1
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
Are you trying to play tricks on me?

2
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,880
N-no, I'm not.

3
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,680
Take your hands out.

4
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,360
Captain Ran, the target has disappeared.

5
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,400
All teams, attention.

6
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
Stop following.

7
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
The target vehicle

8
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,800
is heading south towards Keji Road.

9
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,040
Pursue and intercept the target vehicle.

10
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,640
Guo Aihua was thrown out of the car.

11
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,000
Team B, keep chasing.

12
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,040
Team C, move in to intercept.

13
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,960
Team A, go rescue.

14
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
Keep up.

15
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
Yifei, force him south.

16
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Don't let him return to the city.

17
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,640
Roger.

18
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,440
Bao

19
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,200
We're being followed.

20
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,880
Followed.

21
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,640
By who?

22
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,480
Not sure.

23
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,280
Head back to the city.

24
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,040
We can't.

25
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,240
They're sticking too close.

26
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,600
Where are you now?

27
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,200
On Keji Road, heading east to west.

28
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,040
Passed the roundabout, High-tech Zone.

29
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,400
Third exit at the roundabout.

30
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,600
Onto Tiannan Road.

31
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,600
At the intersection.

32
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,800
Turn around and go against traffic.

33
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,560
If those cars still dare to follow,

34
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
just ignore them.

35
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,480
Okay.

36
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,960
Hurry, get on the roundabout.

37
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,640
Boss.

38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,960
I'll send someone to meet them.

39
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,480
Make it quick.

40
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,920
Don't worry.

41
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Dabao.

42
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,400
After this is done,

43
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,840
go out and relax.

44
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,840
If anything happens,

45
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,720
your mother and brother

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,080
I'll take care of them.

47
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,400
Understood.

48
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,520
We're on Keji Road.

49
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,080
We've found Director Guo Aihua.

50
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Hurry up.

51
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
They're catching up.

52
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Don't let them catch up.

53
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
Hurry, overtake them.

54
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,400
Brake.

55
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,440
Turn around, quick.

56
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Reverse.

57
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,240
Don't drive against traffic.

58
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Chase them.

59
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,440
Quickly.

60
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,560
Brother.

61
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,200
It's done, we succeeded.

62
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
Target is Tiannan Road.

63
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,200
Driving against traffic towards downtown.

64
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,000
You go save them.

65
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,400
Okay.

66
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,280
Prepare to set up a roadblock.

67
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,800
You go save them.

68
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Middle section of Tiannan Road.

69
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,840
Call an ambulance.

70
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Police, get out of the car.

71
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Hang in there.

72
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,120
He was driving against traffic, what does it have to do with me?

73
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,560
How is it?

74
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,160
Where is the ambulance?

75
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Cops

76
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,680
Boss

77
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,200
Charge in

78
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,160
Okay

79
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,200
Don't move

80
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,600
Don't move

81
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,160
Thanks for your hard work

82
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,600
Alright

83
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,280
I'm heading out first

84
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,160
How are Yifei and Xiao Wang?

85
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,960
Captain Ran

86
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,200
What about Guo Aihua?

87
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,640
They're fine, already sent to the hospital

88
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Captain Ran

89
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
The traffic team has already blocked the tunnel entrance

90
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,160
That van

91
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,600
But the two of them refuse to talk

92
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,240
We don't have time to waste on them

93
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,200
Tang Jun, you and Cheng Feng keep an eye on this

94
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,480
I'll go find Sun Ruhai

95
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,560
Dakuan

96
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,680
Haonan

97
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,560
Be careful

98
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,000
He was driving the wrong way

99
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
It's not my fault

100
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,840
What are you doing?

101
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,360
From Nanyang Public Security Bureau

102
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
Looking for Sun Ruhai

103
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,160
What's going on?

104
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,200
They said they're from the police

105
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
Here to see our President Sun

106
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,920
Hello, officer

107
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,840
I'm President Sun's secretary, Chen Xiaonan

108
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,680
President Sun is in the office

109
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,800
I'll take you up

110
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,200
Please wait a moment

111
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,880
President Sun

112
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,880
President Sun

113
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,000
Mr. Sun has been here the whole time.

114
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Maybe he went out when the power went out just now.

115
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,960
You all

116
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
look around.

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,440
Do you remember

118
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,400
what Director Guo said

119
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,720
about hearing the sound of metal clanging?

120
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,280
The east side of the new district has some tech-related

121
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,480
office buildings for the information technology industry.

122
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,040
It's not really suitable for hiding hostages.

123
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,760
That doesn't match what Director Guo said.

124
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,680
The west side has some abandoned factories,

125
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,440
warehouses,

126
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,360
and a junkyard.

127
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,640
Factories and warehouses

128
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,960
wouldn't have the sound of metal clanging.

129
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,200
So it must be

130
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,000
the junkyard.

131
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,600
Let go of me, jerk!

132
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,200
Where are you taking us this time?

133
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,280
Hu Yi! Hu Yi!

134
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,360
You jerks, let her go!

135
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,640
She's pregnant!

136
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,840
How can you treat a pregnant woman like this?

137
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,040
Aren't you afraid you'll never have children?

138
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,400
Let her go! Let—

139
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,360
You've got a sharp tongue, girl.

140
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,360
Come here.

141
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,800
Let's see if I end up childless.

142
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,160
Let go of me!

143
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,520
Let go of me, jerk!

144
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's see if I end up childless now.

145
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,840
Come on, keep going!

146
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,760
Let go of me!

147
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,440
Stop messing around.

148
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,960
The boss is waiting for us.

149
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,120
Don't mess up our payday.

150
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
I'm not even interested.

151
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,640
Hu Yi!

152
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
Hu Yi!

153
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,600
Let her go! Let her go!

154
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,200
Let her go, Hu Yi!

155
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,800
Hu Yi! Hu Yi!

156
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,760
I'll distract them.

157
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,080
You go save her.

158
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,600
Who are you?

159
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,520
Police.

160
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,400
Go in.

161
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,360
Hurry!

162
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,520
Chase!

163
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,040
Stop!

164
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,000
Are you hurt?

165
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,040
No. Are you hurt?

166
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,000
Salute.

167
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,800
At ease.

168
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,240
Yifei.

169
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Calm down.

170
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,440
You all know what to do, right?

171
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,560
Bring them back to me.

172
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,160
Murder.

173
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Killing a police officer.

174
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,280
People like this

175
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,320
can't be allowed to roam society for even a day.

176
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,600
Is that clear?

177
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,360
Sun Ruhai

178
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,640
I'll kill you.

179
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,560
What's the point of saying this now?

180
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,720
Tang Jun, tell me.

181
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,920
The person—

182
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,400
When are you going to catch him for me?

183
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,320
Hu Yi has been safely rescued.

184
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,680
Sun Ruhai is currently missing.

185
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,880
For now, we can't confirm if he fled to avoid punishment

186
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,160
or if he was kidnapped by someone else.

187
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,160
But according to Ren Xiaoqiu,

188
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,320
Wu Xinxin

189
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
the owner of the Athena Hotel,

190
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,040
on the day she learned about Qin Yang's murder,

191
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,200
went to see Sun Ruhai.

192
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,760
During their conversation, they also mentioned

193
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,520
her late husband, Shi Song.

194
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,480
It seems

195
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,560
there is some secret between these two people.

196
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,800
Have you contacted Wu Xinxin?

197
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,440
To be safe,

198
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,320
not yet.

199
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,520
Sanyuan, send it over.

200
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,960
But we checked the properties under Sun Ruhai's name.

201
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,200
The old house by the sea he mentioned

202
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,080
should refer to

203
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,160
an old villa at 58 Binhai West Road.

204
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,160
Wu Xinxin is currently hiding there.

205
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,480
We've already sent people to keep watch.

206
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,760
The detailed information

207
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,960
has been sent to everyone.

208
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,880
Isn't this my dad's notebook?

209
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,920
Look at the address.

210
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,840
Does it look familiar?

211
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,040
This is where Wu Xinxin was hiding.

212
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,520
Master

213
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,120
always had the habit of taking notes.

214
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,200
And every page has a date.

215
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,640
The date on this page

216
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,080
is exactly when the incident happened to him.

217
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,880
Your dad

218
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,560
was investigating Sun Ruhai.

219
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,560
Have you checked this phone number?

220
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,600
Yes, I checked.

221
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,000
Not long after Master passed away,

222
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,120
it was cancelled.

223
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,320
The original owner

224
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,440
was Sun Ruhai's late wife, Shen Lan.

225
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,800
I suspect

226
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,840
this Sun Ruhai

227
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,800
is connected to the case Master was secretly investigating.

228
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,840
We investigated Sun Ruhai before.

229
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,400
He and his Ruhai Real Estate company

230
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,360
made their fortune back then by taking over several

231
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,760
unfinished buildings in Luzhou.

232
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,520
After accumulating some wealth,

233
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
he started giving back to society.

234
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,480
On the surface,

235
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,960
he looks like a legitimate businessman.

236
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,760
It definitely can't be that simple.

237
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,080
Master wouldn't investigate someone for no reason.

238
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,360
That guy must be hiding something.

239
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,680
Even if I have to dig three feet deep,

240
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
I'll get to the bottom of it.

241
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,560
Don't rush.

242
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
The more anxious you are, the more mistakes you'll make.

243
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,080
You always need to proceed steadily and carefully.

244
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,320
Come on, come on.

245
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,360
Let's eat.

246
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,960
I'm not hungry.

247
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,680
Don't rush.

248
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,920
If you get anxious,

249
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
your steps become more chaotic.

250
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,680
You always need to be steady and methodical.

251
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,360
Eat steadily and methodically.

252
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,000
Sleep steadily and methodically.

253
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,640
Solve cases steadily and methodically.

254
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,280
Arrest people steadily and methodically.

255
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,080
Only when you keep your feet firmly on the ground

256
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,200
and don't drift,

257
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,600
can you handle things beautifully.

258
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,480
That's how you live up to this uniform.

259
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,120
Eat.

260
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
You brat.

261
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,200
Eat.

262
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Master, aren't you eating?

263
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,880
I'm not eating.

264
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,360
You eat.

265
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,800
It's the police.

266
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,600
Why are the police here?

267
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,440
Over here.

268
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,400
Can you only enter this door with a smart card?

269
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,800
The door to Mr. Sun's office area

270
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,600
can only be opened with the executive office card.

271
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,080
Can you check the card swipe records?

272
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:01,640
Yes.

273
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,560
There are records in the system.

274
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,800
Then please help us check.

275
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,800
Okay.

276
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,760
Cheng Tou

277
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,280
Cheng Tou

278
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,240
What's wrong?

279
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,000
Cheng Tou, the building had a power outage last night.

280
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,200
The electrician checked it.

281
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,800
It was deliberately sabotaged.

282
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
The building's surveillance system

283
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,240
wasn't on the backup circuit either.

284
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,720
So there was no footage of Sun Ruhai

285
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,840
leaving the office.

286
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,840
Then which surveillance systems

287
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
are on the backup circuit?

288
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,480
The underground parking lot, because it's an underground facility,

289
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,000
has a backup circuit.

290
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,080
Is someone watching us from behind that mirror?

291
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,000
Go ahead.

292
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,080
Say what?

293
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,680
Say what you did.

294
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,080
I didn't do anything.

295
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,040
I was just watching the door, that's all.

296
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,200
Watching the door.

297
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,200
Guarding kidnapped hostages

298
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,400
Assaulting a police officer

299
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
Attempted murder

300
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,600
Any one of these is enough to keep you locked up for a while

301
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,600
Officer, you can't say that

302
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,080
I

303
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,160
Don't worry

304
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Someone like you

305
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,800
You'll have a hard time inside

306
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,800
You

307
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,200
You—

308
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,200
Are you threatening me?

309
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,400
I don't want to talk to him

310
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,840
You want to get me killed

311
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,160
Tell me who arranged it

312
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,360
On the night of September 19th

313
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,640
You went to Sun Ruhai's house

314
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,040
Yes, my home has been under renovation lately

315
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,040
So I borrowed this place from Mr. Sun to stay

316
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,640
Are you close with Sun Ruhai?

317
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
We're fairly familiar, I guess

318
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,560
Mr. Sun used to be my husband's colleague

319
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,440
What did you talk about that day?

320
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,360
I heard

321
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,800
You think someone wants to kill you

322
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
Why are you here?

323
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,440
Someone wants to kill me

324
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,160
Who blabbed?

325
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,160
Don't make things up if you didn't hear clearly

326
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,920
I borrowed a place from Mr. Sun to stay

327
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,560
I said my home was being renovated

328
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,800
The smell in this room is so strong

329
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,200
It's like someone's trying to kill me

330
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,720
Ms. Wu

331
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,960
Why did you move here?

332
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,800
I think you yourself

333
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
know best

334
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,840
Sun Ruhai has disappeared

335
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
Since we were able to find this place,

336
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,760
I think those who are looking for you

337
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,120
can find it too.

338
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,720
If you feel your life

339
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,760
is being threatened,

340
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,000
only we can help you.

341
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,960
Cheng Tou, look at this person.

342
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,920
Officer Cheng,

343
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,160
we found out.

344
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,040
The one who swiped open Mr. Sun's office door yesterday

345
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,920
was using Da Bao's card.

346
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,160
Look,

347
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,160
isn't this Da Bao?

348
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,960
We were all arranged by Da Bao.

349
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Who is Da Bao?

350
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,440
Da Bao is Mr. Sun's personal assistant.

351
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,800
They are very close.

352
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,960
What's his name?

353
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,600
I don't know, never heard of it.

354
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,600
And in our company's employee records,

355
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,560
he's not listed either.

356
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,800
All I know is he's pretty ruthless.

357
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,920
They say he has killed someone.

358
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,560
I just remembered,

359
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,800
yesterday when I passed by the stairwell,

360
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,560
I heard Da Bao making a phone call inside.

361
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,840
You drive the truck to Tiannan Road to pick up Da Bala.

362
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,360
If that car follows you,

363
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,200
just ram it.

364
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,600
We can't let them get away this time.

365
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,120
If we're doing this, we do it cleanly.

366
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,720
How long has he been with the company?

367
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,400
I'm really not sure about that.

368
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,840
After all, when I joined the company,

369
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,800
he was already here.

370
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,560
He and the boss are both from Meiyu.

371
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,720
They must be from the same hometown.

372
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
What's Dabo's phone number?

373
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,680
Call him.

374
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,840
Call from here.

375
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,200
Sorry.

376
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,440
The number you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

377
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,440
Cannot connect.

378
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,360
Please try again later.

379
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,000
What about Wu Xinxin?

380
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
What's the situation?

381
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,400
Judging from her reaction,

382
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,760
Sun Ruhai's disappearance probably has nothing to do with her.

383
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,760
But regarding Sun Ruhai,

384
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,160
she's definitely hiding something.

385
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,760
Sun Ruhai also has a personal assistant.

386
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,600
His name is Dabo.

387
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,560
I checked the surveillance footage.

388
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,200
He was the one who took Sun Ruhai away.

389
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,960
He also drove away Sun Ruhai's car.

390
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,120
Go investigate this Dabo.

391
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:02,960
Cheng Feng.

392
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,760
You lead the team.

393
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Go check on Sun Ruhai's car.

394
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,800
We'll use Ruhai Real Estate as the center point.

395
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,040
Expand the search radius by five kilometers each time.

396
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,760
See if you can find Sun Ruhai's car.

397
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,520
It's five in the morning.

398
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,480
Sun Ruhai's car appeared on Guowu Road in the west district.

399
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,000
At 5:09, it was on Donghua Road.

400
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
At 5:21, it was on Jianshe Road.

401
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,760
At 5:22, it was on Gongye Road.

402
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,440
Bro,

403
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,520
the fingerprint comparison results are out.

404
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,400
The big guy's name is Liao Shaobin, 41 years old.

405
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,320
Cambodian nationality.

406
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,560
He entered the country five years ago.

407
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,760
He's been here on a work visa ever since.

408
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,520
His registered workplace is

409
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
Kunpeng International Trading Company.

410
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,560
Southeast Asian Chinese.

411
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,800
Nonsense.

412
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,720
Then I'll check out this company.

413
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,520
No need.

414
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
It's definitely just a shell company with no real business.

415
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,360
This guy is definitely hiding something.

416
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,760
Went abroad to get a new identity.

417
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,360
Look into these.

418
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,520
See if there are any leads.

419
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,200
The target car at 5:28

420
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,400
passed the intersection at Songhua Road.

421
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,640
It entered a surveillance blind spot.

422
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
Songhua Road leads in two directions.

423
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,560
One to the old city district.

424
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,320
One to the Beipu district.

425
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,760
Yan Zi and Da Kuan, check the old city district.

426
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,360
Got it.

427
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,880
Sanyuan and Xiaopang, check Beipu district.

428
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,400
Got it.

429
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,440
Sun Ruhai's hometown.

430
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
There's news from Meiyu's side. Let's go.

431
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,920
The target car went through the tunnel into the old city district.

432
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,920
Combine teams to search the old city district.

433
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Understood.

434
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,360
You owe me a drink, kid.

435
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,440
Alright.

436
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,560
I'll treat you when I don't have a case.

437
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,640
Can't drink when there's a case.

438
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,720
So, how is it?

439
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,760
It's up there.

440
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,160
This guy,

441
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,120
His name is Wang Xinlong.

442
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,840
He's Wang Xinbao's younger brother.

443
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,640
They're from the same village as Sun Ruhai.

444
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,000
His older brother,

445
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,960
Wang Xinbao,

446
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,400
might be the "Dabao" you're looking for.

447
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,360
But it's pretty strange.

448
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,640
How so?

449
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,760
Wang Xinbao is dead.

450
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,120
Dead.

451
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,160
It's been six years.

452
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,120
Car accident.

453
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,200
At the time,

454
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,520
his head was crushed.

455
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,760
What does his brother do?

456
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Wang Xinlong?

457
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,400
Smuggling. He did a few years inside.

458
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,760
He's basically unemployed.

459
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,960
In Meiyu,

460
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
he owns a few properties.

461
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,720
He just collects rent every day.

462
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,120
Who is it?

463
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,560
Gas company maintenance.

464
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,200
What the hell are you doing?

465
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,000
Police.

466
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What's up with the police?

467
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,960
Even the police can't just barge into someone's home.

468
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,320
Sit down. Sit there and behave.

469
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,360
These two are from the Luzhou City Public Security Bureau's criminal investigation team.

470
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,760
They're here to ask about Sun Ruhai and your brother.

471
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,600
Who?

472
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,320
Sun Ruhai and Wang Xinbao.

473
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,640
Don't pretend.

474
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,560
You're pretty familiar with them, aren't you?

475
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
I never said I wasn't.

476
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
One is my uncle from my mother's side.

477
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
The other is my brother.

478
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,560
But we haven't been in touch.

479
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,760
Old Sun made it big.

480
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,040
But we're not on the same level.

481
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,960
I can't reach him either.

482
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,200
My brother's been dead for years.

483
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,160
Contacting him would cost me my life.

484
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Don't you think that's a bit much?

485
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,920
Do you have a photo of your brother?

486
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,600
No.

487
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,000
Look at this dump I live in.

488
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,560
It's hard enough for a living person to lie down here.

489
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,960
Let alone a dead one.

490
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,320
Do you know him?

491
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,120
No, I don't.

492
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,000
Who is that?

493
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,080
The surveillance in the old city is too outdated.

494
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,560
It's all pixelated.

495
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,000
Passed Xisi Road, didn't find anything.

496
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,040
Nothing at Xisan on my end.

497
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,760
Here, here, on my side, on my side.

498
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Same color clothes.

499
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,800
Same color pants.

500
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,600
Is it him? Is it him?

501
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,960
That's it.

502
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,400
I'm heading to the old town market.

503
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,520
Going to check the market surveillance.

504
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,160
You guys keep looking for Sun Ruhai's car.

505
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,840
Got it.

506
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,240
Okay.

507
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,720
Just got back, he's upstairs.

508
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,800
Let's just go up directly. Come on.

509
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,160
Bro.

510
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,440
Why is it you guys again?

511
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,680
What do you want?

512
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,480
Just the two of you?

513
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,880
What do you think?

514
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,960
Cut the crap.

515
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,240
So sneaky.

516
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,320
Me?

517
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,520
I'm here to meet a woman.

518
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,280
You think I'd announce it to the whole street?

519
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,000
Lao Lu.

520
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,320
We might have made a mistake.

521
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,400
Let's go.

522
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,080
Sorry, man.

523
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,840
Stop following me.
