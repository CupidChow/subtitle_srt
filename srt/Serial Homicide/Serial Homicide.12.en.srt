1
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,320
Criminal Investigation Unit

2
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,880
This is why you killed An Wenju, isn't it?

3
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,040
Who is your exchange target?

4
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,360
This child

5
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,760
is called Liangliang, right?

6
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,840
We've investigated it.

7
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,000
That medical accident at the time

8
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,520
The anesthesiologist was named Lu Junfei.

9
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,600
He's your exchange target, isn't he?

10
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,400
Darn it, he deserves it.

11
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,160
Even if he died ten thousand times

12
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,160
he still couldn't bring Liangliang back.

13
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,680
I couldn't find him.

14
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,240
If I could find him

15
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,600
I would kill him with my own hands.

16
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,520
So you joined the revenge plan.

17
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,040
He said

18
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,720
they could

19
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,800
find that man named Lu

20
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,320
and take revenge for me.

21
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,360
They

22
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,440
arranged for me to deliver pork to the Renxin Hospital cafeteria

23
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,600
deliver pork

24
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,040
The target is

25
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,880
to kill the psychiatry

26
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,760
department head

27
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,520
An Wenju

28
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,040
Is it worth doing this?

29
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,160
This

30
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,720
There is a fire burning

31
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,360
All these years

32
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,160
It can't be extinguished

33
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Thank you for your hard work

34
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,160
Lu Junfei, there is such a person

35
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,200
Back then

36
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,760
He had just had his anesthesia license revoked

37
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,120
And was dismissed by the hospital

38
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,520
He was in a desperate situation

39
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,080
So here at our place

40
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,080
For this

41
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,680
Professional qualification requirement

42
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,520
Isn't that strict

43
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,160
I felt sorry for him

44
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,920
So I let him stay here

45
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,440
When performing surgery on pets

46
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,600
He would do the anesthesia

47
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,200
But he left after only a few months

48
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,840
Why did he quit?

49
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,280
Who knows?

50
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,840
I remember him

51
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
It's because

52
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,000
He didn't say anything

53
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
He suddenly stopped coming

54
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,480
He didn't even collect his salary

55
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,480
We couldn't reach him

56
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,960
At that time

57
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,600
We even filed a report with the police

58
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,760
This

59
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,480
There is a fire burning

60
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
All these years

61
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,880
It can't be extinguished

62
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,480
Tang Jun asked me to apologize to you.

63
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,320
Don't take it to heart with him.

64
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,440
Of course not.

65
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,920
Captain Ran,

66
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,680
thank you for the medicine.

67
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,920
By the way,

68
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,800
Captain Ran,

69
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,040
come over and take a look at this.

70
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,160
This record from April 20th.

71
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,720
Since your husband

72
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,320
the medical appraisal from back then

73
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,960
proved that there was nothing wrong with my treatment of him

74
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
isn't that right?

75
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,400
You have no reason

76
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,840
After all these years

77
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,960
you come to find me

78
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,600
asking me to sign something for you

79
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,320
a medical accident report

80
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,200
Are you crazy or am I?

81
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,160
No matter what

82
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,000
Let me tell you

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,840
I left that hospital many years ago

84
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,240
I don't work there anymore

85
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,640
Go find whoever you want

86
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,640
You're insane

87
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,680
This might be a

88
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,120
phone call with a patient's family member

89
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,600
It might involve

90
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,440
a medical dispute

91
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,800
Besides Renxin Hospital, An Wenju

92
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,400
has he worked at any other hospitals?

93
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,520
When we checked the records before

94
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,480
we didn't find anything

95
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,640
It's not another hospital

96
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,000
It's still Renxin Hospital

97
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,600
just the Mingcang branch

98
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,880
Then go to that branch tomorrow

99
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,160
By the way

100
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,200
Tang Jun

101
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
is already following up on this lead

102
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,840
Tomorrow

103
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,200
go with him

104
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,160
Um

105
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,960
It's fine

106
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,240
Captain Ran told me not to stoop to your level

107
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,720
What does she mean by that?

108
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,520
It was an accident, okay?

109
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,760
You suddenly rushed out, didn't you?

110
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,600
I, I, I...

111
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,560
What could I do?

112
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,000
Why are you looking at me?

113
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,400
Alright, alright, I'll apologize

114
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Sorry

115
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,200
Sorry, sorry

116
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,720
Is that enough?

117
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
What else do you want?

118
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,840
How about this

119
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,080
Come on

120
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,320
You can hit me too

121
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,680
Go ahead, hit me hard, hit me hard

122
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,560
I, I, I...

123
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,120
I won't dodge

124
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,440
Come on, come on

125
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,680
Come on

126
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:17,920
Come

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
Be careful, be careful

128
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,960
Here we go

129
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,240
Come, open the lid

130
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
It's ready, come eat

131
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
What's going on?

132
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,880
You can smell it all the way in the hallway

133
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
You guys came back at just the right time

134
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,240
Come, get chopsticks and bowls, let's eat

135
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,520
We're off work now, aren't we?

136
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,080
You've all worked hard lately

137
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Thank you, Uncle Ping

138
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,200
Let's have a meal together

139
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
No need to thank him, it was all done by his wife

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,800
You're eating my food and not even complimenting me?

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
Hurry up and eat, Cheng Feng

142
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,320
Alright

143
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,680
What's going on at the hospital?

144
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,360
An Wenju is at Mingcang Hospital.

145
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,040
There really is a medical dispute.

146
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,960
The patient's name is

147
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,920
Yang Shuwei.

148
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,640
He was originally diagnosed with severe depression.

149
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,880
He needed that

150
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
MECT

151
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,720
electroconvulsive therapy.

152
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,520
Yes, that's right.

153
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,720
That's the one.

154
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,000
But after the treatment,

155
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,720
this Yang Shuwei

156
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,360
he then

157
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,400
suffered cognitive impairment

158
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,280
and consciousness disorders.

159
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
He was a perfectly normal person.

160
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
He was electrocuted and became mentally impaired.

161
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,680
I heard he used to be quite smart.

162
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,480
He studied

163
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,480
computer science.

164
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,520
Be careful.

165
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,480
Be careful.

166
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,280
Did you hear that?

167
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
So what happened next?

168
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,360
His family wouldn't accept it.

169
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,480
They thought it was

170
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,640
a medical accident.

171
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,400
Later, the medical institution assessed the case.

172
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,600
An Wenju's treatment complied with medical regulations.

173
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,920
Yang Shuwei's accident

174
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
was probably caused by an allergic reaction to a muscle relaxant.

175
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,040
But the family said

176
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,400
that before An Wenju started the treatment

177
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,520
he didn't ask the patient

178
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,360
if he was allergic to anticholinergic drugs.

179
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,800
But the treatment consent form

180
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,640
was personally signed by Yang Shuwei's wife.

181
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,840
As for An Wenju,

182
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,240
he didn't get into any trouble.

183
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,120
He actually benefited from the incident.

184
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,640
To avoid further medical disputes,

185
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,720
he was transferred to our hospital.

186
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,000
Turns out, this old guy has quite a temper.

187
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,640
Whenever someone dares to mention

188
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,600
Mingcang Branch,

189
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,520
he gets upset.

190
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,840
After a while,

191
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,040
no one mentions it anymore.

192
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,720
Mingcang Branch Hospital

193
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,560
So how is Yang Shuwei now?

194
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,880
Mingcang Branch Hospital

195
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,440
After leaving Mingcang Hospital,

196
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,280
he moved into a rehabilitation center in Mingcang.

197
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,720
He died before this year's Qingming Festival.

198
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,960
The phone call monitored at An Wenju's house

199
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,440
was on April 20th.

200
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,240
I suspect

201
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,240
the person who called An Wenju

202
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,600
was Yang Shuwei's wife.

203
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,080
Uncle Ping, let me say something to you.

204
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,000
Where's the meat?

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,520
Is this all you prepared?

206
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,720
Hey, even while you're eating,

207
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,920
you still can't keep your mouth shut.

208
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,640
It's been so many years,

209
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,560
and you're still so stingy.

210
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,440
Hurry up and eat.

211
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,000
After eating, find Yang Shuwei's wife

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,720
and bring her to me.

213
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,560
Jun, Jun-ge

214
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,200
What is it?

215
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,200
I have something to say.

216
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,720
Go ahead.

217
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,360
When we were investigating Wu Xinxin's husband, Shi Song,

218
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,880
there was a psychiatric certificate for Shi Song

219
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,680
issued by this Mingcang Branch Hospital.

220
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,640
Look at the doctor's signature.

221
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,520
An Wenju

222
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,000
Yang Shuwei

223
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,800
It was this April

224
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
when he passed away.

225
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,240
Due to electroshock therapy,

226
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,640
he developed a consciousness disorder

227
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,200
and impaired cognitive function.

228
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,920
Simply put,

229
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,160
he became a vegetative patient.

230
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,960
He couldn't take care of himself anymore.

231
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,600
He needed someone by his side at all times.

232
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,720
So,

233
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,000
his partner Meng Shan

234
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,360
hired a 24-hour caregiver for him.

235
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,400
He stayed

236
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,680
in a private hospital room.

237
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
How long did Yang Shuwei stay here?

238
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,320
About seven years.

239
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,520
Yang Shuwei had a complicated heart condition.

240
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,160
Meng Shan spent a lot of money

241
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,960
to treat his illness.

242
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,400
He underwent several heart surgeries,

243
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,680
but in the end,

244
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,240
he still couldn't pull through.

245
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,400
Do you interact with Meng Shan often?

246
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,120
Yes, quite a lot.

247
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,360
When Yang Shuwei was alive,

248
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,160
Meng Shan had to come to the hospital to see him every day.

249
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,360
It's been seven years.

250
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,000
Yang Shuwei's hospitalization,

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,640
caregivers,

252
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,760
and surgery expenses—

253
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,080
there were quite a lot.

254
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,080
For most people, sticking with it

255
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,480
would be too hard.

256
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,200
Yes.

257
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,720
It really isn't easy.

258
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,800
Do you know

259
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,520
what Meng Shan does for work specifically?

260
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm not exactly sure what she does.

261
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,200
I've heard

262
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,960
she works in sales at a nightclub.

263
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,960
Okay.

264
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,720
Mingcang Branch Hospital just called.

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,800
They couldn't find any records.

266
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,760
Shi Song's medical file

267
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,680
might be fake.

268
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,040
So that means

269
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,800
An Wenju

270
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,040
provided to the police

271
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,880
the medical certificate

272
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,920
could also be fake.

273
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,000
If this medical diagnosis certificate is fake,

274
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,640
then Shi Song's severe depression is questionable.

275
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,720
So his suicide

276
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
could also be fake, couldn't it?

277
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,440
Old Zhang

278
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,040
Old Zhang

279
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,800
Did you take a case eight years ago

280
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,960
about someone named Shi Song's suicide?

281
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,720
I handle so many cases every year.

282
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
It's been eight years, how could I remember clearly?

283
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,120
How about this,

284
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,960
the cases from previous years

285
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,920
are all in those boxes.

286
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,600
Go look for it yourself.

287
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,760
Over there, right?

288
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,240
Old Zhang

289
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,880
Your name is still on it.

290
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,200
You went on duty with my master.

291
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,320
Stop eating.

292
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,560
Think carefully.

293
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,640
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

294
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,160
Qinglong Villa

295
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,320
Ran Da

296
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,760
The deceased's family

297
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,400
Ask about the situation.

298
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,360
When you discovered it,

299
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,600
were you the only one at home?

300
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,080
Captain Ran

301
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,600
The scene is just upstairs.

302
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
It was the victim's partner who called the police.

303
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,280
A suicide note was found at the scene. Please take a look.

304
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,760
Make sure to conduct a handwriting analysis.

305
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,280
Understood.

306
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,960
Hand it over to forensics.

307
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,840
Captain Ran

308
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,480
What's the situation?

309
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,640
Captain Ran

310
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,120
Here's what we know.

311
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,640
The time of death

312
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,600
should be last night,

313
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,040
between 11 and 12 o'clock.

314
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,120
At present,

315
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,880
he seems to have taken an overdose of sleeping pills,

316
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,760
which caused his death.

317
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,200
These two items were found at his bedside.

318
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,160
What are these?

319
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,160
This is insulin.

320
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,240
It's for diabetes.

321
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,000
That's right.

322
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
On the victim's

323
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,800
left arm, there are several needle marks.

324
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,680
Here.

325
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,000
My husband has diabetes.

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,920
He has to inject insulin every night before bed.

327
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,840
When did you find out?

328
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,920
This morning.

329
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,480
A little after eight this morning.

330
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,560
I came to wake him up.

331
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,800
And I found that he had already...

332
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,920
There was a suicide note on the bedside table.

333
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,200
You weren't home last night?

334
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,240
I went to a friend's house last night.

335
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,840
I got home after two.

336
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,440
My husband doesn't sleep well.

337
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,800
I didn't want to disturb his rest.

338
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,240
So I slept in the small bedroom.

339
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,240
Your friend's name?

340
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,680
Yin Hui.

341
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,160
She's my senior from university.

342
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,080
Noted.

343
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,400
Yes.

344
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,800
Has your husband had any...

345
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,760
Any unusual behavior lately?

346
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,200
My husband has had depression for many years.

347
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,160
His mood has been especially bad recently.

348
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,680
He often said strange things.

349
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,960
He kept telling me he couldn't go on.

350
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,000
He wanted to die.

351
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,920
I never thought he really would...

352
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,520
Take her downstairs.

353
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,400
Yes.

354
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
Please.

355
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,360
This way, please.

356
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,640
Please.

357
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,520
Old Liao

358
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,600
Captain Ran

359
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,360
This injection mark is new, right?

360
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,560
It looks like

361
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,320
it was made by a recent injection before the victim died.

362
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,800
Ran Da

363
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,360
What's wrong?

364
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,040
If you were going to commit suicide,

365
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,560
before doing it,

366
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,920
would you still remember

367
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,840
to give yourself an insulin shot?

368
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,200
Insulin.

369
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,800
What happened after that?

370
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,840
Nothing happened after that.

371
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,640
The suicide was ruled as having no suspicious circumstances.

372
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,520
Isn't that what's written here?

373
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,680
What's wrong?

374
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,200
The bed was tidy.

375
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,920
Insulin.

376
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,760
I've gone through it many times.

377
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,600
I never understood what this insulin meant.

378
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,640
Now it seems

379
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,880
my mentor probably suspected at the time

380
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,680
why Shi Song would inject himself with insulin

381
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,240
before committing suicide.

382
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,720
Yang Shuwei's wife has been found.

383
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,720
Bro, what would you like to drink?

384
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,680
Just leave it here.

385
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,880
Call your manager over,

386
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,160
the one named Meng Shan.

387
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,040
I want to get a membership card.

388
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,720
Sure thing, bro.

389
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,840
So,

390
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
is this your first time here?

391
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,400
I've been to bars in the metaverse,

392
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,560
though.

393
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,920
What verse?

394
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,280
The metaverse.

395
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,560
Have you been there?

396
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,120
The metaverse?

397
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,360
They even have bars in there.

398
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,880
Hey, you two handsome guys,

399
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,680
is this your first time at our place?

400
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,360
What’s up, Su Shan?

401
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,040
I haven’t been gone that long, and you already don’t recognize me?

402
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,600
So my old membership card was for nothing, huh?

403
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,680
Bro,

404
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,720
my bad, I didn’t recognize you.

405
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,080
Let me apologize.

406
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,360
It’s on me.

407
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,120
I’ll cover these.

408
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,600
Bro,

409
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,200
come on,

410
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,240
let’s have a drink.

411
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,840
What would you like to drink today?

412
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,600
Anything is fine.

413
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
Let me tell you,

414
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,520
my buddy here,

415
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,680
his wife cheated on him.

416
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,800
They even got into a fight.

417
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,920
Look, he’s all bruised.

418
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,640
See?

419
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,960
He doesn’t want to do anything today.

420
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Just wants to have a drink.

421
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,520
It’s not a big deal.

422
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,480
You’re such a handsome guy.

423
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,680
There are plenty of girls out there.

424
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,600
How about you have a drink?

425
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,120
Sorry.

426
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,760
I don’t know how to drink.

427
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,440
Sorry.

428
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,360
Come on, don’t be like this.

429
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,840
Come on, have a drink.

430
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,800
Everyone’s here.

431
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,600
Since we’re all here,

432
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,360
Come on.

433
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,200
Come on.

434
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,440
Have one.

435
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,920
Um,

436
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,400
I’m going to the restroom.

437
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,640
Take care of him.

438
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,680
Just open a card, whatever.

439
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,640
A hundred thousand, eighty thousand,

440
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,560
is no problem.

441
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,840
Don’t worry, bro.

442
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,840
Go ahead.

443
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,720
Leave it to me.

444
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,000
Let’s get hyped!

445
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,800
Come on, I’ll drink with you.

446
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,440
Let's have a drink.

447
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,080
Sorry about that.

448
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,040
Don't be like that.

449
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,880
Come on.

450
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,840
Bro.

451
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,280
What's up, man?

452
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,640
Let me ask you something.

453
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,600
Go ahead.

454
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,240
You guys...

455
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,360
Manager Susan

456
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,200
Does she have a boyfriend?

457
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,760
She's had plenty, man.

458
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,120
She changes boyfriends all the time.

459
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,840
Why do you ask?

460
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,000
Are you interested too?

461
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,760
Do I have a chance?

462
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,640
Sure.

463
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,200
Just get more membership cards.

464
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,920
Go for it.

465
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,840
What, that's it?

466
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,640
She only cares about money?

467
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,120
If you want something serious, man...

468
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,240
Then...

469
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,120
Probably not gonna happen.

470
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,000
Waiter.

471
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,120
I'm here.

472
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,160
Hey man.

473
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Your wife has been waiting for you a long time.

474
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,720
Didn't I tell you already?

475
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,480
I can't drink much either.

476
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,560
You don't need to pick me up.

477
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,960
But I called you.

478
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,080
And you didn't answer.

479
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,520
You called me?

480
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,160
He really called me.

481
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,440
I didn't hear it.

482
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,360
My friend is having a birthday.

483
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,120
He invited the two of us over.

484
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,920
Are you going?

485
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,640
Your friend is having a birthday?

486
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,760
Let's go celebrate.

487
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,280
Come on, let's go.

488
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,560
Let's go.

489
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,000
Let's go.

490
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,320
Susan.

491
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,040
My sister-in-law's friend is having a birthday, we need to go.

492
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,880
Not drinking today.

493
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,640
Alright, fine.

494
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
We added each other on WeChat.

495
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,800
Next time we'll come to you to book a table.

496
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Sure, no problem.

497
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,120
Goodbye.

498
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Okay, bye.

499
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,520
The people at the nursing home said

500
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,160
Meng Shan and Yang Shuwei's marriage

501
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
has always been very good.

502
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,040
She has taken care of him attentively for so many years.

503
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,560
Until Yang Shuwei passed away.

504
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,480
So,

505
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,080
she might want to ask An Wen to report a grudge.

506
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,520
That's possible too.

507
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,520
I asked around.

508
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,240
That Meng Shan

509
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,520
is actually quite popular.

510
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,200
And they're all wealthy people.

511
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,240
Cheng Feng.

512
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,480
Get someone to look into it.

513
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,440
Get in the car.

514
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,840
Give me the car keys.

515
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,640
I didn't drink.

516
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,760
Yan Zi and the others

517
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,080
saw Wei Qin on the surveillance footage.

518
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,040
Here, help me hold this.

519
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,440
This is September 19th.

520
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
Wei Qin was last seen

521
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,840
on the surveillance footage at Datong Road subway exit C.

522
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,960
This person

523
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,040
was identified through technical analysis.

524
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,920
He is Wei Qin.

525
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,600
Then he appeared

526
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,560
on several streets near Binhai West Road.

527
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,520
In other words,

528
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,280
on that day, Wei Qin

529
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,360
after entering Datong Road subway station,

530
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,840
the reason we

531
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,800
couldn't find him on other surveillance cameras

532
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,800
is because

533
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,160
three minutes later,

534
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,640
he changed into a brown jacket

535
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,720
and exited the subway station again.

536
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,840
Moreover,

537
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,160
after that,

538
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,560
he stayed around the Binhai Road area.

539
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,120
The city bureau information center

540
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,480
informed us that

541
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,360
last night,

542
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,400
near Binhai West Road,

543
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,040
the surveillance footage from several streets

544
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,320
during the same time period

545
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,400
was hacked into

546
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,760
and the camera positions were altered.

547
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,200
Wei Qin is still watching Wu Xinxin.

548
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,160
Our people

549
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,240
are watching as well, right?

550
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,920
Da Kuan and Hao Nan are on it.

551
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,280
Sun Bin

552
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,320
Sun Ruhai

553
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,200
And also An Wenju

554
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,080
And this Wu Xinxin

555
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,960
All have

556
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,640
a direct or indirect connection to Shi Song

557
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,600
The others are all dead

558
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,480
Only she is still alive

559
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,240
Let's start with her as a breakthrough

560
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,520
Let's pay her a visit

561
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,000
Police

562
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Are you done yet?

563
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,520
Why do you keep coming here every other day?

564
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,800
We don't want to either

565
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,760
Ms. Wu

566
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Please take a look

567
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,320
Do you know this person?

568
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,200
No

569
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,240
Give it to me

570
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,400
Take another good look

571
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,880
What's there to look at?

572
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
I don't know him

573
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,520
You don't know him, right?

574
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Then let me tell you

575
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,520
His name is An Wenju

576
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,560
When Shi Song committed suicide back then

577
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,880
You provided the police

578
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,680
with that

579
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,960
psychiatric medical certificate

580
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,120
It was issued by him

581
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,400
Back then, my husband always went to the doctor by himself

582
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,720
I don't know

583
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,840
Then let me tell you something else

584
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,360
He was murdered

585
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,480
Officer

586
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,240
What does this have to do with me?

587
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,480
Someone was killed

588
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,040
You should be out catching the killer.

589
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,520
Why are you wasting time here with me?

590
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,840
We wish coming here was just a waste of time too.

591
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
But it isn't.

592
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,840
Let me ask you,

593
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,600
Why aren't you staying in your nice villa,

594
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,160
and instead came back to live in this old house?

595
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,800
You even hired so much security.

596
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:31,960
Come here.

597
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,200
Do you see that?

598
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,120
Was that thing always there?

599
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,680
It has nothing to do with you.

600
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,080
Why are they watching you?

601
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,560
We found out

602
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,720
that someone deliberately changed

603
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,760
the positions of several surveillance cameras

604
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,880
on nearby streets last night.

605
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,480
I think they were targeting you.

606
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,320
Sun Ruhai and his son are dead.

607
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,360
Yin Hui is dead.

608
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,440
An Wenju is also dead.

609
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,200
You're one of their targets too.

610
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,560
You can hide for a while,

611
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,960
but can you hide forever?

612
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,320
Ms. Wu,

613
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,480
your best option now

614
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,400
is to cooperate with the police.

615
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,440
Keep a close watch.

616
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,000
Tomorrow morning,

617
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
have Xiao Zhang take over your shift.

618
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,000
And also,

619
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,160
keep an eye on the surroundings.

620
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,120
Weiqin,

621
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,400
he's very likely to be lurking nearby.

622
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,640
Don't worry, Jun.

623
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,360
Alright.

624
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,080
Thanks for your hard work.

625
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,880
Really, thank you.

626
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,080
Book me a ticket to Singapore for tomorrow.

627
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,920
The target is using the mall's public network.

628
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,720
Check the surveillance cameras.

629
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,400
Roger.

630
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,960
Roger.

631
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,040
Stay in contact at all times.

632
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,320
The signal is at the west plaza of the mall.

633
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,120
No opportunity found yet.

634
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,000
I know.

635
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,520
Tang Jun and I are watching the two entrances of the plaza.

636
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,560
Yifei and Haonan

637
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,920
Go inside the plaza to search.

638
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,880
Pay attention to people using electronic devices in the plaza.

639
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,880
Roger.

640
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,280
Can you get a more precise location?

641
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,200
I'm accessing his system now.

642
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,240
He might notice.

643
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,280
We need to apprehend him quickly.

644
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
We need to apprehend him quickly.

645
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,200
The target is near the café in the west plaza.

646
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,760
The café's sign is behind him.

647
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,640
Head.

648
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,560
The signal is gone.

649
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,400
We've been discovered.

650
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,040
He has already logged out of the system.

651
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,000
Signal lost.

652
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,720
Target not found.

653
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,000
No sign of the target at the entrances.

654
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,920
Not in the parking lot either.

655
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,120
He's still in the plaza.

656
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,480
He left.

657
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,320
Someone has fainted here.

658
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,760
Make way.

659
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,320
Call 120 quickly.
