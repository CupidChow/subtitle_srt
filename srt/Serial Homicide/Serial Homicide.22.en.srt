1
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,480
Tang Jun realized

2
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,800
the 909 case is related to

3
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,360
an old case from eight years ago.

4
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,280
Eight years ago,

5
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,000
you, Sun Ruhai, and Gao Ang

6
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,680
were involved in some shady dealings.

7
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,680
He is desperate to unravel

8
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,280
the mystery that has been hidden for eight years.

9
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
Now that things have come to this,

10
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,960
I have no choice but to act again.

11
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,080
Eliminate Tang Jun.

12
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,760
But I can't find a way to do it.

13
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,280
The lost gun from eight years ago, belonging to Gao Ang, has been fired.

14
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
To me,

15
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,160
this is both a threat

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,320
and an opportunity.

17
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,400
Help me find

18
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
a police pistol with the serial number 190568.

19
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,480
It's at Jin Fei's house.

20
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,840
I must act before Tang Jun finds the lost gun.

21
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
Use Jin Fei's daughter

22
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,160
to threaten Jin Fei.

23
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,960
Force him to commit suicide, and at the same time

24
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,680
shift the suspicion of murder

25
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,840
onto Tang Jun.

26
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,960
Tang Jun

27
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,320
is therefore wanted by the police.

28
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,400
Without the protection of the public security system,

29
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,800
Tang Jun became a wandering soul with nowhere to go.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,480
I knew the time had come.

31
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,400
He was at the abandoned shipyard.

32
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,240
I found the assassin.

33
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,600
Using my position,

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,960
I told the assassin all of Tang Jun's whereabouts.

35
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,240
Unexpectedly,

36
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,080
Tang Jun

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,160
This disciple of Ran Haochuan was so formidable.

38
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,000
Not only did he escape the assassination,

39
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,760
he also left the assassin alive

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,720
for the police.

41
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,920
There is no other choice.

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,120
This assassin must die.

43
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,080
Including that

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,960
middleman who has already been exposed.

45
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,760
What exactly are you trying to do?

46
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,080
I almost caught the person.

47
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,200
Why did you alert them?

48
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,000
Have you ever thought

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,400
that this person is right among us?

50
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,440
It's someone from within.

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240
When I heard what Tang Jun said,

52
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,440
I realized

53
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,320
I was just one step away

54
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,800
from being exposed.

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,280
The dominoes had already started to fall.

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,240
I was already deeply involved.

57
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
There was no way out.

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,520
Tang Jun was arrested.

59
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,480
I thought it was a chance given to me by fate.

60
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,120
But on the way to the transfer,

61
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,640
the moment Tang Jun was taken away by Zhao Yunping,

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,840
I finally understood

63
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,800
that all of this

64
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,160
was a setup secretly orchestrated by Zhao Yunping and Tang Jun.

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,120
I also knew

66
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
that it was all too late.

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,480
Nanyang Branch

68
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,480
Criminal Investigation Team

69
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,240
Tang Jun

70
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,320
applies for reinstatement.

71
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,960
Everything

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,680
has come to an end.

73
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,600
All these years,

74
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,760
I have woken up from nightmares countless times.

75
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,960
I have also regretted it countless times.

76
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,920
That very first wrong step I took.

77
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,920
But it proves the saying we often repeat:

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Do not do evil.

79
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,640
If you do evil,

80
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,640
you will surely be caught.

81
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Farewell forever

82
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,160
to this world that once fascinated me

83
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,200
and also made me lose myself.

84
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,520
Chen Tingyue

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,160
I'll put the fruit in your bag.

86
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,720
Dad, dad.

87
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,120
Stop packing more.

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,360
One fruit after every meal.

89
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,240
You have to eat it.

90
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,720
You're practically bringing the whole house for me.

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,560
Alright.

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,160
Let me see.

93
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,560
Recite it again.

94
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,080
Dad.

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,960
Recite it.

96
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
I am a People's Police officer of China.

97
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,240
I swear.

98
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,160
To firmly uphold the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China.

99
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,360
To dedicate myself to the noble cause of public security for the people.

100
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,480
Be loyal to the Party.

101
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,560
Serve the people.

102
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,600
Enforce the law impartially.

103
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,800
Maintain strict discipline.

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,480
To safeguard political security.

105
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,760
Maintain social stability.

106
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,240
Ensure the peace of the people.

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,280
Fight bravely.

108
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,480
Good.

109
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,160
Take it.

110
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,720
Daughter.

111
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,120
Now that you're wearing this uniform,

112
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,680
you must always remember your identity.

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,440
and the responsibility on your shoulders.

114
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,960
Salute.

115
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,160
Make way, make way.

116
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
What's the situation on the rooftop?

117
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,280
No signs of fighting or dragging were found at the scene.

118
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
On the surface,

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
it looks like suicide.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,800
What's wrong?

121
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,720
How many people

122
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,440
who jump to their death

123
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,120
land face up?

124
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Let me take a look at that.

125
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,880
Give it here.

126
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,600
This suicide note...

127
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,680
Something's not right.

128
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Usually, people who commit suicide

129
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,200
do so after careful consideration.

130
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,800
His suicide note

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,040
would have neat handwriting.

132
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
Some even

133
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,920
rewrite it many times.

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,600
But look at this one.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,960
The handwriting is messy.

136
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
It's like

137
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,960
when you're about to hand in an exam

138
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,640
and you rush to finish.

139
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,840
I think

140
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,080
this Chen Tingyue

141
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,720
his suicide is questionable.

142
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
Captain Ran,

143
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
there's a new development.

144
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,640
A couple

145
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,920
provided this photo.

146
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,600
Take a look.

147
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,480
In the distant background of the photo,

148
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,440
on the top floor of Dongshi Building,

149
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,680
besides Chen Tingyue,

150
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,960
There was also someone wearing a green trench coat.

151
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,680
A blurry figure.

152
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,040
According to their account,

153
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,920
After taking photos, they arrived

154
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,160
at a nearby restaurant for lunch.

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,440
But soon after, the fall incident happened.

156
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,080
While sorting through the photos,

157
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,040
they found this suspicious person.

158
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,600
So they rushed over to bring us the photos.

159
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,160
This figure

160
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,400
looks like a woman.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
Last time I was watching Chu Hong,

162
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
she was wearing a green trench coat.

163
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,400
Have you checked all the surveillance cameras?

164
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
An hour before the incident,

165
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,280
the entire surveillance system of Dongshi Building

166
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,200
malfunctioned.

167
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,320
There are no surveillance records.

168
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,160
That's quite a coincidence.

169
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,520
Check

170
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,400
the nearby shops

171
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,840
and the parking lot cameras.

172
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,880
Hurry up.

173
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,320
Send this photo to Xiao Pang.

174
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,040
Okay.

175
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,720
Let's go.

176
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,520
Let's go upstairs and take another look.

177
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,880
This

178
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,680
person in the black trench coat

179
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,560
is a woman.

180
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
Yan Zi, hurry.

181
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,880
Notify Jun Ge and Cheng Tou.

182
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,440
Okay.

183
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Any findings?

184
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,120
Not yet.

185
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,920
Hao Nan.

186
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,640
Test the DNA.

187
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,440
Alright.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,440
This was reconstructed by the technical investigation unit.

189
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,320
It's the result of analyzing Chen Tingyue's phone data.

190
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,720
It confirms

191
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,800
that on the day of the incident,

192
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,600
Chen Tingyue received

193
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,680
a call with no network address displayed.

194
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,440
Additionally,

195
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,800
judging from his WeChat messages,

196
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,040
everything seemed completely normal.

197
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,360
Two days ago,

198
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,000
he even used a mobile app

199
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,680
to book a French restaurant.

200
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,720
He was planning tonight

201
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,000
to celebrate his daughter's birthday.

202
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,320
No matter how you look at it,

203
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,000
he doesn't seem like someone about to commit suicide.

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,760
At the crime scene,

205
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,600
an eyewitness

206
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,720
provided a photo

207
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,760
that also shows

208
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,640
before Chen Tingyue jumped,

209
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,320
there was another person present.

210
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,120
What about the surveillance review?

211
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,640
The Dongshi Building's surveillance system

212
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,160
suddenly malfunctioned before the incident.

213
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,640
We can't rule out human interference.

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
But based on nearby personal

215
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,280
surveillance footage,

216
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,720
we found a woman

217
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,320
who matches the features of the person in the green trench coat in the photo.

218
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,600
She has similar characteristics.

219
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,680
She entered the Dongshi Building before Chen Tingyue.

220
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,400
So, this person is a suspect.

221
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,120
What about the DNA from that cigarette butt?

222
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Are the results in?

223
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
The results are out.

224
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,800
Shi Rong

225
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,320
Shi Rong

226
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,200
Wasn't she abroad? She's back?

227
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,600
Pull up Shi Rong's file.

228
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,160
Yes.

229
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,600
Zoom in on the hand.

230
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,760
Zoom in more.

231
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,800
The Shi Rong who spoke with us last time

232
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,200
was an imposter.

233
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,040
This scar

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,520
Why do I feel like I've seen it somewhere before?

235
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,360
Who are you?

236
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,640
Do we know each other?

237
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,360
Well, now we do.

238
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,200
Officer Tang

239
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,840
Get in the car.

240
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,400
They say

241
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,880
that gun

242
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,840
was from eight years ago,

243
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,560
a missing gun from that old case.

244
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,960
How do you know so much?

245
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,640
Chu Hong is the real Shi Rong.

246
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,240
She was the one who told me about the gravel mine.

247
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,200
She also saved me in Tongde.

248
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,480
An outsider

249
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,040
shouldn't know so much.

250
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,680
It must be her.

251
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,480
She changed her appearance

252
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,480
but forgot about the scar on her hand.

253
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,040
We're from the Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team.

254
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
We're looking for Chu Hong.

255
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,160
Lawyer Chu is on a business trip today.

256
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,080
Take us to her office.

257
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,480
Alright.

258
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,280
Please follow me.

259
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,760
This way, please.

260
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,040
It's this one.

261
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,000
This

262
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Was this here before?

263
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,720
This

264
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,440
No

265
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,880
Cheng Feng

266
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,440
Odysseus

267
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,400
Odysseus is a hero in Greek mythology.

268
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,720
After orchestrating the famous Trojan Horse war,

269
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,520
he overcame many obstacles to return home.

270
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,400
and reunited with his family.

271
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,560
Check where Shi Rong's hometown is.

272
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,560
Little sister

273
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:49,960
Little sister

274
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,800
Come quickly

275
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,040
Look

276
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,280
Colored chalk

277
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,080
Big brother, big brother

278
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,040
Let's draw a rainbow together

279
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,120
Okay

280
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,400
I told you two to watch the stall for me

281
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,800
But you ran off to play here

282
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,880
Not listening, are you?

283
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,440
Not listening

284
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,560
Why are you so disobedient?

285
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,720
Police

286
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,360
Don't move

287
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,400
Police, don't move

288
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,120
Shi Rong

289
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,160
You are suspected in the 909 major serial murder case

290
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,440
You are now being arrested according to the law

291
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,560
Captain Ran

292
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,800
Can I speak with Officer Tang

293
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,880
for a moment?

294
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,160
This

295
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,560
is where you and your brother

296
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,400
lived when you were children, right?

297
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,960
After my parents passed away,

298
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,640
my brother and I

299
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,720
were fostered at my uncle and aunt's house.

300
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,760
Right there.

301
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,440
That house was very run-down.

302
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,800
There wasn't even a proper place to use the bathroom.

303
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,120
Every night,

304
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
when I needed to go to the bathroom,

305
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
my brother knew I was timid,

306
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,120
so he always went with me.

307
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,040
Your brother

308
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,600
was very good to you, wasn't he?

309
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,680
He was my only family in this world.

310
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,160
Even if everyone else abandoned me,

311
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,120
he would never leave me.

312
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,200
I won't let him die in vain.

313
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,400
Aunt Zhang,

314
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,520
back then, Chu Hong and I

315
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,160
both lived in Chinatown.

316
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
I met her a few times,

317
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,320
but we weren't close.

318
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,040
After I learned she died of illness,

319
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,560
I tried everything I could

320
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,520
and stole her identity.

321
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,840
I underwent more than ten plastic surgeries.

322
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,440
Finally,

323
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,960
I eventually became

324
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,080
her likeness.

325
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,960
Later, using her identity,

326
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,040
I was admitted to Columbia University's law school.

327
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,320
So you went to college

328
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,680
while planning

329
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,360
the Erinius plan.

330
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,040
As they say, every injustice has its perpetrator, every debt its debtor.

331
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,520
Isn't that right?

332
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,360
After returning to my country,

333
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,240
I started my plan.

334
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,640
The game

335
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,160
has begun.

336
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,320
I'm also part of your plan,

337
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,040
aren't I?

338
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
Officer Tang,

339
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,880
catching criminals must be tough, right?

340
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,080
When I was a child, I lived in the old district,

341
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,920
in the Spring Community.

342
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,200
I went to elementary school at Luzhou No. 9 Primary School.

343
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,120
Chu Hong,

344
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,280
my elementary school classmate.

345
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,720
You also have hatred in your heart.

346
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,800
You also want to find

347
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,440
the person who killed your mentor,

348
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,880
don't you?

349
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,080
I know

350
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,440
behind Sun Ruhai

351
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,720
there is a protector.

352
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,880
That person is the real

353
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,200
one who killed my brother.

354
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,600
Officer Tang,

355
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,040
I heard that a gravel quarry around here

356
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,320
had a shooting incident.

357
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,800
They say it involved a police gun lost many years ago.

358
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,600
This gun

359
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,160
is connected to an old case.

360
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,480
He has been secretly controlling everything.

361
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,800
But I don't know who he is.

362
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,480
I can only rely on your strength

363
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,480
to bring this protector to light.

364
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,080
Officer Tang, your delivery.

365
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,800
Thank you.

366
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,280
The incident where someone was killed.

367
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,360
You help me take care of it.

368
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,080
Besides this one million,

369
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,960
ten percent of the demolition company's profits.

370
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,080
You dare to threaten me.

371
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,280
What do you want?

372
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,600
Of course, I want more money.

373
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,360
How much?

374
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,360
One million.

375
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,480
Alright.

376
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,600
How do we make the deal?

377
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,360
Just as expected.

378
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,440
Director Chen has revealed his true colors.

379
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,160
Chen Tingyue

380
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,520
Did you kill him?

381
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,600
I really wanted to kill him.

382
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,600
But unfortunately,

383
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
someone beat me to it.

384
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Dongshi Building

385
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
fire escape stairs

386
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,960
The DNA from the cigarette butt

387
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
was left by you.

388
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,240
On the day Chen Tingyue died,

389
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,160
I did go to Dongshi Building.

390
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,360
But

391
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,440
I was meeting with a client

392
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,280
to discuss a case.

393
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,720
The elevator was broken that day.

394
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,640
I used the fire escape.

395
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,560
I smoked a cigarette there.

396
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,440
After I finished discussing the case and came out,

397
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,160
I found out that Chen Tingyue

398
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,640
had actually died.

399
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
If it were me,

400
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,000
how could I have let him

401
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,760
die so easily?

402
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,000
In my plan,

403
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,280
Chen Tingyue would have died by being torn apart by horses.

404
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,880
And you

405
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,400
would have been the executioner.

406
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,400
This would have been to honor

407
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,240
my deceased brother.

408
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,560
It's a pity

409
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,080
he didn't get to experience it.

410
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,920
Although it's not perfect,

411
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,920
my enemies

412
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,640
have all received their retribution.

413
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,480
I have no regrets left.

414
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,160
Let's go.

415
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,080
Officer Tang

416
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,680
If this hadn't happened

417
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
we might have

418
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,880
become good friends

419
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,680
In this world

420
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,960
there are no "ifs"

421
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,000
I am a police officer

422
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,760
We are the true justice

423
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,560
Always

424
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,720
standing against evil

425
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,880
Xiao Qiu

426
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,480
I'll be your sun in the next life

427
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,040
Dad

428
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,440
We came to see you.

429
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,840
Master

430
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,600
It's all over.

431
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,760
My dad used to tell me

432
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,840
he was a policeman his whole life.

433
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,280
The happiest thing for him

434
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,280
was having you as his apprentice.

435
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,840
What's so good about me?

436
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,400
Master

437
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,400
He always just scolded me.

438
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,080
He thought I was good.

439
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,040
I think so too.

440
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,640
Dad

441
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,080
Look at this guy.

442
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,800
Such a bad temper.

443
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,480
Reckless and impulsive.

444
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,960
What's so good about that?

445
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,880
But Tang Jun,

446
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,720
I want to thank you.

447
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,960
Because of you,

448
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,120
I can finally stand here calmly

449
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,880
in front of my dad's grave

450
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,480
and finally give my dad an answer.

451
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,880
Why do you want to kill me?

452
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,320
Dad, help me!

453
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,800
Who are you?

454
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,280
Let me go!

455
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,800
What are you going to do?

456
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,000
Dad!

457
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,000
Farewell forever.

458
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,400
Chen Tingyue.

459
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,120
Mr. Han.

460
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,120
Everything has been handled as you instructed.

461
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,560
Next,

462
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,080
You know what to do now, right?

463
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,640
Okay.

464
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,880
Don't move.

465
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,960
Move again and I'll shoot.

466
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,320
Little cop, go to hell!

467
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,520
Where are you?

468
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,080
I'm sleeping in the office.

469
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,800
I got another garbled email.

470
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,920
Come and see me.
