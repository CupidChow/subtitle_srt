Is Jae-woo drunk?

5
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,110
Yes, kind of.

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,290
How much did he drink to get this drunk?

7
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,330
You must be busy with your studies.

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,520
Wait! When did you become so close?

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,770
No, it's not like that.

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,840
Why not?

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,920
It's late into the wee hours, and you're still together.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,820
That's true.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,950
I love seeing handsome people get along well with each other.

Hey, Kang Ji-hoon. Where have you been all night?

17

I don't know.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,010
Is he in Room 308? What's wrong with him?

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,650
Hyeong-jin, get me the room card in my pocket.

Room card?

21

Why? You want him to sleep in your room?

22

Let him sleep in my room. And I'll sleep in his room.

Hurry up. It's heavy.

Wait. When did you two become so close?

Get some rest.

When?

30

When did we become close enough to drink together?

31
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,470
I need to get you some cold medicine.

32

You can't sleep?

33
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,380
Still, you should go to bed. You seem to have a fever.

34
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,810
I'm fine.

35
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,880
You're not, okay!

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,780
It's cold outside. You'll catch a cold if you stay there.

I'm sorry.

For what?

42
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,060
Because I haven't saved you yet.

Fine.

but I heard it. Go to sleep, okay?

48

No, I'm talking about yesterday.

57
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,690
You told me you let the guy in Room 308 sleep in Room 303,

58
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,620
and you yourself slept in Room 308.

59
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,340
Then you should have come out of Room 308, right?

What are you talking about?

61

You said you would sleep in Room 308.

Oh, that?

63

No. I came here to deal with something.

64

Why are your ears so red?

65

No, they're not.

66

Your ears don't lie.

67
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,310
You slept together, right?

68
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,490
Good for you. The bed is so small.

69
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,020
How is that possible?

70
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,450
I said it was not like that.

71
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,090
Then what did you two do?

72

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,130
Are you mad?

76
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,380
Forget it.

77
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,340
What? What is it?

78
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,140
Ice cream.

79
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,540
It's cold. Why do you like ice cream so much?

80
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,210
That's because you don't understand.

So what!

89
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,810
That's all because that you gave it away without my permission.

He's standing like a scarecrow.

96

Why didn't you let him in? It's cold outside.

97

He's standing seriously, making me feel sorry to bother him.

What?

123
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,250
Maybe I made it wrong.

What should I do?

167
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,330
I didn't prepare anything for you.

168
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,680
It's okay.

Stay away from that man.

Don't come here again.

Don't come to him.

188
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,330
I know you came here because you missed him.

189
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,390
But that doesn't matter. Get lost.

195
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,390
What's wrong?

196
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,250
Don't cry. Answer me! You hear me?

197
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,680
If you don't, that man will die because of you.

Answer me, Shin Jae-woo.

What are you doing?

Stay out of this. It's between me and him.

201
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,700
I saw you scaring him. How can I stay out of this?

202
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,680
It's okay. Don't cry.

203

Good boy, don't cry.

Understand?

You're the one who should die, but why...
