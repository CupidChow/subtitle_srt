Yes. Please don't tell him.

Okay.

113

You were so young and naive.

167
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,100
But because of me, in the all 15 years...

168
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,020
I care about you so crazily

169
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,600
that I can't do anything.

170
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:23,220
I can't see you get hurt because of me anymore.

171
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,550
Thank you for coming back to me again

172
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,150
after all these years.

173
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,510
Thank you

174
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,810
for approaching me every time.

175
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:52,700
Thank you for keeping me in your heart after the 15-year death of me.

176
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,310
Thank you for everything.

177
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,790
From now on,

178
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,829
let me approach you.

179
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,060
I feel like someone has been watching me all night.

180
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,830
I want to go with you.

181
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,010
If I ignore love and thus lose it, it'll be a great pity.

182
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,640
Without the beloved one around,

183
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,490
no matter how successful I am,

184
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,660
that's not a good life.

185
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,030
I really like you.

186
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,720
[Once Again]
