This? I think it's already been broken.

167
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,400
I don't want it anyway.

168
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,260
Take it if you want it.

169
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,010
Just use it.

170
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,010
Thank you.

171
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,120
Then you can leave after you're done.

172
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,010
Okay.

173
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,080
The hotel will be closed on January 30.

174
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,760
Don't forget it.

175
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,130
It's already the second morning.

176
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,290
I found you.

177
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,960
I miss you so much.

178
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,560
Is everything going well with your studies??

179
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,200
It's always like that, you know...

180
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,640
Come to think of it,

181
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,700
I nearly forgot the previous time when getting a confession of love.

182
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,770
Are you going to the cram school?

183
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,910
How old are you?

184
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,120
Ten.

185
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,820
Thank you.

186
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:10,350
