00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,870
[Once Again]

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,050
[Episode 7 I hope you can let go of your guilt.]

3
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,130
What are you doing?

4
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,340
You didn't eat much all day yesterday.

5
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,140
Is this for me?

6
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,960
Yes.

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,820
You didn't have to. Your arm is injured. You need more rest.

8
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,840
It's nothing.

9
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,930
Only with more rest can you recover sooner.

10
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,110
This is for thanking you

11
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,410
since you were toiling in the hospital taking care of me.

12
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,090
Not at all.

13
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,800
It's done. Have a seat.

14
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,229
Okay.

15
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,410
Did you sleep well last night?

16
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,580
Last night?

17
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,200
Yes, I did.

18
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,380
I had a good sleep too.

19
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,430
I feel like someone was looking after me all night.

20
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,540
Are you okay?

21
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,300
Yes, I'm fine.

22
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,180
You can cook?

23
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,500
I've been living alone for five years.

24
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,380
Five years?

25
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,520
Come to think of it, I really knew little about you.

26
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,700
Five years... then, you've been living alone since adulthood?

27
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,550
I went to college in Seoul.

28
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,630
To be honest, I really hoped to leave this place as soon as possible.

29
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,380
The memories here made me feel guilty and terrified.

30
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,250
That's how I went back to Seoul and finished my freshman year.

31
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,670
After serving in the army, I came back to continue my education.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,790
Now I just finished my junior year and is on vacation.

33
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,220
It must've been hard.

34
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,700
Because of my parents' work, We can't move either.

35
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,750
During the ten years from the age of ten to the high-school year,

36
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,680
I had been fearing to see anyone.

37
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
But I'm not like that anymore,

38
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,870
because the one that I felt guilty about and missed so much has come to my side.

39
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,280
The soup is getting cold. Let's eat.

40
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,420
Okay.

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,520
Don't show it even if it's not good.

42
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,590
Gosh, it's so good.

43
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,230
It's so delicious! I think you can open a restaurant.

44
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,020
Is it really good?

45
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,920
It's delicious beyond words.

46
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,000
I should tell the owner of the hotel to hire you as a kitchen employee.

47
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,450
No.

48
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,820
Before that, could you please teach  Joo Hyeong-jin how to cook?

49
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,530
I'm scared each time he says he's gonna cook.

50
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,850
What's wrong?

51
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,770
Do you have something to tell me?

52
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,400
Well...

53
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,970
Nothing. Eat up.

54
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,190
Jae-woo...

55
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,080
Is the thing you mentioned on January 29

56
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,960
still work?

57
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,610
What do you mean?

58
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,300
You said you wanted to go on a trip with me, didn't you?

59
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,730
I-I-I want to go on a trip with you.

60
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,550
So, don't do anything dangerous anymore.

61
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:35,480
From now on, let go of everything and have fun with me.

62
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,590
Ji-hoon,

63
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,200
there are so many things I want to do with you.

64
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,900
Thank you.

65
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,840
You're going on a trip with me, right?

66
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,150
Okay.

67
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,610
No.

68
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,230
What's going on? Is that Kang Ji-hoon?

69
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,270
Ji-hoon? What's wrong with him?

70
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,880
They look very eye-catching.

71
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,950
Do you think so?

72
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,159
You're all crazy.

73
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,900
My friend, Ji-hoon.

74
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,150
Poor guy.

75
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,840
He wasn't like that.

76
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,100
But ever since the guy in Room 308 appeared...

77
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,740
You should also look for someone alike too.

78
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,000
I mean, someone like the guy in Room 308.

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,800
Me?

80
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,110
No need.

81
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,280
There are many people who are obsessed with my charm.

82
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,880
Really?

83
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,870
You don't believe me?

84
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,840
Boss, I'm just overlooked for being in this countryside.

85
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,360
You know what, I'm really welcomed elsewhere.

86
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,380
Fine, I believe you, okay?

87
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,590
By the way, Hyeong-jin,

88
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,910
no matter in what way you're overlooked,

89
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,990
be sure not to let love slip by, or you'll regret it.

90
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,950
No matter how successful you are,

91
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,020
you still won't have a totally happy life

92
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,730
without your beloved one being by your side.

93
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,280
I realize that your words are always cruel but reasonable.

94
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,100
I should change my habit of nagging.

95
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,510
But I'm getting older and more nagging.

96
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,230
Anyway, they look really eye-catching.

97
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,380
I really like that guy in Room 308.

98
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,620
He's so sincere towards love.

99
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,690
People like him are rarely seen these days.

100
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,290
Wow.

101
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,050
I've been here for two years. You never said that to me before.

102
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm so sad.

103
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,710
Sir.

104
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,790
I gave you candies and jellies...

105
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,360
I gave you so much delicious food,

106
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,110
but it's all in vain.

107
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,320
I also like you.

108
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,730
Let me tell you something.

109
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,750
What is it?

110
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,910
I'm sure you'll pass this exam and become a top lawyer.

111
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,950
What is this?

112
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,350
Thank you for your kindness, but my intelligence fails.

113
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,560
If it's Ji-hoon, I'm sure he's able to pass it.

114
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,230
Believe me, I can always be right about future things.

115
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,770
This time, you've worked as hard as Ji-hoon,

116
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,030
and you'll definitely pass the exam.

117
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,770
As hard as Ji-hoon...

118
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,170
If he keeps being like this, he may fail the exam.

119
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,810
Don't worry about him.

120
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,110
I wish he could just let go of everything and have fun.

121
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,800
But why do I feel so sad again?

122
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,270
Wait. What's the date today?

123
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,730
Today? 26th.

124
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,050
26th?

125
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,480
There are really very few days left.

126
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
Can it really be roasted like this?

127
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,080
I don't know. It's my first time to do this.

128
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,470
It should work with the high heat.

129
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,120
Will it be cooked?

130
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,410
It doesn't matter if it won't.

131
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,420
This is just a try.

132
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,200
When we get there, I'll grill it on a hot pot.

133
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,960
I believe that it will be delicious.

134
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,370
Please look forward to it.

135
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,110
You know I'm a good cook.

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
I know.

137
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,000
I can't wait.

138
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,110
Ji-hoon, let me try it first.

139
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,750
Now?

140
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,770
Yes.

141
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,660
I think it should be delicious.

142
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,450
It's so good. It's half cooked.

143
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,810
The undercooked sweet potatoes taste better.

144
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,770
How should I put it? It's hard inside and out.

145
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,520
So amazing.

146
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,600
Ji-hoon, try it.

147
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,050
You're lying.

148
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,820
I'm not lying. It's really delicious.

149
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,690
Try it.

150
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,960
Liar.

151
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,000
Is it obvious?

152
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,930
This acting is based on my real experience.

153
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,960
I'll feed you then.

154
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,230
-Come here. -No, I'm not eating.

155
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,720
Come here.

156
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,380
I'm not eating.

157
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,440
I don't know if I should say this.

158
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,840
After all, this is the first time I've felt this feeling.

159
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,380
I didn't have the courage.

160
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,050
What are you trying to say?

161
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,450
I-I-I like you very much.

162
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,330
You're awake.

163
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,380
Yes.

164
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,350
Thank you.

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,810
For what?

166
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,760
Thank you for everything.

167
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,400
I want to give you something.

168
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,490
What is it?

169
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,480
A gift?

170
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,480
Yes, I want to give it to you.

171
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,450
What? But I didn't prepare anything.

172
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,250
It's okay. This is a belated gift that I owe you.

173
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,870
I also received a necklace from you a few days ago.

174
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,570
It felt good.

175
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,210
It's not a big gift.

176
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,820
It's just a toy made by a kid.

177
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,180
It's a toy,

178
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
but it's also my most precious treasure.

179
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,240
So I want to give you one too.

180
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,270
Do you like it?

181
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,840
Yes, I do.

182
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,620
That's great.

183
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,960
I can finally repay you after 15 years. Jae-woo.

184
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,319
Do I look good?

185
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,010
Yes.

186
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,119
Really?

Okay.

190
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,890
Jae-woo, wait.

191
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,520
What is it?

192
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,650
I hope, you can let go of your guilt.

193
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,730
Okay.

194
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,530
See you later.

Please live well for me, Sir.

200
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,950
What time is it? Why hasn't he been back yet?

201
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,270
I'm sorry, mom.

202
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,490
But I'll die soon and be back in time after 15 years.

203
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,560
I wish you wouldn't be so sad, mom.

204
