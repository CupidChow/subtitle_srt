1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,360
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:15,030

3
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,470
Are you playing hide-and-seek? Why are you hiding all of a sudden.

4
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,570
I rushed out of the house so I didn't put on any makeup.

5
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,660
Do you think it's easy for a woman to show a man her face without makeup?

6
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,910
This ... is the kitten from before, right?

7
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,520
What are you doing here with the cat?

8
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,210
Something came up with my friend who was watching Coco.

9
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,910
I was dropping her off with another friend.

10
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,650
- Don't be late because of the cat. 
 - What?

11
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,570
You didn't forget, did you? My father invited you over.

12
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,200
I didn't forget. Don't worry.

13
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,490
I won't be late. I'll be there after I drop off Coco.

14
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,130
I'm leaving work early too. I'll see you at the house later.

15
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,620
Kang Ju.

16
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,950
Here. This is your jacket from the other night.

17
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,590
You could have given this to me later.

18
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,720
Just in case. I brought it with me as I left the house.

19
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,330
I'm good now that I've seen his face one last time.

20
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,320
Take care Choi Kang Ju.

21
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,120
Let's go.

22
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,970
Yes.

23
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,100
- Sir, the documents you need to sign. 
 - Ah.

24
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,260
- Please leave them on my desk. 
 - Yes, sir.

25
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,860
Sir, that's ...

26
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,810
Sweet potato. You know ...

27
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,010
Better?

28
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,280
You can leave now.

29
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,080
Please filet these.

30
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,530
Are you asking me to filet these right now?

31
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,830
During the memorial service last time, you did such a good job,

32
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,090
I'll leave these with you.

33
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,690
What happened?

34
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,620
That's so weird. Last time,

35
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,330
you were like a sushi chef the way you were slicing up that fish.

36
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,250
I overworked my fingers yesterday during the performance.

37
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,190
So that's what happened. I didn't realize.

38
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,380
I shouldn't have bothered you. I'm sorry.

39
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,630
Why don't you go take care of what you need to, I'll take care of this.

40
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,920
 If you become his first wife, you will die.

41
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,780
 Because I will take your life.

42
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,250
 What are you looking at?

43
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,740
 Father. I was looking at some old pictures.

44
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,910
 This was Kang Ju's grandfather's wedding picture.

45
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,190
 Father. Do you ...

46
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,150
 know who this woman is?

47
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,330
 I'm not sure.

48
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,670
 We have so many family members. It's hard to tell who's who.

49
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,010
 Why are you curious about this all of a sudden?

50
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,120
 Even though it's from a long time ago, she's very pretty.

51
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,180
 People cannot believe just because they cannot see.

52
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,600
 But just because you cannot see it does not mean it does not exist.

53
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,000
 Then ... Taeyang Groups Madam also ...

54
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,500
 Of course. Since long ago, she's known everything..

55
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,300
 How can you prove that is true? What is the way to verify it?

56
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,160
 She existed for hundreds of years.

57
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,910
 Then ...

58
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,880
  If you look back in time, you can verify it.

59
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,560
 We can verify it if we look back in time?

60
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,130
 What in the world does that mean?

61
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,240
What are you staring at so intently?

62
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,890
Are you just getting home?

63
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,870
Were you looking at my picture?

64
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,690
You saw me this morning. You get to see me tonight.

65
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,570
That's not enough so you're looking at my pictures too?

66
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,650
Why? You can't get enough of my face that you keep wanting to look at it?

67
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,740
And also, don't think about calling it even with a bag of sweet potatoes.

68
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,290
Do you think adding a bag of sweet potatoes in here is a enough?

69
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,710
Plus, I might get a scar from that cut I got because of you.

70
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,360
See.

71
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,650
So?

72
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:40,410
Considering that you went out of your way to stop by my office,

73
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,350
I won't ask you to pay me back for it.

74
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,550
Aren't you happy I'm saving you money? I'm in a generous mood.

75
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,660
Why aren't you saying anything?

76
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,810
Shouldn't you be thanking me or something?

77
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,550
Father is in the study. You should go say hello.

78
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,970
The food must not suit your taste.

79
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,700
No, it does, Father.

80
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,590
It's because the wedding is coming up.

81
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,090
When your wedding is coming up, you become sensitive and lose your appetite.

82
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,660
Kang Ju, you will need to look after her.

83
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,390
Yes.

84
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,940
Are you worried about something lately?

85
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,410
There's nothing, Mother.  Please don't worry about it.

86
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,040
When we're done eating, come to the study.

87
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,090
Yes, Father.

88
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,310
Mother, I will take Father's tea to him.

89
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,920
Alright.

90
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,810
I heard your music performance yesterday went very well.  You did a good job.

91
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,060
Take this and use it when you need it.

92
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,320
Father.

93
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,880
I'm trying to earn points with my Daughter-In-Law ahead of time.

94
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,840
Did you call me here today to give me this?

95
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,490
The real reason is to have a rematch.

96
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,180
Excuse me?

97
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,940
Alkkagi.

98
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,050
You won't be able to beat me today.

99
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,170
I've been practicing a lot.

100
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,570
Alkkagi?

101
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,190
Of course.  We should do it.

102
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,910
I'll set up the game, you make the ink.

103
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,760
The ink?

104
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,700
Yes, Father.

105
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,620
Coco, let's go with Unni to see Grandma at Namhae.

106
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,080
Shall we eat?  Wait a minute.

107
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,410
That's right. I forgot to mention Alkkagi in my notes.

108
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,840
That's so important.

109
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,850
Dummy.

110
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,730
What the heck has she been doing while I was gone?

111
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,620
That's why you shouldn't have taught him Alkkagi.

112
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,390
You lost to Father pretty badly, didn't you?

113
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,600
What are you doing?

114
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,830
You're a little strange today.

115
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,980
Someone who used to eat everything is not eating well and not smiling much.

116
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,270
You're not talking much.  Are you upset about something?

117
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,790
What would I have to be upset about?  I even got some spending money from Father.

118
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,970
If that's so, then it's all good.

119
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,620
For that matter, what's going on with you?

120
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,880
Since when have you been so interested in how I'm feeling?

121
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,460
It's not that I'm watching how you're feeling.

122
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,080
It's because you might get stressed again and cause trouble.

123
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,140
Don't worry.  That won't happen.

124
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,930
Stay still.  It didn't get cleaned completely.

125
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,610
You two look very good together.

126
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,220
I was just passing by.

127
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,690
Please continue what you were doing.

128
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,000
What was I doing?  Let's go.

129
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,580
Grandma!

130
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,850
Doo Rim!  Aigoo!

131
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,490
Aigoo, my little puppy, aigoo!

132
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,260
Let me look at you, my little one.

133
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,350
Let's go in, let's go in. What is this?

134
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,720
Don't even get me started.

135
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,530
Because of Doo Rim, I'm going to have to learn how to clean fish.

136
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,290
On top of that, Alkkagi ...

137
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,780
Nothing else happened?

138
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,730
Kang Ju is a little strange.

139
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,870
Are you saying that he figured something out, or what?

140
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,090
It's not that.

141
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,240
I can't put my finger on it.

142
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,490
But anyway, he's different from the Kang Ju of the past.

143
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,870
I'm meeting Kang Ju's Mom tomorrow.

144
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,700
Once we set a date, the marriage will proceed as planned.

145
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:21,170
Ah, I'm really happy to be home.  And the smell of my Grandma is nice also.

146
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:27,310
I'm happy too.  I even get to pat my puppy's tush like this also.

147
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,650
My heart ached so much after sending you to Seoul by yourself.

148
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,780
Don't worry, Grandma.  I'm not leaving again.  I'm going to live with you forever.

149
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:43,130
No, you can't do that.  You should get married.

150
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,370
Didn't you meet any men in Seoul?

151
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,640
- Men?
- Yes.

152
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,180
Moreso that even the smartest men in Gyeongsang-do,

153
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,800
I heard that Seoul men are amiable and are good to women.

154
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,020
There's this Seoul man that I met while working.

155
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,620
His personality is very abrasive, and

156
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,780
you know how a woman's heart is supposed to be more beautiful that her outside appearance, right?

157
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,190
But that man is not like that.  He only likes pretty women.

158
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,590
And he only likes women who like really big breasts.

159
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:24,620
Aigoo, what? Is he brainless?

160
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,830
A man who is only interested in a women's looks is 100 percent

161
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,640
the kind to cause his wife grief and cheat.

162
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,770
Is that right?  Even you think he's a no.

163
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,540
You must be tired.  Go to sleep.

164
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,430
What is it?  Are you not able to sleep because of the cat?

165
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,180
That's not it.

166
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,590
How is it that I never get used to this place even though I come every day?

167
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,970
Why does the Madam ask me to do these things in the middle of the night?

168
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,120
Aigoo, you scared me!

169
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,320
It's me, Ahjumma.

170
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,630
Aigoo, you scared me.  That took 10 years off my life.

171
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,660
Why?  Did you think I was a ghost?

172
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,620
I just... for some reason this place frightens me.

173
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,440
When the wind blows even slightly, it gives me chills.

174
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,130
But it's so strange, young Master.

175
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,680
You played well here when you were young.

176
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,020
And you always hid here when you played hide-and-seek.

177
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,650
If you happened to get in trouble with the Madam.

178
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,880
You would hide here and not even eat.

179
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,760
There's good sunlight here so it's good for taking naps,

180
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,220
And it's quiet, so it's good for collecting my thoughts.

181
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,630
It really doesn't bother you at all?

182
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,150
This place ...

183
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,810
you do know that this is no ordinary place, right?

184
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,160
While I was so happy about you getting married,

185
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,790
on the other hand, I was worried.

186
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,340
Aigoo, I'm speaking nonsense again.

187
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,850
I'm sorry.  Please don't pay attention to what I just said.

188
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,390
I know why you're saying those things, and what you're thinking, Ahjumma.

189
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,690
I know it all.

190
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,140
The things that you're thinking about,

191
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,250
They won't happen... ever.

192
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,620
Of course.  Those things must not happen again.

193
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,750
Aigoo, of course it can't.

194
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,460
What are you doing here?

195
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,330
Aigoo, Madam.  What are you doing here so late, Madam?

196
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,760
Then I'll let the two of you speak.

197
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,270
I'll have to get new water.

198
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,620
What you were just talking about ...

199
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,690
Mother, that's—

200
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,110
Those stories made up by people who like to talk,

201
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,880
Why would you talk about it?

202
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,030
You shouldn't listen to those things.

203
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:20,810
You also shouldn't take them to heart.  You know what I'm saying, right?

204
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,260
Yes.

205
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,900
You,

206
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,040
Do you want to be fired?

207
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,500
P- pardon?

208
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,590
- Did I do something wrong? 
 - I've told you multiple times,

209
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,710
why are you spewing nonsense to Kang Ju?

210
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,990
He's preparing to get married. What if he has a change of heart?

211
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,300
I was wrong.

212
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,020
I'll be more careful from now on.

213
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,760
You must not speak of the annex to Yi Gyeong.

214
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,830
Do you understand what I'm saying?

215
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,900
Yes, Madam.

216
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,980
Then, with that date in mind, we'll start to get ready for the wedding.

217
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:19,300
Also, I'd like to keep the dowry minimal and have a simple wedding.

218
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:25,100
As you know, the Chairman does not like very loud and extravagant things.

219
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,410
Of course. Lavish weddings can become issues lately.

220
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,400
A social leader like Taeyang Group should set an example.

221
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:40,530
Thank you for understanding.

222
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:45,780
Of course. My daughter still has a lot to learn so please take care of her.

223
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,820
A charm that brings me love?

224
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,930
I'm dumb for believing such a thing.

225
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,180
Who said you can just throw that away?

226
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,700
You are ...

227
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,840
I told you not to treat this lightly. Why are you throwing it away willy-nilly?

228
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,180
No thanks. It's yours so you can take it back.

229
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,930
What is it? So you didn't like my gift?

230
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,200
Why do you keep doing this to me?

231
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,540
I wonder, why am I doing this to you?

232
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,760
Are you curious? If you're curious, come here.

233
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,360
If you're curious,

234
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,010
give me 500 won  (approx. 42 cents US Currency)

235
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,910
What are you doing? Are you teasing me?

236
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,800
If you put the bracelet back on, I'll tell you.

237
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,130
Don't bother.

238
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,900
Don't appear in front of me again.

239
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,500
You're such a strange woman.

240
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,900
The bracelet will make the things you really want happen.

241
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,190
Do you still not want it?

242
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,050
As soon as you put this on, good things will happen.

243
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,440
What do you want to do?

244
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,400
Are you going to throw it away or put it back on?

245
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,060
You choose.

246
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,840
It's not because I believe you.

247
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,560
There's nothing to lose.

248
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,250
Oppa Yi Hyeon!

249
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,900
See. What did I tell you?

250
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,060
You wanted it so you made the decision.

251
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,870
Whatever happens from this point forward,

252
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,550
you're going to have to learn to handle it.

253
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,160
Oppa!

254
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,530
We don't have much but please enjoy.

255
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,350
Thank you for the meal.

256
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:39,330
Grandma, he can't eat all of this.

257
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,680
No, I can eat it all.

258
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,200
You don't have to. How can you eat all of this?

259
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,660
I don't get full no matter how much I eat.

260
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:58,310
You're so handsome and you eat so well.

261
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,340
Doo Rim must take after your cooking skills.

262
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,400
The food tastes great.

263
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,190
Try some of the fish too.

264
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,400
What is it?

265
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,440
Doo Rim is the same way.

266
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,200
Her ability to bone the fish without it breaking apart was like a work of art.

267
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,140
Doo Rim, did you bone the fish for him too?

268
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,340
Ah, that's ...

269
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,870
When people have a meal together, they start to grow closer.

270
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,800
Good job.

271
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,950
Here, eat.

272
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,000
This you take three pills, three times a day.

273
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,000
And this is for when you go out.

274
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,620
This is a mink scarf that I've always heard about.

275
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,460
This is so expensive.

276
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,130
Grandma, try it on.

277
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,200
I'll help you.

278
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,280
How do I look?

279
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,440
Do I look like a pig with a pearl necklace?

280
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,470
What do mean? It looks perfect on you.

281
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,270
It's very warm and so nice.

282
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,040
The scarf is one thing,

283
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:35,040
but I'm so taken aback with gratitude for all the thought you put into this.

284
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,430
So whenever I come to visit, you'll give me a heaping bowl of rice

285
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,740
- and bone the fish for me? 
 - Of course.

286
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,900
And please speak comfortably around me.

287
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,740
Will that be okay?

288
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,510
Of course. That will make me feel better too.

289
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,300
Grandma, you look so cool.

290
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,340
Have you spoken with your grandma?

291
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,030
About the store I mean.

292
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,600
I'm not sure how my grandmother will feel about it.

293
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,800
The sea is her hometown.

294
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,500
And ... this is where my mom and dad went to rest.

295
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,430
When did your parents ...

296
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,950
When I was thirteen,

297
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,230
the two went out fishing.

298
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,700
You know they say,

299
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:51,500
when a couple truly love each other, they leave this world together.

300
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,600
My dad and mom must have been that way.

301
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,340
Your hands,

302
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,580
are big and warm.

303
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,100
Just like my dad's.

304
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,830
Noona, what are you doing?

305
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:54,100
I was thinking about whether I'm a spoon or a fork.

306
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,740
But what are you doing here?

307
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,770
I came as a VIP customer today.

308
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,500
Fine.

309
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,700
Then have fun shopping. I have a meeting.

310
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,660
Hey Kang In.

311
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,670
Yes, Noona. What?

312
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,460
Nevermind. You wouldn't know.

313
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,510
What was that?

314
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,970
Spoon.

315
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,000
Fork.

316
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,000
What is she talking about?

317
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,060
Ahjumma, please have these.

318
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,170
What is all this?

319
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,840
These are the new cosmetics we're launching at the department store.

320
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,700
I brought some for you to try.

321
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,330
Oh my.

322
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,150
Goodness. They look expensive.

323
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,520
Are you really giving these to me?

324
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,370
Of course. I've tried these myself.

325
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,170
They make your skin moist and firm. I really liked them.

326
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,580
Oh my goodness.

327
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,300
This is the first time I've seen such nice cosmetics.

328
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,660
I'm so grateful I don't know what to say.

329
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,070
Ahjumma, how long have you been working in this house?

330
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:27,320
Me? Let me see, it was even before the Madam married into the family,

331
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,360
so more than 30 years.

332
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,860
That's a long time.

333
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,910
It must be hard taking care of such a large home.

334
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,970
Of course. Since we're talking about it,

335
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,890
the only reason this house is still standing is because of me.

336
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,920
No one else could handle it.

337
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,520
Let me see.

338
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,420
Ahjumma, I am curious about something.

339
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,450
What? What is it?

340
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,900
Whatever you're curious about, ask me.

341
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,540
I've been here so long, there's nothing I don't know.

342
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:08,990
You know some years ago, there were some strange rumors about Kang Ju's family.

343
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,970
That there was a curse passed down through the generations.

344
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,390
That's all nonsense, right?

345
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,420
Well, it's not completely nonsense.

346
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:27,050
Otherwise, why would Kang Ju's grandmother leave something about it in her will when she died?

347
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,360
Her will?

348
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,160
You cannot tell anybody else about this.

349
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,680
The annex is really ...

350
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,400
She asked we protect the annex no matter what happens.

351
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,750
There must be some truth to it for her to leave it in her will.

352
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,890
Madam follows her will

353
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,360
and makes sure to clean and protect that annex.

354
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:17,450
 Do you think a fork goes well with a coffee cup?

355
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,550
 Everyone has a place that suits them.

356
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:31,100
Goodness, why did she send so much?

357
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,970
That was nice of her.

358
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,120
So is Doo Rim doing well?

359
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,990
Yes. And her grandmother is also doing well.

360
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,610
Have you spoken to her about the store?

361
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,130
She hasn't spoken to her grandmother about it yet.

362
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,150
Since she's lived there her whole life.

363
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,170
Leaving your hometown overnight isn't an easy thing to do.

364
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,860
Maybe it's because we've grown closer while living together,

365
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,410
but strangely something keeps tugging at my heart whenever I think of Doo Rim.

366
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,460
It must have been hard for her to take care of her grandmother at such a young age.

367
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,460
If she lived close, we could check in on her more,

368
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,960
and take care of her. It would be nice.

369
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,030
Yi Hyeon, try to convince her.

370
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,670
Yes, I will.

371
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,880
Aigoo, Doo Rim,

372
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,460
it would be nice for you to meet a man like the Director.

373
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,800
Perhaps he came all the way here,

374
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,200
because he has feelings for you.

375
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,400
It's not like that Grandma. What would he see in me?

376
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,720
Aigoo, what are you saying? What's bad about you?

377
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:07,000
Any guy who whisks you away should consider himself lucky.

378
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Grandma, should we move to Seoul?

379
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,400
Seoul? Do you want to live in Seoul?

380
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,690
Do you not like it?

381
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:30,590
Aigoo, why does that matter? We don't have any money to move there anyway.

382
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:40,760
Truthfully, Grandma. The Director offered to open a restaurant for us in Seoul.

383
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,790
A restaurant? What did you tell him?

384
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:53,550
I told him I would think about it. If you don't want to, I'm not going.

385
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:59,370
I also don't feel right leaving with Mom and Dad resting here.

386
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,430
Are the sweet potatoes done?

387
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,830
Let's see if they're done.

388
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,160
Oppa, breakfast is ready. Come down.

389
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,900
Okay.

390
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,570
Oppa, that necktie doesn't look good. It doesn't go well with your outfit.

391
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,560
I think this would look better.

392
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,130
No, I like this one better.

393
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,160
Oppa, is there a girl you're seeing lately?

394
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,500
Don't just spend time working. You should be dating as well.

395
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,590
When I get married, you'll have no one to hang out with. You'll probably be bored.

396
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,090
Don't worry. I have someone to hang out with.

397
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,430
What? Do you have a girlfriend?

398
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:06,130
This necktie ... I'm right, aren't I? You're acting very strange.

399
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,670
Who gave you this tie?

400
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,230
Who is it from?

401
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,660
Later. Let's eat.

402
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,790
There really must be someone. Who could it be?

403
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,600
Here. This is from Kang Ju's grandmother.

404
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,810
It's an heirloom passed down to the daughters-in-law over the years.

405
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:59,700
If we adjust it to fit your hand, you won't ever lose it. Here.

406
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,770
Thank you, Mother.

407
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,580
I'll cherish and care for it.

408
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,100
Try it on.

409
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,010
It's a little big.

410
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,630
What is this?

411
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,810
A wedding present. Congratulations.

412
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,740
I saw you getting your engagement ring earlier.

413
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:40,070
At this point, what else can I do?

414
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:45,140
I'll wave the white flag. I'm giving up.

415
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,670
I admit it. I was suspicious of you at one point.

416
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:56,590
Your face was the same but it didn't seem like you.

417
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,090
What are you talking about? Who else could it have been?

418
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,700
But once I saw you playing the piano,

419
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,420
I realized how wrong I was.

420
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,370
Once reality set in, I came back to my senses.

421
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,420
Once that happened,

422
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,500
the road I couldn't see before started to appear.

423
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,600
So now I plan on going down my own road.

424
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,350
That's good. I'm glad.

425
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,030
I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.

426
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,610
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

427
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,620
Thanks for the gift.

428
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,570
I have work to do so I'll leave first.

429
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,780
The wedding bouquet, is it okay if I receive it?

430
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,160
Of course. I'd like that.

431
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,810
Thank you.

432
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,400
 Do you think you'll be able to wear that nightgown safely on the first night?

433
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,560
What's with the nightgown?

434
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,460
Ru Mi gave it to me as a wedding present.

435
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,060
Ru Mi did?

436
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,420
But do you think this will look good on you?

437
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,140
What are you doing?

438
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,940
You ... don't wear this and put on that goblin makeup.

439
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,720
Why haven't you been wearing that bracelet lately?

440
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,620
What?

441
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:02,370
You know ... the one you called a lucky charm or whatever. You wore it everyday.

442
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,520
Oh that. I got tired of wearing it everyday.

443
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,910
Kang Ju, I forgot to mention something earlier.

444
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,760
I made a reservation to look at wedding dresses tomorrow.

445
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,150
Are you free tomorrow?

446
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,510
Jang Yi Gyeong. Jang Yi Gyeong!

447
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,630
What happened?

448
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,520
Kang Ju.

449
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,970
- Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? 
 - What?

450
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,630
How can you just hang up like that?

451
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,070
I thought you were in some kind of accident. You scared me.

452
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,250
A car came out of nowhere ...

453
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,010
You ran out here like this because you thought I was in some kind of accident?

454
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,130
How could I not after you screamed on the phone like that?

455
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,250
Do you think you can drive? Should I call a driver?

456
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,930
No. I'm fine.

457
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,270
 Could it ... no. There's no way.

458
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,590
 Choi Kang Ju would never ...

459
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,840
Aigoo, my goodness.

460
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,560
These expensive gifts.

461
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,310
On top of that, a restaurant?

462
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:58,590
There's no way he would do that unless he had feelings for Doo Rim.

463
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,590
Perhaps, the reason Doo Rim can't sleep at night

464
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,320
is because of the Director.

465
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:13,120
Aigoo, that's it. That's why. Now that they're separated,

466
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,130
she must miss him and I didn't even know.

467
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,360
Doo Rim. Have a seat here.

468
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,560
Grandma, what?

469
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:30,770
Doo Rim, let's ... go to Seoul.

470
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,180
Grandma.

471
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:39,730
Why do we have to live in this small town forever?

472
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,330
Let's move to Seoul and make lots of money.

473
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:47,700
We can live a great life like everyone else.

474
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,770
We tracked the phone number you gave us.

475
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,990
This is the owner of that phone.

476
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,550
This person is ...

477
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:13,150
You're right. It's Hong Man Su, Kang Ju's maternal grandmother's chauffeur.

478
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,830
She's been abroad recently,

479
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:19,360
so I think he's taking care of the empty house.

480
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:25,060
What should we do Chairman? Should we dig deeper?

481
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,750
 I have chosen to marry that man.

482
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,990
 Even if I lose my life.

483
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:11,280
 I do not regret my decision.

484
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,790
 Because I love him more that my own life.

485
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,550
What are you doing here?

486
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,240
What are you hiding right now?

487
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,880
Hiding? What am I hiding?

488
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,630
Is it something I can't see?

489
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,350
What are you doing?

490
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,180
What is this that you keep taking such good care of it?

491
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,970
Did you forget your mother's will?

492
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:47,560
I'm just following that will.

493
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,540
Her will?

494
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,160
Like my mother,

495
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,290
do you have some ulterior motives for the kids' marriage?

496
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,970
What do you mean?

497
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:05,060
Thirty years ago, my mother had different thoughts than me.

498
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:11,530
But my mother accepted the woman I brought home without a fight.

499
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,940
Even though she was a poor girl with a single father who owned a dry cleaning business.

500
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:24,490
I only found out why she didn't oppose the marriage after that woman died.

501
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:32,280
If you are planning the same things with Yi Gyeong like my mother did—

502
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,840
If I said no, would you believe me?

503
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,660
You're not going to believe anything I say.

504
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,740
You believe what you want.

505
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,630
I'll believe what I want.

506
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,410
Does that mean you believe that senseless rumor about this family?

507
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,490
Why do you think I'm doing this? It's all for Kang Ju's sake.

508
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,950
Are you in your right mind right now?

509
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:09,070
Listen to me carefully. If you have different plans for Yi Gyeong,

510
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,500
then I will never forgive you.

511
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,030
It's not true, is it?

512
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,330
It's not like that, right?

513
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,760
Those are made up stories.

514
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,450
You said it yourself. They're all made up.

515
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:14,940
So why do you believe it? Why?

516
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,990
Kang Ju.

517
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:23,200
Is that why ... you chose Yi Gyeong instead of Ru Mi?

518
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,390
That's not it. It's not.

519
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:39,730
I didn't think ... I had a heart.

520
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:48,030
I wasn't going to ... give my heart away.

521
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,830
But for the first time in my life, I found someone to give my heart to.

522
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,650
You came.

523
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,000
 Bride of the Century
