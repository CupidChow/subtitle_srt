00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,550
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,010

3
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,240
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,940
Oppa! 
 ♫  Is it wrong if long for you?  ♫

5
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,450
Oppa! 
♫  What if i can't hold back any longer?  ♫

6
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,420
♫  There are words I didn't get a chance to say  ♫

7
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,940
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm thankful  ♫

8
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,560
Are you all right?

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,530
It's such a relief that you are unharmed.

10
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,630
Why did you do such a stupid thing?

11
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,760
Why for someone like me?

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,930
I haven't done anything for you.  Why ...

13
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,930
♫  Should I let you go with a warm smile?  ♫

14
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:29,190
Thank you.  I am so sorry and grateful.

15
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,930
♫  Should I pretend nothing is wrong  ♫

16
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:43,990
♫  As if we never knew each other and let you go?  ♫

17
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,410
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

18
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,790
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

19
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,560
♫  What if I can't hold back any longer?  ♫

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,520
♫  There are words I didn't get a chance to say  ♫

21
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,930
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm thankful  ♫

22
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,970
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm sorry  ♫

23
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:24,660
 For the sake of my daughter, someone else's daughter's life

24
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,570
 was snuffed out in an instant.

25
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,760
This is precisely the reason your grandmother wanted to meet me.

26
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,600
Is this how you made a deal with my mother?

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,630
Your mother is the most aftraid that this will be revealed to the world.

28
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,280
Call a press conference as soon as possible.

29
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,120
This time there may have just been a picture,

30
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,370
but if this happens again, the recording will be distributed to the press.

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,840
If this gets released, Taeyang Group will definitely suffer,

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,730
but I wonder what will happen to your Father and Grandmother?

33
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,770
Stop hurting people.

34
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,980
Everything is in your hands. You make the decision.

35
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,890
You tie up my hands and feet,

36
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,520
and now you want me to make a decision?

37
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,850
Thanks. You helped pull myself together without any regrets.

38
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,710
You'll need to come with me. We need to clean up the mess I made.

39
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,360
Aren't you being pretty demanding for someone who needs my help?

40
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,370
Do you want a public announcement or something?

41
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,000
If I feel like it, I can end all of this.

42
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,960
Is that what you want?

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,680
Listen to me carefully. If we're both holding on each end of a rope,

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,550
and I decide to let go, you'll get hurt too.

45
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,740
Stop going overboard and know your place.

46
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,970
I'm sorry for worrying you.

47
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,730
I acted before thinking. I was careless.

48
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,990
Everything is my fault.

49
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,460
I was also at fault. I treated Kang Ju poorly.

50
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,530
Please forgive us this once.

51
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,430
I'll think of Yi Gyeong and look pass this incident.

52
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,100
Thank you Father.

53
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,220
Kang Ju. I need to speak to you.

54
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,660
I was hoping you wouldn't find out.

56
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,560
I didn't want you to go through all this pain.

57
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,290
Don't resent your grandmother. It's all my fault.

58
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,790
I couldn't let go of your father.

59
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,280
So your grandmother ...

60
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,730
Don't try so hard anymore.

61
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,000
All the burdens you've been carrying alone,

62
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,320
you can give it all to me now.

63
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,490
I just have to be the one to change my mind.

64
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,790
Kang Ju ...

65
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,710
Please make sure Father never finds out.

66
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,590
You know as well as I do.

67
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,870
The person who will be hurt the most is Father.

68
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,740
I'm not afraid the world will find out the truth.

69
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,600
Because it's only right that a person pays for their wrongdoings.

70
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,390
But I'm most of afraid ... that Father will find out.

71
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,430
Father ...

72
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
has been trapped in the past all of this life.

73
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,160
He's lived in a prison he's created for himself.

74
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,010
We shouldn't put him though any more pain.

75
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,090
Father, take your medicine.

76
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,370
Young Miss.

77
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,400
I heard that Young Master skipped the press conference because you two had a fight.

78
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,590
What did you two fight about?

79
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,700
This should be a time where you two are all over each other.

80
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,800
For him to skip the press conference, was it something really serious?

81
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,920
You must really be comfortable around me.

82
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,460
Pardon?

83
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:48,200
If you want to continue working here, know you place and whom you work for.

84
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,430
It's not like we're friends to be gossiping together.

85
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,740
If that's what you want to do, go find some neighborhood friends.

86
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,700
But watch what you say around me.

87
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,170
I ... was just worried.

88
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,600
Did I ever ask you to be worried about me?

89
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,990
Please mind your own business from now on, and focus on your the housework instead.

90
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,990
Isn't that your job?

91
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,060
Why do you look like someone whose spirit's just been sucked out?

92
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,970
How can a person change so much?

93
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,270
It's really strange.

94
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,130
What is?

95
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,470
Miss Yi Gyeong.

96
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,650
Besides her face, everything about her is different.

97
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,240
The look in her eyes, her facial expressions, the way she speaks, all of it.

98
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,790
She doesn't seem different to you?

99
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,370
Again, again, and again ... there you go saying useless things.

100
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,800
Listen to me! Do you know what she just said to me?

101
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,480
 News

102
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,640
It's a relief your injuries weren't more serious.

103
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,020
You don't even want to look at my face now?

104
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,400
I tried really hard. While living in your home,

105
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,960
I tried really hard to be like your real son and Yi Gyeong's real brother.

106
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,470
- But you— 
 - If you were really Yi Gyeong's real brother,

107
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,500
would you still be on Doo Rim's side?

108
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,050
You abandoned us. We didn't abandon you.

109
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,860
I didn't know you were this kind of person. How could you ...

110
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,290
Fine. Resent me.

111
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,700
Loathe me all you want.

112
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,050
If that helps you feel even a little bit better,

113
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,480
then as your mother for the last 20 years,

114
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,040
it will be my last gift to you.

115
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,410
From the first day you came into my home, you never once complained.

116
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,110
You were a good kid who listened well without having to be punished.

117
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:53,300
Never once did I ever have to yell or get mad at you.

118
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:01,520
I wonder if that was to keep each other distant emotionally.

119
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,480
- Rest. 
 - Must you go this far?

120
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,070
I know you're the one who released the photos to the media.

121
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,600
That was probably not part of your original plan.

122
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,580
Because you didn't know that Choi Kang Ju would skip the press conference.

123
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,520
We steered off course a bit, but we'll get back on track soon.

124
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,090
You sound confident. How can you be so sure?

125
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,420
Do you think I could get this far with just photos?

126
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,710
If I'm going against Taeyang Group, those pictures are not nearly enough.

127
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:50,090
As soon as they got a taste of what's to come, Kang Ju came to his senses and came to us.

128
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,680
Now stop worrying and focus on getting better.

129
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,670
You need to get better by Yi Gyeong's wedding day. After all, you're her one and only brother.

130
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,980
You should walk her down the aisle, don't you think?

131
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,750
Stop acting like everything's okay around me.

132
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,010
Don't act like nothing happened. That worries me more.

133
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,780
Does it look like I'm trying to act like everything's okay?

134
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,940
I'm Taeyang Group's heir.

135
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,010
Do you think I'll put the entire company in jeopardy because of a knock-off girl?

136
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,030
All of that is nothing.

137
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:54,560
Since it's nothing, I'm acting like nothing happened.

138
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,820
I understand, Sir.

139
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,710
Even though the sales and revenue were up nearly 5.4% compared to last year,

140
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:27,000
the reason profits are not higher is because of poor decisions made by the executive board.

141
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,140
It's a given the board needs restructuring,

142
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,590
but I think it's also a good time to review new options for low-performing plans.

143
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,030
You came up with a solid plan.

144
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,530
Go ahead and move forward with what you have.

145
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,560
Is there anything else?

146
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,430
I was just wondering if there's another reason you're working so much lately.

147
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,630
No, there's isn't. I've neglected my work lately, so I want to make it right.

148
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,220
You're not even going to acknowledge that I'm here?

149
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,910
What is it?

150
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:56,990
I did what you asked me last time, so this time do something for me.

151
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,160
Come with me to see my brother.

152
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,150
Kang Ju wanted to come visit you.

153
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:25,990
I should have come sooner. I'm sorry it took so long.

154
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,560
I hope you get better soon.

155
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,910
You don't need to act so courteous.

156
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,730
Can you please excuse us? It's been awhile since I've seen my sister.

157
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,800
Do you feel better now? Are you happy now that you have Choi Kang Ju by your side?

158
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,550
Do you know how long it's been since we've seen each other?

159
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,370
After all this time, that's all you have to say to me?

160
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:16,310
I knew you'd be like this so I didn't come to visit even when I wanted to.

161
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,330
Why is it Doo Rim and now me? What is she to you?

162
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:29,140
She even turned you down so why are you so determined to protect her until the end?

163
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,450
I was so angry and upset that I didn't want to see you.

164
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,890
Because if I saw you, I would hate Doo Rim even more.

165
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,740
Yi Gyeong ...

166
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,500
Take Doo Rim and go somewhere far away.

167
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,850
You want Doo Rim beside you.

168
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,810
You want that more that anyone else.

169
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,500
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

170
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,760
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

171
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,230
♫  Because I'm sorry for loving you  ♫

172
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:36,130
♫  I can't let you go  ♫

173
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,080
♫  I try to see you but I can't see you  ♫

174
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:03,220
♫  You keep calling out to me from somewhere  ♫

175
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,020
♫  You're hiding behind my tears from a corner of my heart  ♫

176
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,290
Let's go Kang Ju.

177
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,770
♫  I just can't find you  ♫

178
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:24,860
♫  As if I could touch you with my fingers  ♫

179
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,460
♫  As if I could reach you in the corner of my eye  ♫

180
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,960
♫  I keep thinking of you so I stop in place  ♫

181
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,110
♫  After a long time  ♫

182
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,850
♫  I call out to you in tears  ♫

183
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:53,140
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

184
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,640
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

185
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,150
♫  What if I can't hold back any longer?  ♫

186
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:07,250
♫  There are words I didn't get a chance to say  ♫

187
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,730
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm thankful  ♫

188
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,950
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm sorry  ♫

189
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,770
♫  The words I love you  ♫

190
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,980
We don't have any more spectators so there's no need to continue with this act.

191
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,860
You've settled everything in your mind but not your heart.

192
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,580
Whenever you see me, your heart still races and it hurts, doesn't it?

193
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,230
Don't you dare try to see into my heart. Just keep acting like Taeyang Group's daughter-in-law.

194
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,210
I'm saying to stop acting like my woman. Isn't that what you wanted?

195
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,630
To be Taeyang Group's daughter-in-law and not my woman.

196
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,380
What if I wanted to be your woman?

197
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,900
You're being too greedy.

198
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,700
I was just kidding. There's no need to be so serious.

199
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,410
When did we ever have a relationship where we could kid around?

200
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,060
Watch what you say to me.

201
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,770
Why do you keep coming? What about the restaurant?

202
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,790
Don't worry. Grandma and Jin Ju are taking care of things well.

203
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,070
It's because whenever I see you,

204
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,960
you're like a grim reaper who walks around 24 hours a day without sleeping.

205
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,360
Have you ever seen a grim reaper as cute as me?

206
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,940
Your dark circles would even scare the grim reaper away.

207
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,560
How about now?

208
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,210
Oppa, here.

209
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,540
The dry cleaner said they couldn't take the stains out.

210
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,160
I searched all over the internet to find ways to take them out.

211
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,580
There's still a tiny bit left,

212
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,830
but I wanted you to get better soon.

213
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,190
You can wear this and go to work like before.

214
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,310
Remember when you said there's nothing you've done for me?

215
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,790
You made me smile.

216
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,960
A smile that warms my whole body.

217
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,300
So much that it makes me feel warm even when I'm hit with cold air.

218
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,990
That alone is more that enough.

219
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,330
So don't feel sorry.

220
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,820
Go wherever you want. That's what I wish for you.

221
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,190
What do you think?

222
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,600
Things seem different between Kang Ju and Yi Gyeong.

223
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,960
It's also unlike Kang Ju to skip a press conference.

224
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,770
To be honest ...

225
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,850
Don't be afraid to tell me.

226
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:11,480
Lately, my wife has also mentioned some strange things.

227
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,320
She keeps saying Yi Gyeong is different from before.

228
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,250
Like she's a different person.

229
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,470
I know this makes no sense ...

230
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,020
It's okay. Tell me.

231
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:36,710
She mentioned whether Young Master has another woman.

232
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,640
Another woman?

233
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,940
It seems my wife accidentally overheard Madame and Young Master speaking.

234
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,690
She said they briefly mentioned another woman.

235
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:54,530
So my wife thought he skipped the press conference because of that other woman.

236
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:08,000
After the meeting next week, I was thinking about restructuring the board.

237
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,960
Of course, I'll keep key members from the current board.

238
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,240
Kang Ju.

239
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,360
Yes, go ahead.

240
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,260
When I see you lately, you don't seem like yourself.

241
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,150
I can't help having some strange thoughts.

242
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,900
And it's not just me.

243
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,690
Mrs. Ahn is also saying odd things.

244
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,910
What do you mean odd things?

245
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,870
Please don't misunderstand and just listen.

246
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:51,020
Are you ... by any chance ... seeing another woman besides Yi Gyeong?

247
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,800
Kang Ju.

248
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:01,220
Oh, Father. I didn't know you were here.

249
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,460
You're here?

250
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,910
Aren't you working Kang Ju too hard?

251
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:12,210
He's been working so much overtime lately, his face is half it's size.

252
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,690
He's saying he's doing this to make up for slacking off.

253
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,760
There's nothing I can do.

254
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,270
What is that?

255
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:26,240
Oh, this. We've been having lunch dates lately.

256
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,430
Since he's so busy lately, if I don't pack him food,

257
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,730
I would never see him.

258
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,340
Father, you should have some too.

259
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,900
Grandmother.

260
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,770
- Give it to me. 
 - Oh, thank you. Thank you.

261
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,540
She doesn't seem like other girls these days.

262
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,530
What's wrong?

263
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,900
No, it's nothing. Let's go.

264
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,460
Ah, yes.

265
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,950
That wasn't bad considering I came at the last minute after receiving your call.

266
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,510
And we completely fooled Father.

267
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,520
You should have majored in acting instead of piano.

268
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,330
That was a compliment, wasn't it?

269
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,560
Does this seem like I'm acting?

270
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:19,180
Don't ever touch me. I'm not amused by your acting.

271
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,680
You're a lot more innocent than I thought.

272
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,530
I was just practicing in case we might need to do this one day.

273
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,440
You'll never win his heart.

274
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,990
You'll end up just holding onto an empty shell.

275
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,590
You weren't able to have even that empty shell.

276
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,880
Why don't you look for another company?

277
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,120
Isn't it uncomfortable constantly running into me?

278
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,160
Once I marry Kang Ju, I'll be okay but you may be uncomfortable.

279
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:28,900
You'll have to treat me as your superior but with your personality, will you be able to do that?

280
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,060
Think about it carefully.

281
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,790
Hey Na Doo Rim? What's so special about you?

282
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:00,360
You don't have anything so why do you act so high and mighty?

283
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,540
I am a woman who graduated from Hangook University. You know that?

284
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,090
If you're going to be drunk, go somewhere else.

285
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:12,460
Out of all the bars in the city, why did you come here so early in the day?

286
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,920
I can't stand Jang Yi Gyeong doing so well. Why?

287
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,830
Can't you listen to me rant? It was hard enough coming here. Are you looking down on me too?

288
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,990
Hey, stop drinking. You're not the soju type.

289
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,170
You should be sipping on wine or something.

290
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,700
And you're the soju type?

291
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,300
Of course.

292
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,720
That's good.

293
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,780
Kang Ju. You. You both are amazing.

294
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,140
I'm not okay just watching you two.

295
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,700
So how can you two just live like nothing happened?

296
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,440
Then, should I be crying and acting like I'm going to die?

297
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,360
People go through things worse than this and still make it out perfectly fine.

298
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,980
Even when I lost both my mom and dad at once,

299
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,950
I only had my grandmother left.

300
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,340
Even when my grandmother collapsed from a heart attack,

301
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,820
I still made it out alive.

302
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,010
I was still able to live.

303
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,420
The reason I can't hold onto Kang Ju,

304
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,270
is not only because I acted like a knock-off.

305
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,260
I don't even know if he knows my real name.

306
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,010
It will be hard for him to acknowledge me.

307
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,000
To Kang Ju, I'm not Na Doo Rim.

308
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,790
I'm just the knock-off Jang Yi Gyeong.

309
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,360
You're the one that needs to stop drinking.

310
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,720
I hope I'm not bothering you at work.

311
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,970
It's fine.

312
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,420
I was just passing by and decided to stop by.

313
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:06,120
I heard the company isn't doing very well.

314
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,220
You're not here because you're concerned about the company.

315
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:18,190
If you're here because of the press conference tomorrow, don't worry.

316
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,900
We will proceed as planned.

317
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,870
I'm glad to hear that.

318
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:28,570
I came just in case you had something else in mind.

319
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,300
I guess I don't have to worry.

320
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,620
I know you have a bomb in your hands, so I have no intention of sabotaging myself.

321
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,410
The doctor says you're recovering quicker than he thought.

322
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,980
When you're discharged, plan on returning to the company.

323
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:12,880
What? Were you planning on completely cutting yourself off from us?

324
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,290
Even if I'm only your step-son, you must not trust anyone else with the company.

325
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,900
Yes. I can't deny that.

326
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,830
We received the funding from Taeyang Group so we're finally financially stable.

327
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:32,150
After the press conference tomorrow, things will get even busier.

328
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,240
Press conference?

329
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,080
There's nothing Kang Ju can do.

330
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,810
Doo Rim wasn't enough for him to throw everything away.

331
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,660
They were just playing with fire that entire time.

332
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:52,620
Everything will be wrapped up tomorrow. Get some rest.

333
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,630
You should be at the hospital. So what brings you all the way here?

334
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:25,460
I have something to ask. What are you going to do about Doo Rim?

335
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,160
Why are you asking me that?

336
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,020
How could you do this? Doo Rim did so much for you.

337
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,570
She fooled me, lied to me,

338
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,050
and humiliated me.

339
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,630
On the surface, you two acted like brother and sister.

340
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,410
But you really felt strongly about each other, didn't you?

341
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:56,350
I think you should be the one to be responsible for her.

342
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,470
Whether you two go far away or not,

343
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,650
I have nothing to do with her.

344
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,140
Don't say things you don't mean.

345
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,750
Even if everyone in the whole world points their fingers, you shouldn't do that.

346
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,100
She lied, was deceitful, and humiliated you?

347
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,430
Did you ever stop to think why she did those things?

348
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,000
How she's lived her life ...

349
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,290
I don't want to know.

350
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,270
Please leave now.

351
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,510
Even if it was just for one day, she wanted to be your bride.

352
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:39,640
She risked her life for you. Because she loved you more than her own life.

353
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,810
Do you think I would believe that?

354
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:49,050
A guy like you doesn't deserve a girl like her.

355
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:54,310
You threw away a woman who loved you more than you'll ever know.

356
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,830
I'm not backing down anymore.

357
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,760
You threw that love away, so don't resent me if I take your place.

358
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,200
Oppa. Where have you been?

359
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,140
You haven't finished recovering. You can't walk around outside like that.

360
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:39,850
Oppa. What's wrong? Did something happen?

361
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,350
Oppa.

362
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,560
What am I going to do?

363
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,680
What am I going to do with you?

364
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,260
I'll ask you one last time.

365
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,160
Do you want to run away with me and go live somewhere far away?

366
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,360
What's wrong with this ahjussi?

367
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,570
It was okay for awhile but now you're starting up again.

368
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,880
Since everything is going well for you now, you're having useless thoughts again.

369
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,360
Stop playing around and answer me.

370
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,450
Are you crazy?

371
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:21,540
It's not like I'm being chased by creditors. Why do I need to leave behind my nice home and run away.

372
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,780
Your heart must be made of steel.

373
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,330
Seeing as how you keep making excuses.

374
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,650
So ... stop doing this.

375
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,030
You did everything you could.

376
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:54,530
You can't disappoint  all the people who depend on you.

377
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:02,490
You'll be able to take Taeyang Group farther than even your father and grandfather.

378
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,380
I guarantee that.

379
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,160
You're confident and smart.

380
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,240
I'll admit, you're a bit rough around the edges,

381
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,710
but you have a lot more positive traits.

382
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,290
And also ...

383
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:24,570
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

384
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:28,980
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

385
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:39,210
♫  Because I'm sorry for loving you, I can't let you go  ♫

386
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,790
It will pass quickly.

387
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,390
And the wounds will heal soon.

388
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,860
You're going to get through this.

389
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,220
I'll be rooting for you wherever you go.

390
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,640
I don't want to cry.

391
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:19,320
I want the last memory you have of me, to be of me smiling.

392
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:25,900
♫  As if I could reach you in the corner of my eye  ♫

393
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:31,560
♫  I keep thinking of you so I stop in place  ♫

394
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:39,790
♫  After a long time, I call out to you in tears  ♫

395
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,990
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

396
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,360
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

397
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:54,090
♫  What if I can't hold back any longer?  ♫

398
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:58,110
♫  There are words I didn't get a chance to say  ♫

399
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:02,530
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm thankful  ♫

400
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,760
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm sorry  ♫

401
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,100
♫  The words I love you  ♫

402
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,610
♫  Even though it hurts  ♫

403
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:17,720
♫  I kept hoping  ♫ 
I'm sorry ... for not keeping my promise.

404
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,530
I don't think I was meant to be the owner of this bracelet.

405
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,180
I'll return it to you.

406
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,310
♫  What if I want to hug you?  ♫

407
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:40,030
♫  What if I can't hold back any longer?  ♫

408
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,930

409
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:48,290
♫  Words that remain in my heart  ♫

00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:54,400

00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,000
♫  I am in love with you  ♫

412
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,070
So that girl isn't the one either?

413
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,170
I've been waiting 100 years for her.

414
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,160
What brings you all the way here?

415
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,320
 Lease Agreement

416
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,670
What? Are you returning this to save your pride?

417
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,380
If it was for money, I did whatever it took.

418
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,490
I threw away my pride a long time ago.

419
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:31,650
If I cared about my pride, I would never have acted like a knock-off to begin with.

420
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:36,890
I don't want you to feel content.

421
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:43,290
You gave me this restaurant so I could live being grateful towards you.

422
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,810
Do you think this would make me feel guilty?

423
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:56,770
You wouldn't even blink an eye. But if I continue living there,

424
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:01,510
it would make me no different than you.

425
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,840
If you don't want it, I won't stop you.

426
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,200
Don't say anything to Yi Hyeon.

427
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,690
I'll see him one last time once he's discharged, then leave.

428
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,900
 Taeyang Group CEO Choi Kang Ju Wedding Announcement Press Conference

429
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,310
You finally got what you wanted. No ...

430
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:53,710
You didn't earn it, you stole it.

431
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,890
I can't bring myself to congratulate you.

432
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:02,410
It doesn't matter. I didn't start this to be acknowledged by you.

433
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:09,260
That position you got from stepping on someone else's back, how long do you think you can keep it?

434
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,580
Don't worry. Even if I don't try, Mother,  Kang Ju,

435
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,420
there are plenty of people to protect my position.

436
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,740
You want to return to Namhae? What are you talking about?

437
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,050
The restaurant is doing well and we even have more regular customers.

438
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,180
So why all of a sudden?

439
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,990
Grandma, truthfully ...

440
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:55,200
I didn't earn this restaurant

441
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,680
through my own hard work and sweat.

442
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,960
I lied to myself and others to get it.

443
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,340
Up to now, you and I have done well on our own.

444
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:20,220
Mom and Dad always told me to live an honest life. I had forgotten that.

445
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,300
I shouldn't do this.

446
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,800
I hope you understand.

447
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,420
I don't know what happened,

448
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,300
but I'm always on your side.

449
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:40,910
If you say it's right, it's right. And if you say it's wrong, it's wrong.

450
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,100
I'm sorry, Grandma.

451
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,410
You have nothing to be sorry about. It'll be nice to return to Namhae.

452
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:55,790
I can see the ocean all I want. I can see my neighborhood friends all I want.

453
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,880
It's okay.

454
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,320
Grandma.

455
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,710
Good. You made the right choice.You're back to your old self.

456
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:18,070
Thank you for understanding, Jin Ju.

457
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:22,810
- When are you leaving? 
 - When Yi Hyeon gets discharged.

458
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:28,500
I haven't told him yet. I told Grandma not to say anything either.

459
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,560
I'll tell him once he gets discharged.

460
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,050
But once you leave ... I'm going to miss you.

461
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,700
 Bride of the Century

462
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:51,240
