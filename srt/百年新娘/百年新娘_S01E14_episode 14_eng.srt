1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,200
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,530

3
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,060
 That diary ... this is the very last page.

4
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:02,100
 After that day, in my heart...

5
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,540
 I've been living with this heavy burden.

6
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,400
 I did something a person shouldn't have.

7
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,330
 I committed a sin that cannot be forgiven.

8
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,220
 Even if I die, I'll accept my punishment.

9
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,020
 The reason I'm telling you

10
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,620
 all of this is because

11
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,060
 Even if you don't say anything, I know.

12
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,420
 I'll stay by Kang Ju's side.

13
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,960
 I won't leave him.

14
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,640
 Kang Ju...

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,760
 To his mother...

16
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,140
 Make sure she doesn't know.

17
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,130
 If she finds out,

18
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,980
 confusion and pain that she won't be able to stop, will follow her.

19
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,170
 Can you promise me?

20
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,590
The only mistake you and I made,

21
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,900
is completely believing in the household's curse.

22
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,300
Fortunately, I was given a chance to overcome my mistake.

23
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,410
Thanks to your mother.

24
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:10,290
If the world find out the truth, not only will your household be ruined,

25
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,690
but the future of Taeyang Group will also be uncertain.

26
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,650
Ah. I thought you'd be curious...

27
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,370
why Doo Rim came back safely.

28
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,890
I also don't want things to get noisy.

29
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,020
It's over if we break off this marriage.

30
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:56,030
You know well that you have more to lose than we do.

31
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,420
You also know well that this isn't something you should drag on for long.

32
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,410
I'll give you time until tomorrow.

33
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,120
I feel like we just went through a bad storm.

34
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,310
We overcame a huge wave today, didn't we?

35
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,880
I told you, didn't I? My mom will get over her anger quickly.

36
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,050
To be honest, I'm more worried about your older brother.

37
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,410
You know he's surprisingly scary, don't you?

38
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,140
My brother is?

39
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,220
Are all older brothers like that?

40
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:08,080
Do they see all men who want to take their younger sister away as thieves?

41
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,230
Sometimes when I see him, he seems like a beast who wants to capture me and eat me.

42
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,350
To your older brother... that's not right.

43
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,370
I should call him brother-in-law now.

44
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,910
Tell him let's have a drink sometime.

45
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,020
Okay.

46
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,300
Your ugly hands became silky hands.

47
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,580
It's because I received a manicure at the nail salon.

48
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,050
Your parents are probably waiting. You should get going.

49
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,060
You didn't sleep a wink at the villa yesterday, did you?

50
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,200
Don't worry about anything now and sleep well.

51
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,010
You too.

52
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,870
I'll go now.

53
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,790
Don't come out. It's very cold outside.

54
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,270
Go in.

55
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,510
Doo Rim!

56
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,850
What happened?

57
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,480
What about the Director?

58
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,710
Jin Ju...

59
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,660
Doctor! How is he?

60
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,590
We tried our best but... we must monitor the results for know.

61
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,110
Jin Ju...

62
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,740
what's going to happen to him?

63
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:17,010
Because of me... because of me!

64
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,040
What do we do?

65
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,000
What do we do?

66
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,560
 That a curse fell on the household wasn't true.

67
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,820
 All of this was just a test to find true love.

68
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,290
 Now, just to be by that person's side...

69
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,320
 I've become the world's happiest bride.

70
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,340
 If the world finds out this truth,

71
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,420
 Not only will your household be ruined, but the future of Taeyang Group will also be uncertain.

72
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,720
Young Master, are you just getting home?

73
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,870
Aigoo, Young Master. Congratulations.

74
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,960
You must have been suffering a lot.

75
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,650
I'm more excited than when our Mi Soon got married.

76
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,910
Courage, determination, perseverence.

77
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,500
You're very cool. You're the best!

78
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,690
Why are you like this?

79
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,120
An ill-fated love that death can't even tear apart.

80
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,280
Aigoo, so romantic!

81
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,060
Go on in. The president is waiting.

82
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,790
Listen to me.

83
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,880
I've come back, Father.

84
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,520
Thank you for trusting me.

85
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,940
You've done well.

86
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,000
There are so many stars.

87
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,460
There are many stars.

88
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,620
Oppa did? Where and how much is he hurt?

89
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,610
- Where's the hospital?
- I told you Doo Rim is there.

90
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,030
There's no good for you two to run into each other.

91
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,230
Mom!

92
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,550
Yi Hyeon did this. Don't start to waver.

93
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,220
In order to do great things, small sacrifices must be made.

94
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,850
All that's left is for Kang Ju's mother to wave her white flag and surrender.

95
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,850
Then everything will be over.

96
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,730
Oppa.

97
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,050
How can you just sleep like this?

98
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,820
Please open your eyes.

99
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,670
I want to say...

100
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,340
so much to you.

101
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,750
There's so much ...

102
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,150
that I want to say,

103
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,100
I didn't know where to start.

104
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,480
Oppa.

105
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,450
Yi Hyeon.

106
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,010
I thought you would make the right decision.

107
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,880
Please publicly acknowledge Yi Gyeong as the daughter-in-law of Taeyang Group.

108
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,170
Whether you announce the marriage or hold a press conference,

109
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,030
However you would like to, I would just like it if you made a formal announcement as soon as possible.

110
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,390
Of course I should do that. However, as you know,

111
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:59,340
Kang Ju's grandmother is very ill so we have a lot on our minds right now.

112
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,290
If you wait a bit more, I will announce it publicly.

113
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,760
It's not that I don't trust you, but the truth that I hold...

114
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,880
is a lot more dangerous than the truth you hold.

115
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,130
You know that well, don't you?

116
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,020
Normally in a deal, the side that has a lot to lose,

117
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,100
is the side that also has a lot to endure.

118
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,110
Tell me what you want.

119
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:44,770
I'll need you to hand over all the Ohsung Construction stocks you own.

120
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:50,050
And please sign over your Taeyang Group holdings to Yi Gyeong.

121
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,900
You need to show at least that much so that I believe you are accepting my child as your daughter-in-law.

122
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,810
That's the only way I could trust you, don't you think?

123
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,090
Lastly, the funds you offered to invest in Ohsung Construction,

124
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,700
you'll need to deposit that also.

125
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,390
Also, regarding Doo Rim...

126
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,690
Making sure she no longer lingers in Kang Ju's life,

127
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,580
I trust that you will take care of that.

128
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,530
Just eat one spoonful.

129
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,350
You haven't slept or eaten.

130
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,080
What are you going to do if you collapse too?

131
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,670
- What about Grandmother? 
 - Don't worry.

132
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,880
I told her the Director was hurt at a construction site,

133
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,760
and that you came up from Namhae to help take care of him.

134
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,450
Quickly eat.

135
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:19,020
You have to eat so you can have strength. And you have to have strength so you can take care of  him.

136
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,270
Oppa. Oppa! Yi Hyeon!

137
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,420
Oppa! Jin Ju, call the doctor! Quickly!

138
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,160
Oppa! Oppa! What am I supposed to do? Oppa!

139
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,270
Oppa, come to your senses!

140
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,910
Doctor! Quickly!

141
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,670
Doctor, is he going to be alright?

142
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,370
He's getting the treatment he needs so don't worry.

143
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,500
Oppa. Yi Hyeon Oppa.

144
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,500
I was so interested in what was on the outside, I failed to look beyond that.

145
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,910
I'm at an age when I should be looking at the horizon, but I've been going around blind.

146
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,480
I've lived a foolish life too.

147
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Who should I blame now?

148
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:37,040
I loathe and detest myself for believing in such foolish rumors.

149
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,720
Today will be the last time you and I are facing each other like this.

150
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,480
I won't speak for long.

151
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,600
Don't appear in front of Kang Ju. As if you're dead, live quietly without making a sound.

152
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,980
In return, I'll guarantee the safety of your life.

153
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,500
Yi Gyeong's side will not be able to hurt you anymore.

154
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,830
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

155
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,040
But the people who made  Oppa Yi Hyeon like that... I can't forgive them.

156
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:27,950
Forgiveness is something that someone with power gives to someone weak.

157
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,560
Do you think you have that kind of power?

158
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,490
I don't understand. Why are you watching silently?

159
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,370
It's not because I'm being greedy.

160
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,630
In the beginning, I wanted to be by his side so I tried to reveal the truth.

161
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:57,080
But not anymore. For him, you shouldn't be like this!

162
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,330
I don't possess the power to forgive them.

163
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,650
That's the reason.

164
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,560
I don't know what happened but that's not possible.

165
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,560
If you committed a sin, it's right that you receive punishment. I'll receive that punishment too.

166
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,420
- If not now, there won't be any other opportunity. 
 - In your position,

167
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,570
do you think you're worthy of being part of Taeyang Group's family?

168
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,940
Aren't you trying to fulfill your own desires by telling me you'll take all of the punishment?

169
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,500
I told you. It's not because I want Kang Ju!

170
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,770
You and Kang Ju. I don't want you both getting involved in any way.

171
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,520
You two live in completely different worlds.

172
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,720
You cannot mix together and you shouldn't.

173
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,830
I... didn't like him because he's the heir.

174
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,880
Even if he was just an ordinary person...

175
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,660
If he was... I thought he could be mine.

176
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:24,170
Until now, I've never regretted that I was born by my parents.

177
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,520
But since Kang Ju has entered my heart...

178
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,430
If I was born as a woman who matched him well...

179
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:41,490
that would've been great. I've thought like that.

180
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,450
But now... I'm so sorry to my parents.

181
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,060
That I thought that for even a moment.

182
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,280
I'm asking you a favor.

183
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,650
If you appear in front of Kang Ju, he will fall into pain.

184
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,930
Disappear. Like someone who never existed in the first place.

185
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,100
That's the way for Kang Ju.

186
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,930
Why did you do that, Mom?

187
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,910
For my sake... you shouldn't have done that.

188
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:57,680
Because of me, you've become a sinner. How can I live?

189
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,820
I didn't want to embarrass you. I wanted to be a good daughter.

190
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,240
But what is this...

191
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,430
I'm a sinner who has dirtied your life.

192
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,110
 I'm sorry, Myeong Hui.

193
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,020
 It's all my fault.

194
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:49,260
 I've made you like this.

195
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,750
 For having you believe in that family's curse...

196
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,310
 It's all my fault.

197
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,610
 This foolish and thoughtless mother of yours...

198
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,330
 Please forgive me.

199
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,080
Mother! I can't accept this.

200
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,520
How could you do this?

201
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,860
I'm sorry, Ru Mi.

202
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,900
What's the reason? Why are you acknowledging Yi Gyeong?

203
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,650
I don't understand at all.

204
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,210
Did someone find out your weakness?

205
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,870
If not, then you have no reason to do this.

206
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:56,190
Tell me. I have to know too. I have the right to!

207
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,500
I already met with Yi Gyeong's mother. It's a done deal. You should stop interfering now.

208
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:06,140
If you don't tell me, I'll just have to personally find Yi Gyeong's mother and hear it.

209
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,410
You won't be able to hear anything even if you go find her.

210
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,530
Mother!

211
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,710
For our household...

212
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,680
Think you're doing this for Kang Ju.

213
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:21,600
If you can't, I can tell Kang Ju everything.

214
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:28,300
I was always watching over you as my daughter-in-law.

215
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,030
I thought of you as my only daughter-in-law.

216
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:39,130
The minute you open your mouth, you and I become enemies.

217
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,090
Do you want to leave me as your enemy?

218
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,910
Don't skip meals and make sure sure you take care of yourself.

219
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,480
- You're the caretaker so you need to stay strong. 
 - Don't worry Grandma.

220
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,620
Director Jang is not someone who'll go down so easily.

221
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,260
He'll gather his strength and wake up before you know it.

222
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,060
Of course. He's such a strong person.

223
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:15,670
- I'll be back. Don't come out, Grandma. 
 - Okay. Go on.

224
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,300
I don't think she's a ghost. She's definitely a living person.

225
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,220
What happened?

226
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,480
Take care of Yi Hyeon.

227
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,790
I think who he needs right now isn't us but you.

228
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:59,090
If you want to, you can leave far away with him.

229
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,990
I can also look into what can help with his treatment.

230
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,750
Don't pretend that you're doing this for him.

231
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,760
You just want to clean me up so I won't appear before you.

232
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:19,140
Are you thinking it's because of me that he became that way?

233
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,290
If you didn't get greedy, he wouldn't turn out like this.

234
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,500
That's right.

235
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,290
I was being selfish and wanted Kang Ju and then this happened.

236
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,780
I may be paying the price for my greed right now.

237
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,490
Realizing how agonizing this reality I have to live in is...

238
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,240
What's scarier than the household's curse...

239
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,240
People who attack at any opportunity they get, like starving beasts.

240
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,800
People who wear the mask of a human but are not even human.

241
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,270
Keep one thing in mind.

242
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:11,910
If you decide something else, I can't guarantee your Grandmother and your friend Jin Ju's safety.

243
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,390
This makes me think that you're really pitiful.

244
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,900
Even throwing away your son...

245
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:29,260
Even hurting someone's life... what do you gain?

246
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,090
You won't be able to understand.

247
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,860
Since you lived in a different world than us.

248
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,880
If this is your world that you guys talk about,

249
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,380
then even if you offered me loads of money, I don't want to be a part of it.

250
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,440
You may not like me getting mixed up in your world, but I don't like it either.

251
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,250
I hate getting involved with you people. But I still won't forgive you.

252
00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,190
I can't even forgive myself for only thinking about what I wanted,

253
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,810
so how could I forgive you?

254
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:12,180
Until I can forgive myself, I'll live while repaying my debt to Yi Hyeon.

255
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,420
Even if I can't repay it all for my whole life.

256
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:45,110
Ah, about your brother. He isn't picking up my calls. Is he really busy?

257
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,670
Ah. Did I not tell you?

258
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,540
He got a complaint from a construction site in Dubai.

259
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,070
He left for Dubai the day before yesterday.

260
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,940
It would have been nice to see him. It must be taking long since it's a trip abroad.

261
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:09,460
Yes. He did mention that he wants to get drinks when he gets back.

262
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,380
 That's right.

263
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,210
 My gaze...

264
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,000
 Voice...

265
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,920
 The sound of my breath...

266
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,080
 Don't remember anything.

267
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:58,280
 As long as you can smile happily next to someone who isn't me, that's enough.

268
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,090
 Live well. Goodbye.

269
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,570
Its been a while, Ru Mi.

270
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:45,160
Sure. It must have been a while since you've seen me but I can't say the same for myself.

271
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,170
I sent my congratulations to him, so pass.

272
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:56,640
Your face has brightened up. You look happy.

273
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,710
Thank you.

274
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,610
But why do I not see the ring? Wasn't it a couple ring?

275
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,830
Only you're wearing it.

276
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:16,070
Did you put it on another girl's hand, perhaps?

277
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:24,430
I'm just kidding. What kind of man doesn't recognize his own woman?

278
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,170
Sir, I'll leave the files for your approval on your desk.

279
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,080
The ring... what happened?

280
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,980
About that...

281
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,740
You didn't go around pretending to be single, did you?

282
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,740
I'm sorry. I forgot it and left without it.

283
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:22,560
You're suspicious nowadays. Even at the villa, you seemed like someone who had something to say but didn't.

284
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,440
What was it you were going to say?

285
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:36,700
- It's nothing. 
 - Yeah right. You were really serious back then.

286
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:45,720
You're not really hiding another man somewhere, are you?

287
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,050
Let's stop, Choi Kang Ju.

288
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:54,630
Let's go now. Mother and Father must be waiting.

289
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,700
- Grandmother. I'm here. 
 - Ah, you're back.

290
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,960
Why don't you have any energy? Are you sick anywhere?

291
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,190
What? No. I'm just tired.

292
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,420
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

293
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,810
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

294
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:58,350
♫  Because I'm sorry for loving you  ♫

295
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:04,200
♫  I can't let you go  ♫

296
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:23,290
♫  Even I try to see you I can't see you  ♫

297
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:30,370
♫  As if  I could reach you in the corner of my eye   ♫

298
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:37,090
♫   I keep thinking of you so I stop in place  ♫

299
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:42,040
♫  After a long time passes   ♫

300
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,630
♫  I call out to you in tears  ♫

301
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:52,730
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you?   ♫

302
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:57,450
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

303
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:03,100
♫   What if I can't hold back any longer?  ♫

304
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,040
♫  There are words I didn't get a chance to say.  ♫

305
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,580
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm thankful,  ♫

306
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,770
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm still sorry.  ♫

307
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:22,450
♫   The words I love you  ♫

308
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,280
This is so tasty. It's nice and tender.

309
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,600
Where is this from? I'll have to order from here again.

310
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:44,050
What brings you here again?

311
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,930
You're blessed with so much food.

312
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:54,780
No one's even offered up any food for me in over 100 years.

313
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,910
Then, at least this...

314
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:04,830
Are you mocking me right now? How can I accepted tainted human food?

315
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:10,580
I must have been mistaken for a moment. I've committed a sin worthy of death.

316
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:16,260
I don't think anyone will be offering me any food this year either.

317
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,830
In the end, that child was still unable to overcome her obstacles.

318
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:29,290
That... since you've mentioned it, I'm going to ask you one thing.

319
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:34,270
That child... didn't you say something bad would happen to her?

320
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:39,080
But... she's perfectly fine and alive!

321
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,540
And how could you give me false information?

322
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,800
- Are you going to take responsibility if I go bankrupt? 
 - You fool!

323
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Are you trying to start a fight with me? If you don't like it, I can always go somewhere else.

324
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,030
No. If you just go like this, then what do I do?

325
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,790
I was wrong. I'm very sorry.

326
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,250
You haven't abandoned, have you?

327
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,790
You need to come back, okay?

328
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:21,230
- Father, do you like it?
 - Of course I do.

329
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:26,310
I can just wear it like this and go for walks.

330
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,060
- Please invite me along when you go on your next walk Father. 
 - I'd like that.

331
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,500
If there's someone to talk to, then I won't be bored.

332
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,980
Mother, you should open yours too. Yi Gyeong walked three laps around the department store looking for your gift.

333
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,240
- And I got dragged around for 2 hours too. 
 - Yes, let's see it.

334
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,290
Kang Ju helped me pick it out.

335
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,870
He said you like scarves.

336
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,810
Try it on Mother.

337
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,870
Later.

338
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,430
- You should try it on. 
 - I said later.

339
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:39,350
Mother, don't hate me too much.

340
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:46,610
I don't expect us to get along. But don't turn your back on me.

341
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,960
Then things will get difficult for both of us.

342
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,240
So?

343
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,900
Grandmother didn't want things to be harder for you either.

344
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,920
She did what she could for you.

345
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,910
And you did as well.

346
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,530
In order to find a bettter match for Kang Ju,

347
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,530
you played with my life.

348
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:21,250
And you are paying the price for that now.

349
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,540
When did you start fencing?

350
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,180
I learned it for fun in elementary school.

351
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,000
 Who are you?

352
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,680
Why are you laughing?

353
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:14,500
Do you remember that time? You were a one woman show, having fun all by yourself.

354
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:20,630
It's a shame I was the only one to see it.

355
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,490
Let's stop talking about the past.

356
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,250
Makes sense. You probably don't want to remember those times.

357
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,900
Yes, I don't remember anything.

358
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,590
Is that so? Then should I help you remember?

359
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:46,050
- What are you doing? 
 - You still don't remember?

360
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,000
What are you doing?

361
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,200
Shall I close the door again?

362
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,690
- What is it? 
 - Ah yes, dinner is ready.

363
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,460
Then ...

364
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,470
Let's go now.

365
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,750
Don't you want a little snack?

366
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,040
Let's get a bowl of udon.

367
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,150
Please enjoy.

368
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,840
You know how to eat these things?

369
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,270
Have some.

370
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:17,900
I can't eat blood sausage. The smell makes my head hurt.

371
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,930
You used to go crazy for blood sausage.

372
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:25,770
If you don't want any, then fine. I'll eat it all.

373
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,510
Do you remember this place?

374
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,130
Of all the surprising things you've done, this was the best.

375
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,300
this was the best.

376
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,720
You wore that fur coat that looked like

377
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,540
it could keep you warm in Antarctica.

378
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,540
 My friends and I were doing cosplay.

379
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,700
 You know cosplay, right? How do I look? Don't I look sexy?

380
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,920
You know I get cold easily.

381
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,580
I remember it was really cold that night.

382
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:28,130
And ... you had something weird on your head.

383
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:37,030
Oh, that hat? My mom bought it for me as a gift when I graduated.

384
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,490
It's something I cherish.

385
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:49,680
And you were too afraid you'd get your clothes dirty so you didn't even eat the cake I bought you.

386
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,950
I bought an organic cake especially for you.

387
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:57,550
 It's delicious. It's melting in my mouth.

388
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,480
 Have a taste.

389
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,380
How could I eat something like that here?

390
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,600
Since you bought it for me, I took it home and ate it.

391
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,020
Don't worry.

392
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,060
Let's go now.

393
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:26,670
Last thing. There's one more important thing left.

394
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,100
What?

395
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,200
Who ...

396
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,100
are you ?

397
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:09,850
Why are you being like this all of a sudden? Stop playing around.

398
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,120
You're not the Jang Yi Gyeong I know.

399
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,450
You got everything wrong.

400
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:22,430
Everything you said doesn't match what I remember.

401
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:26,600
If I'm not Jang Yi Gyeong, then who am I?

402
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,300
Speaking of which, you're like a different person to me.

403
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,590
You're not the Kang Ju I know.

404
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,940
We barely got through all those obstacles to get to where we are.

405
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,530
Now that things have settled down, have you changed your mind?

406
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:02,050
You're not having second thoughts, are you?

407
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,850
I'm really disappointed.

408
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,630
Let's just go.

409
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:29,390
Even if Kang Ju has caught on, he'll never be able to find Doo Rim.

410
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:33,110
And what if he does find her?

411
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,880
There's nothing to be afraid of.

412
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,680
Do you think love lasts forever?

413
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,150
There's nothing more weak and fickle as the human heart.

414
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:49,630
If he sees Doo Rim for who she really is,

415
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,860
then do you think Kang Ju will be any different?

416
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,490
Doo Rim. We're in trouble.

417
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,350
What happened?

418
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,800
She already knew everything and found us.

419
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,870
Instead of my friend Jang Yi Gyeong,

420
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:26,370
should I call you Na Doo Rim.

421
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,030
How did you know about this place?

422
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:39,640
I'm the first person who found out about you.

423
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,430
And I was the first person to tell Kang Ju's mother.

424
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:48,620
In the end, you've been caught by me.

425
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:55,710
You can also say I was the one who saved you from getting killed.

426
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:01,010
If they were even a minute late, you wouldn't be sitting here right now.

427
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,480
Are you here because you want me to thank you?

428
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:11,090
How does it feel not having to cosplay as a rich girl and return to your rightful place?

429
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,390
It's not bad. It's familiar and comfortable.

430
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,460
Why did you give up ... on Kang Ju?

431
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,940
You even risked your life, so why?

432
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,480
Were you not serious?

433
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,350
Even if I can't, shouldn't you tell him?

434
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,890
If it were me, I wouldn't have done that.

435
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,020
I even tried to take something I couldn't reach.

436
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,750
But you, you had it all in the palm of your hands but you gave it up.

437
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,130
I wanted him too.

438
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:01,960
I didn't want anyone else to take him.

439
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,530
Because he was someone I risked my life to protect.

440
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:11,510
But as my greed grew, my fear grew with it.

441
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:17,920
As my fear grew, my greed became bigger and bigger so I couldn't see.

442
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,830
And because of my greed, I didn't even know

443
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:28,290
that the person closest to me was getting hurt and in pain.

444
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,660
I want to think love isn't just holding onto the person.

445
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,950
I have no choice but to let go.

446
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:45,070
Letting go for the sake of that person has to be love as well.

447
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,180
You're not going to regret it?

448
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:57,890
I may regret it all of my life.

449
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:03,540
It's probably how I'm going to pay for my greed.

450
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:08,050
If Kang Ju somehow finds out about you—

451
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:12,330
Pretend like you don't know. Please.

452
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:18,610
Don't let him know that I was even by his side for a brief moment.

453
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,840
If he finds out, he'll be in pain.

454
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,390
I don't care if I get hurt.

455
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,560
But because of me ...

456
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,460
I don't want anyone else to get hurt anymore.

457
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:02,760
Why is the President's fiancée here?

458
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,890
When did you arrive?

459
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,180
- Were you drinking? 
 - Yes. We had a company dinner tonight.

460
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,850
Oh, that was Team Leader Lee  just now wasn't it?

461
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:28,170
Yes. She was sorry she couldn't come by during the grand opening so she just stopped by for a moment.

462
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:34,740
- You seem really drunk. Why did you come here instead of going home? 
 - I must be drunk.

463
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:41,390
Inside the restaurant, there's someone who look's just like the President's fiancée.

464
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:46,870
You must really be drunk. Why would the President's fiancée be here?

465
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:50,900
This won't do. Let's get some medicine to sober you up a bit before you go home.

466
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,740
There's a pharmacy right over there. Let's go.

467
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,430
Okay.

468
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,270
What did you want to talk about?

469
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:13,340
You know, right? The woman I gave the ring to.

470
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:18,000
Tell me. Please.

471
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,840
You found out sooner than I thought.

472
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,560
I knew you would find out eventually.

473
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:41,150
Why do I have the ring that should be on Yi Gyeong's hand?

474
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,360
It's exactly what you're thinking.

475
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:49,340
If you didn't put it on a different woman's finger, then there's no way it would be in my hand.

476
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,890
The person you gave this ring to,

477
00:51:54,890 --> 00:52:00,960
would you believe me if I said it wasn't Yi Gyeong but a knock off?

478
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:09,300
I probably don't have to tell you the reason for all of this is because of the curse on your family.

479
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,850
And the fact I know all this means

480
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:18,000
the people around you already know.

481
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,440
Then ...

482
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,210
my mother too?

483
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:29,850
It takes two cymbals to make a sound. No one wants you to know.

484
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:34,710
Because the moment you find out, Pandora's box will be opened.

485
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:39,290
Where is she right now? The woman I gave this ring to.

486
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:46,090
She went back to her rightful place after she finished the role given to her.

487
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:51,560
Everyone got what they needed and went back to their lives like nothing happened.

488
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,040
If you keep digging, then a lot of people will suffer.

489
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,370
You'll probably suffer the most.

490
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:05,400
Do you still want to find her?

491
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,200
I asked you where she is.

492
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,070
This is everything I can tell you. I don't know what will happen beyond this.

493
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:16,180
The rest is for you to figure out.

494
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,900
You'll have to act quietly.

495
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:27,900
Because if anyone finds out your searching, they'll make sure you never find her.

496
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,650
 The person you are trying to reach ...

497
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,620
President, I brought you something to eat.

498
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:57,240
- This is ... 
 - I brought it from Oh Jin Ju's restaurant.

499
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,900
It tastes pretty good.

500
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:07,230
  - Miss Jin Ju. 
 - Yes. I will bring water.

501
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,490
 - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay.

502
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,620
  Oh Jin Ju.

503
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,420
 Then, what will happen to Jin Ju?

504
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,940
 Even after all that, you're still worried about Jin Ju?

505
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,320
 Jin Ju must have been in a tight spot to do that.

506
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,070
 Who is Jin Ju to you? Why do you keep protecting her?

507
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,270
 Why are you getting mad?

508
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:45,110
Where is Oh Jin Ju's restaurant?

509
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:51,320
Did you want to try it out too? Team Leader Lee was also there not too long ago.

510
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:15,320
 Taste Doo Rim

511
00:56:54,690 --> 00:57:00,350
♫  Without you I can't live. I really can't live. ♫

512
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:04,940
♫ You are my battery. ♫

513
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,670

514
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,540
 Bride of the Century
