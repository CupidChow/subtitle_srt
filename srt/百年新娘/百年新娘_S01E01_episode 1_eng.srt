1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,320
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,720

3
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,100
Such a pretty girl. She's like an angel who came down from heaven.

4
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,390
It's too bad that even if she is a flower, she can't ever bloom.

5
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,550
Everyone knows that.

6
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:02,020
She was married off quickly to relieve the family's poverty.

7
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,420
Then, is what they say true?

8
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,430
If it weren't would it make sense for our  young master

9
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,490
to marry the daughter of a poor tenant farmer farming a palm sized parcel?

10
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,080
That's right. Because of the rumor the  daughter is

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,770
- marrying the son of a bank president in Seoul.  
 - That's terrifying.

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,500
- Then that young bride will not survive the first night? 
 - Yes!

13
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,830
Do you also believe that rumor?

14
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,920
The first wife of the first son of our house is sacrificed on the first night

15
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,360
to the ghost who protects this house.

16
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,290
Do you believe in such a ghost?

17
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,820
Of course.

18
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,500
That old maidservant saw it with her own eyes!

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,900
- Really? 
- Yes!

20
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,620
The granny had to use the bathroom at night so she went to the outhouse.

21
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,290
Some young-looking woman she's never seen before sat in the courtyard like it's her own house.

22
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,380
There's no way a guest would come at night so she asked who she was.

23
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,860
"I'm the owner of this house! Don't you even recognize the house owner?"

24
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,990
She shouted!

25
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,070
Then she disappeared like smoke in front of her eyes.

26
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,890
Yea. Not just one or two people have seen her either.

27
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,660
Her body is shaped like an hourglass.

28
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,790
White and pretty like gourd flowers under the moonlight.

29
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,520
Before the pure and chaste bride can consummate,

30
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,080
she sucks up her energy to retain her ten thousand year youth.

31
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,130
Oh my, that's why she was so young. No wonder.

32
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,010
What are you all doing?

33
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,880
Oh my. Madam.

34
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,450
It's getting late so you all should go back.

35
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,820
At once.

36
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,210
Yes, ma'am.

37
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,540
Son-in-law Jang, let no one in the annex after this hour.

38
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,700
- Do you understand? 
- Yes, I understand.

39
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,250
 Celestial Kirin Rides on Northern Wind 
 (TN: Kirin -- a mythical hooved chimerical creature)

40
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,340
Miss!

41
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,440
Miss?

42
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,770
Miss!

43
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,100
Miss!

44
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,040
Miss!

45
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,320
Alright!

46
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,180
What did we catch?

47
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,350
What is that girl ...

48
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,200
Is she crazy?

49
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,330
Hello? Wake up. Hello?

50
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,560
Can you breathe?

51
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,530
Are you alright?

52
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,460
If you were going to save me, you should've saved me sooner. I almost died for real!

53
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,990
Oh, so salty.

54
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,820
Look here ...

55
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,190
That damn bastard!

56
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,500
He said he would love me until death. How ...

57
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,450
If I had the body of a grade-schooler like you, I wouldn't feel so wronged.

58
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,460
But to leave a girl like me to cheat with some other wench, does that make sense?

59
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,560
Body of a grade-schooler?

60
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,150
You should be thanking me now. Is that something you say to someone who saved your life?

61
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,450
How do I have a little girl's body? Huh, huh?

62
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,780
Jeez!

63
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,620
It's because this is a rubber suit.

64
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,730
You'd be shocked once I take this off. It's even better than a 3D movie.

65
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,150
You were almost fish food so I swam faster than Park Tae Hwan ( T.N. Olympic gold medal swimmer )

66
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,960
and barely saved you.

67
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,130
So why did you save me, huh?

68
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,730
What does that petty love mean anyway?

69
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,720
No one would be alive if everyone went to die after breaking up.

70
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,660
Do you know what love is? You've never been in love, right?

71
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,840
You're forever single. With a wall around your heart.

72
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,610
Well, that's . . .

73
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,360
What a pity, to have never loved at your age.

74
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,400
This is all I have to give you.

75
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,500
These are lucky rocks that court love.

76
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,220
Don't belittle this. If you put this on, it will ward off evil and lots of good things will happen to you.

77
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,770
What a relief.

78
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,420
These are brand new merchandise.

79
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,100
If you try hard from now on, you should spare yourself from dying a virgin.

80
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,400
Then, good luck.

81
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,470
What the ...

82
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,750
Hey!

83
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,330
Doo Rim!

84
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,060
Granny!

85
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,560
- Come eat! 
 - Okay.

86
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,440
♫ Fill me with love  ♫

87
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,970
♫ The battery of love is done ♫

88
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,720
♫ Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, please don't do this ♫

89
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,030
♫ A woman's heart is a reed ♫

90
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,970
Here you go. Fish so good you won't even notice if the person eating with you dies. Enjoy.

91
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,920
- Thanks. 
 - Doo Rim, delivery.

92
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,250
Okay.

93
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,160
Hey, it's cold. Put this on.

94
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,340
Okay.

95
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,090
There you go.

96
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,090
I'll be right back.

97
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,630
- Drive safely. 
 - Okay.

98
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,160
- Over here.
 - Yes, I'll be right there.

99
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,090
We're barely reaching 50% completion.

100
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,400
And the workers are not being paid on time, so they're refusing to work.

101
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,800
If this keeps up, the construction may stop soon.

102
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,600
We should be receiving fund from Taeyang Group soon.

103
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,930
Until then, please try to motivate the workers.

104
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,180
Yes.

105
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,100
Yes, Yi Kyeong.

106
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,500
Yeah. I'm on my way to the airport now.

107
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,680
Oppa, seriously.

108
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,950
Have you ever seen me make a mistake? Don't worry. You know me.

109
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,260
It's been a long time so it may be awkward but try to lighten up the mood.

110
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,630
Yeah.

111
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,770
What is this?

112
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,540
Watch out!

113
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,280
Are you okay?

114
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,630
You must have been really shocked.

115
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,810
Can you see how many fingers I have up?

116
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,450
I'm okay.

117
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,860
That could have been really bad.

118
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,830
Are you okay?

119
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,530
You didn't injure your head? Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

120
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,540
Oh, I'm okay.

121
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,160
I'm an expert in martial arts.

122
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,860
My specialty is breaking boards with this head.

123
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,240
I can break at least 10 boards without a problem.

124
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,410
But you never know so you should still stop by the hospital.

125
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,320
If there's anything wrong, just contact me at this number.

126
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,970
I'm really okay.

127
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,400
Hey, over here.

128
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,360
I'll be going now.

129
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,670
Yes, I'm here,  Ahjussi!

130
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,800
 Oppa, what's wrong? You just hung up on me.

131
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,220
Oh, sorry.

132
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,740
You saw someone who looked like me?

133
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,590
Oh my, is there a birth secret I don't know about?

134
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:43,460
Like a twin sister who was separated when I was a baby.

135
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,870
Oppa, your head is really okay, right?

136
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,980
Nothing happened after getting hit in the head with a brick, right?

137
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,280
Okay, I understand. I'll leave early.

138
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,820
- She doesn't believe me. 
 - Manager, let's go eat. We already made a reservation.

139
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,790
- Let's just eat here. 
 - Pardon?

140
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,900
- Enjoy! 
 - Thanks.

141
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,060
Will it be okay if I joined you?

142
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,660
They say contruction site food is like sand.

143
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,980
Can someone so high up eat that kind of food?

144
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,890
Manager, just sit with us.

145
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,420
- Pour the drinks. 
 - Oh, I'll pour it for you.

146
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,600
By the end of the month, you'll receive your paychecks including all the backed up pay.

147
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,150
So you don't have to worry.

148
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,990
- Are you sure? 
 - I'm positive.

149
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,600
Please, have some.

150
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,770
That's what I'm saying.

151
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,210
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

152
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,100
Give him a lot.

153
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,930
I thought you were a weakling but you're a real man.

154
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,690
Have some.

155
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,730
It's him!

156
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,580
Welcome back Kang Ju.

157
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,820
Thank you.

158
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,860
Why is studying abroad such a big deal?

159
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,290
That welcome was too much of a fuss.

160
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,120
Manager Lee, did you prepare what I asked?

161
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,490
Here you go.

162
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,960
Try it on.

163
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,380
Is that for me?

164
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,660
I didn't think you were getting me anything.

165
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,030
I know you're busy, you shouldn't have.

166
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,500
What do you think?

167
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,460
It's not bad.

168
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,320
Thank you. But where are we going?

169
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,930
Are you on a diet?

170
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,760
Why are you only eating salad?

171
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,470
I can't have sushi.

172
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,190
Really?

173
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,380
You should have said something sooner.

174
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,200
Salmon salad is fine for me.

175
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,990
I do eat salmon and caviar.

176
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,190
What kind of food do you like?

177
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,990
And what don't you like?

178
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,610
We're engaged but were separated for most of it.

179
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,840
Do you know what my friends say?

180
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,260
I'm only your fiancée for the title.

181
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,690
But it feels more real now.

182
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,100
We're eating alone and exchanging gifts.

183
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,370
It would be nice to continue getting to know each other in the future.

184
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,110
You didn't get the list?

185
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,360
Pardon?

186
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,390
You'll get a list from your mother. We don't need to waste time getting to know each other.

187
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,540
You'll find it helpful.

188
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,950
Yes.

189
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,170
Aren't you tired?

190
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,160
Maybe you should have gone home early and rested.

191
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,770
Your mother and father are probably waiting.

192
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,130
President Kadeko.

193
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,630
Mr. Choi!

194
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,580
It's been a while. When did you come back?

195
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,120
Today. You look more beautiful than when we met in Paris.

196
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,290
Oh! The beautiful lady by your side might take offense.

197
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,630
This is my fiancée.

198
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,430
Say hello. This is President Kaneko of JR Group.

199
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,340
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

200
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,370
Nice to meet you, too.

201
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,300
President.

202
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,070
If it's fine with you, would you like to join us?

203
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:24,100
I'm sorry. I know what you'd want to talk about as the owner of Taeyang Department Store

204
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,770
so I can't join you.

205
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,420
The brand opening has been decided on the group level to be at a different place.

206
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,420
I'm really sorry.

207
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,020
Enjoy your time.

208
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,670
I have an appointment.

209
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,770
What's wrong, President?

210
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,930
That necklace...

211
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,660
It's a lucky necklace to me.

212
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,150
I used this necklace to propose and was able to receive her feelings.

213
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,580
Eternal love.

214
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,210
It's my late husband's first masterpiece.

215
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,340
I also got proposed to using this necklace.

216
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,300
At that time, we were the happiest

217
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,200
couple there was.

218
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,090
How is it like for you now?

219
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,110
He just closed the deal with President Kaneko.

220
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:21,890
Yes. I'll bring him once he's done so please call the board meeting.

221
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,780
You worked hard, Mr. President.

222
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,270
You worked hard, Manager Lee.

223
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:37,360
All I did was bid on the necklace from New York like you asked.

224
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,800
We should leave now. I scheduled the board meeting in 30 minutes.

225
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,790
Let's go.

226
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,800
Hold on.

227
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,980
I have something to say.

228
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,270
I'll give you one minute. What is it?

229
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,020
Am I a puppet?

230
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,440
From the beginning, the necklace, this restaurant, everything ...

231
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,850
How could you do that?

232
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,640
I had no idea.

233
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,870
You're right. You're a puppet.

234
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,230
You didn't know that?

235
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,210
Seriously, you weren't expecting to play childish love games like normal people,

236
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,890
were you?

237
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,870
I thought you knew that our marriage was merely for business purposes.

238
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,170
There's nothing more to say.

239
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,090
Noona.

240
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,920
Kang In, it's been awhile.

241
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,530
What are you going here?

242
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,810
I'm on my way home from having lunch with Kang Ju.

243
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,730
My hyung (brother) is back? Since when?

244
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,380
Today. You didn't know?

245
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,360
Ah, that's right.

246
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,690
I've been so busy because of my schedule.

247
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,330
Who is this?

248
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,050
One of your crazy fans?

249
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,200
Hey, know who you're talking to.

250
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,420
Say hello. She's going to be my sister-in-law.

251
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,090
Oh my.

252
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,620
Hello.

253
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,030
Returning with her 3rd album "Hello Girl", my name is Rian.

254
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,420
Wait, if she's your sister-in-law, then how will she be related to me?

255
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,630
- She has nothing to do with you.
 - I'll be leaving now.

256
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,190
- I'll see you next time. 
 - Okay.

257
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,790
Send Hyung my regards.

258
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,370
What was that? She treated us like we're invisible.

259
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:17,360
Do you think an idol group fits our company's image?

260
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,680
How much time is left on the contract?

261
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,210
We are currently renewing our contract with the group.

262
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,350
Cancel it immediately.

263
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,580
How long have you been working here?

264
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,860
It's been three years.

265
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,490
Nobody knew for three years. Or they knew but chose to ignore it.

266
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,540
You. From this moment on, you're fired.

267
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,880
You didn't know that using cheap perfume would only make the stench of your cigarettes that much stronger?

268
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,760
Is this just a low-end marketplace?

269
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,150
If this woman is still here in the morning, you're also fired.

270
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,650
Yes, I'll take care of it immediately.

271
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,620
What's wrong with being a puppet?

272
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,070
How could you get upset over something so little and come home alone?

273
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,620
What will Kang Ju's family think when they hear how thin skinned you are?

274
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,020
Mom, how can you say that when they insulted me like that?

275
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,820
Not to mention it was in front of Lee Roo Mi.

276
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,430
I'm saying this because I'm your mother. Even if it's unfair and rude, you need to hold it in.

277
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,900
Mom!

278
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,600
Do you even know what's happening with the company right now?

279
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,920
We have no more investors and are losing money. We're about to shut down.

280
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,600
- If we lose Taeyang Group's investment— 
 - Please stop mom!

281
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,360
Is it my fault the company's not doing well?

282
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,530
You're not a little kid anymore. It is not time for you to be throwing a tantrum.

283
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,470
Will it take the company shutting down and our family living on the street for you to come to your senses?

284
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,130
What in the world do you want me to do?

285
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,550
I'm doing everything I can.

286
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,250
Do you know why people have eyes in front?

287
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,530
It's so that we only look and run forward.

288
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,030
If something happens with this marriage, you and I, this company, it'll all be over.

289
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,860
Do you understand?

290
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,570
Look who it is! Welcome back, Young Master!

291
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,570
Welcome back.

292
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,500
Have you been well?

293
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,490
You must be tired from your trip.

294
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,680
Oh my goodness. It must really be different overseas.

295
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,180
You've become more handsome and mature.

296
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,030
That's why girls are all over you.

297
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,230
Hearing your voice makes me feel at home.

298
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,340
- Really? 
 - Let's head inside.

299
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,570
- Yes. 
 - Let's go.

300
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,490
We missed you so much!

301
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,190
The head monk at the temple sent this to us.

302
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,460
The scent is very rich.

303
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:01,060
You should try some, too. You probably have jet lag. It'll help.

304
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,010
The deal with JR Group was handled nicely.

305
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,440
Work is good and all but he hasn't been officially hired yet.

306
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,090
Aren't you working too hard when you just got back?

307
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,880
In a tea ritual,

308
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,330
the first step is to slowly heat up cold water.

309
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,790
It's not bad for your first start.

310
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,900
Cold water that is heated to the right temperature,

311
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,760
has a different taste and scent depending on how long the tea was steeping.

312
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:42,390
If you don't want to rush the steeping process, you need to look far into the future.

313
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,320
Yes, I understand.

314
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,260
Why hasn't Kang In called when his brother just got home?

315
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,600
What is he doing that he even turned his cellphone off?

316
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,010
But it's still impressive that the rebellious kid is grown up and making his own money.

317
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,440
Who asked him to make money? There's plenty of people to do that for him.

318
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,700
I'm just relieved he's not doing something to ruin our reputation.

319
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,900
When I think about all that he's put us through, I wake up with panic attacks.

320
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,400
He doesn't even have anything on his schedule lately. He should have at least come home on a day like today.

321
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,490
Don't worry. He'll find his way home soon.

322
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,230
- What does that mean? 
 - You'll see.

323
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,700
The issue at the construction site has been taken care of?

324
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,910
Yes. I was able to put out the most immediate fires.

325
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,030
You even had makgeolli ( T.N. Korean rice wine ) with the workers.

326
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,130
You worked hard.

327
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,090
It was for the company.

328
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,190
How was the airport?

329
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,470
Yeah.

330
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,820
What? Did something happen with Choi Kang Ju?

331
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:01,860
No. Nothing happened.

332
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,420
Oppa, tell me what happened.

333
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,560
You saw someone who looked just like me?

334
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,400
How similiar is she to me?

335
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,440
That is ...

336
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,930
Lucky charm. Bull****

337
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,440
 Mom. Dad.

338
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,590
Oh my, Young Master. You're not sleeping?

339
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,850
Nothing has changed. Everything's the same.

340
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,540
Goodness. You must be tired from traveling.

341
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,700
- Go in and get some sleep. 
 - Okay.

342
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,120
You should get some sleep, too.

343
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,210
Yes, Young Master.

344
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,250
As soon as he got home, he comes to the annex.

345
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,780
So strange.

346
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,690
Three years ago, when Monster debuted,

347
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,300
they filmed their music video on this beach right here.

348
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,190
They ate at our restaurant afterwards and left this picture.

349
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,310
Look at Kang In's soft hair.

350
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,580
These pictures are a work of art.

351
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,710
What did they eat?

352
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,550
Give us exactly the same things they ate.

353
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,630
Wow, these Monster oppas practically filmed a food show.

354
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,420
They had seafood stew, steamed conch, and crab stew.

355
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,360
Which one would you like?

356
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,870
Give us everything. All of it.

357
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,950
Okay.

358
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,150
Did you come here after seeing the post on Monster's fan club?

359
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,320
Yes.

360
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,600
Then, just for fan club members, I'll give you a 30% discount.

361
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,020
- You're awesome. 
 - Check please.

362
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,430
Yes, I'll be right there.

363
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,780
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

364
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,520
Come back again.

365
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,180
Auntie.

366
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,990
Aunt Bong Sook.

367
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,000
That color looks great.

368
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,330
Yeah? Were you making a delivery?

369
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,990
Yes. Auntie, my savings club money.

370
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,040
Let's see.

371
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,980
It's your turn to get the money. You must be really happy.

372
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,550
Yes. Once I get my savings money, I'll treat you to a meal.

373
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,880
Here. Take this.

374
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,990
Are you closing the shop?

375
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,620
Lotions, eye cream, why is there so much?

376
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,680
You can just give be samples.

377
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,030
The eye creams are expired so I added them in.

378
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,020
Don't try to save it and use it everyday.

379
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,560
You need to take better care of your skin at your age.

380
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,730
Thank you so much. I'll use them well. Work hard.

381
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,030
- Bye. 
 - Okay, bye.

382
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,540

383
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,130
Choi Kang Ju, just how remarkable do you think you are?

384
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,260
Do you think you can look down on me like that?

385
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,300
I am sincerely grateful that you made this difficult trip

386
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,790
to see a novice student like myself at this remote location.

387
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,210
Please head back safely.

388
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,000
Oh, it's cold.

389
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,580
Oh, this is so frustrating.

390
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,670
Why do I feel so sore today?

391
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,920
Oh, this feels good.

392
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,710
What brings you here without any warning?

393
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,060
When have I ever announced my arrival?

394
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,120
I left my home empty for too long.

395
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,670
I don't have much time so I'll get right to the point.

396
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,560
Yes, yes, yes.

397
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,490
Once I leave, a woman will come find you.

398
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,500
Whatever that woman wants, whatever it is, all of it, give it to her.

399
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,570
But there are things I can't do as part of my business policy.

400
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,450
You rascal ...

401
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:36,190
Yes, okay, I'll do as you say.

402
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,230
Okay, I'll do anything.

403
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,660
Anyway, I don't have any appointments.

404
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,440
Who's coming at this hour?

405
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,470
My goodness ...

406
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,670
  Is anyone here?

407
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,450
My daughter is getting married soon.

408
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:32,580
Ah yes. So you must be curious about the bride and groom's compatibility.

409
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,570
What are the bride and groom's birthdays?

410
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,710
Let's see here.

411
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:59,330
I heard that you assist Taeyang Group's family affairs using lunar and solar cycles.

412
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,010
Hot coffee and cup noodles here!

413
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,760
Unnie, Oppa, have a cup of sweet coffee.

414
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,670
I've got cup noodles too.

415
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,760
- Two cups of coffee here. 
- Yes.

416
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,690
- We meet again. 
- You've got two jobs?

417
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,490
Early morning, I dive. During the day, I work in the restaurant. At night, I sell coffee.

418
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,920
I guess I've got three jobs.

419
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,790
- Just a second, please. 
 - Yes.

420
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,730
Totally awesome!

421
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,540
I can't stand it.

422
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,870
The pose is no joke.

423
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,620
What's so amusing?

424
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,670
We're looking at Choi Kang Ju's airport shots.

425
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,940
Choi Kang Ju? Is he a new singer?

426
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,600
You don't know Choi Kang Ju?

427
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,540
You know, Time Magazine's top 100 beautiful people.

428
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,680
Our proud 11th ranked Korean.

429
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,900
Taeyang Group's heir Choi Kang Ju.

430
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,780
Choi Kang Ju?

431
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,230
Is he more famous than Monster?

432
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:12,160
Oh my. I guess she's been living on some other star.

433
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,130
You know Taeyang Group though, right?

434
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,810
Of course I do. Our house's TV, fridge, and washer are all from them.

435
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,750
So Monster's Choi Kang In's older brother is Choi Kang Ju.

436
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:26,980
But the important point is, the person who's a whole lot more handsome than Kang In,

437
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,130
and a whole lot more famous is his older brother Choi Kang Ju.

438
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:37,770
Oh, if he's more famous than Choi Kang In, then he must really be very famous.

439
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:42,880
But she looks so familiar.

440
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,410
Doesn't she look like Choi Kang Ju's fiancé?

441
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,900
No way.

442
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,190
No, look. The eyes and nose.

443
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,400
No.

444
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,420
I think so though.

445
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,290
- Three cups of coffee here. 
 - Yes.

446
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:03,140
Wow, it's so nice.

447
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,610
Here you go.

448
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,530
It's here.

449
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,210
Enjoy.

450
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,830
Alright.

451
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,420
It's good.

452
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,290
Excuse me.

453
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,080
Sir.

454
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,100
Huh?

455
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,230
The money.

456
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,640
Put it on my tab.

457
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,320
What?

458
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:37,490
I'll give it to you next time I see you so put it there.

459
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,300
Why don't you give it to me when I'm being nice? I'm busy right now.

460
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:54,280
Oh, this Unni. When her eyes start getting big, she looks so cute.

461
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,700
You cowardly piece of s***.  Tab my a**. Stop talking crap.

462
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,410
My nose is bleeding.

463
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,740
Give me my money.

464
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,270
- Thank you. 
 - Have a good evening.

465
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,960
Let's go.

466
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,280
We have hot coffee and cup noodles.

467
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,510
Oh, we'd like some coffee.

468
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,800
Yes, hold on a moment. One moment.

469
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,760
- Two please. 
 - Two cups.

470
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,390
Thank you.

471
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,360
Electricity, gas, all the utilities are up.

472
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,690
Let's see.

473
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,290
I won't ask for more or less, I just want to make as much as I did tonight.

474
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,230
Doo Rim, it's your favorite.

475
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,180
Baked sweet potatoes.

476
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:34,960
Try some. They're really sweet.

477
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:41,220
Tasty, isn't it?

478
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:47,680
Grandma, when I get my savings this month, let's go to the hospital and get a check up for you.

479
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,280
The prescriptions you get from the clinic aren't doing anything.

480
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,020
Why are you going to waste money on such things?

481
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,840
I know why I'm sick.

482
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,460
The day your mom and dad went out fishing,

483
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,370
they were taken by the sea and I got this illness.

484
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,110
Maybe I would get better if your parents came back to life,

485
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:14,260
but a hospital won't cure me.

486
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,100
Grandma.

487
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,340
Why would spending money on you be a waste?

488
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,810
Grandma, wait just a little longer.

489
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,570
I'll make lots of money,

490
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:27,340
and buy you nice clothes, a nice car,  and a nice house.

491
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,750
I'll take really good care of you.

492
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,690
So you have to live a long, long life.

493
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:39,260
Oh, my sweet, caring puppy. Just hearing that is enough for me.

494
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,400
Have some more of these.

495
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,020
Here.

496
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,590
Good, right?

497
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:56,560
Wait. It's time for your favorite drama.

498
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,920
Oh, yeah. Let's watch.

499
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,000
This is acting up again.

500
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,530
It's on.

501
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:14,470
It always needs a good beating to get started.

502
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,950
What's going on now?

503
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,950
Oh, Doo Rim! Doo Rim.

504
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:33,150
What are we going to do?

505
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,600
Ahjumma? Is it true? Aunt Bong Sook?

506
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,060
Doo Rim, what do we do?

507
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,210
That wench took all the savings money and store deposit,

508
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:45,090
and ran away.

509
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,800
It can't be.

510
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,400
I need that money.

511
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,660
Doo Rim. Doo Rim.

512
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:38,940

513
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,240
Grandma.

514
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,780
Grandma?

515
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,220
Grandma.

516
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,520
Grandma!

517
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,190
Excuse me. Excuse me!

518
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:11,350
♫  Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you  ♫

519
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,510
♫  Just come to me ♫

520
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,540
 Bride of the Century

521
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:25,410
♫   Suddenly you became the only person. I longed for you while smiling  ♫

522
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:32,450
♫   Even if I try to hide it, I will be looking all day always for you. Forever   ♫

523
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:39,230
♫   Even if I try to hide it, I will be looking all day always for you. Forever   ♫

524
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:46,020
♫  It must have been love.  It was hidden. The only person there.  ♫

525
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:52,840
♫  It must have been you.  Be at my side  The one person who did that.  ♫
