1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,830
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,530
 Yes, everyone. I know you must be busy but if I could get your attention. Please turn your attention this way.

3
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,250
 Bong Mi Bakery is having a cake eating event.

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,510
As you can see, first place is a 3D ready TV.

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,990
Second place is a free cake gift certificate. Third place is a 70% off coupon for the bakery.

6
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,630
Do I have any interested participants? One more time,

7
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,970
- first place is a 3D— 
 - Oh, me, me, me, me.

8
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,700
- Okay, good. Okay, anyone else? 
 - Me, me, me, me.

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,080
- Oh, you look good. Anyone else? 
 - Over here. Me.

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,830
- Oh, you look like you can eat. Anyone else? 
 - Over here.

11
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,670
- Okay, Any other participants? 
 - Here, here.

12
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,100
One last person. There's one last seat left. Anyone else?

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,660
- One last seat. Anyone else? 
 - Me!

14
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,540
Okay, young lady. Please give a big round of applause to all of our participants.

15
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,680
- Yeah. 
 - Okay.

16
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,150
We have a lot of great prizes for the winners of this event.

17
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,910
Let's see who will win today's cake eating contest.

18
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:36,390
♫  Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you.  ♫ 
 Don't be nervous. Get ready. Start. A round of applause!

19
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,650
♫   Just come to me. Keep on coming to me.  ♫ 
They're all eating really well. Looks to me that contestant number 2 may get first place.

20
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:50,740
♫   Suddenly you became the only person  I longed  for you while smiling.  ♫ 
 But contestant number 3 is eating well also. Number 5 is no joke either. Who will be the winner? Oh, it looks like Number 2, Number 2.

21
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:57,090
♫  Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever   ♫ 
 Number 2. Number 2 is ... Oh, Number 3 ... 3 ... 3 is catching up. Wow!

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,810
♫  Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever   ♫  
Number 3 isn't playing around. She's hungry. Wow, what's happening. She's crazy.

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,950
Number 3 is going crazy. Oh my goodness, how can a woman ... How can a woman act like this?

24
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,530
Number 3 ... three, three, three, three ... Number 3 is ... Number 3 is the winner.

25
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,060
Here is today's winner.

26
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,760
Congratulations. She finished in 1 minute and 27 seconds.

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,730
Oh, what? What are you doing?

28
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,750
Why is she doing this?

29
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,070
Celebrate! Celebrate! Give her a round of applause. Celebrate.

30
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,920
That was an awesome celebration.

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,440
Today's cake eating contest winner. Okay, okay.

32
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,930
- Mother. 
 - What are you doing here?

33
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,590
I was just passing by and saw your car. What's going on?

34
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,550
Oh, nothing. It's nothing.

35
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,660
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

36
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,250
Are you crazy? What do you think you're doing?

37
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,490
How did you know I was here?

38
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,400
Is that important right now? What if my mother had seen you?

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,800
Your mother?

40
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,240
Well, the thing is ...

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,520
Now you're entering cake eating contests? Do you have any other surprises?

42
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,300
And what's with your outfit?

43
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,930
You know women sometimes get nervous and stressed before their wedding.

44
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,900
- They want to do things they hadn't done before. 
 - So  because you're under so much stress,

45
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,760
you're doing all these ridiculous things?

46
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,770
I won't do it again. I'm sorry.

47
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,010
Sir, I was looking for you everywhere. It's almost time.

48
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,140
Jang Yi Gyeong, what are you doing here?

49
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,350
Go home. We'll talk later. Let's go.

50
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,690
- Aren't you coming? 
 - Ah, yes.

51
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,560
Are all women like that? They get all stressed before their wedding.

52
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,480
Did Yi Gyeong say she's under a lot of stress?

53
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,780
I suppose, being the Taeyang Group's daughter-in-law isn't for everyone.

54
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,450
- But isn't a cake eating contest too much? 
 - Cake eating contest?

55
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,140
Yi Gyeong was eating cake?

56
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,550
That's strange. Yi Gyeong doesn't really like sweets. She doesn't even eat candy or chocolates.

57
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,190
You didn't know? There's a lot you don't know about your fiancé.

58
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,490
- I know she like cats. 
 - What are you talking about?

59
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,430
Yi Gyeong is allergic to dog and cat hair so she can't even go near them.

60
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,340
She was so jealous that I was able to raise a dog.

61
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,790
Are you sure you're not mistaken? I even saw her cuddling with a kitten.

62
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:35,370
She wanted to raise the kitten that lost her mother so she even took her home.

63
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,620
During the interview, you acted like you knew the CEO's fiancé.

64
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,070
- Why were you like that? 
 - Pardon? Why are you asking all of a sudden?

65
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,730
- Isn't it because she looks like someone you know? 
 - What? No.

66
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:03,380
At first, she looked like my friend. But when I got a closer look, she didn't look anything like her.

67
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,140
I was 100 percent mistaken.

68
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,660
- Okay, you can go back to work. 
 - Yes.

69
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,930
The cake ... the cat ... She keeps doing strange things she hasn't done before.

70
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,000
Jang Yi Gyeong, your stress must be really bad.

71
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:41,400
Yes, yes. The screen is big and the color is bright. It's so nice.

72
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,400
Yes, yes.

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,650
Grandma, watch your favorite dramas on the new TV as much as you want.

74
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:55,120
Of course. I'm eating and sleeping well. I'm doing great.

75
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,650
Grandma, hold on. I'll call you right back.

76
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,910
- Welcome back— 
 - What have you been up to?

77
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,900
Unbelievable. I'm so embarrassed, I can't show my face.

78
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,690
Mother.

79
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,390
Yi Hyeon, what have you been doing. Do you know what this girl's been doing?

80
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:22,140
- What's wrong? 
 - Do you know what the number one most searched topic online is right now?

81
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,130
Do you know how shocked I was when the in-laws called me?

82
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,940
 1. Cake Eating Contest Video

83
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,150
How dare she wear clothes no one would ever want and enter a eating contest?

84
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,220
Mother.

85
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,670
What are you going to do when our Yi Gyeong returns? It wasn't enough that you ruined her reputation.

86
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,530
Our precious Yi Gyeong ... You've made our precious Yi Gyeong a laughingstock.

87
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,540
- Why are you being like this? 
 - Throw away all these clothes.

88
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,440
And get rid of this cat immediately.

89
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,520
- You know that our Yi Gyeong can't even touch cats. 
 - Calm down, Mother.

90
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,040
Mother, you need to be more patient. There must have been a reason.

91
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,730
Reasons? What reasons? Why are you protecting her?

92
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,370
- What if they decide to cancel the marriage? What are you going to do? 
 - Mother.

93
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,800
You said you would be able to find her right away. Are you even looking? Would you be like this if she was your biological sister?

94
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,990
Later, when I return to Namhae, I'll take her back.

95
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,750
- Until then, can you watch her? 
 - Yeah. Okay.

96
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,410
Coco, nice to meet you.

97
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,980
So Doo Rim, how do you feel when you're with Choi Kang Ju?

98
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,710
Hey, he's Choi Kang Ju. His name alone shines bright. The heir of Taeyang Group.

99
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:11,430
He's every Korean girl's dream. I'm really curious what it's like to be alone with him.

100
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,830
When I first saw him, I wondered if he was truly human.

101
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,510
He was dripping with wealth and glamour.

102
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:28,470
But what's the use of being handsome and rich? I understand why Jang Yi Gyeong disappeared.

103
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,750
- He's rude and so inconsiderate. 
 - Hey, don't be so hard on him.

104
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:40,070
You know Miss Kim from the information desk? He got her hired at a major supermarket. And she's a full-time employee.

105
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,830
Really?

106
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,100
That mart also has really good benefits so they even provided her a place to live.

107
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,810
Her sibling no longer needs to go to the orphanage so it all worked out in the end.

108
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,940
Right, Coco?

109
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,080
- Did you find a good home for the kitten? 
 - Yes. My friend really likes her.

110
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,530
- Today is Monster's showcase, right? 
 - How did you know?

111
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,090
Kang In sent an invitation.

112
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,890
 2014 Jan 24, Fri., Club SB

113
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,240
Kang In alone is enough of a headache. But now even Yi Gyeong.

114
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,840
- Mother, don't worry about it. 
 - This won't do.

115
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:45,410
- Ask the group administrative office to get her a bodyguard or someone to— 
 - I told you not to worry about it.

116
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,670
We took down all the photos and blocked all the videos from being broadcast.

117
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,870
There won't be anymore problems so stop worrying and leave.

118
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,050
I understand.

119
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,960
Tell Team Leader Lee to report to my office immediately.

120
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,760
 The person you are trying reach is unavailable. After the beep—

121
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,740
After causing all this trouble, you turn off your phone and that's it?

122
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,300
- You asked for me?  
 - Lee Ru Mi, was it you?

123
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,050
- What are you talking about? 
 - The cake eating contest video. I'm asking if you're the one who uploaded it.

124
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,680
- Why do you think it was me? 
 - Do you think I would accuse you without any evidence?

125
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,610
- I asked the bakery— 
 - Yeah, you're right. It was me.

126
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:03,520
- Why did you do that? 
 - Do you really not know? You said I would return to my rightful place.

127
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,980
You ... might need to find a new place to work.

128
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,230
Find another company.

129
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,720
Yes, Mother. I can't seem to get in touch with Yi Gyeong.

130
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,620
Is she at home by any chance?

131
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,500
Pardon? A showcase?

132
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,030
Wow, so there are places like this.

133
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,990
There's all kinds of things here. So fascinating.

134
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,010
It's my first time in a place like this.

135
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,560
It's hotteok.  (T. N. Sweet Korean pancakes)

136
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,560
You said you like sweet things. They make it here from scratch. Try it.

137
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,710
It's so tasty. This is my first time trying something like this.

138
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,500
Everything is a first for you.

139
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,320
Oppa ...

140
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,240
It's also my first time calling you that.

141
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,490
Thank you. I know you're doing this to try and cheer me up.

142
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,820
There's nothing I can do well. And I keep causing trouble.

143
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,500
I felt so sorry that I wanted to crawl and hide in a hole somewhere.

144
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:40,310
Am I keeping you from your hole? Fine. I'll take responsibility for you today.

145
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,830
Ah, hot. It's tasty but really hot.

146
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,230
You're like a kid. What is this?

147
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,720
There's more on your lips than mine.

148
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,040
Fooled you!

149
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,560
You have no problem laughing in front of your brother.

150
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,410
Oh, you're even trying to act cute.

151
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,400
 100 Year Tradition Walnut Snack

152
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,530
Kang ... Kang Ju.

153
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,230
How does it feel to be the number 1 search topic?

154
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,330
Yi Gyeong has been feeling down about that all day.

155
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:38,660
I was trying to cheer her up. She didn't want to but I dragged her out.

156
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:47,140
I'm sorry. Even if I had ten mouths, I would have nothing to say.

157
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,980
Could you excuse us? We need to speak privately.

158
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,520
Oppa ...

159
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:09,780
Yi Gyeong is really remorseful. We should have been more thoughtful. We'll be more careful from now on.

160
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,080
Where are you going?

161
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,550
I came all the way here. I should at least watch the showcase.

162
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,520
Hold on. Let's go together.

163
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,620
- It's Choi Kang Ju. 
 - Oh, Choi Kang Ju.

164
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,320
What happened to all that fighting spirit you showed me earlier?

165
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,680
You used to have something to say about every little thing I said or did.

166
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,200
You must care more about what other people think.

167
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,660
When did I ever do that?

168
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:19,780
The employee that was fired. I heard you got her a job.

169
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,520
I'm sorry. I was too harsh.

170
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,220
Don't be mistaken. It wasn't because of you.

171
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,110
That female employee ... I didn't want her to start a nasty rumor so it was just to keep her quiet.

172
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:40,800
Hello. Do you perhaps remember us?

173
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,940
You know, in Namhae. "Yeah". It's you, right?

174
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,660
- No. 
 - You're not?

175
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,210
I'm sorry. I told you she isn't.

176
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,210
- You're really handsome. 
 - Oh, thank you.

177
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,850
Hold on a moment.

178
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,030
Oh, it's starting.

179
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,990
Mom, ouch!

180
00:18:39,740 --> 00:19:06,830
Mon - Si - Ter! Mon - Si - Ter! Mon - Si - Ter ...

181
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,660
Oh, Oppa.

182
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:24,950
People who don't have a brother must be lonely. Why don't you just live with your brother forever?

183
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,080
- You do that on purpose, don't you? 
 - What?

184
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,600
Isn't this also an act? To provoke me.

185
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,910
- Go away. 
 - What will you do if I don't?

186
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,580
- If you keep coming closer, you might get a double nosebleed. 
 - Really?

187
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,890
I definitely warned you.

188
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,380
I saved you from getting trampled and you headbutt me?

189
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,840
What are you doing?

190
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,100
- Yi Gyeong. 
 - Oppa.

191
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,850
Are you okay?

192
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:50,070
 Come to me Kang In

193
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,280
Hello everyone!

194
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,560
The featured singer in our new single,

195
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,950
is actually publicly dating our leader, Kang In.

196
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,150
She's receiving lots of love for her single "Hello Girl", please welcome LeAnn.

197
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,190
Hello, I am LeAnn.

198
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,010
I'm very honored to be here with you during this special event.

199
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,470
And to the Monster members, we look forward to hearing more great music from you. Monster fighting.

200
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,920
Hello, I am Kang In.

201
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,270
After such a long time, seeing all of your faces makes me so happy and delighted.

202
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:57,680
We also have a special guest with us tonight, making this night even more joyous and memorable.

203
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,520
Let me introduce him. I don't want to admit it,

204
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,420
but everyone thinks he's better looking than me.

205
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:13,640
It's none other than my brother Choi Kang Ju and my future sister-in-law, Jang Yi Gyeong.

206
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,520
It's already been 3 years since we debuted.

207
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,240
But this is the first time anyone in my family has attended a concert. I'm really touched.

208
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,270
Soon my brother will be a taken man.

209
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,320
I hope you two will be happy for a long, long time. Hyung, I love you.

210
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,790
Sister-in-law, I love you.

211
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:45,880
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

212
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,320
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

213
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,710
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

214
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:07,200
♫  Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you.  ♫

215
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,470
♫  Just come to me  ♫

216
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,570
♫  Keep on coming to me  ♫

217
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,620
♫   Suddenly you became the only person  I longed  for you while smiling.  ♫  
  Why is his acting so realistic?

218
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,500
♫  Even if I try to hide it   ♫ 
 He really has two personalities.

219
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,050
♫   I will be looking all day always for you. Forever   ♫

220
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,550
Thank you. May I get a picture?

221
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,140
- Of course. 
 - Really?

222
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,900
One, two, three ... kimchi.

223
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,870
Thank you. Thank you.

224
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,760
Unni. Take one with me too.

225
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,350
- Can I? 
 - Of course.

226
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,670
One, two, three ... kimchi.

227
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:56,640
- LeAnn, you're so pretty. 
 - I can call you Unni, right?

228
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,250
- Of course. 
 - Since I don't have an older sister,

229
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,890
- I was always jealous of kids who had an older sister. 
 - I don't have a younger sibling either.

230
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,840
It's so nice to have found a younger sister who can call me Unni.

231
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,080
Kang In, thank you. I had fun tonight.

232
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,650
You should be more thankful for that kiss performance. He should have gone in for a deep kiss.

233
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,710
Our Hyung is really timid, isn't he?

234
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,260
Unni, was that ... your first time?

235
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,160
It must have been your first time. What is this? You're even engaged.

236
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,660
Awesome. As expected, you're just like my brother.

237
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,190
Our Hyung really doesn't like physical affection. But don't fall for that.

238
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,750
Because all men are beasts. You never know when they'll go wild.

239
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:50,130
Call the house one in awhile. Mom worries about you.

240
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,140
Let's get going.

241
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,700
- Kang In, good luck. LeAnn, I'll see you next time. 
 - Yes, Unnie. Bye.

242
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,220
Brother-in-law, goodbye.

243
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,240
You're going overboard again.Do you think brother-in-law is the name of someone's dog?

244
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,540
What? If we get married, that's what he'll be.

245
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,850
I'm just saying it a little earlier, so what?

246
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,600
But Oppa, you know Yi Gyeong ...

247
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,870
She's so different from last time. She was so cold back then.

248
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:23,690
Today, she's warm like a spring breeze. She's like a completely different person.

249
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,450
Is she?

250
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,980
Brother-in-law?

251
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,760
I thought Kang In was the only problem. But now La ... LeAnn?

252
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,160
She has a lot of problems, too.

253
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,260
Why? I thought she was cute.

254
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,040
Her face is really pretty. She sings well and she can dance.

255
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,530
She's the epitome of pure beauty. You could say she is blessed with great genes.

256
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,190
Any woman would be envious of her.

257
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,760
I suppose. You would be jealous.

258
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,070
How can you compare your little girl body to hers?

259
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,790
Hey, even if that were true, how could you say that so bluntly to my face?

260
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,780
It's not like you're going to live off of a woman's face and body.

261
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:20,200
A woman's true beauty is ... you know ... their inner beauty.

262
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,830
That's what ugly girls say.

263
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,460
You're short.

264
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,010
On top of that, did you grow up lying on your stomach?

265
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,670
Oh, you do have something big ... your big head.

266
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,830
Fine. It's not surprising coming from you.

267
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,830
And if you really like big things, then find someone with big hands,

268
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,190
and big feet ...

269
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,690
and huge nostrils that can fit a 500 won coin.

270
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,850
You should just say you like big girls like that.

271
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,940
Why are you throwing a tantrum? I was just telling you how I see it.

272
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,240
Where are you going?

273
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,490
Why are you doing this again?

274
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,760
I couldn't tell you earlier because of your brother,

275
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,140
but I took care of all the cake eating contest videos so stay out of trouble from now on. Umderstand?

276
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,690
Okay. I won't do it again.

277
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,730
If you get in any more trouble—

278
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,600
There won't be anything like that. No way.

279
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,140
I swear to the heavens. I won't ever do that again.

280
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,340
I heard from Yi Hyeon.

281
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,670
The viral video has been taken care of?

282
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,830
I'm sorry. I asked too much of you.

283
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,550
Lately, I've been really sensitive because of Yi Gyeong.

284
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:04,460
No, it's all my fault.

285
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,120
I'm really sorry.

286
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,660
Thank you for understanding.

287
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,010
But, I know it won't ever happen,

288
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:21,160
but what if we can't find Yi Gyeong before the wedding?

289
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,500
I'm just asking, just in case.

290
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,120
What would you do?

291
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,010
What if something like that does happen? What would you do?

292
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,820
What are you saying?

293
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:47,030
I was just asking. Nothing like that will happen so don't worry.

294
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,780
Oh wait.

295
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,150
The trip to Namhae tomorrow. I'll go.

296
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,680
Okay.

297
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,290
Tomorrow is ... that day, right?

298
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,410
I'm sorry I can't be with you.

299
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,060
You have a lot going on right now.

300
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,390
I'll take care of everything. Don't worry.

301
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,710
Okay.

302
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,510
How dare she ... to Choi Kang Ju?

303
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,850
It's more shocking than when the company stocks plummeted.

304
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,830
It's not like she's an alien from another planet.

305
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,290
Who are you, Jang Yi Gyeong?

306
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,650
- Thank you. 
 - Yes.

307
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,780
What are these flowers all of a sudden?

308
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,310
Is it Yi Hyeon's birthday?

309
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,360
Why didn't Ms. Ma ask me to make seaweed soup?  (T.N. Traditional birthday soup)

310
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,310
Did they forget since it's been so crazy?

311
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,390
Yes, Mother.

312
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,290
Our young miss is so thrifty.

313
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,920
That sesame oil is 100% domestically made,

314
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,930
you can't waste even a drop.

315
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,830
Mother, please have a taste.

316
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,530
Please taste some.

317
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,190
You seasoned it well.

318
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,100
Let me try some.

319
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:08,410
How did you make it so tasty? You cook really well.

320
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:14,360
I heard Father-in-law is on a low sodium diet so I only put in a small amount of salt.

321
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,150
Mother, what else should I do? Is this being used for the stew?

322
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,120
Kang Ju must have spoken to you.

323
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,510
I wasn't going to just overlook this incident,

324
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,090
but Kang Ju asked for this favor,

325
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,360
so I won't ask anymore about the video.

326
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,130
I'm sorry, Mother.

327
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,600
This is your last and only warning.

328
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,990
Do you understand?

329
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,140
Yes.  I'll remember it.

330
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,580
Father.

331
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,490
Take your medicine.

332
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,840
One of these and one of these.

333
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,230
Wow, did you draw these yourself?

334
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:20,270
It could make Kim Hong Do  (T.N. Famous Joseon era painter)  cry. You're really talented.

335
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:25,010
I'm just good a copying things.

336
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,250
It's nothing compared to your talent.

337
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,730
What?

338
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,580
You finished a cake in a minute.

339
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,380
You have a surprising talent.

340
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,800
You saw it, too?

341
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,190
I'm really sorry.

342
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:49,920
Don't be. It's only a problem if you're a picky eater, but someone who enjoys eating is nothing to be upset about.

343
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,870
It seems my wife called you here to set you straight.

344
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,950
But you can be comfortable around me.

345
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,350
Okay.

346
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,530
- Father. 
 - Yes?

347
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,320
Do you play Go?

348
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,460
Why? Do you know how to play?

349
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,730
What is that?

350
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,920
Hey! You can't move your stone.

351
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,700
When did I? It's been there the whole time.

352
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,660
I'm telling you, it's been here all along.

353
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,360
- It was just— 
 - I'm telling the truth. When did I move it?

354
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,460
I'm telling the truth.

355
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,780
What are you two doing?

356
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,740
Quiet. Be quiet. I need to focus. Focus.

357
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,360
I need to focus. Quiet, quiet.

358
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,690
It's your turn for punishment.

359
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,880
Okay, fine.

360
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,640
- Alright. 
 - What are you doing right now?

361
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,350
Just hold on. Punishment is punishment.

362
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,790
Father, prepare yourself.

363
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,170
Here.

364
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,710
Hey, over here too. Over here.

365
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,240
Oh goodness, the Chairman's face is covered in moles.

366
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,860
Really?

367
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,260
My face is a masterpiece.

368
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,470
It's the best art I've ever seen.

369
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,960
Father, let's take a commemorative photo.

370
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,630
Shall we? Okay, okay.

371
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,620
Honey, get in the picture. Everyone v-sign, v-sign.

372
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,040
-Get in, get in. 
 - One, two, three ...

373
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,060
Kang Ju was a little odd since he was young, wasn't he?

374
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,790
Stubborn and fussy.

375
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,610
Oh, no, he wasn't.

376
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:27,530
When he was young, he smiled all the time and chatted like a little bird.

377
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,200
He was so cute and lovable.

378
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,270
But then ... after that incident,

379
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:41,430
he spoke less and didn't smile often.

380
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,100
He became like stone.

381
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,380
What incident?

382
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,100
When he was eight years old,

383
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,370
he was kidnapped.

384
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,280
- Kidnapped? 
 - Yes.

385
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,210
They say there's no one in the world you can trust,

386
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,810
but the kidnapper was none other than

387
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,870
his private tutor.

388
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:10,560
She was someone he really liked and trusted.

389
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,670
Imagine how hurt he must have felt.

390
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,210
Thankfully, he was came back safely after a day.

391
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,260
But the scar on his heart is probably really deep.

392
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,700
He was sick with a fever for several days after that.

393
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,520
After that, he has never kept anyone close to him.

394
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,400
It makes sense when think about

395
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,140
how Ru Mi is his only close friend.

396
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,980
But one thing is strange.

397
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:47,560
The young master hasn't spoken one word about that incident.

398
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,960
No one knows how such a young child

399
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,800
was able to escape that situation.

400
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,450
It was such a horrible incident that no one wanted to think about,

401
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:05,320
and everyone was just thankful he returned safely,

402
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,810
so everyone pretends it never happened.

403
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:13,950
So you must also act like you don't know about it.

404
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,800
Yes, I understand.

405
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,150
Do you like her that much?

406
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,550
It's nice that she's so pure.

407
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:40,080
Don't get too attached to her. In any case, that child —

408
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,580
What are you talking about?

409
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,860
They say caring is also an illness.

410
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,880
If you keep spoiling her because she's cute, she may develop some bad habits.

411
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,750
If you cut and polish a stone well, it can become a valuable gem.

412
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,700
That child may seem foolish and lacking,

413
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,470
but if you teach her well, she can be very shiny gem.

414
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,890
What are you watching? Let me see.

415
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,740
These people ...

416
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,540
They really have nothing to do. Why are they watching stuff like this?

417
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,430
What is there to see?

418
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,450
What are you doing here at this hour?

419
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,800
I was doing a photo shoot across the street and stopped by while I was passing through.

420
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,730
Oh and Noona,

421
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,220
this.

422
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:53,300
- What is this? 
 - I was filming a movie in Sydney and bought it.

423
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,560
You came here to give me this?

424
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,140
- All the way here? 
 - Yes.

425
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,240
Why? You don't like it?

426
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,360
It's mine now so I can do whatever I want with it, right?

427
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,840
Miss Oh Jin Joo.

428
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,330
Yes.

429
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,910
Have this.

430
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,940
Why are you—

431
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,770
You could probably use a hairpin.

432
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,270
Ah, seriously. I'm sorry.

433
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,970
Noona.

434
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,440
Noona.

435
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,430
- Noona! 
 - Boss.

436
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,140
Noona, what's wrong? Noona, noona. Wake up.

437
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,320
This looks nice.

438
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,280
That's not my style.

439
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,700
Do you think that would look good on me?

440
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,400
You really are just full of yourself.

441
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,000
This isn't for you.

442
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,610
Today is Yi Hyeon's birthday. It's for him.

443
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,470
I'm throwing a party for him tonight. Do you want to come?

444
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,080
I'm busy.

445
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,890
I knew it.

446
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:40,060
I thought you would be sad if I didn't invite you so I figured I'd ask.

447
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:46,160
You said you were busy. Aren't you leaving?

448
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:51,880
I was going to ask if you wanted to have dinner but something came up.

449
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,080
I need to go too. I have to prepare for the party.

450
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,840
Hyung.

451
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,580
Hyung, aren't you being too much?

452
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,620
I know work is important but you shouldn't be working people to the point of death.

453
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,380
Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

454
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,790
Don't worry about me.

455
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,270
Just because I haven't slept in a few days,

456
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,520
doesn't mean I'm going to die.

457
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,900
Where are you going?

458
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,120
I have a meeting.

459
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,790
- I need to get back to work. 
 - Lee Ru Mi.

460
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:38,030
Can't I do at least this much to make up for what I did?

461
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:41,500
You told me to look for another company. I need to do my job well,

462
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,200
so you don't kick me out.

463
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:49,610
That's right. When you were at the showcase showing everyone your kissing performance,

464
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,630
I was eating a stale sandwich,

465
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:55,070
and preparing for our company event all night.

466
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,920
It was all for you.

467
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,130
The Department Store needs to do well so you can do well.

468
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,450
Rest. Or else you really will be fired.

469
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,850
How's Ru Mi?

470
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:27,480
She must have been working too hard. She'll be fine once she gets some rest.

471
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,230
- How's Ru Mi? 
 - Go inside.

472
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,170
Didn't you say you had dinner plans?

473
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,360
I canceled it.

474
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,990
Was it because of Ru Mi?

475
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,230
You said you have to prepare for the birthday party.

476
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:51,010
You're protective of your brother.

477
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:54,200
Don't worry about things here. Hurry and go.

478
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,740
If you keep missing your scheduled events, won't you get fired?

479
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,570
You're worried about me. Aren't you?

480
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,980
Don't worry. Who's going to fire me?

481
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,100
I'm Monster's looks, scandal, and issue maker.

482
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,880
If not for me, they wouldn't make any money.

483
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,330
Oh, you smiled.

484
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,490
See. You're prettier when you smile.

485
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,530
There's nothing to smile about.

486
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:44,940
Since Kang Ju got engaged, there's nothing left to smile about.

487
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,370
Noona.

488
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:59,820
Ta-da. Try it on.

489
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:10,310
Oh, excuse me.

490
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,480
Come on in.

491
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,260
You haven't eaten dinner yet, right?

492
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:27,230
I bought some porridge. Eat it while it's still warm.

493
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:31,950
I'm not so easygoing to be able to accept such things from you.

494
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,060
Noona, what's wrong?

495
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,150
Even ghosts who eat before dying look better.

496
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,420
You need to eat and get stronger.

497
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:48,510
Fine. I'll accept it since you bought it for me.

498
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:06,960
What? Since I accepted it, I can eat it or throw it away. Can't I do whatever I want with it?

499
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,080
Noona, why are you being like this?

500
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:18,060
Yi Gyeong, please understand. Ru Mi is a bit sensitive today.

501
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,600
What? Lee Ru Mi is the one who uploaded the cake eating video?

502
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:37,660
It came from the secretary office. They overheard the CEO and  Lee Ru Mi fighting.

503
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:42,350
Why would Lee Ru Mi do such a thing? She's trying to steal your spot.

504
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,920
What if she really takes the CEO from you?

505
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,160
Whether they fall in love or have an affair, let them do whatever they want.

506
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,100
You shouldn't be like that.

507
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,050
Then, you'd be neglecting your duty.

508
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,770
Jang Yi Gyeong's family probably put everything on the line for this marriage.

509
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,540
If something were to happen, don't you think they'll want compensation?

510
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,700
If they cancel the marriage, do you think they'll ask for their money back?

511
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,830
Of course. So focus and do your best.

512
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:28,940
You know Lee Ru Mi, she doesn't act strange just in front of Choi Kang Ju.

513
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,110
What do you mean?

514
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:38,350
When I went into the first aid room, Kang In was putting a hairpin on Ru Mi.

515
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,660
Hairpin?

516
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,420
But it didn't seem like just an older sister and younger brother relationship.

517
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,330
The mood was a little peculiar.

518
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,640
 The person you are trying to reach is unavailable. After the beep—

519
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,380
Why isn't he picking up?

520
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,790
Yes, Madam.

521
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,840
Yes. Everything's fine.

522
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,130
Yi Hyeon? He's not home yet.

523
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,390
But isn't today his birthday?

524
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,970
A birthday bouquet was delivered for him this morning.

525
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,270
It's not much but I prepared seaweed soup

526
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:47,990
and a few other dishes for his birthday.

527
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,720
But he hasn't been picking up his phone all day.

528
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,970
Yes, please take care of Yi Hyeon.

529
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:59,600
I'll head back up after I finish my work in Namhae tomorrow morning.

530
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,040
Oppa's okay, right?

531
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,930
Is this the time for you to be worried about your brother?

532
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,130
Don't worry about anything else but your future.

533
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:18,260
And why did you send flowers?

534
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,530
What if Yi Hyeon starts to suspect something?

535
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:25,110
Don't worry. I was careful.

536
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:44,220
 This is a pretty necklace. But if you want to continue to wear this necklace,

537
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,040
 You're head might just roll off.

538
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,700
 What do you want from me? Why do you keep appearing in front of me?

539
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:02,590
 If you become that man's first bride, you'll die. Because I'm going to kill you.

540
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:13,300
 I heard you look after Taeyang Group's solar and lunar fortunes.

541
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,990
 My daughter is going to be their future daughter-in-law.

542
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:21,550
 I know about the family's secret that's passed down every generation.

543
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,070
 If you know about that secret ...

544
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:28,430
 Something that shouldn't be spoken of freely. Some may call it a curse.

545
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:31,240
 My daughter's life is on the line.

546
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,410
 Please tell me the truth.

547
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:38,820
 Years ago, there was a strange rumor about that family.

548
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:45,130
 There's a curse on that family. That the first bride of the heir will be sacrificed.

549
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,310
 Is that just an innocent rumor or—

550
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,770
 What you cannot see,

551
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,360
 may not be real.

552
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:58,730
 But just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

553
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,260
 Then ... that is ...

554
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,350
 Yes.

555
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:07,870
 - Then, Taeyang Group's madam—
 - Of course.

556
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:12,620
 Since long ago, she's known everything.

557
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:39,460
Na Doo Rim must be going to find Yi Hyeon. She's sprinting like a speeding bullet.

558
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:44,520
This is just between you and me.

559
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,460
We must take this secret to our grave.

560
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:01,010

561
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,970
 Bride of the Century
