1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,570
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,940

3
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,430
 Taeyang Group CEO Choi Kang Ju Wedding Announcement Press Conference

4
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,720
The reason I stand before you today,

5
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,320
is to introduce you to the woman I plan on spending the rest of my life with.

6
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,460
As the future wife of Taeyang Group,

7
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,500
and the person who will be paving the future of Taeyang Group alongside me ...

8
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,310
At an event where I am introducing the person I plan on spending my life with,

9
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,150
it does not seem right

10
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,890
to be reciting a pre-written speech.

11
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,750
I met a woman.

12
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,420
At first, I had no feelings or interest in her.

13
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,860
Since she was someone arranged for me to marry.

14
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,600
But then ...

15
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,010
 There are plenty of other people to fill that spot.

16
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,330
 As time passed, I found myself falling for her more and more.

17
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,740
 I think the mom died.

18
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,500
 It was the first time I felt that way.

19
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:40,070
 Love found me when I didn't believe in love. She was my first love.

20
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,360
There were times we almost broke up.

21
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,150
Because of the rumors that surrounded my family.

22
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,220
 But ... but it wasn't that way for me.

23
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,670
 My heart ...

24
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,870
 I tried to leave her.

25
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,140
 Don't go!

26
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,610
 But she didn't leave my side.

27
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,330
 I love you.

28
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,950
 We had our own private wedding.

29
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:44,990
 With the sunshine, breeze, and trees blessing us.

30
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,100
 We swore our love for each other and promised to spend the rest of our lives together.

31
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:07,750
I, Choi Kang Ju, will introduce the woman I will spend the rest of my life with.

32
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,720
That woman's name is ...

33
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,220
Na Doo Rim.

34
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,620
Who is the woman named Na Doo Rim?

35
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,580
Are you saying there is another woman other than your fiancÃ©e?

36
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,960
Are you breaking the engagement with Jang Yi Gyeong?

37
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,950
What do you mean Na Doo Rim?

38
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,950
Was Kang Ju really seeing another woman?

39
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,800
This is from the secretary's office.

40
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,920
What is this?

41
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,520
They look identical,

42
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,980
so it seems she acted like Jang Yi Gyeong all that time.

43
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,640
How is this possible?

44
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,980
Chairman! Chairman! Chairman!

45
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,660
This is a declaration of war.

46
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,390
I'm going to make you regret this until the day you die.

47
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,940
I'll make you feel this anger and humiliation a million times over.

48
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,770
I look forward to it.

49
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,590
Make sure you check every article and press release that comes out from this point forward.

50
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,190
Block any false reports and speculations.

51
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,280
If any information get leaked about Na Doo Rim,

52
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,630
then the both of you can submit your resignation.

53
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,180
Yes, I understand.

54
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,270
Now you're acting more like yourself.

55
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,810
Is that a compliment?

56
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,530
Of all the things I've seen you do, that was truly the best.

57
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,980
At least there's one person on my side.

58
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,730
There's going to be a lot more to do from now on. Thanks for your help.

59
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,260
Doo Rim, Doo Rim. You're in trouble.

60
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,760
What's wrong?

61
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,950
You're going to pass out.

62
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,160
Choi Kang Ju made a shocking announcement.

63
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,230
A shocking announcement?

64
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,910
Take a look at this.

65
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,300
 Taeyang Group Successor Choi Kang Ju Makes Shocking Announcement! Breaks Up with Fiancee Jang Yi Gyeong!

66
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,960
What happened? Did you really not know?

67
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,280
Hello Young Master.

68
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,470
How's Father?

69
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,210
Dr. Kang just stopped by a little while ago.

70
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,130
He said he'll be okay after resting for a few days.

71
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,990
I told you. What did I say. I told you it was strange.

72
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,550
I know.

73
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,400
Father.

74
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,330
I'm sorry. I knew you would be shocked.

75
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,730
But I couldn't hide my feelings any longer.

76
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,790
I'm very sorry.

77
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,920
There's nothing to be sorry about.

78
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,560
I'm ... fine so don't worry.

79
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,210
Father.

80
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,100
You didn't do anything wrong.

81
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,350
All the wrongdoings ... you were just trying to make things right.

82
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:48,330
So her name is ... Na Doo Rim?

83
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,130
Yes.

84
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:06,430
From now on... there are going to be a lot of things you'll have to endure.

85
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm prepared.

86
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,310
Please keep a close eye on the media and make sure nothing is leaked.

87
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,520
You know very well,

88
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,740
the stocks drop even if my father gets cold medicine due to the fear he might pass.

89
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,800
Yes. We will have the PR team on constant watch.

90
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,420
And also ...

91
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:41,190
It seems your mother gave Jang Yi Gyeong her shares of the department store.

92
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:46,200
She did it without anyone knowing, so we only found out about it recently.

93
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,750
Please don't tell my father.

94
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,940
I'll take care of it.

95
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,190
I'm sorry, Mother.

96
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,380
It's not like we can pick up spilled water.

97
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,370
It's too late to be pointing fingers.

98
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,300
Everything seems like it's my fault.

99
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,300
Truthfully, there's something I haven't told you.

100
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,950
Are you talking about the shares you transferred?

101
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,160
The choice I made for your sake,

102
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,870
in the end, it made it more difficult for you.

103
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,980
Taeyang Group won't fall so easily.

104
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,790
I will protect it. Just trust me.

105
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,930
 The woman's name is ... Na Doo Rim.

106
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,950
I won't forgive him. Ever!

107
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,670
You used to shake with fear when you saw me.

108
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,860
I'm not afraid of you any longer.

109
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,630
The only thing I'm afraid of now is how I will change from here on out.

110
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:08,530
Two people who are similar yet different. One is the bright sun.

111
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,980
The other is the sun's shadow.

112
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,960
In the end, you became nothing but a shadow.

113
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,000
That's not true. It's not over yet.

114
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,940
Nothing is final until I say so.

115
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:31,620
Be warned. Only you can create the path to your future.

116
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,240
If you cannot control the fire burning within you,

117
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,800
then you will not be able to live even as a shadow.

118
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,500
No! I'm not the shadow! I'm not!

119
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,910
 Taste of Doo Rim

120
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,510
Hey, dummy. Where are you off to so early?

121
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,130
Excuse me. Can't you hear me?

122
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,810
You created a huge mess. It's not like you're a little kid.

123
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,220
How were you planning on cleaning this up?

124
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,320
Now do you understand how I feel?

125
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,790
How hard I worked to clean up after all the messes you made.

126
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,000
Can you really joke right now?

127
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,630
Compared to you, all the things I've done is nothing.

128
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,660
You said you're curious as to what's going on inside my head?

129
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,410
I'm curious as to what's going inside of your head.

130
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,500
Where are you going?

131
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,310
Here.

132
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,990
What is this?

133
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,370
A gift for your discharge. Try them on.

134
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,410
Oppa, you're the best. Congratulations on your discharge.

135
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,420
You two over there. Aren't you being too much? I'm standing right here.

136
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,820
Do you not have hands or feet?

137
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,380
Do you not know how to tie your necktie?

138
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,140
Can't you put on your own shoes?

139
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,230
She used to tie my ties for me all the time. She does a better job than I do.

140
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,540
Why did you follow me all the way here and cause a ruckus? You should be congratulating him.

141
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,910
Think about how you would feel if you were me.

142
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,510
Would you be able to congratulate him?

143
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,200
Oppa, let's go. Grandma is waiting.

144
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,020
You really went through a lot.

145
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,190
Director, congratulations on your discharge.

146
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,460
Drink this before it gets cold.

147
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,700
Grandma bought the marrow and cooked it all night.

148
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,860
There's nothing better than marrow to help heal your bones.

149
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,750
Thank you.

150
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:55,070
Try this too. Abalone is the best for regaining your strength.

151
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,640
Oppa, try this too.

152
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,830
It's the grilled sea bream you like.

153
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,530
Aren't you all better now?

154
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,420
You didn't hurt your arm. Can't you eat it by yourself?

155
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,670
Oppa is still a patient.

156
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,420
Why ... Why is this boy here again?

157
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,400
He came to congratulate me on my discharge.

158
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,890
Do you two know each other?

159
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,530
Let me introduce myself. My name is Choi Kang Ju.

160
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm your guest. Shouldn't you at least give me some water?

161
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,540
It's ... it's over there. Get it yourself.

162
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,840
 We will be closed starting today.

163
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,120
 My grandma and I have decided to return to our hometown by the ocean.

164
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,030
 Thank you to each and every customer who hasvisited us.

165
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,130
 We wish you a happy and healthy life.

166
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,930
What is this?

167
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,200
I was going to tell you once you got discharged.

168
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,360
Says who? Without my permission, you're not allowed to go anywhere.

169
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,740
Understand?

170
00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:00,370
Na Doo Rim. If you can't come to me, I'll go to you.

171
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,930
I'm sorry it took me so long.

172
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:12,300
Let me formally introduce myself. I'm Choi Kang Ju.

173
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,930
It's nice to meet you, Na Doo Rim.

174
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:32,300
â«  Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you.  â«

175
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,540
â«  Just come to me  â«

176
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,830
What are you doing?

177
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,280
What do you think you're ...

178
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,020
I'm sorry.

179
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,000
I know you don't like me.

180
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,590
But I can't stay away.

181
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,840
I don't think I can go on without your granddaughter.

182
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,200
â«  Forever  â«

183
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,960
The market was slowly rising,

184
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,260
but rumors of the Chairman's condition started to spread causing our stocks to drop again.

185
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,170
Stop our investments in Ohsung Construction immediately.

186
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,650
Also, reinvest stocks in the department store.

187
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,390
Make sure there's nothing left for them to hold onto.

188
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,300
Yes, I understand.

189
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,480
To stop the rumors from getting out of control, we blocked all the news articles and internet posts.

190
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,790
And in case of an emergency, we already prepared an official statement.

191
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,390
I'm a pretty useful ally, aren't I?

192
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:50,490
The rumors are just the start, what they really want ...

193
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,260
Is to shake up Taeyang Group.

194
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,360
Do you have a way to stop them?

195
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,760
In a war, there's a winner or a loser. You can only be one of the two.

196
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,380
If I were going to be a loser, I wouldn't have started this in the first place.

197
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:25,160
Doo Rim. Sit down.

198
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,770
Doo Rim. I heard everything from Jin Ju.

199
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,070
That boy ... I heard he's the son of Taeyang Group.

200
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,380
Grandma, you must have been really shocked.

201
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,440
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

202
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,910
Doo Rim. I don't like it.

203
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:02,510
Those people and us are like oil and water. We can't mix well together.

204
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,790
If we get involved with a household like theirs,

205
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,600
you'll only suffer.

206
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,950
Grandma.

207
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,600
This is all my fault.

208
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,060
If it wasn't for my surgery fees ...

209
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,940
you would have no reason to get involved with them.

210
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,690
It's because I have a lot of sins. Lots of sins.

211
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,800
Grandma, why are you speaking like that?

212
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,770
What have you done wrong?

213
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,580
Oh my pitiful child.

214
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:58,940
You couldn't say anything that whole time. How hurt you must have been.

215
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,570
Grandma.

216
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,440
 Taste of Doo Rim

217
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,020
Welcome.

218
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,070
Father.

219
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,380
It's been awhile.

220
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,950
It tastes better since it's free.

221
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,380
Why do you keep staring at me like that? You're embarrassing me.

222
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,180
I didn't think I would ever see you again.

223
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,970
You cherished and trusted me more than anyone else.

224
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,190
I'm really sorry.

225
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,890
I really wanted to ask for your forgiveness.

226
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:48,450
If you ... decided to never show up in front of us,

227
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,230
then that would have been unforgivable.

228
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,540
Everything's fine now that you've returned.

229
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,680
That's enough.

230
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,220
Father.

231
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:13,120
During that time ... I know you were hurt both physically and emotionally.

232
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,570
Now you should just live life comfortably.

233
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:19,960
And ... if you're going through a hard time, you have to let me know.

234
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,470
Father, your soup is getting cold. Hurry and eat.

235
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,350
Okay.

236
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,210
This soup is really delicious.

237
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,940
It's really good.

238
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,630
Oh my goodness. She put a lot of care into this.

239
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,830
And the colors are beautiful. Should we taste some?

240
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,170
And the seasoning is just right.

241
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,560
What is that?

242
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:59,300
Oh yes. The Chairman stopped by Miss Doo Rim's restaurant today.

243
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,760
And she sent back food to serve him for dinner.

244
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,650
Why don't you come and taste some? It's delicious.

245
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,270
I'm fine.

246
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,730
She must not like her.

247
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:24,150
Of course not. She had it all planned out and then it backfired.

248
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,600
It's like trying to choose fine silk but ending up with burlap.

249
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,880
Or she could have been picking burlap and ended up with silk.

250
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,130
That could be true too.

251
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:58,350
 In an instant, I crushed someone else's life.

252
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,580
Is this why Mother thought the wedding would definitely happen?

253
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,580
It's tomorrow. If that gets exposed tomorrow,

254
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,290
it will be a sight to see.

255
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:17,220
Yi Gyeong. I want you to be happy more than anyone else.

256
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,410
If I happiness is something I could share, I would give you all that I have.

257
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,460
Do you still not get it?

258
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,290
If you hurt other people, there's no way you can be happy.

259
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,520
Jealousy, obsession, greed.

260
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,550
You can call it whatever you want.

261
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,590
I'm going to make them suffer as much as I have suffered.

262
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,570
You said you wanted me to be happy, right?

263
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:53,190
Choi Kang Ju. Na Doo Rim. If those two people become unhappy, then I will be happy.

264
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,570
 Lease Agreement

265
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,340
Oppa, how do you have this?

266
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,980
I'm doing this as a favor for Choi Kang Ju.

267
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,790
To not let you go anywhere.

268
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,830
You don't have to worry that my mother will take this all away.

269
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,220
Choi Kang Ju bought this restaurant.

270
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,760
So you can keep living comfortably.

271
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,200
- But ... 
 - Choi Kang Ju,

272
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,570
put everything he has on the line so that he can have you.

273
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,140
What are you talking about?

274
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,530
My mother is holding onto a secret.

275
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,000
He knew all of that and still chose you.

276
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,660
 Taeyang Department Store

277
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,690
Leave the files on my desk.

278
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
What's with you so early in the morning?

279
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,880
Was there something wrong at the restaurantâ

280
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,940
Hey. Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

281
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,560
In a professional office?

282
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,500
Why didn't you tell me?

283
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,250
Yi Hyeon told me everything.

284
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,590
Why did you do that?

285
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,460
You could have lost everything.

286
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,110
But I got you, Na Doo Rim.

287
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,490
You're my everything.

288
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,210
It's not a losing business.

289
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:17,280
You're obviously losing from this business.

290
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:22,970
Don't worry. You said I'm smart.

291
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,800
You told me that I will do better than anyone.

292
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,500
I'm Choi Kang Joo. Don't you trust me?

293
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,700
Fine.

294
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:41,590
If something goes wrong with you, I'll make a living for you.

295
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:46,930
I'll manage the restaurant well.

296
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,970
Okay. Also, that was not free.

297
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,670
Pay it all later on with interest.

298
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,250
I'm sorry.

299
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,320
Thank you.

300
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,790
I heard that you completely stopped your investment towards our Ohsung Construction.

301
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,950
You have also blocked the customer lines.

302
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,080
Do you think I'll stop because you did that?

303
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,960
No. Don't stop.

304
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
Do as you want.

305
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,270
However, we will also do everything that we can do.

306
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,890
We have nothing to lose anymore.

307
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,020
Whether it be the company or Yi Kyeong, they've become a total mess.

308
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,610
Even if we get cornered on the edge of a cliff,

309
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,460
we won't be the only ones who will die.

310
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,070
I'm not sure who will be hurt more by this,

311
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,340
but one thing is for sure,

312
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,340
I was foolish to think I could cover the sky with the palm of my hand.

313
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:09,100
If only I had the courage back then to take one more step forward,

314
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,200
we wouldn't be here right now.

315
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,190
Let's end our relationship here.

316
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,810
Then ...

317
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:29,140
You can act classy and elegant all you want, but you're just the daughter of a murderer.

318
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:35,540
I'm curious how you will feel being labeled a murderer's daughter for the rest of your life.

319
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:46,630
If you're curious, then ask your daughter.

320
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,790
Isn't your daughter the same as me?

321
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:57,850
When your mask finally comes off to reveal your cruel and pathetic schemes,

322
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:04,530
there will be a day when everything you said to me will come back to your daughter and pierce her heart.

323
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,520
Tell Manager Park to get in here immediately.

324
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,150
I will take your mask off myself.

325
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,810
Release it to the media immediately.

326
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,170
Yes, I understand.

327
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:44,260
Also, those men from before, you made sure none of that will be traced back to us, right?

328
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,660
Don't worry.

329
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,510
I watched them leave for Macau with my own eyes.

330
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,340
The reason I am standing in front of you today,

331
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:47,200
is to reveal our family's rather embarrassing history.

332
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,340
 It's only right for us to admit our wrongdoings first, Mother.

333
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:55,160
 At first, I was only interested in covering the truth too.

334
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:01,050
 But we can only move on if we admit our wrongs and ask for forgiveness.

335
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:09,030
 If we can't be the first to admit it, then no one will be able to acknowledge us now or in the future.

336
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:15,470
 I will tell Father.

337
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:20,100
 No. I will tell him.

338
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,210
 I want to tell him.

339
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,550
 Your first love ...

340
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,670
 It's all ...

341
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,860
 Because of me.

342
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,980
 Because of me ... my mother ...

343
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,740
 Took an innocent life.

344
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,300
 How did you ...

345
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,880
 Did your mother tell you?

346
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,580
 You ...

347
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,570
 Since when have you known?

348
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,580
 If you knew, then why?

349
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:22,810
Thirty years ago, my grandmother committed a crime and took an innocent life.

350
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,160
 Thank you Myeong Hee.

351
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,280
 For allowing me to leave this world feeling as light as a feather.

352
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,160
 Mom.

353
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:45,210
 If we meet again in the next life,

354
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,610
 then come back as my daughter.

355
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,100
 So that I can pay back even just a little of what you've given me.

356
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,740
I will accept any sort of criticism.

357
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,920
And we will not avoid any legal punishment and  moral responsibility.

358
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,630
 We send our deepest apologies to the family of the deceased.

359
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,700
 And beg for their forgiveness.

360
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,240
Choi Kang Ju was one step ahead of us.

361
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,970
Now all we'll be doing is revealing old news.

362
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,770
So he gave us a piece of his flesh,

363
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,740
and then cut off our bones.

364
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,120
It's so disgusting.

365
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:38,980
What now, Mom? Are we just going to take this?

366
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,110
Stop now.

367
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,280
Oppa, you like seeing us this way, don't you?

368
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,840
Do you feel better now?

369
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,320
Yes. This may be a good thing.

370
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,930
If this can stop you and mother ...

371
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,560
You can't help it when you're only half-related.

372
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,920
Mother!

373
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,320
It would be barely enough if you even tried to help us but what?

374
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,500
You want us to standby and watch while they suffocate us?

375
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,330
Please come back to your senses.

376
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:13,920
The people suffocating us isn't them, it's you.

377
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,860
Oppa. What are you doing right now?

378
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,700
It's probably Manager Park. Go ahead.

379
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,450
- Mother, please! 
 - I don't want to hear it.

380
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,700
If you're going to talk nonsense, then go up to your room.

381
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:49,150
Who are you people?

382
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,510
Are you Ma Jae Ran?

383
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,290
You are under arrest for the attempted murder of Na Doo Rim. Arrest her.

384
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,950
- What are you doing right now? 
 - Mom. Let go of her.

385
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,170
Let her go. I said let her go!

386
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,900
Mom!

387
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:12,160
Mom! Mom! Mom!

388
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,930
Yi Gyeong. Yi Gyeong.

389
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,910
Oppa.

390
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,130
Thank you Doo Rim.

391
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:43,950
You were the one who was more hurt and scarred than me.

392
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:50,710
At first, for your sake, I wanted to make her pay the price.

393
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:59,580
But ... I couldn't in case things got more difficult for you.

394
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,600
Mom are you okay?

395
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,830
I'm okay.

396
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,690
Don't worry.

397
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,870
It's times like these where you need to focus and stay strong.

398
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,130
You understand what I'm saying, right?

399
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:31,320
Lawyer Kang said that unless those men confess, it will be hard to charge you with anything.

400
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,190
And Na Doo Rim already gave a statement that she wasnt harmed.

401
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:41,460
All of this is Kang Ju's Mother's doing.

402
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,860
Seeing as how the men who fled to Macau were all captured,

403
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,800
she'll try to do whatever she can to have me sentenced.

404
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,680
And the police won't be able to ignore anything from Taeyang Group.

405
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,770
This is frustrating and unfair. I have no power.

406
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,460
 Jang Yi Gyeong

407
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,470
Those are the Taeyang Group stocks you gave me.

408
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:49,480
In exchange, please stop my mother's investigation.

409
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,400
The police told me,

410
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,710
it would be faster to try to convince you to stop the investigation.

411
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:03,080
Isn't your request much considering you're just giving me back what's mine?

412
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:09,400
Our company, my mother, and myself ...

413
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,310
All of our limbs have been bitten off.

414
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,220
What more do you want from us?

415
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,100
You've done as much as you can.

416
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:21,710
Do you think this is enough to pay for your wrongdoings?

417
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,370
Your mother asked me,

418
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,690
how does it feel to live as a murderer's daughter?

419
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,880
How do you feel right now?

420
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:40,690
I don't think I have to tell you how I feel.

421
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,080
It felt like I was throwing up blood and wishing I was dead.

422
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,120
I couldn't blame my mother for her crime.

423
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:57,030
Because of a daughter like me, she had to get blood on her hands.

424
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,930
In the end, you and I are both criminals.

425
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,250
What drove our mothers to that point,

426
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:11,110
was because of the undying desire within us.

427
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,760
I beg you.

428
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,380
Please ... my mother ...

429
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,190
What is this?

430
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,350
It belonged to your first love.

431
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:02,190
Your mother held onto it and gave it to me right before she passed.

432
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,870
Along with her request to protect the annex.

433
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:37,490
 Declaration of Divorce

434
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,250
I want to put everything down now.

435
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,760
Wanting a man who has another woman in his heart.

436
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,560
Trying to find a good woman for our Kang Ju,

437
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,450
In the end, it was to fulfill my own selfish desires.

438
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:06,930
As a wife and mother, I am unqualified.

439
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:16,250
I can't say I never wished something bad would happen to your first love.

440
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:22,470
I'll have to spend the rest of my life paying for the crime I committed in my heart.

441
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,490
To protect our family, to protect our Kang Ju ...

442
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,810
When the things I've spend years building broke in a matter of seconds,

443
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:42,930
it felt like a pillar that was holding me up had collapsed.

444
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,730
Honey.

445
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,420
I think I've done as much as I could now.

446
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,310
Leaving this house is all I have left to do.

447
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,980

448
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,930
 Bride of the Century
