1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,710
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:27,070

3
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,960
What is this?

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,660
It's a keepsake from your first love.

5
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:47,330
Mother had been holding onto it, but she gave it to me before she passed.

6
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,350
Along with her request to protect the annex.

7
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,290
I want to put everything down now.

8
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,980
Wanting a man who has another woman in his heart.

9
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,750
Trying to find a good woman for our Kang Ju.

10
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,940
In the end, it was all to fulfill my own selfish desires.

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,620
I have no right as a wife or a mother.

12
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:01,680
I can't say I never hoped something bad against your first love.

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,810
I will have to spend the rest of my life paying for the crime I committed in my heart.

14
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,340
That is how I can protect our household, protect Kang Ju.

15
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,050
The second everything I had spent years believing just came crashing down,

16
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:27,280
it felt like the pillars supporting me just fell apart.

17
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,660
Honey.

18
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,840
I've done as much as I could.

19
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,940
Leaving this house is my last step.

20
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,440
Hey, we have to go to the red clay room first.

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,250
That way it can make our pores smaller.

22
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,770
- Alright. 
 - Let's go!

23
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,000
My body is so achy, I need to go roast somewhere hot.

24
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,730
- Hello, Grandmother. 
 - Why are you here so late?

25
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,570
What do you think? I thought I might want to see you, so I made time to come here.

26
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,260
Chairman.  We were about to go to a sauna. Do you want to come?

27
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,210
A sauna?

28
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,310
- Don't force him if he doesn't want to come. 
 - No!

29
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,960
I'll go. To the sauna.

30
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,340
There, all done.

31
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,120
What is this?

32
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,070
Why? It's cute.

33
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,490
- It's your first time at a sauna, isn't it? 
 - Yeah.

34
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,480
But why do people sleep here when they have their own homes?

35
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,560
Times like this, your life seems so boring.

36
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,010
What's the point of being rich if you don't know how to have fun?

37
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,990
Ta-da! The rice punch has arrived!

38
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,040
Ta-da!

39
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,910
Oh, my throat is dry.

40
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,130
That really hits the spot.

41
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,200
You sweat as much as you can, then drink cold rice punch in one shot.

42
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,140
This is the joy of saunas.

43
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,830
You're right.

44
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,090
- Try it. 
 - I don't really like sweet stuff.

45
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,300
It's good, try it.

46
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,730
Don't you feel like your insides are being totally refreshed?

47
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,170
Maybe it's because I'm here. It's good.

48
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,510
Who wouldn't think you're a stonehead? That was quite a sound.

49
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,520
Ready, go!

50
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,200
Hey, go play your game over there.

51
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,160
- There's a grandmother sleeping here. 
 - No.

52
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,070
You rude little thing. Go over there.

53
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,290
I'm a businessman.

54
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,440
Here. I'll give you this so go over there and get yourself a snack.

55
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,380
Wow!

56
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,840
This is my spot.

57
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,960
- Why are you taking a picture of me while I'm sleeping? 
 - You weren't sleeping?

58
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,550
Give that to me.

59
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,400
- What are you doing with my phone? 
 - Give it!

60
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,450
- Let go! 
 - You let go!

61
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,860
Hand it over! Ow!

62
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,410
Grandmother, this is just a misunderstanding.

63
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,960
That's not it, we were, uh...

64
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,950
Your grandmother is so cool.

65
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,580
- Give it. 
 - Hey!

66
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,650
Why are all your pictures of girls?

67
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,720
They're juniors from my school.

68
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,380
And I didn't take choose to take the pictures, they took them on their own.

69
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,020
So, why are all your juniors female?

70
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,400
And totally pretty juniors at that.

71
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,800
Why don't you have a picture of me?

72
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,280
You're unbelievable.

73
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,340
That's why I was trying to take a picture of you.

74
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,740
All the other girls are styled so nicely in their pictures

75
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,830
and you're okay with a picture of me in sauna clothes?

76
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,730
- Come here. 
 - No. 
 - Come on.

77
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,230
I don't want to!

78
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,250
- Ready. 
 - No. No!

79
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,160
Look here.

80
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,950
Look at the camera.

81
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,340
One, two, three.

82
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,400
You're so ugly.

83
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,040
- You're like the ugly duckling. 
 - What?

84
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,100
After Taeyang Group pulled their investments, other investors also pulled out.

85
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,720
We have no choice but to sell Gyeonggi-do Apartments and our remaining stocks.

86
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,940
It looks like all of our remaining assets will be sold for pennies.

87
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,730
The media is already talking about mergers and acquisitions.

88
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,540
We've become the perfect prey for Taeyang Group.

89
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,250
I'm sure the creditors will be after us soon,

90
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,150
and start auctioning everything off.

91
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,270
But once the resort in Namhae is complete, we can potentially turn things around.

92
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,080
So don't worry too much.

93
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,090
We're hanging on by a thread.

94
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,370
How long do you think we can last?

95
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,790
Stop drinking.

96
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,990
I have to at least drink this to be able to sleep.

97
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,560
Noona, you're Na Doo Rim?

98
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,590
- That's amazing. You look exactly alike. 
 - It's been awhile Kang In.

99
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,530
I came here as soon as I landed.

100
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,270
While I was performing overseas, a lot of crazy things have been happening.

101
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,450
He kept bugging me to see you so I brought him here.

102
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,700
Come have a seat.

103
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,930
Shouldn't you give us a congratulatory drink?

104
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:03,630
Is this like a welcome back party for me returning from spreading k-pop around the world?

105
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:09,460
No. It's to congratulate Kang Ju and Na Doo Rim on officially becoming a couple.

106
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,140
- Then I want to go. 
 - Sit down Choi Kang In.

107
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,510
Yes Noona. I should sit down. Of course I should stay.

108
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,570
Okay. The congratulatory drinks are on me.

109
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,270
If that's the case, we can't leave out the other star of the party. I'll give Hyung a call.

110
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,180
So how is Yi Gyeong doing?

111
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:38,040
Yi Hyeon hasn't stopped by lately either. It seems like their company isn't doing very well.

112
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,160
Why? Did you think I would be a mess?

113
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,130
Are you disappointed because I'm not?

114
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,800
I didn't come here because I wanted to.

115
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,430
- Someone asked for a favor so I came here against my will. 
 - What?

116
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,360
After everything, Na Doo Rim still has empathy for others.

117
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,760
She asked me to check on how you and your mother are doing.

118
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,320
She made it herself.

119
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,610
She wants to you to take care of yourself so you can bounce back from all this.

120
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,660
Do you think we're bums or something?

121
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,050
Do I look that pathetic?

122
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,850
Do you feel bad for me?

123
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,750
Are you playing games with me right now?

124
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,880
Alright. This is more like Jang Yi Gyeong.

125
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,860
This is better than acting like you're okay.

126
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,230
How much more do I have to suffer for you to feel better?

127
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:55,380
You've already seen me at rock bottom. So if you've seen what you needed to see, don't come by anymore.

128
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,630
It's not like you and I were ever friends anyway.

129
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:07,210
If you have the energy to be mad, then you must be okay.

130
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:12,370
I won't have to worry about you. I'll leave now.

131
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,490
Na Doo Rim!

132
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:03,530
 No. No. No. No. No!

133
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,440
What are you doing?

134
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,880
Why are you here so early?

135
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,900
Aren't you going to work?

136
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,510
That's why I'm here.

137
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,970
Tie it for me too.

138
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,090
I'm asking you to tie it for me too.

139
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,660
Then I can go to work.

140
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,600
You came all the way this early in the morning for this?

141
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,230
Okay. Hand it over.

142
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,060
Are you trying to choke me to death?

143
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,350
You asked me to tie it for you.

144
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,450
Wait a minute.

145
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,910
How did I ... This isn't it.

146
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,780
Who wouldn't say you're a dummy? You can't even remember that?

147
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,730
- What is your IQ exactly? 
 - Be quiet. You're confusing me.

148
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,700
How can I be quiet right now? You have no problem doing this for other men.

149
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,830
Who asked you to come here first thing in the morning for this?

150
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,450
Today ...

151
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,330
Don't go anywhere.

152
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,180
Don't even ride a car.

153
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,480
So ...

154
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,710
- Just stay here. 
 - Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

155
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,930
I'll be stopping by tonight to greet your grandmother, so just stay here.

156
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,920
- Okay? 
 - Okay. I'll be waiting for you.

157
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,550
All done.

158
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,870
You should leave for work now, President Choi Kang Ju

159
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,110
I'm leaving.

160
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:26,200
For now, go stay with your aunt in Sydney.

161
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:32,340
Things are getting crazy with the company and people are continuing to talk.

162
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,400
Go cool down and get some rest.

163
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,830
Mom.

164
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,810
What will be the most painful revenge?

165
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,530
Will it be enough to take away the most important thing in his life?

166
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,630
- Yi Gyeong. 
 - I would be happy if Na Doo Rim just disappears.

167
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,630
She took everything away from me.

168
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,400
I wish this was a bad dream.

169
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,210
But nothing changes after I wake up.

170
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,670
I feel abandoned in an empty world.

171
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,780
Don't say such a thing. You have me.

172
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,910
I'm not going down like this.

173
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,390
I will do everything to save this company and you can start over too.

174
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,500
Until then, just stay with your aunt until then.

175
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,140
Mom.

176
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,180
You know, don't you?

177
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,360
Being your daughter ...

178
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,510
I never once regretted it.

179
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,950
Thank you for everything.

180
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,560
Yi Gyeong...

181
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:11,290
Mom. No matter where I am,

182
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,120
I will always be with you.

183
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,170
Maybe I should have asked you before I bought it?

184
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,910
What if she doesn't like it?

185
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,980
Okay.

186
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm leaving now. I'll be there soon so wait for me.

187
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,560
Okay.

188
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,140
 Jang Yi Gyeong

189
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,430
I'm leaving for Sydney tomorrow.

190
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,230
I have something to give you before I leave.

191
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,710
It won't take long.

192
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,870
Okay. I'll wait for you.

193
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:44,190
The person you risked your life for,  he's in danger.

194
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,330
What a weird dream.

195
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,950
It wasn't a dream.

196
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,600
Doo Rim.

197
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,530
Shouldn't Choi Kang Ju be here by now?

198
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,020
Did something happen?

199
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,290
 Na Doo Rim

200
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,570
You're leaving tomorrow?

201
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,120
Once I leave, I may never come back.

202
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,950
Today may be the last time I see you.

203
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:30,120
Do you remember the first day we met?

204
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,280
Of course you wouldn't remember.

205
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,610
We saw each other for less than a minute.

206
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,670
But you remember this, right?

207
00:23:54,350 --> 00:24:00,280
- This is ... 
 - It was Ru Mi's 22nd birthday party.

208
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,080
I was there too.

209
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:10,580
Champagne was spilled on you and when you took off your blazer, you lost your cufflinks.

210
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,990
You found one but couldn't find the other.

211
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,750
I found it but didn't want to give it back to you.

212
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,410
I just wanted to have it.

213
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,840
I'll give it back to you now.

214
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,200
Because it was never mine to begin with.

215
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,190
I should go now. I have somewhere to be.

216
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,550
Let's have a farewell drink together.

217
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,660
For the last time.

218
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:15,030
 Mom, no matter where I am,

219
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,380
 I will always be with you.

220
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,300
- Are you leaving now? 
 - I need to get home.

221
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,100
Yi Gyeong was acting strange.

222
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,560
 Due to a personal matter, we are closed today.

223
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,230
Don't worry. He'll be here soon.

224
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,240
I'm sure he's fine.

225
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,080
What do you think happened?

226
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:45,290
What impression will I leave behind in your mind?

227
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,100
I hope you forget all the bad memories,

228
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,330
and I hope you find happiness and health.

229
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,860
I have one last request.

230
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,290
Our company is everything to my mom and brother.

231
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,270
Since I was in fact your fiancee at one point,

232
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:17,150
can you help protect their company for old times' sake?

233
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,590
I'm putting aside my last ounce of self-respect to ask you for this favor.

234
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,330
Okay. I'll think about it.

235
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,380
Then ...

236
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,400
Goodbye Kang Ju.

237
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,650
Kang Ju, where are you?

238
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,440
You weren't picking up your phone so I thought something bad happened.

239
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,380
Take your time and drive carefully.

240
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,210
What did I tell you? I told you everything would be fine.

241
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,240
Ah, when will I ever experience such a romantic relationship?

242
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,030
Then, it's time for the co-star to quietly leave.

243
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,440
I'll see you later.

244
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,330
I'll see you.

245
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,270
Yi Gyeong?

246
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,970
Yi Gyeong?

247
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:47,020
Yi Gyeong! Yi Gyeong!

248
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,100
- Yi Gyeong. 
 - Yi Gyeong. No. No.

249
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,390
This isn't right, Yi Gyeong.

250
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,150
We have an emergency. Hurry!

251
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:06,730
Yi Gyeong, no. No!

252
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,340
Yi Gyeong, wake up.

253
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,010
Yes, this is Choi Kang Ju.

254
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:38,210
Why does my Yi Gyeong have to disappear?

255
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,800
 The one who should disappear should not be my Yi Gyeong.

256
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,530
Just watch what a terrible choice it was

257
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:52,150
to choose that girl over my Yi Gyeong. I will follow you to hell,

258
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,340
and do whatever I can as Yi Gyeong mom.

259
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,250
Kang Ju?

260
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,670
Why are you ...

261
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,110
Because of you, my Yi Gyeong.

262
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,210
- What are you going to do about my Yi Gyeong? 
 - Why are you doing this?

263
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:26,090
If only you hadn't shown up, nothing would have happened to my Yi Gyeong.

264
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,620
Why did you show up in front of us? Why?

265
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,160
Why are you doing this?

266
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,090
The one who should die is not my Yi Gyeong.

267
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,920
You're the one who should die.

268
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,250
You should never have been born.

269
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:58,560
Die. Die!

270
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:35,890
You cruel wench. You finally show your true colors.

271
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,010
I've waited a long time for you.

272
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,170
You will not remember the 100 years I waited,

273
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,970
and why I've shown up in front of you.

274
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:52,580
You will finally pay for what you did.

275
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,600
 No!

276
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,200
 Mom!

277
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,140
Madam, your husband is here.

278
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,280
My Lord.

279
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,960
Welcome back, my Lord.

280
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,880
You're all grown up now Boon Yi.

281
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,160
You were just a little kid when I left.

282
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,940
I think she's ready to be married off now.

283
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,430
Don't even mention it. She's such a troublemaker, I'm worried if there's anyone who would take her.

284
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,230
Mother, you're always scolding me.

285
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:42,350
I'm going to live with my mom and ... my Unni forever. I'm never going to get married.

286
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,170
This is the first time we've met. What is your name?

287
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:55,340
Are you deaf? Why are you not answering?

288
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,180
Sir ...

289
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:25,230
On my way back from the temple, I had a sudden stomachache.

290
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,550
I was lost deep in the mountains.

291
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:35,370
That girl happened to be passing by and saved me.

292
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,340
She is deaf so she cannot talk.

293
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,340
She was like a wandering soul,

294
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,760
so I took pity on her and brought her here.

295
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,180
I had no idea and here I am asking if she's deaf.

296
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,330
She cannot hear not speak.

297
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,840
She doesn't even have a  name to call herself by.

298
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,870
It's okay. It's okay.

299
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,130
You're like a scared rabbit. I'm sorry I scared you.

300
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,370
That's extraordinary.

301
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:03,460
We merely grazed hands. How did you know I had a headache?

302
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:11,550
They say you can save a life or take a life with a single needle.

303
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:19,710
Your hand is a precious hand meant to save lives.

304
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,540
Ouch.

305
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,930
That hurts.

306
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,980
You helped me so I should repay you somehow.

307
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,260
Byul.  (T.N. Meaning Star)  Starting today, you will be called Byul.

308
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,290
What do you think? Do you like it?

309
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,480
Byul. Byul.

310
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,900
Byul.

311
00:40:50,200 --> 00:41:00,000

312
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,060
 Father. Mother.

313
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:46,410
 I will avenge your deaths by my own hand,

314
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,840
 and cut off this family's legacy.

315
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:57,700
 When all of this is over,

316
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:04,440
 I will follow you to where you are.

317
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:47,070
 Father. Forgive me.

318
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:56,820
 I was like a pebble in the street, being kicked from one place to another.

319
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,050
 But he came into my life and cherished me more than a flower.

320
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,070
 There was no way I couldn't love him.

321
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:16,020
 Please forgive me, Father.

322
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:26,330
What do you mean by that? Byul is the daughter of my enemy?

323
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,770
Based on what I uncovered,

324
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,280
Byul's family ran an herbal shop in the south village.

325
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,640
After joining the rebellion, her whole family was murdered.

326
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:42,020
Her family was sentenced to death by your father, who oversaw the case.

327
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,280
She hid her identity and approached your wife to seek revenge.

328
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,830
I don't believe it. I can't believe it.

329
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:55,920
You must. Your life was almost in danger.

330
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,430
This is a poison that causes you to spit up blood with just a small amount.

331
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,830
Why do you think she had this?

332
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,030
I let you in and swore my love to you.

333
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,250
How can you do this?

334
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:54,530
A person may be able to change overnight,

335
00:46:54,540 --> 00:47:00,390
but the woman I gave my heart to just put a knife in it.

336
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:07,320
Were you truly trying to put an end to my family's legacy?

337
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,560
By ...

338
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,130
killing me?

339
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:18,150
 No. It's not like that, my Lord.

340
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:23,060
 For a moment I did think about killing you.

341
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:29,320
 But my heart is already yours.

342
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,930
 Please believe me.

343
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:40,680
I cannot forgive you for betraying and humiliating my family.

344
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,670
 Please just kill me instead.

345
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:54,940
 If it's for you, I do not regret giving up my life.

346
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,070
 But ...

347
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,350
 my feelings for you ...

348
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:07,530
 were true. Please do not forget that.

349
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:44,190
Leave.

350
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:49,700
You are as good as dead to me. I do not know you.

351
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:55,570
I do not know your name either.

352
00:48:55,570 --> 00:49:00,350
We are two people who have never met.

353
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:03,750
I'm going to forget everything.

354
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:07,300
Declaring my love for you ...

355
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:12,140
All the memories of our love ...

356
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:20,380
All of it.

357
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,570
What if she bears a son?

358
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:16,310
He may have turned his back on her now but do you think he would be able to ignore the mother of his child?

359
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,470
I have an idea.

360
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,230
Just a little bit more.

361
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:32,600
Unni, just a little more.

362
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:36,780
- Just a little more. 
 - Just a bit more.

363
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,700
Just push a little more.

364
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,860
Just a bit more.

365
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,270
Unni.

366
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:56,080
He's a prince.

367
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,440
Boon Yi, go and get more hot water.

368
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,550
Okay, Mother.

369
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,370
While giving birth to that child,

370
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:40,000
you both died.

371
00:51:55,310 --> 00:52:00,800
 No. My baby ... Please ... Just the baby.

372
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,640
 Just save the baby.

373
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,370
No!

374
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,660
Mom!

375
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:01,670
Given how things turned out, this child is now my child.

376
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:07,490
Since I have not been able to carry on the family's name, I will consider him a gift from heaven.

377
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:13,860
Throw out that girl's body so no one can find it.

378
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:20,830
Destroy all the remnants of that girl so not even a strand of hair is left.

379
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:32,270
And you need to leave immediately.

380
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,300
No cause is without a consequence.

381
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:16,270
Until the heavens punish you, you will not be free of what you've done.

382
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,820
Na Doo Rim. Na Doo Rim!

383
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:08,030
Wake up, Na Doo Rim. Na Doo Rim. Wake up, Na Doo Rim. Na Doo Rim.

384
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,420
 Bride of the Century
