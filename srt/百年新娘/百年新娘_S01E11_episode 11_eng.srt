00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,510
 Bride Of The Century

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000

3
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,770
What happened?  Doo Rim! Doo Rim, wake up!

4
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,290
Doo Rim! Doo Rim!

5
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,550
 It appears she had a momentary shock from being overworked.

6
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,160
 She must have absolute rest for a while.

7
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,750
 Yi Gyeong's Mother

8
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,470
Hello, ma'am.

9
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,730
What?

10
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,230
Grandma, we have a customer.

11
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,100
Oh, we do.

12
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,040
Just a moment, please.

13
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,490
Doo Rim!

14
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,830
Are you the owner of this place?

15
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,890
Yes.

16
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,230
I made a difficult journey here to see the grand opening,

17
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,960
but the owner wasn't here so I sat here alone,

18
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,390
just drinking plain water.

19
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,050
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,960
Anyway, where did Doo Rim go?

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,000
But the energy in this place is quite strange.

22
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,170
A mountain in the back and river in the front favors health and longevity,

23
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,440
bringing about success and wealth.

24
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,040
There are spirits lingering here.

25
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,240
Everything about this place is nice and all,

26
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,360
but the owner may experience some bad luck unexpectedly.

27
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
What is that supposed to mean?

28
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,990
There is nothing free in life, ma'am.

29
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,980
If I have some alcohol to wet my throat,

30
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,200
and a nice meal to eat, maybe my mouth will feel like talking.

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,180
Oh, goodness, let's do that.

32
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,970
Wait.

33
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,490
Could you make it the most expensive dish here?

34
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:36,620
Of course! Please wait just a little bit.

35
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,180
Salt.

36
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,960
Grandma, what are you doing?

37
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,370
You look normal on the outside, but have you got nothing better to do?

38
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,330
What, did you look down on me because I'm old?

39
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,500
Did you think I wouldn't know you were

40
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,400
trying to scam me with that three-inch long tongue of yours?

41
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,360
Scam you? You must not know who I am.

42
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,220
I am a very powerful person.

43
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,880
I even studied the four pillars of destiny at Jinri Mountain for years!

44
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,630
Look at this punk.

45
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,270
How many times do you have to be beaten to snap out of it!

46
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,720
You dung fly bastard!

47
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,730
Ma'am, it hurts!

48
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,330
Hey! You better not come back here, you hear?

49
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,480
Damn it, what the hell was that?

50
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,640
My outfit is ruined.

51
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:09,110
But the energy I received from that house was really something.

52
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,680
I don't think it was the grandmother's.

53
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,180
How weird.

54
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,200
That little punk, let's see what happens if he comes back.

55
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,290
Dang it, how unlucky.

56
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,930
Grandmother, there's a problem. Doo Rim is at the hospital.

57
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,840
What?

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,480
Kang Ju.

59
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,970
Are you Kang Ju?

60
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,030
Is it really you?

61
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,980
Are you okay?

62
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,380
How did you know to come here?

63
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,030
Your mother called.

64
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,470
I just came to see if you were okay.

65
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,460
I'll go now.

66

79

At first, I thought I didn't have a heart.

I didn't want to give it to anyone.

I wondered how I could make you believe it.

86

160
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:23,430
Just because of me ... don't throw your life away.

161
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,190
Grandma, it's room 302.

162
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,100
Na Doo Rim! Doo Rim.

163
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,470
Doo Rim, are you okay?

164
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,660
Are you okay?

165
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,120
Aigoo, Doo Rim. What's wrong with her?

166
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,470
- Doo Rim. 
 - What happened?

167
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,960
Doo Rim, what's wrong?

168
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,410
What about Grandma?

169
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,810
I made sure she left safely.

170
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,480
Thank you, Jin Ju.

171
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,070
Na Doo Rim.

172
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,210
You ...

173
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,030
Don't do that.

174
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,830
Liking Choi Kang Ju. Don't do it.

175
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,310
I'd like it if you didn't.

176
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,220
See ... look at yourself.

177
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,180
The only thing you can do is cry until you collapse from exhaustion.

178
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,390
Fine. It's totally possible.

179
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,610
You could have developed feelings for Choi Kang Ju while you spent time with him.

180
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,530
He's good looking, wealthy,

181
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,970
and he's smart.

182
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,710
It would be strange if you didn't like him.

183
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,040
But you're not Jang Yi Gyeong.

184
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:12,410
Na Doo Rim shouldn't like Choi Kang Ju.

185
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,380
Why?

186
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,960
Because I don't have money? I'm not pretty?

187
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:30,230
Or because I'm not smart? Is that why?

188
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,440
Dummy. It's because things will get more difficult for you.

189
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,130
How much longer do you think you can fool him?

190
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,730
What happens when the truth comes out?

191
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,740
What if Choi Kang Ju hates you? What if he doesn't want you near him?

192
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,080
What are you going to do then?

193
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,470
Jin Ju ... But I still want to hold onto him.

194
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,930
I really, really want to hold onto him.

195
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,820
If I could, I would stay by his side forever.

196
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,470
Madam! Madam!

197
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,550
What is it that has you so worked up?

198
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,100
Please hurry and come out.

199
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,810
Right now Young Master is ... oh, what do we do?

200
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,640
Kang Ju, what are you doing? Stop it! What's wrong?

201
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,850
What do you think you're doing right now?

202
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,080
Leave me alone! I'm about to go crazy!

203
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,710
You foolish punk!

204
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,010
Honey!

205
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,070
You fool. You can't even handle your own emotions,

206
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,520
so how are you expecting to accept someone else's heart?

207
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,060
If you don't have the courage to overcome your fears and these illusions, then just give up!

208
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,340
What are you doing? Come out.

209
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,910
Why did you contact Choi Kang Ju?

210
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,750
What were you thinking?

211
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,260
What do you mean what was I thinking?

212
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,990
I felt bad for Doo Rim so I arranged for them to say their last goodbyes.

213
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,470
I don't understand why you went that far. Why?

214
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,040
Oppa, stop.

215
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,550
What did mom do so wrong?

216
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,170
Why are you getting mad at her?

217
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,480
If you don't know, then stay out of it.

218
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,450
What do I not know?

219
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,870
You're getting mad right now because of Doo Rim.

220
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,230
Just because of Doo Rim.

221
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,610
How could you be like this to Mom?

222
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,170
You know for sure now.

223
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,990
Where Doo Rim's heart lies.

224
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,680
It sounds like you did this to make me get over Doo Rim.

225
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:51,530
Regardless, I'd like this to be the last time you raise your voice because of Doo Rim.

226
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,420
I don't know what you're thinking.

227
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,990
I can't help but think you did this for other reasons.

228
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,870
What other reasons?

229
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,260
If you were trying to make me get over her, you didn't have to go that far.

230
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,400
There were plenty of other ways.

231
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
I told you, Doo Rim—

232
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,260
You felt bad for her?

233
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,440
Fine, let's just say that then.

234
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,510
Mom.

235
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,320
There's nothing to worry about.

236
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,630
Manager Park, it's me. There's something I need you to quietly investigate.

237
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,190
Madam, it's me.

238
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:46,110
Hey, where are you going? I can't come along?

239
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,750
There's somewhere I need to go for a while.

240
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,600
Don't worry. Go ahead and head back to the restaurant.

241
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,450
How are you feeling?

242
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,680
I'm fine now.

243
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,640
Good. So what is it you wanted to talk about?

244
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,940
There's no one home. Speak comfortably.

245
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,400
What is it exactly?

246
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,140
I'm here to make a deal.

247
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,610
You have nothing to lose with this deal.

248
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,340
I'd like it if you could here me out,

249
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,130
and agree to what I'm asking.

250
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:14,600
I'm not sure what you're saying. Explain it so I can understand.

251
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,410
I want to be Choi Kang Ju's bride.

252
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,220
What?

253
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,840
I want to be his bride.

254
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,580
Even if it's just for one day.

255
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,900
 Kang Ju

256
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,400
 The person you are trying to reach is unavailable—

257
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,270
No. Absolutely not.

258
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,510
You also wanted this marriage.

259
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,230
You have nothing to lose.

260
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,210
You could lose your life. How do I have nothing to lose?

261
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,590
It doesn't matter to me ... even if I lose my life.

262
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,400
How could I when it's obvious something bad might happen to you?

263
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,730
- I can't. 
 - Madam.

264
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,220
I'll pretend you didn't say anything.

265
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,470
I'm begging you, please.

266
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,750
I don't think I can go on without Kang Ju.

267
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,700
Please allow me to be with Kang Ju.

268
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,730
Do you know ... how dangerous this is?

269
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,400
Are confident that you won't change your mind no matter what happens?

270
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,720
But if for some reason nothing bad happens to me,

271
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,460
allow me to stay next to Kang Ju.

272
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,360
Please give me a chance to tell Kang Ju the truth.

273
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,050
Let me stay by his side not as Jang Yi Gyeong,

274
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,550
but as Na Doo Rim.

275
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,160
Do you think Kang Ju will accept you?

276
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,530
I don't want to fool him anymore.

277
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:04,590
Even if I lose him, I want to tell him the truth.

278
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,520
Will you let me do that?

279
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,090
We didn't even have to force her. She just volunteered to die.

280
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,750
She's such a nice girl.

281
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,330
A love worth dying for ... how nice.

282
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,810
Enough that it's making me jealous.

283
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,480
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

284
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,400
Have you been discharged?

285
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,580
Is it okay for you to be walking around like this?

286
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,720
No. It's not okay.

287
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,840
My legs are shaky and I still feel weak,

288
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,550
I couldn't get out even if you told me to.

289
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,990
Put your seatbelt on.

290
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,400
What? Is it the first time you're seeing my face?

291
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,550
I feel like I can live now.

292
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,930
They say if you miss someone and can't see them, you'll make yourself ill.

293
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:32,970
I think I was lovesick. Take responsibility.

294
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,800
Don't waste your time on the wrong person,

295
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,520
find someone else to take responsibility.

296
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,730
This is all your fault so you need to take responsibility.

297
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,650
Why are you trying to place the blame on someone else?

298
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,620
I ... want to be your bride.

299
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,100
You really want to die, don't you?

300
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,140
Yes. Even if it's just for one day,

301
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,370
I want to be your bride.

302
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,370
Shut your mouth. You better not say one more thing.

303
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:37,340
Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?

304
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,720
What's wrong with you? Do you really want to die?

305
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,900
Why does it matter whether I live or die?

306
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,370
You already threw me away.

307
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,890
Jang Yi Gyeong!

308
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,000
Coward!

309
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,930
How can you be sure something bad will happen to me?

310
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,530
There's no such thing as a predestined future.

311
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:09,030
Why are you willing to give up this moment because of a future that may never happen?

312
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,140
Regardless of how strong the opponent is, no matter if you fall down and break into pieces,

313
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,680
do you not have the courage to fight it?

314
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,870
I have the confidence to overcome it.

315
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,330
If it's with you.

316
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,970
Are you sure you won't regret it?

317
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,760
After you let me go, are you confident you won't regret it?

318
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,420
What I'm most afraid of,

319
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:47,320
is not being able to see you again.

320
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,750
I don't want to live my life in regret after losing you.

321
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,440
Can I ... ask you something?

322
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,320
Yes, anything. If there's something you're curious about.

323
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,170
You know the CEO ... why is he breaking off the engagement?

324
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,120
Oh, the CEO?

325
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,030
You don't know either?

326
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,750
The truth is ...

327
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,730
You have to keep this to yourself.

328
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,390
This is a secret beyond all secrets.

329
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,920
Is that true?

330
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,170
No one knows if it's true or not.

331
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:13,560
Whether you believe it or not, it's just a rumor.

332
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:19,970
Still ... if he's breaking off the engagement, it's can't be completely untrue.

333
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:28,320
But why are you so interested in our CEO?

334
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,640
What?

335
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,690
Have some more to eat.

336
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,570
I was meeting with some friends and heard something strange.

337
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,760
What do you mean?

338
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,230
There's a rumor that Kang Ju is calling off the engagement.

339
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,050
What's going on?

340
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:07,500
It must be true then. Why is he breaking things off?

341
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,790
The Chairman is coming home.

342
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,670
You're just getting home?

343
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,270
You're here.

344
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,190
You don't have to see me out. Head inside.

345
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,320
What happened?

346
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,600
She came after hearing about the broken engagement.

347
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,820
Did you tell everything?

348
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:06,950
Then what should I have done? She knew everything already. There's nothing left to hide.

349
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,130
Are you feeling okay?

350
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,020
As you can see, I'm fine.

351
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:44,170
Did my mother say anything to you?

352
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,600
In case my mother says anything about our relationship,

353
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,440
something hurtful ...

354
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,800
Why are you making your mother worried?

355
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:09,880
I'm very grateful for you and your mother.

356
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,900
I don't want to feel sorry because of you.

357
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,380
I know I can't keep you by my side.

358
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,640
But you and Choi Kang Ju can't be together. You're not meant to be.

359
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,800
If you hold onto someone not meant to be, it will only become more difficult for you.

360
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,420
I know. I also know.

361
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,180
I know ...

362
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,860
so you don't have to worry about me.

363
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,400
I'll go now. Rest.

364
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,260
Take your medicine.

365
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,880
This herbal tonic is for you, not me.

366
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,740
Be quiet and drink up. Drink up, drink.

367
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,130
I was so worried something bad might happen to you,

368
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,500
I thought my heart would stop.

369
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,660
Grandma, stop worrying.

370
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,620
I don't know if it's because of the herbal tonic you made but I can already feel myself getting stronger.

371
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,680
You must be tired, lay down.

372
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,390
Where did you go today?

373
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,470
Did you go to meet Choi Kang Ju?

374
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,920
No. Why would I meet him?

375
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,560
I went to see Madam.

376
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:02,340
You. You're not thinking of doing else, are you?

377
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,640
What else would I be thinking?

378
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,020
That you're going to try to make it work with Choi Kang Ju ... or something ...

379
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:15,360
No, I'm not. It's over now. Honest.

380
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,380
Good. You're doing the right thing.

381
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,590
It wasn't meant to be from the beginning. With such an ominous house,

382
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,730
it would be best not to get involved at all.

383
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,860
What are you talking about?

384
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,890
I heard everything from Secretary Kim.

385
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:39,300
The first bride of the first born son in Choi Kang Ju's family dies as a sacrifice.

386
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,840
Because of the family curse.

387
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,700
Doo Rim, get rid of any feelings you have for Choi Kang Ju.

388
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:56,830
I'm worried something bad might happen if you get mixed up with him.

389
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,830
Stop thinking about such nonsense, Oh Jin Ju.

390
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,790
The Director seems like a nice person.

391
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,060
He's nice to grandma, too.

392
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:13,290
Starting today, forget all about Choi Kang Ju and move over to the Director.

393
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,060
Should I?

394
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,750
Don't worry. What you're worried about won't happen.

395
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,190
Yes, Mother.

396
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,660
I'm sorry for making you come here.

397
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,990
It's okay.

398
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,530
Your face looks thinner.

399
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:03,360
Our Kang Ju hasn't been well either. He's been doing things he's never done before.

400
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:09,000
Kang Ju is struggling to pull himself together.

401
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:20,130
The reason I wanted to see you ... is because I want to know what your intention is.

402
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,150
Your mother is says it absolutely cannot happen.

403
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,630
Do you feel the same way?

404
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:35,500
Mother, I ... don't want to lose Kang Ju.

405
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,450
But what if your family is against it till the end?

406
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,290
Even still, I won't change my mind.

407
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,860
Now that I hear that, I feel much better.

408
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,450
Okay, so is there something I can help with?

409
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,360
For now, just quietly watch over us.

410
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,350
Until Kang Ju changes his mind.

411
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,700
What brings you here unannounced?

412
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,690
You know why I came to see you.

413
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:31,140
I'm not sure. It seems you have something to tell me.

414
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,560
The man named Hong Man Soo.

415
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,610
He worked for you over 30 years.

416
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,230
Why are you curious about that man?

417
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:50,590
He knew a lot about the car accident from 30 years ago.

418
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,660
What's wrong?

419
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:11,800
Mother, do you know who this is?

420
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,430
I'm not sure. We have a lot of family members.

421
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,750
Why do you ask?

422
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,100
She looks just like someone I know.

423
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,700
Is that so?

424
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,030
You all know what the atmosphere's been like around here lately.

425
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:40,020
During times like these, you need to be alert.

426
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,810
And make sure you are not disturbing those we work for.

427
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,130
We must be careful with our words and actions.

428
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,170
We need to be extra careful.

429
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,720
Why are you not answering me? Am I making sense?

430
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,800
Yes.

431
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,640
I might as well fire all of you.

432
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,290
Answer me loudly.

433
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,920
Yes!

434
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,830
From now on, listen to me carefully.

435
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:16,460
If you don't want to be fired, you need to make wise choices.

436
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:23,090
I may report directly to the Madam,

437
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:29,670
but in my heart, I report to none other than ...

438
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,520
me.

439
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,140
- Young Miss, are you leaving? 
 - Yes.

440
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,300
I'll be leaving now.

441
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,660
Okay. Go home safely.

442
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,900
Travel safely.

443
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,040
Madam.

444
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,130
What were you all doing out here?

445
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:11,460
I was just making sure they knew their place.

446
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,650
As long as you watch your own mouth, there shouldn't be any problems.

447
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,150
Madam, why was Young Miss here?

448
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,520
- Wasn't the engagement broken off already? 
 - Again.

449
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,970
Why can't you stop running that mouth for even a moment?

450
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,900
Where did they all go?

451
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,250
I'm going to have to fire them or something.

452
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,340
 There is no such thing as a predestined future.

453
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,920
 Because of a future that hasn't happened,

454
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,230
 why are you giving up this moment?

455
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,590
 Are you confident you won't regret it?

456
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,380
 After losing me, are you confident you won't ever regret it?

457
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,350
What are you doing here so late?

458
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,390
I have something to tell you.

459
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,190
The engagement is already broken. Is there something left to say between us?

460
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:58,250
I'd like to start over again with Yi Gyeong.

461
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:07,500
The reason I called you at the hospital was so you can say your last goodbyes.

462
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,520
There was no other reason.

463
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,510
Are you doing this now because you misunderstood?

464
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,670
Please give me permission.

465
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,650
I came here to get your permission.

466
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:27,390
So are you asking me to sacrifice our Yi Gyeong's life?

467
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,050
Take this necklace with you. It was burdensome so I was going to return it anyway.

468
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,820
Now there's nothing to left  to give or take so let's end it here with this.

469
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,840
Mother.

470
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,150
If you care for Yi Gyeong at all, then you shouldn't be doing this.

471
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:16,200
You were just calling off the wedding. Do you think doing this now makes sense?

472
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,560
I'm sorry.

473
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,240
No, there's nothing to be sorry about.

474
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,250
We're thankful.

475
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,460
If it wasn't for your decision to end things,

476
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,790
we would have went on with this marriage not knowing anything.

477
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,900
I love her.

478
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,280
Enough to hold onto her.

479
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,860
It's too late. I know now why other families turned down this marriage,

480
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,500
and why your family chose our family.

481
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,650
Do you think I would allow this marriage?

482
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:54,700
Love? Our Yi Gyeong's life is more important than love.

483
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:00,040
What I want to protect is our Yi Gyeong's life, not love.

484
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,650
Doo Rim, it's me. Choi Kang Ju just stopped by and left.

485
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:34,360
He wants to start over with you.

486
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,440
Why are you here unannounced?

487
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:04,550
You came by my house without calling so you're no different.

488
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:11,200
Wow, the great Choi Kang Ju even got down on his knees.

489
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,680
I can't believe I wasn't home and missed such an important scene.

490
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,020
It would have been amazing to see.

491
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,570
Can you joke around right now?

492
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:33,200
♫  Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you.  ♫

493
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,940
What are you doing?

494
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:41,310
♫  Just come to me. Keep on coming to me.  ♫ 
Thank you for accepting my feelings.

495
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:45,700
Just because of that you just hug me whenever you want?

496
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,020
Much less in my office.

497
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:51,420
So am I not allowed?

498
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,290
You acted so innocent before.

499
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,250
Are you a player now?

500
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,090
Who's fault is that?

501
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,920
- Are you saying it's my fault? 
 - Yeah.

502
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,810
So take responsibility.

503
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:16,200
I'm going to take responsibility ... that's why I visited your mother.

504
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:25,100
Then shall we talk about how you're going to take responsibility?

505
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:48,500
Hey. You ...

506
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,830
Doo Rim. Doo Rim.

507
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:54,280
Doo Rim.

508
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,360
Hey, stop right there.

509
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,720
- Doo Rim. 
 - Stop right there.

510
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,820
Hey, stop right there!

511
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,730
Doo Rim!

512
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,730
Hey!

513
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,170
Ru Mi.

514
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,830
Are you here to meet Kang Ju?

515
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,300
Yeah.

516
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,250
I heard your family is against this marriage. What are you planning on doing?

517
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,650
Are you going to break up with Kang Ju?

518
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:02,790
No. I'm going to marry Kang Ju.

519
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:05,170
Are you doing this because of your family's company?

520
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:13,910
No. My feelings for Kang Ju are sincere.

521
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:16,720
I'm leaving now.

522
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,800
Aren't you afraid?

523
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:32,070
Once you marry him, something might happen to you.

524
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:34,090
Even then—

525
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,850
What I'm most afraid of is ... losing Kang Ju,

526
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,470
and living with regret for the rest of my life.

527
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,800
It's true I was hurt a lot because of you.

528
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,630
But I know it's not because you hate me but because you love Kang Ju so much.

529
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:58,150
I understand where you're coming from. I'm not going to hate you anymore.

530
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,810
I'm leaving now.

531
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,930
You can come out now.

532
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:38,750
I don't know who you are but thank you.

533
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,370
If you're really thankful, I'll give you a chance to make it up to me.

534
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,870
Shall we talk?

535
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:48,320
Pardon?

536
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,560
After reviewing the CCTV from the neighborhood markets like you asked,

537
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,080
I confirmed that President Ma was there a few times.

538
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,590
Here is a copy of the CCTV footage. You can take a look.

539
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,950
What about the apartment?

540
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:10,100
There is no evidence to show that Jang Yi Gyeong stayed in that apartment.

541
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:14,260
And there was no contract under either the President or Jang Yi Gyeong's name.

542
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,050
Are you sure?

543
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,250
Yes, I'm sure.

544
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,580
Of course, this and any future investigations I ask for,

545
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,960
must never be found out by President Ma.

546
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,230
Yes, I understand.

547
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,150
I did as you asked.

548
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,280
Good work.

549
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,900
Please keep me updated on everything Yi Hyeon asks you to do.

550
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,590
Yes, I understand.

551
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:04,290
Just know that all of this is the sake of Ohsung Construction.

552
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:07,240
Yes, then I'll be on my way.

553
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,600
 Be Happy

554
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:00,000

555
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,230
 If it was December, then Choi Kang Ju's inauguration.

556
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,600
 Since the time Yi Gyeong disappeared.

557
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,600
 What's happened?

558
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,630
 What are you doing here?

559
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,870
 I came to visit a friend.

560
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,820
 I have a friend that lives in this apartment complex.

561
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,090
 How did you know to come?

562
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:19,830
 She's finally home. Why is that so important?

563
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:23,140
 Have you spoken to her about the store?

564
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,030
 If she lived closer, we can check on her and take care of her.

565
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:29,550
 It's not something Yi Gyeong can do. We need to ask Doo Rim.

566
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,380
 That store is now yours.

567
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,420
 Kang Ju's family has no intentions of breaking off this marriage.

568
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,250
 All you have to do is help change Kang Ju's mind.

569
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,460
 There is no evidence to show that Jang Yi Gyeong stayed in that apartment.

570
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:04,010
 And there was no contract under either the President or Jang Yi Gyeong's name.

571
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:22,980

572
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,330
 Bride of the Century
