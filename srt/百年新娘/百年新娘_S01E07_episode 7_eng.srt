1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,650
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,990

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,730
Why didn't you tell me?

4
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,780
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,520
Who was the one who didn't even want to listen to me?

6
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,740
From the beginning, you didn't want to hear me.

7
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,210
You thought whatever you wanted.

8
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,650
You didn't give me a chance to speak, and you didn't believe me.

9
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:59,470
Even if no one else believed me, I hoped for just you to do so.

10
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,190
You said that because they were a person next to you, because they were so close to you, you couldn't forgive them?

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,330
Then how do you think I feel?

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,230
You're next to me.

13
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,520
The person closest to me won't believe me.

14
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,520
If you shut your heart, you won't be able to see anything.

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,330
The sincerity and feelings of the people closest to you.

16
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,660
You'll forever live as a blind fool.

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,610
I'm sorry for calling for you when you're busy.

18
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,080
It's no problem Mother. What did you want to say?

19
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,370
I heard the JR opening went well.

20
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,700
Ru Mi, you put in a lot of work.

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,830
Thank you.

22
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,120
Even though everything was settled, that ring incident ...

23
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,910
I'm wondering if you had to go that far, when you could have quietly moved passed it.

24
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,970
Mother, that was...

25
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,950
I understand that it was your only choice.

26
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,950
And even why you showed Kang Ju that video.

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,690
However, nothing will change no matter what you do.

28
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,610
Kang Ju and Yi Gyeong's marriage will proceed as planned.

29
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,730
So don't concern yourself too much.

30
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,770
Mother.

31
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,920
Don't feel upset. I'm saying this all for you, Ru Mi.

32
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,710
You don't know the strength I feel, knowing that you're by Kang Ju's side.

33
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:32,430
Please continue to stay by Kang Ju's side, and help him with his work.

34
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,610
Mother, I can't give up on Kang Ju.

35
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,600
You know better than anyone what I thought about Kang Ju ever since I was young.

36
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,640
I know I shouldn't be like this.

37
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,260
But if I don't even do this, I feel so suffocated I could die.

38
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,210
Mother. Mother, please help me. Please?

39
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,590
Do you think a fork suits this coffee cup?

40
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,870
A teaspoon suits a coffee cup.

41
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,130
Even an object has its own place.

42
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,010
Why wouldn't humans?

43
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,800
People all have their own places that suit them.

44
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,020
The one definite fact,

45
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,640
is that this marriage will proceed as planned.

46
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,280
Even if you try to shake things up, it won't be shaken.

47
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,580
You shouldn't even try to.

48
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:59,040
So don't concern yourself too much, and let it impact your feelings. Just sit quietly.

49
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,150
That's the path that will benefit all of us.

50
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,950
Our Kang Ju, and even for you.

51
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,570
 Ru Mi. Even if it's painful now, wait.

52
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,490
 If you keep quiet and endure, you'll be able to gain what you desire.

53
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,000
 Just like how I was able to thirty years ago.

54
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,520
Hello.

55
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,820
Hello?

56
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,720
Who is this?

57
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,200
Hel—

58
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,520
Mother.

59
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,780
What are you doing here?

60
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,540
I'm here to meet with a friend. My friend lives in this officetel.

61
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,650
Then, why are you so taken aback?

62
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,080
- Was I? 
 - Yes.

63
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,810
Is your friend that outstanding gentleman?

64
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,520
Stop teasing your mom.

65
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,900
Are you getting off work now?

66
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,950
Yes.

67
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,350
Then you should head back first, I have some business to take care of.

68
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

69
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,410
Yeah, Doo Rim.

70
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,410
You haven't been contacted by Choi Kang Ju yet?

71
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,030
Yes. He hasn't even sent me a single text in days.

72
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,640
You know that he won't apologize even if he messed up, right?

73
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,780
Because since he was born, he never had to be sorry.

74
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,480
Of course. He's never had to answer to anybody.

75
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,450
Choi Kang Ju's ego could probably pierce through the Earth's atmosphere.

76
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,210
Dumplings.

77
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,090
Oh, it's delicious. You should try some.

78
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,070
Ah, you must be newlyweds.

79
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,930
You two are so cute. It's so sweet.

80
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,330
That's not it. He's my brother. My brother.

81
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,600
Really? You looked so close. I thought you were a newlywed couple.

82
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,880
Oppa, she said we look like a newlywed couple.

83
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,130
Ma'am could you give us a bag of dumplings?

84
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,690
Yes.

85
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,840
Let's go home. I'll cook you up some dumplings.

86
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,240
Wow.

87
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,350
Do you like movies?

88
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,940
Yes.

89
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,970
Do you want to watch one before heading back?

90
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,820
Really? Could we?

91
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,940
Action. Melodrama.

92
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,550
It's horror.

93
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,190
Horror. Horror horror.

94
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,900
♫  It's only you  ♫

95
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
It's Choi Kang Ju.

96
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,190
I couldn't reach Yi Gyeong's phone.

97
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,010
I was wondering if you were with her.

98
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,620
What did you want to talk about?

99
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,140
There's nothing more I need to hear or say.

100
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,060
Sorry.

101
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,890
I said I'm sorry.

102
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:59,250
For not trying to listening to you. And not believing in you. I'm sorry for everything.

103
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,550
After stabbing someone in the heart, you don't even call once,

104
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,990
and then suddenly show up and just say you're sorry. And that's it?

105
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,640
And also, what were you saving up your apology for?

106
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,570
What? You should've held on to it for another few decades.

107
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,670
And apologized when I became an wrinkly old grandma.

108
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,360
Is that what I should have done? You wrinkled old grannie,

109
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,190
I'm sorry. Like that?

110
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,690
Then what will happen to Jin Ju?

111
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,250
Even after going through this, you're worried about Jin Ju?

112
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,190
Think about how desperate Jin Ju was to do that.

113
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,380
There's a saying that you should hate the crime but not the person.

114
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,170
Who is Jin Ju to you? Why do you keep protecting her?

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,580
Why are you getting angry?

116
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,960
When I see you like this, it feels like you're from another world.

117
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,310
Not the world I live in.

118
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,720
Like you've come from a faraway and foreign world.

119
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,870
So, do you dislike me?

120
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,240
Yeah, I dislike it. Foreign things make me uncomfortable.

121
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,930
Either way.

122
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,540
I apologized today.

123
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,190
It's my first time.

124
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,840
Chairman. You were looking for me?

125
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,560
I have something I need you to look into quietly.

126
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,890
You're not sleeping yet?

127
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,380
Are you just getting home?

128
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,840
I heard you met Kang Ju.

129
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,920
Yes. He apologized for misunderstanding.

130
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:39,060
Kang Ju's mother picked out some dates for the wedding today.

131
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,680
And we can't keep pushing back the wedding.

132
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,110
Life doesn't seem very livable lately.

133
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:56,360
I feel like a scarecrow, an empty shell.

134
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,650
I try to not have such weak thoughts, but the only one I can vent to is you.

135
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,830
Don't worry so much.

136
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,960
I'll do everything I can.

137
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,340
Will you really be able to do anything?

138
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,480
It's nothing I can't do.

139
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,900
So stay strong. Okay?

140
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,860
Yes, we uploaded this on Choi Kang In's fan cafe.

141
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,460
Can I ask where you recorded this?

142
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,950
When we took a trip to Namhae, we recorded it by chance.

143
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,660
We posted it for fun.

144
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,770
But why are you asking about it?

145
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,120
She just looks like someone I know.

146
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,980
By any chance, are you talking about Choi Kang In's brother Choi Kang Ju's fiancée?

147
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,680
Their styles are very different. But when I first saw her,

148
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,380
I really thought they looked alike.

149
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,780
 Na Doo Rim.

150
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,750
 Doo Rim.

151
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,360
 I'm sorry.

152
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,040
Team Leader, you called for me?

153
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,850
Have a seat.

154
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,620
Jin Ju, you grew up in Namhae and went to school there, right?

155
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,180
Yes. I lived in Namhae until high school.

156
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,590
Do you know who this woman is?

157
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,360
This was recorded in Namhae.

158
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,070
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

159
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:36,760
Is this the same woman with the smokey make-up who was fighting at your house?

160
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,320
No.

161
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,420
Then, where does that friend live? Can I meet her?

162
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,410
Abroad. She lives abroad.

163
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,450
Her whole family immigrated to Canada.

164
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:55,320
She stopped by while visiting Korea but returned to Canada last week.

165
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,470
Jin Ju. If you tell me the truth without hiding anything,

166
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,330
I'll prevent your getting fired.

167
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:16,000
Or if you want, I could find you a permanent position at another company.

168
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

169
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,790
I told you everything I know without hiding anything.

170
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,220
Is that so?

171
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,440
If you change your mind, you can find me anytime.

172
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,520
But don't take too long.

173
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,850
I'm different from Jang Yi Gyeong. I don't have much patience.

174
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,550
Lee Ru Mi said that?

175
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,530
Okay, Jin Ju. I'll be careful. Thanks.

176
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,580
Lee Ru Mi's awareness is no joke.

177
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,410
Kang Ju.

178
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,790
Why are you buying so much?

179
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,240
We're going to the orphanage tomorrow.

180
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,220
I was going to cook some food for the children.

181
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,910
Make sure you diligently follow my mother to all her charity events.

182
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,000
It's good for the company's image and advertisement.

183
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,590
We need to consider those things for charity work?

184
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,490
Do you think running a company is like some kids playing house? We can't just do things willy-nilly.

185
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:53,000
We have to carefully calculate all the pluses and minuses as we go.

186
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,400
If you're considering pluses and minuses, what side am I?

187
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,850
If you calculate that for charity work, getting married is an even more important event in your life.

188
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,920
So you would have calculated all of that.

189
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,300
Why are you asking when you already know? Of course,

190
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,220
you are a minus..

191
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,420
I'm stupid for asking.

192
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,550
Hand that over.

193
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,570
How much more do you need to buy?

194
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,050
There's still a long way to go.

195
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,860
- Let's go together. 
 - Aren't you busy? Why do you keep following me?

196
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,490
I'm not busy, that's why I'm here.

197
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,110
- You're going to trip. 
 - Stop following me.

198
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:47,920
Kang In, it's me. I want to discuss something with you. Are you free tonight?

199
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,710
It's not Gapyeong?

200
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,550
The florist is in Gapyeong but the order was completed online.

201
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,080
When we tracked the IP address, it was an internet cafe in Cheongdam-dong.

202
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,160
Cheongdam-dong?

203
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,870
 What are you doing here?

204
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,750
 I was meeting a friend. I have a friend who lives in this apartment complex.

205
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,660
 Evergreen Orphanage

206
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,730
This one. Okay.

207
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,810
♫  Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you.  ♫ 
Bye.

208
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:47,140
♫  Just come to me.  Keep on coming to me.  ♫

209
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,950
♫  Suddenly you became the only person  I longed  for you while smiling.  ♫

210
00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:01,000
♫   Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever.  ♫

211
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,900
♫   Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever.   ♫

212
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,620
Stop by to visit, Jin Ju.

213
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,710
Thanks for everything.

214
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,870
Take care, Jin Ju.

215
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,730
Where did the Team Leader go?

216
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,230
I'll have to leave without saying goodbye to her.

217
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,260
She went to the orphanage with the CEO's mother.

218
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,380
You know, the annual charity event.

219
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,910
I hear today they're going to have a surprise concert.

220
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,420
A surprise concert?

221
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,190
 Heaven's Orphanage

222
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,310
Oh, so cute.

223
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,430
Glad you could make it, Kang In.

224
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,290
You weren't here at the scheduled time so I thought you were bailing on me.

225
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,390
Noona, who was the one who asked for a favor? How could I bail?

226
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,220
If it's for you, I can pluck the stars and the moon out of the sky.

227
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,920
Thank you.

228
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,330
But where is Yi Gyeong?

229
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,820
- Yi Gyeong doesn't know you're coming. 
 - That's right.

230
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,670
We better get inside before someone sees.

231
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,470
Let's hurry.

232
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,630
Why is Kang In here?

233
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,920
Let's go.

234
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,760
Hold on.

235
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,280
Oh, Jin Ju.

236
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,150
A surprise concert?

237
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,400
Yeah, Doo Rim.

238
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,740
I just got a call from Yi Hyeon. A surprise concert?

239
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,620
Tell me the details.

240
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,830
I think Ru Mi caught on.

241
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,710
Truthfully, last time ...

242
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,530
What? A video of you fighting?

243
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:54,710
Ru Mi tried to confirm it with your friend Jin Ju?

244
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,940
Why did you wait to tell me something so important?

245
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,500
Why do you think Ru Mi planned this concert without telling you? She's up to something.

246
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,940
You weren't able to play the piano during your last interview.

247
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,850
You may have gotten through that incident, but if you can't play again, do you think Ru Mi will sit still?

248
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,600
If she goes to your restaurant in Namhae ...

249
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,870
What do you think? Isn't it perfect for the stage?

250
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,650
Yeah.

251
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:30,420
It's a surprise event I planned just for you.

252
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,510
Kang In will soon become your brother-in-law.

253
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,790
If you perform together, it'll be meaningful and good publicity for the company.

254
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,500
Isn't it a win-win?

255
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,720
Still, this is so sudden.

256
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,650
And I haven't been able to practice my piano lately.

257
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:51,610
Don't worry. I thought that might be the case,

258
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:55,150
so I just chose an easy song you can play.

259
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,900
Okay.

260
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,010
Ru Mi, you know I have a little stage fright.

261
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,760
Can't we just have Kang In perform alone?

262
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,100
Kang In wanted to perform with you so he barely got permission from his company to rearrange his schedule.

263
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,740
Are you going to disappoint everybody?

264
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,410
Kang Ju will be here soon.

265
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,140
Kang Ju too?

266
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,620
His fiancée will be performing. Of course he would be here.

267
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,780
Get ready and come on.

268
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,400
Yeah, okay.

269
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,330
Why is Yi Hyeon not here yet?

270
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,760
 Evergreen Orphanage

271
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,260
Oppa.

272
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,400
I just got here. Where's the auditorium?

273
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,780
This is ... the building behind the main building.

274
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,990
- Who are you talking to? 
 - Nobody.

275
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,110
Should I help you change?

276
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:12,290
No. I can change on my own.

277
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,120
I'm going to look over the sheet music one more time and head out.

278
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,820
Okay. Hurry. People are waiting.

279
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,050
Okay, I understand.

280
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,220
Oppa. Hurry. Come quick.

281
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,380
 Heaven's Orphanage

282
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,750
 Small Concert

283
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,100
Kang Ju, you're here. What's this concert all of a sudden?

284
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,800
Ru Mi must have secretly prepared it with Kang In.

285
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,170
She thought the children would enjoy it.

286
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,920
Ru Mi is really good at organizing these things.

287
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:16,540
Everyone, we have a very special performance prepared for you today.

288
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,650
A small music performance by Choi Kang In from Monster and Jang Yi Gyeong.

289
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,350
Let's get started.

290
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,840
I really like Monster too. Let's call him out first.

291
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,170
Kang In, come on up.

292
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,790
We love you.

293
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:56,600
I thought about it carefully but the star of today's performance is not me.

294
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,330
This isn't good for Monster's reputation ...

295
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,190
Anyway, there is someone who can steal the spotlight from me.

296
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,370
There's a person back there cooler than me.

297
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,080
Really?

298
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,230
She has a lot of names. Taeyang Group's fiancée.

299
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,930
Why isn't the fire alarm going off?

300
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,890
But tonight, I just want to call this person like this.

301
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:32,820
Let me introduce you to the beautiful pianist, Jang Yi Gyeong.

302
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,030
Sister-in-law, come on out.

303
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:53,750
- Sister-in-law. 
 - Come on out. Come on out.

304
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:03,670
Come on out. Come on out. Come on out. Come on out.

305
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:43,130
Okay, now let's start the performance.

306
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,360
Noona. Noona.

307
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:53,250
♫ The moments right now are unbelievably exciting ♫

308
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:59,400
♫   I also unknowingly end up looking only for you  ♫

309
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:08,240
♫ I’ve been falling more and more for you. Even if I tried to push you away, in the end it was you. ♫

310
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,810
♫ Now I want to know more you better and I want to have you always. ♫

311
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:21,880
♫ Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you. ♫

312
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:29,490
♫ Just come to me.  Keep on coming to me. ♫

313
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:36,590
♫ Suddenly you became the only person  I longed  for you while smiling. ♫

314
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:42,830
♫  Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever. ♫

315
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:51,430
♫   The moments right now are unbelievably exciting  ♫

316
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,510
 Surprise concert?

317
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,290
 Mother, it's me.

318
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,960
 Yeah, Mom. I was just about to call you.

319
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,030
 Go to the orphanage immediately.

320
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,390
 This isn't something Yi Hyeon can stop.

321
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,920
 If people find out that Doo Rim is a fake, we'll all be finished.

322
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,760
 We need to put out this fire first.

323
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,690
 We'll think about the aftermath later. Go quickly.

324
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,380
 Hurry.

325
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:13,620
Encore! Encore! Encore!

326
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,160
Doo Rim. Na Doo Rim.

327
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,580
Oppa. I'm over here.

328
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,120
Oppa.

329
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,140
Did the performance go well?

330
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,700
Were you able to meet Yi Gyeong?

331
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,240
Yi Gyeong. Are you okay?

332
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,740
Are you hurt anywhere?

333
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,800
Where have you been all this time?

334
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,460
Mom, I'm fine.

335
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,280
Alright.

336
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,590
But how did you know to come?

337
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,890
Oppa, is that what you're curious about right now?

338
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:26,450
That's right. All that matters is she's back. Why is that important?

339
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,660
No, I must know. What was she doing all this time and—

340
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:35,000
Oppa, just because I disappeared, do you think I was blind or deaf?

341
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,030
Don't you know that the news is updated live these days?

342
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,040
During this time, I've seen the cake eating contest,

343
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,640
the kiss performance at the showcase, I've seen them all.

344
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,430
I was so upset you had a fake acting like me.

345
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,970
Yi Gyeong, that—

346
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:55,820
You and Yi Hyeon's efforts were truly tear-jerking.

347
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,900
And I didn't think that girl could handle a live music performance so I returned.

348
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,450
Let's talk about the details later.

349
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,550
Yi Gyeong must be tired.

350
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,880
Let's go upstairs and rest.

351
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,240
Oppa, wasn't that incredible timing?

352
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,140
How did she appear just at the right time?

353
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:40,160
If it wasn't for Yi Gyeong, I would have died of a heart attack.

354
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,540
I know. The timing was almost too perfect.

355
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,870
Now I can finally stop acting.

356
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,870
Are you that happy?

357
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:58,950
Of course. I don't have to wear high heels anymore nor wear dresses the size of my palm.

358
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,480
I'm happy too.

359
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,920
I was always worried when you would meet Choi Kang Ju.

360
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,650
Of course you would be.

361
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,380
You were nervous I would get caught, weren't you?

362
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:14,090
Now you don't have to worry anymore. You can spread out your legs and sleep peacefully.

363
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,850
Mom, what am I going to do now?

364
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,010
What happens if she leaves?

365
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,860
This is all Lee Ru Mi's fault.

366
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,330
If it weren't for her ...

367
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:37,840
Whether it's Ru Mi or Kang Ju's mother, we know their motives so don't worry.

368
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,910
You just have to trust me.

369
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:49,570
I will do whatever it takes to make that girl come back.

370
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,580
I don't know how you can drink this.

371
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,360
No matter how many times I've tried it, I can't get used to it.

372
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,930
You always did have the taste of an elementary schooler.

373
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,550
I told you to stop calling me a little kid.

374
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,880
Don't you know the scariest people these days are kids?

375
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,780
Do you want to see what happens when you upset a little kid?

376
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:21,270
Hearing all the fuss in the house means Kang In is definitely home.

377
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,640
It's not as bad as when Yi Gyeong is here.

378
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,560
When Hyung gets married and Yi Gyeong moves in, it's really going to get loud.

379
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,070
I laughed so hard when I saw this.

380
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,180
What is this?

381
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,970
Yi Gyeong uploaded it.

382
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,090
Yi Gyeong is so full of energy. She's just my type.

383
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,700
Ah, speaking of, have Yi Gyeong come by tomorrow.

384
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,080
Why? Did you need to speak to her about something?

385
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,340
Does there always have to be a reason?

386
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,480
Have her stop by to eat dinner.

387
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,910
She doesn't need to come all the way here just for dinner.

388
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,810
I mean ...

389
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:08,940
kids these days don't like to be told to come and go before they get married.

390
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,010
We don't want to seem like we're forcibly accepting her.

391
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,080
Excuse me.

392
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,240
What is it?

393
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:44,550
You're not expecting me to say thank you or good job for impersonating me, are you?

394
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,360
No, that's not it.

395
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,980
You really do look the same.

396
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,860
I only saw pictures so I was curious.

397
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,080
Did you get work done on your face?

398
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,500
What?

399
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,270
After announcing my marriage to Choi Kang Ju, my style was really popular

400
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,730
at the Gangnam University Plastic Surgery Hospital.

401
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,290
Oh no. I don't even have money for that.

402
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:18,390
If not that, then it really is strange.

403
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,520
How can we look exactly the same?

404
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,680
Right? It really is strange.

405
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,370
It's not like we're family or distant relatives.

406
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,640
How can we look so alike when we don't even share one drop of blood?

407
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,380
In any case, thank you for coming back.

408
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,450
Now I can feel at ease when I return to Namhae.

409
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,590
I'm sorry but I don't feel the least bit thankful towards you.

410
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:51,640
If it weren't for you, this marriage would have been broken off a long time ago.

411
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,120
You made me come back to exactly where I was.

412
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,990
I don't know your situation, but from what I experienced

413
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:12,110
Choi Kang Ju is just a little rough around the edges, but he's not a bad person.

414
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,550
- So— 
 - If you like him that much, you should just marry him.

415
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,730
What?

416
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:22,300
Someone else was pretending to be his fiancée and he didn't even notice.

417
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,890
So how am I supposed to accept that?

418
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,570
Would any woman like a man like that?

419
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,890
If you're done, can you leave now?

420
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,060
Here.

421
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,540
I wrote down everything that happened between me and Choi Kang Ju during that time.

422
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,360
I figured you'd need to know so you don't make a mistake.

423
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:55,510
There was a time I filleted a fish and gave his great-aunt a piggyback ride.

424
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,570
I wrote down everything I could remember. You'll see as you read it.

425
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,690
Oh and this.

426
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,610
Your cellphone.

427
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,140
It's Choi Kang Ju. Answer it.

428
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,530
 Choi Kang Ju

429
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,590
Hello Kang Ju.

430
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,500
Father?

431
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,580
Yes.

432
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,050
Yes.

433
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,640
You worked hard.

434
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,030
What is this?

435
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,820
Consider it a bonus for all your hard work.

436
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,490
Oh, you really don't have to.

437
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,120
It's from my heart so accept it.

438
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,440
Think of it as allowance from mother to daughter.

439
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,220
Daughter?

440
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Yi Gyeong is my daughter, so you were like my daughter.

441
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:10,230
I don't know what you thought of me, but I thought of you as my daughter.

442
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,530
I'm really grateful.

443
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,030
We should be thanking you.

444
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,910
If you ever visit Namhae later, please stop by.

445
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,780
I will treat you to some great sashimi.

446
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,750
You must visit, okay?

447
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,650
Speaking of ...

448
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:41,470
Doo Rim, do you have any thoughts of moving to Seoul?

449
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,130
Pardon?

450
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:48,700
I received an offer for a shop near Dongdaemun Market,

451
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,070
I was wondering whether you would want to open a store there.

452
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,140
A store?

453
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,130
Are you opening a store for me?

454
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,630
If you'd like to, I think it would be a good spot for a restaurant.

455
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:10,350
You're good at cooking so if you do well, you can get a lot of business.

456
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,020
Of course I would like it.

457
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,390
But I don't know what my grandmother would think.

458
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:23,630
Try to convince your grandmother.

459
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,010
Yes, I will.

460
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,350
♫  I try to see you but I can't see you  ♫

461
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:48,640
♫  As if I could see you with my eyes  ♫

462
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,260
♫  I keep thinking of you so I stop in place  ♫

463
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,550
♫  After a long time  ♫

464
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:05,470
♫  I call out to you in tears  ♫

465
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,910
♫  Is it wrong if I start to miss you  ♫

466
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:14,240
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you  ♫

467
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,070
♫  What if I can't hold back any longer  ♫

468
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:24,010
♫  There are words I didn't get a chance to say  ♫

469
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:28,390
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm thankful  ♫

470
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:34,560
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm sorry  ♫

471
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:42,000
♫  I am in love with you  ♫

472
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,150
Where' is Yi Gyeong?

473
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,920
Just let her be. We said our goodbyes last night.

474
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,040
Will you be okay? I can take you to the bus terminal.

475
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,650
It's okay. I'm fine.

476
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,830
I need to stop by my friend's house and pick up my cat.

477
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,110
I'll be going now.

478
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,980
Okay. Have a safe trip.

479
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,740
 Na Doo Rim. You're not getting out of this so easily.

480
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,000
 Because I won't let you go. Never.

481
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,180
 Are you okay?

482
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,790
 You're like a little kid.

483
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,950
You're going back home? Does that mean you don't have to pretend anymore?

484
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:29,170
Yeah. It's all over now.

485
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,110
Oh, that's so great.

486
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,970
Jin Ju, here.

487
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,100
What is this?

488
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,460
I got it as a bonus.

489
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,880
Jin Ju, hurry and pay off your debts.

490
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,540
Doo Rim.

491
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:00,110
You helped take care of Coco and did a lot of other things for me.

492
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:04,800
You deserve this so put it away.

493
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,580
Hey ...

494
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,200
I told you to put it away.

495
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,750
Thank you.

496
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:08,590
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes ma'am.

497
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,020
This ...

498
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,990
In a little while ...

499
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,260
Are you playing hide-and-seek? Why are you hiding all of a sudden?

500
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,290
I ran out of the house and didn't put on any makeup.

501
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:22,390
Do you think it's easy for a woman to show a man her face without makeup?

502
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,570
This ... is the kitten from before, right?

503
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:30,370
What are you doing here with the cat?

504
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:34,890
Something came up with my friend who was watching Coco,

505
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:38,060
so I was taking her to another friend.

506
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,530
Don't be late because of the cat.

507
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,430
What?

508
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:48,220
You didn't forget, right? My father invited you over.

509
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,790
How could I forget? Don't worry.

510
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:56,110
I'll make sure I'm not late after dropping off Coco.

511
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:01,400
I'm getting off work early too. I'll see you at the house later.

512
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:11,230
Kang Ju. Here.

513
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:14,590
This is your jacket from the other night.

514
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:18,180
You can just give this to me later.

515
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,360
Just in case, I brought it with me on my way out.

516
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:49,000

517
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It's okay now that I got to see him one last time.

518
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,960
Take care Choi Kang Ju.

519
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:05,900
♫  Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you.  ♫

520
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,190
♫  Just come to me.   ♫

521
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:13,140
♫  Keep on coming to me  ♫

522
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:19,980
♫  Suddenly you became the only person  I longed  for you while smiling.  ♫

523
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:27,060
♫   Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever.  ♫

524
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:34,290
♫   Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever.  ♫

525
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:41,390
♫  It must have been love.  It was hidden. The only person there.   ♫

526
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:47,420
♫   It must have been you.  Be at my side  The one person who did that.  ♫
