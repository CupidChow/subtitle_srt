1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,390
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,070

3
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,930
Mom.  Oppa is on his way to the villa.

4
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,050
He says Doo Rim knows all about our plan.

5
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,510
She might tell Choi Kang Ju everything!

6
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,240
Then that's all the more reason for her not to live.

7
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,810
We have no choice but to silence her forever.

8
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,190
This will all be over by tomorrow.

9
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,200
Stay strong and wait.

10
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,170
 The first night I spend with him.

11
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,370
 Tonight that's filled with happiness and excitement.

12
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,970
 It will be the first and last night that I will spend with that person.

13
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,800
 I am not scared that something bad might happen to me.

14
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,110
 When I'm gone,

15
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,010
 he has to endure being left alone after losing the person he loves.

16
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,740
 I am worried for that person.

17
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,170
Kang Ju...

18
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,040
I'm really tired.

19
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

20
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,600
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you  ♫

21
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,560
 Your gaze, voice,

22
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,890
 even the sound of your breathing,

23
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,200
 I will keep everything in my heart.

24
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,000
 Tonight might be the my last night as your wife.

25
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:20,000
 Even if I leave you, please remember me.

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,800
 My feelings toward you are at least genuine.

27
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,600
 When this night passes,

28
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,980
 I don't know what kind of future awaits us.

29
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,470
  But I won't let you go.

30
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,920
 Never again.

31
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,020
 The many days ahead of us,

32
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,700
 will be for nothing if I can't be with you.

33
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,080
 I won't let you go alone.

34
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,620
 Wherever you go,  I will be together with you.

35
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,990
 I'll stay with you.

36
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,500
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

37
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,040
♫  What if I can't hold back any longer?  ♫

38
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,020
♫  There are words I didn't get a chance to say.  ♫

39
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,400
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm thankful.  ♫

40
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,140
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm sorry.  ♫

41
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:30,000
♫  I am in love with you  ♫

42
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,960
Why am I having such a bad dream?

43
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,620
Jang Yi Gyeong!

44
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,350
Jang Yi Gyeong!

45
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,360
Jang Yi Gyeong!

46
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,060
 You are not going to die.

47
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,700
 This test was started by someone's heartfelt wish

48
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,060
 to find true love that would not falter.

49
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:02,650
 Just as a flower must endure snowy winters to bloom in spring,

50
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,810
 You overcame your fear and showed the power of true love.

51
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,980
 You passed the test.

52
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,820
 However, something scarier than death is your reality that is to come.

53
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,590
 The one who wants your life is not me but the people around you.

54
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,310
 In order to be by that person's side, you have to take off your mask and face the truth.

55
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,220
 You may experience more pain than death itself.

56
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,340
 You may be torn to shreds and left bleeding.

57
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,290
 The person that you believe in... may not accept you...

58
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,860
 and he might abandon you.

59
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,540
 Even so ...

60
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,510
 do you want to take this path?

61
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,110
 It'll be a lonely and difficult fight.

62
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:26,040
 No one knows what you will gain at the end of that path.

63
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,700
 Because the future is what you create.

64
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,660
 I have something I want to ask.

65
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,710
 Why me of all people?

66
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,950
 You have to find that answer yourself.

67
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,430
 Now... is your heart ready?

68
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,350
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

69
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,650
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

70
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:55,070
♫  Because I'm sorry for loving you,  ♫

71
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:01,520
♫  I can't let you go.  ♫

72
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,090
♫  I try to see you but I can't see you.  ♫

73
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,650
I told you, didn't I?

74
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,360
There is no future that is pre-determined.

75
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:33,720
Nothing bad will happen to me.

76
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,090
♫  After a long time  ♫

77
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,690
♫  I call out to you in tears.  ♫

78
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,980
The owner of this bracelet said so.

79
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,530
That we make our own future.

80
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,380
♫  What if I can't hold back any longer?  ♫

81
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,460
♫  There are words I didn't get a chance to say.  ♫

82
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,670
♫  Words that remain in my heart  ♫

83
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,190
♫  Words that I held back a thousand times.  ♫

84
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,660
♫  I am in love with you  ♫

85
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,240
Manager Park!

86
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,230
Hurry and check it out.

87
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,450
I'm sorry for making you worry, Mother.

88
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,080
Yi Gyeong did nothing wrong. Everything is my-

89
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:24,050
For now, I've confirmed you're safe so let's talk about the details in Seoul.

90
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,660
Quickly take your things and come out.

91
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,570
I told you I would take all the shots, right?

92
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,870
You just have to stay by my side. Okay?

93
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,420
Before you go, I have something to say.

94
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:17,830
No matter what I say, can you believe me?

95
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,290
Can you promise me?

96
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,170
That you won't hate me.

97
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,530
That you'll forgive me.

98
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,480
Since yesterday, you keep saying weird things.

99
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,980
You caused an accident without me knowing, didn't you?

100
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,250
I'm not even surprised by much anymore.

101
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,090
What is it? Tell me.

102
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,070
The person you thought I was,

103
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,950
isn't me.

104
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:02,290
This is... it isn't me...

105
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,200
What do you mean it isn't you?

106
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,770
Kang Ju... to be honest...

107
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,330
Truthfully...

108
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,530
Jang Yi Gyeong is ...

109
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,310
Hold on.

110
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,640
What?

111
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,490
Grandmother?

112
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,540
Ah, yes. I'll go right now. Yes.

113
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,150
Okay.

114
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,810
What is it?

115
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,570
Grandmother collapsed.

116
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,840
Grandmother?

117
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,650
She's in the hospital right now. She wants to see you.

118
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,870
Me?

119
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,180
Hurry. We have to go quickly.

120
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,980
Your Grandmother said she wants to meet her?

121
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,570
Yes.

122
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:16,880
I know there's not much time, but she is going to see an elder. She should at least be presentable.

123
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,440
I'll send her after she changes clothes, so go to the hospital first and wait.

124
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,070
Let's do that. I'll be there soon.

125
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,430
So you're safe. The heavens must have helped you.

126
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,590
Get in.

127
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,420
We still have something to talk about.

128
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,670
Let's talk on our way.

129
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,620
Yes, Jin Ju.

130
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,220
You lost Doo Rim?

131
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,980
I'll try to find out where Choi Kang Ju is right now.

132
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,930
Doo Rim.

133
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,940
You've worked hard all this time.

134
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,120
What?

135
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:31,020
Your role is done now. You can come off the stage now.

136
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,790
Manager Park.

137
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,610
What are you doing right now?

138
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,550
This is different from what you promised!

139
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,870
If nothing bad happened to me, you promised that you'd let me stay by Kang Ju's side!

140
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,320
You're so naive.

141
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,680
You believed that?

142
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,810
Were you planning on revealing everything to Choi Kang Ju?

143
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,810
Did you think I'd let Yi Gyeong be your shadow for her whole life?

144
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,320
Excuse me!

145
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,100
Quietly follow.

146
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:36,400
If you don't, your grandmother and your friend Jin Ju will be in danger.

147
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,960
Were you waiting because you thought I wouldn't come?

148
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,250
To be honest, I was a bit anxious. I was worried that your mother would hide you somewhere.

149
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,850
Then we can run away again.

150
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,290
We did it once. Why couldn't we do it again?

151
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,850
Don't play around.

152
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,060
Where's Grandmother?

153
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,910
Let's go.

154
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,290
Oh, you came?

155
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,730
Yi Gyeong came, Mother.

156
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,520
Hello, Mother.

157
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,590
Welcome.

158
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,740
How is Grandmother?

159
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,590
She's passed the critical stage... but they said we should prepare ourselves.

160
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,790
Mom, I'll go first. Hyung, Noona.

161
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,210
Go in.

162
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,920
Yes.

163
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,970
Ru Mi, it's me.

164
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,770
What? Yi Gyeong came back?

165
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,550
Kang In. Where did you say it was?

166
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,030
Grandmother. Yi Gyeong is here.

167
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,900
Grandmother, I'm here.

168
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,280
Kang Ju.

169
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,250
I have something to say to her.

170
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,980
Go ahead and talk.

171
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,920
I'll be outside.

172
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,330
For the last time...

173
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,670
I wanted to see you, so I asked you to come.

174
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,450
For not telling you in advance,

175
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,420
I'm sorry.

176
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,990
Please understand.

177
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,670
Let's talk about that later.

178
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,270
You said it was for me, didn't you?

179
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:24,810
The reason you spent so long maintaining that annex.

180
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:34,820
That belief may have been in vain, but I won't blame you.

181
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,330
Just like how I overcame fear...

182
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,180
I hope that you too, will face reality a day sooner.

183
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,310
You came?

184
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,340
You must be very worried.

185
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,150
I truly hope she gets well soon.

186
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,230
Thank you for caring.

187
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,700
I know you must have been surprised. I was also very shocked.

188
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,790
Thankfully since the heavens helped and she came back safely.

189
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:21,560
Anyways, I know you have a lot on your mind right now so we can talk about the kids at a later time.

190
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,490
Let's do that.

191
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,580
Mother. I'll come by later this evening.

192
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,880
You should come prepared for punishment.

193
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,010
Yes. I will come prepared.

194
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,160
Go safely.

195
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,620
See you later.

196
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,900
Yes, it's me.

197
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,920
Yes, I'm still at the hospital.

198
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,260
What did he say?

199
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,810
He's at the hospital, and Jang Yi Gyeong also went to the hospital.

200
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,420
- Really? 
 - I found this out by being misunderstood as a stalker.

201
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,970
But what's wrong? Tell me.

202
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,300
That... I can't tell you.

203
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,200
Jin Ju. You like Kang Ju, don't you?

204
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,940
Don't speak so rashly. You don't even know how I really feel.

205
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,590
Then what is it that you can't tell me?

206
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,560
Ah, I don't know! I don't know!

207
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,190
 The person you are trying to reach...

208
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,700
What should I do? I can't get a hold of Director either.

209
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,850
Should I report it to the police?

210
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,680
No.

211
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:28,270
 You said it was for me, didn't you? The reason you spent so long maintaining that annex.

212
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:33,640
 That belief may have been in vain.

213
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,120
 but I won't blame you.

214
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,490
Mother.

215
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,600
I have something to tell you.

216
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,740
Make sure you take care of things without leaving anything behind.

217
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,250
Yes, I understand.

218
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,030
Mom! Kang Ju is here!

219
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,790
I'm not getting kicked out again, am I?

220
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:59,790
If you do, then I'll follow you out.

221
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,670
Please accept these, Mother.

222
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:19,960
Do you think my mood will get better from just one bouquet?

223
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,350
Mom!

224
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,920
I'm sorry for worrying you.

225
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:45,750
As much as I've done wrong, I'll cherish her more and show you a happier side.

226
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,610
Please forgive me and accept us.

227
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,580
Mom.

228
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,940
I gave birth to her, but she's conniving.

229
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,530
I didn't know you'd fool your own mother.

230
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:08,530
I guess that's why they say there's no use in raising daughters.

231
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:13,490
She threw her mother away and followed the man she likes.

232
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,210
Mom, we'll do well from now on.

233
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,550
Take care of her. She has left my embrace now.

234
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,230
I'll just trust you.

235
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,410
Thank you, Mother.

236
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,220
Take care of things quietly, and make sure your guys don't talk.

237
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,690
It's not like it's our first or second time.

238
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,510
Doo Rim!

239
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,180
- Oppa!
- Are you okay?

240
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,520
We have to hurry and get out of here.

241
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,830
Look at this. There was a rat hiding in here.

242
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,810
You bastard!

243
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,100
Doo Rim! Run away!

244
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,410
Run away, Doo Rim! Quickly go!

245
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,700
Come here.

246
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,420
Don't!

247
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,390
Oppa! Oppa!

248
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,890
Oppa!

249
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,120
Ah, oppa! What do I do now?

250
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,620
Got it. I'll go right away.

251
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,720
Back at the hospital... what did Grandmother say?

252
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,160
Are you curious? It's a secret.

253
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,850
Did you say something strange, perhaps?

254
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:15,710
What should we do? Something urgent just came up so I have to go.

255
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:19,270
Did something happen at work perhaps?

256
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,770
It's not that. No need to worry.

257
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,960
Eat dinner, hang around, and take your time in leaving.

258
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:31,460
You don't have to come out. Relax.

259
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:36,020
Yi Gyeong. I'll be back.

260
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,840
 Restricted Area

261
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,030
♫  The words I never said   ♫

262
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,040
♫  The words I couldn't say  ♫

263
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:20,600
♫  As I watch from behind you, the ugly confession disappears  ♫

264
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:26,700
♫  Whether I'm there or not  ♫

265
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,200
♫  It doesn't matter  ♫

266
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,210
♫  To you  ♫

267
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,100
 Are you okay?

268
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,870
 Ah, it's hot!

269
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:39,880
 Ah, hot!

270
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,690
 You're such a kid. What is this?

271
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,400
 From sometime ago, my fears disappear when I hold your hand.

272
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,110
 Together with you...

273
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:01,180
 I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

274
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,410
 If you're sorry...

275
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,760
 Then it seems like I really have no chance. I'll wait.

276
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,630
 Somewhere out there.

277
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,070
How could you let this happen?

278
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:32,090
- I'm sorry President.   - Tell me exactly what happened.  Why is it all messed up?

279
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,910
- That is...
- I'm asking you what happened!

280
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:40,080
I'll answer that question.

281
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,580
You probably didn't think you would see me here.

282
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,840
I'm quite surprised as well.

283
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,680
Why we have to meet at a place like this.

284
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,630
What's more surprising...

285
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,210
is that kid in front of the operating room.

286
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,020
Is it really your daughter?

287
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,700
 Yes, Mother.

288
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,870
- Have you eaten dinner?
  - Yes.

289
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:30,420
Yi Gyeong's mother made a lot of delicious foods.

290
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,900
 Yi Gyeong is next to you, isn't she? Can you pass the phone to her?

291
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,960
Yes, Mother.

292
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,160
Yi Gyeong, you've worked hard in a variety of ways.

293
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,220
 What are you talking about, Mother?

294
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,520
 - What do you mean I've worked hard? 
- Alright.

295
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,520
Have a nice time with Kang Ju.

296
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,220
 Yes, have a good night.

297
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,490
Na Doo Rim.

298
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,850
Turns out she's came here from Namhae.

299
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:23,960
If I'm not mistaken, she was here since Kang Ju's inaugural ceremony.

300
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,000
Playing her counterpart.

301
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:34,710
The bride who swore to love Kang Ju wasn't your daughter, but her.

302
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,310
You covered our eyes and ears, and with that kid's life...

303
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:43,390
were you going to steal the position of Taeyang Group's daughter-in-law?

304
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:49,890
Weren't you the first to play around with Yi Gyeong's life?

305
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,730
You never had any thoughts of accepting her as your daughter-in-law.

306
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:58,070
It's only okay to be greedy when you are worthy of it.

307
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:03,310
But when you don't know your boundaries and overstep, you are setting yourself up for failure.

308
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,730
I don't want things to get noisy.

309
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,750
If you step back at this time,

310
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,910
I won't create any problems anymore.

311
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:15,820
I'll cover it up quietly.

312
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:20,910
You know this isn't something you should drag out, don't you?

313
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,000
By tomorrow, give me an answer.

314
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,730
I'll give you the answer right now.

315
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,050
 Before I leave...

316
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,600
 I wanted to tell you something.

317
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,870
 From now on...

318
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,770
 Listen to what I say.

319
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,930
 Don't be surprised.

320
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,690
 Thirty years ago...

321
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,990
 Kang Ju's father...

322
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,800
 It's about his first bride.

323
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,570
 After the wedding,

324
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,080
 the two of them...

325
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,990
 went to the villa...

326
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,100
 for their honeymoon.

327
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,710
 I, too,

328
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,100
 went to the villa.

329
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:57,050
 I needed confirmation.

330
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:03,990
 What would happen to the bride on that first night?

331
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,970
 But that bride, surprisingly...

332
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,700
 was fine. She was unharmed.

333
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,250
 In that diary...

334
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:02,930
 a surprising story was written in there.

335
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:10,600
 That a curse fell on the household was not true.

336
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,660
 When the first bride dies,

337
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,770
 my Myeong Hui was supposed to take her place.

338
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,900
 It was an unspoken promise.

339
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:35,630
 But the bride was perfectly alive.

340
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:42,430
 The thought of Myeong Hui losing her place...

341
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,350
 Before I knew it...

342
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,000
 My daughter,

343
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,210
 Myeong Hui ...

344
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,400
 For her happiness.

345
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,660
 Ever since she turned 20,

346
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:22,380
 she only had eyes for Kang Ju's father.

347
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,100
 For my daughter,

348
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,440
 Someone else...

349
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,500
 Someone else's life,

350
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:40,920
 was cut short in one second.

351
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,270
 That diary...

352
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,830
 This is the very last page.

353
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:33,860
 After that day, in my heart...

354
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:39,330
 I've been carrying around this burden.

355
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:43,260
 I did something a person shouldn't have done.

356
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:50,140
 I committed a sin that cannot be forgiven.

357
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:55,420
 Even if I die...

358
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,140
 I'll accept the punishment.

359
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:16,390
 The reason I'm saying this to you...

360
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,780
 Even if you don't say anything, I know.

361
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,160
 I'll stay by Kang Ju's side.

362
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,690
 I won't leave him.

363
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,360
 Kang Ju...

364
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,590
 Kang Ju's mother...

365
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:37,900
 Don't let her find out.

366
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:43,840
 If she finds out,

367
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,690
 pain and confusion that she won't be able to stop will follow her.

368
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:52,050
 Can you promise me?

369
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:21,320
The only mistake you and I made,

370
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,640
is completely believing in that household's curse.

371
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:31,020
Fortunately, I was given a chance to overcome that mistake.

372
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,160
Thanks to your mother.

373
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:39,360
If the world finds out the truth,

374
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,150
it will not only ruin your household,

375
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:45,500
but the future of Taeyang Group.

376
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,490
Ah! I thought you'd be curious.

377
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,150
Why Doo Rim came back safely.

378
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:16,720
I also don't want things to get noisy.

379
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,780
It's over if we break off this marriage.

380
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:27,880
You know well that you have a lot more to lose than we do.

381
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,200
You also know you shouldn't drag this out too long.

382
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,400
I'll give you until tomorrow.

383
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:07,640

384
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,010
 Bride of the Century
