1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,560
Who is it?

3
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,650
Your lover.

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,250
Jin Ju, is someone here?

5
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,880
Jin Ju, who are these people?

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,540
Doo Rim...

7
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,310
Who are you people, and why are you barging into someone else's home?

8
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,850
If we tell you who we are, are you going to pay the money in her stead?

9
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,990
If you don't have money, you'll have to pay it off with your body.

10
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,300
Step aside.

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,570
Let her go! What do you two think you're doing right now?

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,510
Get out!

13
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,030
Doo Rim!

14
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,260
Hey!

15
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,800
You stupid cowardly bastards. Who do you think you're messing with?

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,680
Hey!

17
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,010
Take that!

18
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,730
Wait! Wait!

19
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,780
Don't you dare come back!

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,350
Oh Jin Ju?

21
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,990
Team Leader!

22
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,750
What happened here?

23
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,800
Oh ... well ... you see ...

24
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,980
Jin Ju, it seems you have a visitor. I'll get going.

25
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,520
- Wait. 
 - Yes?

26
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,410
Your shoes.

27
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,230
Oh, my shoes.

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,340
Team Leader, what brings you here?

29
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,850
That's ...

30
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,550
This bastard. Excuse me!

31
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,090
Yi Gyeong? No, she's not here.

32
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,750
She just stepped out, so she'll be back soon.

33
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,440
But, why do you need her? Did something happen?

34
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,640
Why did he come here so late?

35
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,340
Yes, Oppa. I'm in front of the house.

36
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,360
I want to go in too, but something happened.

37
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,710
Anyway, I'll go in soon.

38
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,120
How long is he going to stay out there?

39
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,670
I'm practically filming an action movie today.

40
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,250
Excuse me!

41
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,910
Hey, Jang Yi Gyeong!

42
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,680
- Kang Ju! 
 - You have nothing else to do so now you're scaling walls?

43
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,950
Get down here already. Are you planning to stay up there all night?

44
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,180
Okay.

45
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,450
Not that way, this way! Where I am.

46
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,530
Okay! Stop shouting, you're making me confused.

47
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:02,230
Do you think I can stay calm right now? What the hell are you doing in the middle of the night?

48
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,440
Oh my goodness!

49
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,710
Oh my goodness!

50
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,390
You're so heavy.

51
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,720
Are you okay?

52
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,320
I am not okay.  I am hurt here. It's bleeding. It hurts.

53
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,270
My sweet potatoes! What a waste.

54
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,050
Why do you look like that? Do you even have a brain?

55
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,790
I'd like to open up that brain of yours to see what the hell you're thinking about.

56
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,680
You were shocked because I look like this, right?

57
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,870
If I ever die of a heart attack, know that it'll be your fault.

58
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,110
Tell me. Why did a sick person reject my dinner invitation

59
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,890
and go somewhere, looking like that, doing what?

60
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,490
I'm really sorry I couldn't accept your dinner invitation.

61
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,950
Did you go to the club dressed like that? If there are weird videos of you on the Internet...

62
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,090
No! I didn't go to the club! The truth is ...

63
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,420
I did a cosplay with some friends.

64
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,460
You know what that is, right? What do you think? Don't I look sexy?

65
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,760
Stop it. I'm scared I'll see you in my nightmares.

66
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,980
Fine, whatever.

67
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,610
You used to say you liked sexy women.

68
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,460
- When? 
 - Last time, when you said I had the body of an elementary schooler.

69
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,580
So?

70
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,780
Do you think this suits you?

71
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,960
Oh, yes, you're so right. I must have gone crazy for a bit and did something stupid.

72
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,600
I can tell that for myself without you telling me outright.

73
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,940
Anyway, what's that for?

74
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,610
You said you like the organic cakes with mango so I picked a mango cake.

75
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,240
Wow!

76
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,530
Wow, this looks so good. Wow.

77
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,860
You remembered all that and bought this?

78
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,850
Well, I was just passing by after my dinner and...

79
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,340
Also, it's not because I planned on remembering it.

80
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,550
It's just that my memory is so good that I can't forget it.

81
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,620
This is so good. It's just melting in my mouth.

82
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,810
- You should have some, too. 
 - I don't like cakes.

83
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,650
But it's good.

84
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,720
Then, you can eat this.

85
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,750
Ta-da!

86
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,730
You want to me eat this? You dropped these earlier.

87
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,680
I cleaned all the dirt off.

88
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,460
Come on. This is pumpkin sweet potato so it's really good.

89
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,880
It's good, isn't it?

90
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,620
Well, it's edible.

91
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:54,480
Sweet potatoes taste the best when you eat it with kimchi that was fermented in a crock pot.

92
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,940
My grandmother...

93
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,420
did that for me when I was young, yeah.

94
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,800
You've never tried it like that, have you? You should try it, you won't regret it.

95
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,000
Are you planning on eating the whole thing right now?

96
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,740
Yes. You bought this for me, so I should eat the whole thing.

97
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:40,990
But, other women only eat a little in front of men. Why are you...

98
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,020
It's because I don't see you as a man. Happy?

99
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,090
What?

100
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,170
You're bleeding! Oh no.

101
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,000
- What are you doing? 
 - Hold still.

102
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,230
Oh, no. It must be painful.

103
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,880
Forget it. Just wipe the cream off your lips.

104
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:38,650

105
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:53,390
♫  Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you  ♫

106
00:12:53,390 --> 00:13:00,430
♫  Just come to me.  Keep on coming to me  ♫

107
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,640
What are you doing?

108
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,480
What? You don't see me as a man? Then what do you see me as?

109
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,360
I just said it as a joke, but you kiss me without permission?

110
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,460
I think you're misunderstanding something right now.

111
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,250
I'm not someone who needs permission to do anything.

112
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,160
You should be the one asking permission to touch royalty.

113
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,980
You think I need permission from you?

114
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,820
Royalty?

115
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,650
Do you think I'm a court lady from the Joseon Dynasty? Right now,

116
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,000
Right now, you sound like the chair king with 3000 palace ladies.  (T.N. famous King known for debauchery and was said to have destroyed the nation.)

117
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,290
You know in a marriage, one person has power and the other obeys.

118
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,680
The one who obeys is the one who is lacking, and that's our marriage right now.

119
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,620
So, you think you can boss me around?

120
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,960
I thought you were just a stonehead,  but I'm glad you finally understand.

121
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,740
So as the one who is lacking, obey so you don't upset the person with power.

122
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,730
Understand?

123
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,980
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

124
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,480
- I have to take home the rest. 
 - Just throw it out.

125
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,960
That's such a waste. Why would I do that?

126
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,880
Damn it.

127
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,010
Don't get the wrong idea again. I'm not doing this because you're pretty. It's because you're embarrassing.

128
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,290
What the heck? He gives a disease then the medicine.

129
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,420
He forgot his coat.

130
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,750
 - You uploaded this, right? 
 - How did you...

131
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,720
 Where did you hear this from? Did Jang Yi Gyeong tell you?

132
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,180
 No. Never.

133
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,320
 It's a lucky charm that calls for love.

134
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,910
Do I actually... Choi Kang Ju? That makes no sense.

135
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,210
If Choi Kang Ju comes at me without permission one more time, then I'm really going to...

136
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,080
Why did you suddenly want sweet potatoes?

137
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,720
Someone told me this is really good if I have it with kimchi.

138
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,920
Of course.

139
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,300
You have to rip it like this for it to taste good.

140
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,220
Here. Try it.

141
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,960
- Good, right? 
 - Yes, it is.

142
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,780
- You should have some, too. 
 - Don't mind if I do.

143
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,340
This is so good. It roasted so well.

144
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,540
 - Yes, Chairman! 
 - Bring me a glass of water, please.

145
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,050
 I'll be up right away.

146
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,610
What's this?

147
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,870
Please sit.

148
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,220
I was feeling hungry.

149
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,520
Someone said you have to eat a sweet potato like this for it to taste the best.

150
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,850
How?

151
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,930
Don't eat it yet.

152
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,180
Try it now.

153
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,620
Okay, let's see.

154
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,050
It reminds me of the past.

155
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,950
Sweet potatoes these days are nothing special, but they were so precious in the past.

156
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,020
Hey,

157
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,360
who taught you to eat sweet potatoes with kimchi?

158
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,600
Someone. She's like a goblin from another star.

159
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,800
Goblin?

160
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,830
Was it Yi Gyeong?

161
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,030
Only Yi Gyeong could be compared to a goblin.

162
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,690
- Have some water. 
 - Thanks to Yi Gyeong, I'm having a delicacy...

163
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,520
for the first time in a while.

164
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,980
This is really good. You can eat these with the skin on.

165
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,230
Try it, here.

166
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,710
Hell— Oh, no one's here.

167
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,950
Hello.

168
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,150
- Is the CEO here? 
 - No, not yet. His meeting must be ending late.

169
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,390
Hello!

170
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,500
Work is hard, right?

171
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,150
- Have some while you work. 
 - Wow, they look so good.

172
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,690
Where are the pamphlets for the event?

173
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,360
Oh, Oh Jin Ju went down to the parking lot to pick them up.

174
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,730
It's been a while since she left, though.

175
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,890
There she is now.

176
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,750
Excuse me.

177
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,430
Have some while you work.

178
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,580
Thank you.

179
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,900
♫  I don't want to even be apart from you for a moment  ♫

180
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,810
Please eat up. Have some as you work. Enjoy!

181
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:18,590
♫   I really love you. It's like a dream  ♫

182
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,360
♫   I really love you. I try to hold it in. I try to stop it.  ♫

183
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,290
♫   It keeps appearing.  ♫

184
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,830
♫  My love   ♫

185
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,960
Did you know that Jin Ju is a member of Kang In's anti-cafe?

186
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,460
What does that mean?

187
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:41,150
Something weird was posted on the anti-cafe, so we traced the IP address and its location was her place.

188
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,100
Don't you want to know what that weird post was?

189
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,560
It said Kang In and I were dating. It talked about how we were close enough for him to put a pin in my hair.

190
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,030
It was so detailed as if she saw it with her own eyes.

191
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,340
At first, I suspected you. You were the only person who saw it.

192
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:06,220
- Why would I? 
 - You know how I think about Kang Ju.

193
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,120
But if he found out that I had a thing with his brother,

194
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,410
even crazy soap operas aren't that crazy.

195
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,750
I figured you might want me to be part of a crazy soap opera.

196
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,830
There was a high possibility you told Oh Jin Ju about it.

197
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,440
Do you think I'm like you?

198
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,220
What's that supposed to mean?

199
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,390
I know you were the one who uploaded the cake eating video.

200
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,750
No matter how low I go, I won't do anything as petty as that.

201
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,920
What? Petty?

202
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,940
Team Leader! We have a problem.

203
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,960
What is it?

204
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,830
- The ring disappeared! 
 - What?

205
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,680
Is the ring that important?

206
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,470
It was custom-made for President Kaneko. It was specially made for tomorrow's ceremony.

207
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,960
Tell me the truth! Where did you swindle the ring?

208
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,980
CEO, it really wasn't me. After it was given to me by the security team,

209
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,230
I carefully verified it. Then placed it on your desk.

210
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,570
After you placed it on my desk, you didn't go anywhere.

211
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:24,240
And no individual entered my room either. So did the ring sprout feet and run away?

212
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,100
There's no one other than you that could've gotten their hands on the ring!

213
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,790
CEO.

214
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,280
Your sick grandmother and younger siblings. It must've been difficult to look after them.

215
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,180
A few days ago you went to apply for a loan and were rejected due to your credit limit.

216
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,220
Isn't that why you set your eyes on the ring?

217
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,440
It's not too late to tell me the truth. I'll forgive you this one time.

218
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,870
I told you it wasn't me. Why can't you believe in my words?

219
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,850
Assistant Kim! Are you alright?

220
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,880
Those that are the closest to you are the scariest.

221
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,300
Pretending to be kind and innocent, then stabbing them in the back.

222
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,660
You're no different.

223
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:17,290
- Kang Ju. 
 - Why are you even here? Get out!

224
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,640
- How could you do that to a person? 
 - I'm more concerned about the exhibition! Understand?

225
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,750
You should intervene depending on the time and place. Can you still not grasp this situation?

226
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,570
- Hand Assistant Kim to the police immediately. 
- Yes.

227
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,440
-Secretary Kim.

228
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,470
Have the event staff on 24-hr emergency stand-by and call for an emergency meeting with the heads of each division.

229
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,780
Yes, I understand.

230
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,650
How could you do that? It was none other than the person that was next to you.

231
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,140
He always followed you like a shadow. He was your person!

232
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,700
That's why I can't forgive him even more. Understand?

233
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,270
If it were someone who had nothing to do with me, I could've ignored it.

234
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,000
But because he was the person next to me.

235
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,810
He was the person closest to me.

236
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,060
- Detective Kim, come over here. 
 - Yes.

237
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,620
What are you going to do Assistant Kim?

238
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,320
You'll be released as soon as the investigation deems you clear.

239
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,390
So even if you're having a difficult time, wait it out until then.

240
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,510
Thank you for caring about me.

241
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,360
Also ... Don't be too upset at the CEO.

242
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,370
It's not like that. If only I had

243
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,590
looked over the environment a little bit more. This wouldn't have happened.

244
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,060
Is there someone you suspect?

245
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,230
It's nothing. It can't be. They're not that kind of person.

246
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,020
I might have had a misunderstanding.

247
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,540
Even still, can you tell me? Please.

248
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,790
Move the other cases to the secured room. I'll personally deliver this to the CEO.

249
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,760
Yes, I understand.

250
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,700
Jin Ju, are you alright?

251
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,610
Yes.

252
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:26,740
That's the only time I let go of the jewelry box.

253
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,450
But Jin Ju isn't that kind of person.

254
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,100
Why isn't she answering her phone?

255
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,280
Alright, drag her away.

256
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,610
- Don't get mad at me. 
 - Get in.

257
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,800
This one really! Hurry and bring her.

258
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,710
Hold on!

259
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,370
Ah, why won't you answer your phone? Ah, this one.

260
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,010
- Will you only come to your senses after a beating? 
 - Hold on!

261
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,540
This. This is real.

262
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,000
If you sell this ... you'll get more than what I owe you.

263
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,310
Let's call it even with this.

264
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,460
Oh Jin  Ju.

265
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,910
Jin Ju, you.

266
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:57,900
Who are you? The house wasn't enough, so you chased her down at work?

267
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,100
Who is this?

268
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,870
Brother, this is her.

269
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,400
Do you want me to stuff you in a coffin,

270
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,750
and nail it shut while I'm at it?

271
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,670
Hold on a moment.

272
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,570
Could you fast forward this?

273
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,640
Do you know what you did?

274
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,300
I'm sorry Doo Rim. I messed up.

275
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,750
I was so afraid of those guys showing up day after day.

276
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,160
Even without realizing, I just...

277
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,850
 Jin Ju, are you alright?

278
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,660
 Yes.

279
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,740
I couldn't think of anything then.

280
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,050
If I just had that.

281
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,670
I would be able to escape their grasp.

282
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:22,610
Assistant Kim has been wrongfully accused and is locked up in a holding cell  because of you.

283
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,120
And Assistant Kim said that it couldn't be you, until the end.

284
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,910
He said it was probably a misunderstanding.

285
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:33,460
Do you know what you did to someone that trusted you so whole-heartedly?

286
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,250
Jin Ju, you weren't this kind of person.

287
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,120
You're not the same person I used to know.

288
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:49,850
At first, I thought if I tried hard,

289
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,940
I'd be able to save up money. That I could be like everyone else

290
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,840
and buy designer purses.

291
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,960
And that I could go to fancy restaurants and eat expensive foods. I thought it would be like that.

292
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,920
But you know what's funny?

293
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,480
I work without getting days off, again and again.

294
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,550
When others eat soup that costs 7,000 won,

295
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,380
I'll eat kimbap that costs 1,000 won.

296
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,780
And still I can't seem to save up money, and my debt keeps growing.

297
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:35,720
When I moved to this house, I needed money for the security deposit,

298
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,500
so I was only going to borrow enough for the moment.

299
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,090
But I didn't know it would turn out like this.

300
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,880
You can't justify your actions with that.

301
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,610
I know that I can't. I don't plan on avoiding it.

302
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,370
I'll own up to it.

303
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,620
What are you going to do?

304
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,140
I'll tell the CEO the truth.

305
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,240
Then you'll be fired from the department store!

306
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,380
It doesn't matter. My life has already

307
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:18,190
hit rock bottom anyway.  I can't go any lower than this.

308
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,300
Really.

309
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,070
I'm sorry I disappointed you Doo Rim. But ...

310
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,580
you'll still be my friend, right?

311
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,340
I'm more afraid of losing you than my job.

312
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,990
Hold on Jin Ju.

313
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,480
Without anyone nothing, let's return it to its place.

314
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,020
- What? 
 - If we just return the ring, we can pass over this incident.

315
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,270
Doo Rim.

316
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,410
No one will suspect anything if I go into Kang Ju's office.

317
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,400
I'll put it back without anyone knowing. Let's do that.

318
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,860
 Jin Ju. Even if things don't turn out the way we want them to,

319
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,580
 Let's live confidently, the way we always have.

320
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,850
 Cheer up, Jin Ju.

321
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,700
Thanks Na Doo Rim.

322
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:53,500
That's a relief. So is Secretary Kim also getting released?

323
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,520
I was just curious.

324
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,140
This is just my opinion but I think it's more important that the ring was found,

325
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,080
than trying to find the culprit.

326
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,490
That's what I'm saying.

327
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,070
If you keep dwelling on something so insignificant,

328
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:13,020
the department store image will also suffer.

329
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,890
It's best to just quietly get pass these situations.

330
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,310
Okay. Bye.

331
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,560
That's a relief.

332
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,260
Na Doo Rim, you did a good job.

333
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,360
 You weren't here so I'm just leaving this here.

334
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,400
 Eat it as a snack when you're hungry.

335
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:06,400
 After you left it on my desk, you never left your desk.

336
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,510
 And no one came by my office.

337
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,410
 I have something to show you.

338
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,660
Yes, Kang Ju. You're in front of the house?

339
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,900
Okay, I understand. I'll head down.

340
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,820
What could it be?

341
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,340
What is this?

342
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,170
What happened? I'm asking you to explain this.

343
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,660
Kang Ju. You see, what happened was—

344
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,840
How much more do I have to understand and let things go?

345
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:31,150
I knew you were unpredictable but I can't understand or forgive you for this.

346
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,900
Stop getting angry and listen to what I have to say.

347
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,960
I don't want to hear your excuses.

348
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,100
You weren't trying to steal it. Fine, you probably weren't.

349
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,650
What are you lacking that you'd try to steal that? So you were delivering a sandwich,

350
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,520
then you saw the pretty ring and tried it on intending to put it right back.

351
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,260
But then you forgot and walked out.

352
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,720
This is what I pictured in my mind. Is it not?

353
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,530
If I think about everything you've done so far, you're definitely capable.

354
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:09,010
Because you're careless. You're the best at jumping into things without thinking about the consequences.

355
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,460
Do you know what happened because of your thoughtless actions?

356
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:18,890
How much longer do I have to clean up after you? How much longer?

357
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,620
- Kang Ju, that's ... 
 - If it's going to continue on like this,

358
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,310
we need to reconsider this marriage.

359
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:33,080
For the time being, don't try to call me. I need time to think.

360
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,480
There must have been some sort of misunderstanding ...

361
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:59,000
Oppa. Oppa, I ...

362
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,230
If it's too hard, you don't have to say it. I don't know what happened,

363
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,190
but I know you wouldn't have done that.

364
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,180
Oppa.

365
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,620
What do you mean ring thief?  What is this about?

366
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,460
You heard Doo Rim. It was for her friend.

367
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,390
What friend? Take me to her now. I need to meet her.

368
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:31,090
Mother, calm down. If you get involved, it'll only make things more complicated.

369
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,320
Is this that simple?

370
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,230
If things go wrong, Yi Gyeong becomes a thief. How can I stay calm?

371
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:43,760
I'll take care of it. I'll do everything I can.

372
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,790
How are you going to take care of it? How?

373
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,410
The only solution is for that friend to confess.

374
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,790
If she denies it and says she didn't do it,

375
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,640
then you'll take all the blame for it.

376
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,190
Jin Ju isn't that type of girl. I know that much for a fact.

377
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:09,220
But I wonder who showed that video to Choi Kang Ju?

378
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:16,090
How did they know you would do that and have a camera ready in the office? Is there anyone you suspect?

379
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:22,850
 At first, I suspected you because you were the only one who saw that.

380
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:26,290
There 's one person.

381
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,190
Are you thinking ... Ru Mi?

382
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:38,930
So Ru Mi is causing all of this. What if they want to break off the wedding?

383
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,270
Oh, my head.

384
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,660
Hey, hey. Did you hear the rumor?

385
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,630
The ring. The CEO's fiancé stole it.

386
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,270
What in the world?

387
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:58,530
- Who did you hear that from? 
 - What do you mean? It's all over the department store.

388
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,510
What if they call off the wedding at this rate?

389
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:04,360
That's what I'm saying. The cake eating contest can be cute,

390
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,410
but a ring thief is something else.

391
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,090
Would Taeyang Group want a thief as their daughter-in-law?

392
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:15,270
- Of course. It's Taeyang Group. 
 - You really have to take the time to get to know people.

393
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:01,380
It's late. Did you drink?

394
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,840
I just got a call from Ru Mi.

395
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,900
What happened? Yi Gyeong stole a ring?

396
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,430
I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it, Mother.

397
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,960
Break up?

398
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,360
Don't worry. If they were going to call off the wedding,

399
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,350
they would have done it when you disappeared from the inaugurationl ceremony.

400
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:40,450
Kang Ju's mother's goal is marriage, not a break up.

401
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,630
In fact, she may even want this wedding to happen faster.

402
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:48,420
Since the first wife is just a sacrifice to her anyway.

403
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,910
Secretary Kim.

404
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:15,500
Jin Ju. What are you ...

405
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,730
Jin Ju, why are you doing this all of a sudden?

406
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,500
I stole it. The ring.

407
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,750
I'm really sorry.

408
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,010
I'm sorry.

409
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,550
I'm sorry.

410
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,230
It's okay, Jin Ju.

411
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:05,500
Don't cry.

412
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,090
I actually stole the ring before you did.

413
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,180
When I first saw the ring,

414
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:21,290
I wanted to steal it.

415
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:27,950
This ring could help pay off my mother's hospital bills that have been piling up for months,

416
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:32,870
and my siblings could study wherever they want.

417
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:38,860
In my heart, I already stole that ring.

418
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,880
I have no right to blame you.

419
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,830
So don't cry.

420
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:51,060
I'm sorry.

421
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,140
I'm sorry, Secretary Kim.

422
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,130
I was wrong.

423
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,450
I thought I told you to take the day off.

424
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,740
You did, but I'm fine.

425
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,300
- Yesterday, I— 
 - It was because I was careless.

426
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,970
I was largely at fault. I'm sorry.

427
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,510
Also, you have a guest waiting inside.

428
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,840
How can I help you?

429
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,660
I have something I need to tell you.

430
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:35,470
I know I don't have to tell you this, but what we discuss here,

431
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,500
cannot be heard by anyone else. Please keep that in mind.

432
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,610
Of course, you have nothing to worry about.

433
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:46,130
I am a person who lives off of just one skill.

434
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:51,450
If I do not keep my word, then it would not be my choice,

435
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,430
but also the heavens.

436
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:59,670
I am just someone who follows orders from heaven. Then, please return safely.

437
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:13,730
Oh, so frustrating. So frustrating.

438
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:19,160
It's not like I can tell her the truth. I've just become a spy.

439
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:26,550
In any case, I thought the wedding could get called off.

440
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:31,930
Things are progressing strangely.

441
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:37,330
You were probably very surprised by the ring incident.

442
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:41,310
I understand that she was trying to protect someone below her,

443
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:44,770
but she was still careless.

444
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:49,960
Fortunately, the misunderstanding was resolved and things ended smoothly.

445
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,630
But the video incident from last time and then this,

446
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:59,020
I'm concerned about the rumors of a break up.

447
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,210
I think we need to move the wedding sooner than later.

448
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,560
I should have contacted you earlier. I'm sorry.

449
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,310
Things at the company have been crazy.

450
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:15,300
Of course. I'm sure it has been.

451
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,870
So I don't want to impose but,

452
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:23,010
we already looked up some dates.

453
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,250
I know it's usually the bride's side that chooses a date,

454
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,720
but we have someone who's been looking after our family for some time.

455
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:39,650
I wasn't sure, so I requested several dates to choose from.

456
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:45,140
You can discuss it with Yi Gyeong and choose from one of those dates.

457
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,770
Yes, let's plan on that.

458
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:05,090
 I know why you're trying to hurry this wedding. I know what you want.

459
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:11,190
 But it's not going to happen the way you want. Never.

460
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,830
 Enjoy.

461
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:36,880
 She really looks exactly like me. We could pass as twins.

462
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:43,180
 That child is our last chance from the heavens.

463
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,460
 What are you saying?

464
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:50,960
 As soon as I found out why Kang Ju's mother chose you to be bride,

465
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,760
 I couldn't just sit back and take it

466
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,140
 How dare she try to use my daughter as a sacrifice.

467
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:09,130
 Yi Gyeong. Listen to me carefully.

468
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:17,360
 I'm going to make you Taeyang Group's daughter-in-law.

469
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,320
 Even if I have to steal someone else's life.

470
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,630
 Mom, what are you thinking right now?

471
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:39,230
 I don't know what you're thinking,

472
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:44,010
 but I don't want to. I'm not going through with this marriage.

473
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,340
 I'm scared.

474
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,680
 Don't you feel used and wronged?

475
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,230
 How pitiful do we seem that Kang Ju's mother thinks she can play with your life?

476
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:00,200
 How much longer are you going to let people step all over you?

477
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:05,000
 If you runaway because you're scared, you'll live that way until you die.

478
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,060
 Do you want to live as a weak loser all your life?

479
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:16,590
 Right now, we don't know when we'll be stabbed in the back.

480
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,880
 But if you just listen to me,

481
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,760
 we'll have a weapon that can give us the power to do whatever we want.

482
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,190
You were right.

483
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:49,090
Kang Ju's mother must be really impatient.

484
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:53,960
She even got wedding dates when the bride's side normally takes care of that.

485
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,850
Mom, I can't forgive Choi Kang Ju's mother.

486
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,730
How could she do that to me?

487
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:06,250
That's why you need to become Taeyang Group's daughter-in-law.

488
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:10,000
With everyone watching. Confidently.

489
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,550
Once you find your place in that family, the games they played with your life,

490
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:22,110
Kang Ju's mom will end up paying the price.

491
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,690
Because you standing in that position,

492
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:29,750
is the worst pain she could have.

493
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:37,840
To do that, we need to make sure Doo Rim makes it to the wedding.

494
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,850
Whether it's through bribes or other means.

495
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,750
Mom,

496
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,910
I'm going to become Taeyang Group's daughter-in-law.

497
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:56,870
And then everyone will be beneath my feet.

498
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:00,630
Including Choi Kang Ju's mother, who put a price on my life.

499
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,840
And Lee Ru Mi, who always looked down on me.

500
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,090
And then all the pain and insults I received,

501
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:10,870
will be returned right back to them.

502
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:15,510
No, I'll pay them back two-folds, three-folds.

503
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,810
Of course you should.

504
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,930
Now you seem more like my daughter.

505
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:36,890
♫  Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you  ♫

506
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:39,090
♫  Just come to me.   ♫

507
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:44,150
♫  Keep on coming to me  ♫ 
  Bride of the Century

508
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:51,080
♫  Suddenly you became the only person  I longed  for you while smiling.  ♫

509
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:58,290
♫  Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever  ♫

510
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:06,540
♫  Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever  ♫

511
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:13,570
♫  It must have been love.  It was hidden. The only person there.  ♫

512
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:18,910
♫  It must have been you.  Be at my side  The one person who did that.  ♫
