1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,540
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,980

3
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,770
Na Doo Rim must be going to Oppa.

4
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,220
She's running like a bullet.

5
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,930
This is a secret that you and I have to take to our graves.

6
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,530
Even though I know that Yi Hyeon treasures you like gold.

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,630
we can't fully trust him.

8
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,470
Because he's not my biological brother?

9
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:25,210
We live in a world where even full siblings stab each other in their back.

10
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,270
So how can you trust a half-sibling?

11
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,290
Just passed the intersection. This is the right place.

12
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,560
Where is he?

13
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,020
Yi Hyeon.

14
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,660
Oppa, what are you doing here in the street?

15
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,050
Let's go home.

16
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,430
Can you get up?

17
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,180
It was when I was seven years old.

18
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,900
That day was my birthday.

19
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,840
My mom bought a cake but she forgot the candles.

20
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,250
We invited all my friends,

21
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,400
but without candles, there was nothing I could blow out.

22
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,210
I hit her as I cried.

23
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,220
My mom ran to the cake shop.

24
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,220
I waited a long time, but Mom didn't come back.

25
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,870
When I came out crying to look for my mom ...

26
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,010
My mom ...

27
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,060
Was collapsed here,

28
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,840
while holding seven candles in her hand.

29
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,690
Oppa, we're almost home. Hurry and go in.

30
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,030
Na Doo Rim.

31
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,460
Why aren't you saying anything after calling my name?

32
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,720
Kang Ju.

33
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,670
What are you doing here at this time?

34
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,570
Who's the one that invited me to the birthday party?

35
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,370
What? Did you already start drinking?

36
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,150
- Oppa!
- Are you alright?

37
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,970
Are you alright?

38
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,190
Let's go inside.

39
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,620
Let's leave now.

40
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,170
 Forget about Seon Hwa now.

41
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,390
 It's already been thirty years.

42
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,030
 Thirty years is enough time to make even a name fade from memory.

43
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,480
Hello?

44
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,660
 Orabeoni ( old form of Oppa ) Yi Hyeon, happy birthday.

45
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,100
 I with a long and blessed life.

46
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,230
 I hope you find someone special soon,

47
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,270
 and start a beautiful family with an adorable son and daughter

48
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,160
 This is my sincere wish for you.

49
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,740
 Oppa, happy birthday.

50
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,890
 If you had not been born, I would have been very lonely.

51
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,570
 I'm also thankful to your mother who allowed you to be born.

52
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:15,800
 Although I know that you're waiting for me, I don't have the courage to go back yet.

53
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,620
 I'm sorry.

54
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,610
I stocked up on food, so don't skip meals because you find it bothersome.

55
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,590
I understand.

56
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,190
 Incoming text

57
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,170
 Yi Gyeong, I received the flower basket well.

58
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,700
 Thank you for remembering my birthday.

59
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,990
Do you know why Oppa sends a text every single day?

60
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,470
You know that you can never answer that phone, right?

61
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,350
Don't worry.  I don't need to be caught because my location has been tracked.

62
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,310
The private line between you and me is right here.

63
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,720
What are you doing?

64
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,830
I was looking for copies of the subcontractor contracts.

65
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,240
Fine, you can leave.

66
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,010
- I heard you went there yesterday. 
 - Yeah.

67
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,680
The one on the left with short hair is Mi Yeong.

68
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,870
The one on the right with long hair is Hyeon Jeong.

69
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,020
Mi Yeong and Hyeon Jeong.

70
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,070
Sorry, I'm a little late, aren't I?

71
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,760
Jang Yi Gyeong, I almost forgot your face.  How long has it been?

72
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,190
If you didn't come today, we were really going to barge into your house.

73
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,430
I'm sorry.  I've been busy lately.

74
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,070
Your face does look a little rough.

75
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,900
It looks like you lost some weight.

76
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,350
As an apology, I'll buy dinner tonight.

77
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,200
Shouldn't your groom buy dinner?

78
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,930
Shouldn't the groom buy a meal for the bride's friends?

79
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,460
It's not polite for us to see the groom's face at the wedding.  Don't you think?

80
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,090
Yes, that's not right.

81
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,780
Call him.  Quickly.

82
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,200
Oh, okay.

83
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,940
Yes, it's me.  Are you still at work?

84
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,710
I'm with my fiends at the cafe across the street from the department store.

85
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,530
I was wondering if you could eat dinner with us.

86
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,090
You're busy, right?  Of course, I know you're busy.

87
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,500
Yes, I understand.

88
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,750
What should I do?  He can't make it today.

89
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,790
He's not the kind of person to come because you call.  He probably wouldn't come even if his Grandfather, the Chairman, called.

90
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,380
Eat more.  You like salmon salad.

91
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,510
Thank you.

92
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,620
Aren't you rubbing it in too much in front of us single people?

93
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,240
If you're envious, then hurry up and find your mates.

94
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,920
What if someone else stole them?

95
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,610
What if someone else stole the person I thought was my other half?

96
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,920
Should I wait for that person to come back?

97
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,390
Or would it be wise to find someone else?

98
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,900
Waiting for someone who left is a waste of time.

99
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,750
No. I'm going to wait.

100
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,990
No one knows when a person's heart could change.

101
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,160
 What are they doing?  I knew this would happen.

102
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,020
 Choi Kang Ju, a man with no morals.

103
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,420
It's gotten late.  Should we leave now?

104
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,230
Why?  Are you not having fun here?

105
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:36,430
Of course not.  You and Kang Ju both need to go to work early tomorrow.

106
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,010
Kang Ju, let's leave now.

107
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,730
Shall we?  Then that's enough for today.

108
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,690
Thank you for dinner.

109
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:25,150
You know that the thing rolling around on the floor isn't your shoe but your pride, right?

110
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,670
So embarrassing.

111
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,590
Go in.

112
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,930
I was really surprised today.

113
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,630
I was sure that you wouldn't come.

114
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,170
Did you do it because of Ru Mi?

115
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,100
In order to help Ru Mi quickly get closure on her feelings?

116
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,100
That's why you were purposefully good to me, wasn't it?

117
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,030
Go inside.

118
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:23,280
Choi Kang Ju you're the worst!  Even more than Ru Mi!

119
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,550
Because you keep caring about her, giving her an opportunity.

120
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,450
That's why Ru Mi can't give up.

121
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:39,710
I have never given my heart to you or Ru Mi.

122
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,230
Women mistake giving nice presents and nice food as showing feelings.

123
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,600
I can buy you as much delicious food and expensive presents as you want.

124
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,500
Because doing it with money is the easiest.

125
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,880
I can do that much for you.  Don't expect more.

126
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Let's go in.

127
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:34,450
From what I heard earlier, I thought you mentioned Ru Mi.  Is something going on?

128
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,030
Tell me.  If there is a problem between the two of you, we should know also.

129
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:50,720
You both know very well that Lee Ru Mi and Choi Kang Ju have had a close relationship for a long time.

130
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,030
It seems like Lee Ru Mi is trying to sway him, and that he is also being swayed.

131
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,820
Although I'm sure that won't happen,

132
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,610
there can't be even the tiniest chance that Kang Ju could fall for Ru Mi.

133
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,630
Why are we suffering like this right now?

134
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,060
You understand what I'm saying, right?

135
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,630
We are trusting in you.

136
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,550
Yes.  I will work hard.

137
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,540
Oppa, are you going somewhere?

138
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,740
Pay inside.

139
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,790
Why did you want steamed buns all of a sudden?

140
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,490
Why did we come so far?  They have them in the convenience store by home.

141
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,340
Ah, I wanted to take a walk.  It's nice to get some exercise.

142
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,550
Steamed buns!

143
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,020
Ahjumma, give us some steamed buns.

144
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,990
What kind do you want, Oppa?  Red bean or vegetable?

145
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,230
Oh, either one.

146
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,690
Please give us a red bean and a vegetable one.

147
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,780
That will be eleven thousand won.

148
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,780
- Oppa, we need to pay.
- Okay.

149
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,950
It's delicious.  Oppa, take a bite.

150
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,280
Excuse me, customer, you forgot this.

151
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,600
I think you're mistaken.  We have ours here.

152
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,290
That's strange. From the face it was the same person.

153
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,770
The person who left this looks just like her?

154
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,400
Yes.

155
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,290
Oppa!

156
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,380
Oppa!

157
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,290
It's important to find Yi Gyeong. But you're also important to me.

158
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,290
Yi Hyeon?

159
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,790
From now on, don't even go anywhere near that market.

160
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,460
And don't call me unless I call you first.

161
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,410
Yes, you need to be careful too.

162
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,620
Mother must be sleeping.

163
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,450
Where were you at this late hour?

164
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,820
We wanted to get some exercise so we went out for a walk.

165
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,000
We bought some buns, would you like some? I can steam them up really quick.

166
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,600
No thanks. I'm fine.

167
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,140
Okay.

168
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,530
Are Choi Kang Ju and Lee Ru Mi are still together right now?

169
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,260
That's what I said.

170
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,760
Because of the JR opening, they've been inseparable lately.

171
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,150
Last night, after working late ...

172
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,070
What? Hotel?

173
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,010
They said after working late, going home is too far and difficult,

174
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,610
so it would be easier to rest at a hotel nearby.

175
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,200
But no one knows what they're doing in the hotel.

176
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,070
It seemed too suspicious so I decided to call you.

177
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,010
Where are they now?

178
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,690
They finished not too long ago so they should be coming out.

179
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,780
Doo Rim, over there. There. There.

180
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,540
Where do you think they're headed? No way! A hotel.

181
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,230
- I'm leaving. 
 - Yeah. Doo Rim, be careful.

182
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,170
- Don't worry. 
 - Yeah.

183
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,090
Where are you two going right now?

184
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:48,980
Look at these two. They're trying to be smart.

185
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,950
Choi Kang Ju, you think I'll lose you?

186
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,630
They're meeting at a villa, not a hotel?

187
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:33,090
Fire? It'll get plenty hot in there even without a fire.

188
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,730
Then, the sexual tension will start heating up.

189
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,210
That's inappropriate. So inappropriate.

190
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,470
How long is he going to be like that?

191
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,820
Ah, it's cold.

192
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,730
Lee Ru Mi, when is that wench going to get here?

193
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,180
No way. Did she notice me?

194
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,590
No way. I was really careful.

195
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,160
Ah, I'm freezing.

196
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,700
Where did he go? Did he go to the bathroom?

197
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:34,150
I saw something lurking by the window. I thought it was an animal so I was about to shoot it.

198
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,170
But it was you?

199
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,510
I think we need to talk.

200
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,990
Huh?

201
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,120
What were you expecting that you followed me all the way here?

202
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,760
Why are you asking when you know?

203
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,840
Alright, let's just assume whatever you were thinking did happen.

204
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,700
Do you think I'd be caught? By the likes of you?

205
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,630
Then, are you saying you really have that kind of relationship with Lee Ru Mi?

206
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,780
Do you know what your actions today mean?

207
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,520
An engaged Choi Kang Ju has a mistress.

208
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,780
His mistress works in the same company,

209
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,530
and they are having a love affair in one of his villas.

210
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,570
You should have told the press.

211
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:36,620
Then you could have gotten compensation by Taeyang Group for emotional distress.

212
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,020
I have no idea what you're talking about.

213
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,610
It's late. I should get going.

214
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,200
What are you doing?

215
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,730
Isn't this what you wanted?

216
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,980
You weren't afraid to follow me all the way here.

217
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,030
Don't do it. No.

218
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,240
Why? You were going to headbutt me again? I'm not going to fall for it.

219
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,230
Don't treat people so lightly.

220
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:21,920
Do you think you're so above everyone else that you can treat them however you want?

221
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,080
I didn't do anything to you to deserve this kind of treatment.

222
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,160
This isn't what I wanted.

223
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,580
You're no different.

224
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,120
Everyone's the same because I'm Taeyang Group's heir.

225
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:48,510
What you want is to be Taeyang Group's daughter-in-law, not Choi Kang Ju's wife.

226
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:59,370
Go home. There are only local roads so there are no streetlights and it's dark. Drive carefully.

227
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,420
There was definitely someone there.

228
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,930
Seoul.

229
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,970
   Iryeong   Seoul

230
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,370
What?

231
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,970
Aren't you hungry?

232
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,950
Now that I think about it, I haven't had any dinner.

233
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:47,820
- You don't know what I might do. You really have some nerve. 
 - Huh?

234
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,180
Peel it.

235
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,910
Are you asking me to peel an onion?

236
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:03,580
They say hands are not only for eating, but they're for cooking too.

237
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:17,210
Villa? Okay, I understand. Call me if anything happens.

238
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,740
I'll tell my mother.

239
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,400
 Mom

240
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:25,990
 Hello, ma'am. Why are you calling at such a late hour?

241
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,530
Doo Rim called to say she's at a villa with Choi Kang Ju.

242
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:47,450
Villa? Why is she there?

243
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,290
Something must have come up.

244
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,830
Okay, I understand. Go rest.

245
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,370
Mother ... I ...

246
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,860
What? Is there something you want to tell me?

247
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:11,500
It's nothing. We'll find Yi Gyeong soon.

248
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,480
I don't want you to worry. Get some rest.

249
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,200
Okay.

250
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,160
Thank you for the hard work, Ahjumma.

251
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,620
Then, I'll be going now.

252
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,840
 For now, have the housekeeper answer the phone.

253
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,550
 Yi Hyeon is being suspicious.

254
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:13,000
Now, what you've been waiting for, drumroll please ...

255
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,730
What is this? Just to make this simple fried rice, you made me do all that work,

256
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,420
and made that huge fuss?

257
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,080
It's not just simple fried rice. Just try it first.

258
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,070
It's so good, you wouldn't even notice if someone died.

259
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,290
It's good, isn't it?

260
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,720
If you force me to eat this after we get married, it would be torture.

261
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,930
If it's not good, don't eat it.

262
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:59,880
I'm not eating it because it tastes good, but because you seem so proud of making it.

263
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,230
What do you like?

264
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,630
You must have a favorite food or something.

265
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:18,300
Sea cucumber, sea urchin, live octopus, sashimi ...

266
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:25,240
I can't eat any of those foods.

267
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,760
Salmon, caviar, lobster ...

268
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,790
Unsweetened organic cake, mango,

269
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,430
and coffee ... hand-dripped.

270
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,250
That. I like that.

271
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:49,330
But why do you always wear that bracelet? Does it have some special meaning?

272
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:54,960
This. It was a present. They said it was a lucky charm.

273
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,050
If I wear this, then maybe I'll find some luck.

274
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,410
The shrimp still tastes fishy.

275
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:23,360
Here. You didn't do anything but peel one onion.

276
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:29,240
I even peeled an onion for you. Now you want me to do dishes?

277
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:35,100
- I'm not the kind of man you can just boss around— 
 - Yes, yes.

278
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:41,170
Everyone in Korea knows you are Choi Kang Ju.

279
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,960
Here.

280
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:49,560
Make sure you scrub it well so there's no food left behind.

281
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,110
Fine.

282
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,160
This too.

283
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,740
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

284
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,490
Did it come out?

285
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,440
Jang Yi Gyeong.

286
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,220
Jang Yi Gyeong. Jang Yi Gyeong.

287
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,610
Jang Yi Gyeong!

288
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,130
No, don't come in.

289
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,770
Are you okay?

290
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,700
You could have hurt your head, neck, or back.

291
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,700
It might be dangerous for you to move so stay just like that. I'll go call an ambulance.

292
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,020
Yes, please hurry. Yes.

293
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,640
What are you doing?

294
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,770
What are you staring at?

295
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:55,340
Are you trying to get another video uploaded online by going out like this?

296
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,820
An X-rated one this time? No way.

297
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,370
Wear this.

298
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,980
Lights ... Turn them off.

299
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,850
Turn the lights off first.

300
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,110
I can't see anything.

301
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,270
Where are you touching?

302
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,830
I'm sorry.

303
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,080
Stop touching.

304
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,750
I never touched you. Just put these pants on.

305
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,500
Where's your leg?

306
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,160
Close your eyes.

307
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,590
- I can't see. 
 - Close your eyes.

308
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:51,560
Thankfully, it's not too serious. Her neck and stomach muscles

309
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,060
may be sore and there's some bruising.

310
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,520
Tonight she can stay here and get treatment.

311
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,410
Once she rests for a few days, she'll be just fine.

312
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,080
Thank you.

313
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,470
Where are you going?

314
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,770
The bathroom.

315
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,820
Stay still.

316
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,160
♫   The moments right now are unbelievably exciting  ♫

317
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,100
♫  I also unknowingly end up looking only for you  ♫

318
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,040
♫  I’ve been falling more and more for you.   ♫ 
I'm doing all sorts of things because of you.

319
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,590
♫  Even if I tried to push you away, in the end it was you.  ♫ 
 Shoveling, peeling onions ...

320
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,680
♫  Now I want to know more you better   ♫ 
 And there's also washing dishes.

321
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,430
♫  And I want to have you always  ♫

322
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,670
♫  Enter my heart  ♫

323
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,420
♫  I will keep on loving you  ♫

324
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:29,730
♫  Just come to me. Keep on coming to me.  ♫

325
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:36,620
♫  Suddenly you became the only person  I longed  for you while smiling.  ♫

326
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:43,670
♫   Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever.  ♫

327
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:06,920
♫  It must have been love.  It was hidden. The only person there.  ♫

328
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:14,240
♫  It must have been you.  Be at my side  The one person who did that.  ♫

329
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:21,060
♫  Suddenly you became the only person  I longed  for you while smiling.  ♫

330
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:28,080
♫  Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever.  ♫

331
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:36,440
♫  Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever.  ♫

332
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,250
Did you sleep well?

333
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,160
The bed was uncomfortable for you, was it?

334
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,690
No, I slept fine.

335
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,700
Did you think I would say that?

336
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,840
I'm sorry. Because of me ...

337
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,090
As long as you're sorry. We need to get ready to leave.

338
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,740
Noona.

339
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,800
Why are here again?

340
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,480
What do you mean again? It makes me sad.

341
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,070
Have you been eating?

342
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:19,590
I'm busy right now. I don't have time to play with you.

343
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:23,870
Did you see this? It came up on my anti-cafe. They say I'm two-timing.

344
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,870
It says she's older than me and I gave her a hairpin as a gift.

345
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,130
It's really detailed. Isn't it funny?

346
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,910
Is this funny? How can you be laughing?

347
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:37,960
Why are you overreacting? Someone just uploaded it for fun.

348
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,920
The only person who saw the hairpin was Yi Gyeong.

349
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,160
It might be okay with you, but not me.

350
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,930
If it was Yi Gyeong, I won't ever forgive her. Never.

351
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,800
How can you be so sure it was Yi Gyeong?

352
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,450
That's why I'm going to find out who it was.

353
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,520
What are you doing right now?

354
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,410
I'm going to find out using their IP address.

355
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,160
Manager Lee, it's Ru Mi.

356
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:16,100
Are you okay? Where did you get hurt?

357
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,980
The doctor said it's nothing too serious.

358
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,660
The neck brace should be worn for a few days just in case.

359
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,110
You should get going.

360
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,000
Take care of Yi Gyeong, Hyungnim.

361
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,360
Oppa, let's head inside.

362
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,920
Half-siblings.

363
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,180
Why did you go to the villa?

364
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,630
I thought he was meeting Ru Mi.

365
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,660
Madam asked me to keep an eye on them so I was secretly tailing them.

366
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,630
But it wasn't the case.

367
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,840
Why are staring at me like that?

368
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,300
Absolutely nothing ... happened at the villa.

369
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,130
You getting hurt was something.

370
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:40,730
What?

371
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,820
Let me know if you need anything.

372
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,830
You helped me when I hurt my hand.

373
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:48,830
It's okay. My body is just sore.

374
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,010
My arms and legs are just fine.

375
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:52,600
Okay, then just rest.

376
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,060
Yes.

377
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:33,070
What am I thinking right now?

378
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,320
Here. Drink up.

379
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,550
This is the essence of 100-year-old ginseng.

380
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,160
What?

381
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,070
This is for young master.

382
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,690
I made sure no one would notice. Don't worry.

383
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:50,840
And plus, the young master is still young so he has plenty of energy.

384
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,440
It's okay if he has a little less.

385
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,080
Don't leave a single drop. Drink up.

386
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,200
Honey, honey. Whenever you're like this, I get scared.

387
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,540
What do you mean scared? What's there to be scared of?

388
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,120
You're feeding me this so you can keep me up all night.

389
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:07,340
No one's going to kill you. Just drink.

390
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,030
Okay, I'll drink it.

391
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:12,370
Oh, good job. Drink—

392
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:16,280
- Young- Young master 
 - You're home.

393
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,630
Young master, you seem so happy lately.

394
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:24,540
Honey, he's about to be the husband of a beautiful bride.

395
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,820
Of course he would be happy now.

396
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,700
There are things you just can't hide.

397
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,440
A sneeze, a hole in a sock,

398
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,010
and one's love for another.

399
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,940
Don't you know those things?

400
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,000
Love? Who loves whom?

401
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,170
Young master, really.

402
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,900
Who else is getting married here?

403
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,050
It's not like that.

404
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:01,710
See. The young master knows everything now.

405
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,380
Honey.

406
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,540
Do you suppose ...

407
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,900
the young master will be okay?

408
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,930
What are you saying?

409
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,390
You know, the Chairman ...

410
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:19,780
After losing his first bride, he was so hurt.

411
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,700
The young miss is perfect for our young master.

412
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,480
If something bad were to happen ...

413
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,270
Watch your mouth. Stop speaking such nonsense.

414
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:33,980
Okay, just drink this.

415
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,570
- It's fine. I'm fine. 
 - Just drink the rest.

416
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,050
I'm fine.

417
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:42,000
- Just drink it. 
 - Oh, seriously.

418
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,400
Yi Gyeong hasn't been coming by lately.

419
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,010
Father.

420
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:05,560
Why? So you can play Alkaggi with her again?  (T. N. game where players try to flick their stone to knock another player's stone off a game board)

421
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,720
Alkaggi?

422
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,970
I mean ...

423
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:19,170
Alkaggi is more fun than Go.

424
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:24,340
What makes it more fun is Yi Gyeong ...

425
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,280
She's just like that, isn't she?

426
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,080
It's cold, head inside.

427
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,670
Kang Ju.

428
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,220
Yes.

429
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,870
Nevermind.

430
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,250
Head inside first. I'm going to get some air.

431
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,690
Okay.

432
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:31,850
Even after 30 years,

433
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:35,100
do you still want to remember her even if it's through a nightmare.

434
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,760
How long do you think it will take to erase her from your memory?

435
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,230
There was a time I thought you were at fault.

436
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:55,700
For it to be a simple accident, there were things that didn't fit.

437
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:05,750
If I say that I was never suspicious of you after living with you all these years,

438
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:09,660
it would sound like a lie.

439
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,870
My position as Taeyang Group's daughter-in-law was stolen,

440
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,640
so I did it out of jealousy?

441
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,710
Thinking like that,

442
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,790
isn't out of the ordinary.

443
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:28,240
After what happened to your first love,

444
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,870
I was the one who gained this position.

445
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,830
But ...

446
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,300
that was just an accident.

447
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,520
Something that could have happened to anyone.

448
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:46,140
It had nothing to do with you or this family.

449
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,670
That's what you want to believe.

450
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,580
Whether it's the truth or not. It doesn't matter.

451
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,700
Didn't you hear me?

452
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,110
It was just a simple accident.

453
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,030
We need to set a date soon.

454
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,430
That way Kang Ju can finally settle down.

455
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,080
For Kang Ju's sake.

456
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,660
Of course.

457
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,830
We must.

458
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,970
For our Kang Ju.

459
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,080
You're just coming home?

460
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,970
You took off your neck brace. Are you better now?

461
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:35,500
Of course. I'm fine now.

462
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,620
You haven't had dinner yet, right? I'll prepare some.

463
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,530
Go wash up.

464
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:41,970
Okay.

465
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:48,370
♫   Runaway. Run, runaway.  ♫

466
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:52,730
♫   So no one can find me.  ♫

467
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:59,650
♫   Runaway, runaway. Away-ay-ay-ay-ay.  ♫

468
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,010
Yes, Kang Ju.

469
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,860
President Kaneko invited us to dinner.

470
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,530
Are you free?

471
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,820
President Kaneko?

472
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,080
I can't, I can't speak Japanese.

473
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:20,520
I'm sorry, but I'm still healing for my injury.

474
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,530
I just want to rest at home tonight.

475
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:28,120
Please tell her I'm very sorry.

476
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:30,390
Yes.

477
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:46,030
♫   Runaway. Run, runaway.  ♫

478
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,180
Yeah, Jin Joo.

479
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:50,280
It's a snake. It's a snake.

480
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,250
It's a snake!

481
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,990
♫  Fill me up with love ♫

482
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,920
♫ My love battery must be low ♫

483
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,300
Fill my battery.

484
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,960
♫ Letting go of all my worry ♫

485
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,890
Cha, cha, cha!

486
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:07,760
Drink and drink. Drink and drink and drink.

487
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,890
Cheers.

488
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:18,410
Soju is the best drink.

489
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:20,900
I'm tired of drinking bland wine.

490
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,630
But Doo Rim, you get to drink expensive wine,

491
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:25,920
and you're just running your mouth.

492
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,420
It's just expensive.

493
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:32,510
My grandmother's raspberry wine is so much better.

494
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,360
When will I ever get to eat at a place like that?

495
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:42,990
I went to a new French restaurant in front of the department store.

496
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:47,020
It was so expensive so I just looked at the menu and left.

497
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,520
But do you know what the ladies next to me were talking about while they were eating their full courses?

498
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,920
The prices are pretty cheap here.

499
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,780
The smallest thing on the menu was 300,000 won  (~$288 US dollars) .

500
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,700
That's the same as the monthly rent on this rooftop apartment.

501
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,440
My one month's rent

502
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,480
is the price of a one meal to those people.

503
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:10,570
There isn't much to life.

504
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:13,790
When those people are eating steak, we can eat pork belly.

505
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:14,820
We'll eat.

506
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,070
When those people eat pasta,

507
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:19,270
- we'll eat ramyun. 
 - We will.

508
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:22,380
When those people drink wine, we'll drink soju.

509
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,770
We'll drink.

510
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:25,150
Isn't that enough?

511
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,000
In that spirit, one shot?

512
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,530
One shot.

513
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,040
Oh, it's good.

514
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:44,120
But, do all guys like sexy girls?

515
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,490
Why? Did Choi Kang Ju say he likes sexy girls?

516
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:53,360
He said I had a elementary schoolgirl body and just dismissed it.

517
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,830
To be honest, Doo Rim, you don't really have any feminine charm.

518
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:01,980
The heavens know it. The earth knows it. Everyone in the whole world knows it.

519
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,150
Don't you have a push-up bra?

520
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:10,590
You should at least try one like me.

521
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,220
Why should I? They're so restrictive.

522
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,610
You. You. We've got to do something with you.

523
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:19,900
You. You need to get educated by me.

524
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,490
Come with me.

525
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,500
Where are you going?

526
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,130
What is this? I'm not some kind of goblin.

527
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,630
What? You look sexy.

528
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,430
Follow me.

529
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,100
That makes me cringe.

530
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,630
Hey, all men like this stuff.

531
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:43,470
Isn't Choi Kang Ju a man? Try it. Try it.

532
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,000
Okay. Stop it, stop it.

533
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,130
I can do it. Watch.

534
01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:00,070
Stop it. Stop. You need to be born with it like me.

535
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,730
Anyone home?

536
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:05,190
Stop!

537
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:07,040
Anyone home?

538
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,140
Who is that?

539
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,350
Who's there?

540
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,480
Your lover.

541
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:21,670
Jin Joo, is someone here?

542
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:28,630
Jin Joo, who are those people?

543
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,320
Doo Rim.

544
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:37,240
Who do you think you are that you can just barge in here?

545
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,010
If you knew who we were,

546
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,620
then are you going to pay us back?

547
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:45,780
If you don't have the money, you should at least use your body.

548
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,200
Let's go somewhere nice.

549
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,550
Let go. What do you think you're doing?

550
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:54,370
Who are you?

551
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,140
Doo Rim!

552
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,230
Hey!

553
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:10,610
You cowardly stupid bastards.

554
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:13,760
Who do you think you're messing with?

555
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,220
Hey!

556
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:27,030

557
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,230
 Bride of the Century
