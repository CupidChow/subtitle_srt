1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,310
 Bride Of The Century

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000

3
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,710
This thing called a heart ...

4
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,990
I didn't think I had one.

5
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,970
My heart ...

6
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,270
I wasn't going to give it to anyone.

7
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,110
For the first time in my life, I have someone I want to give my heart to.

8
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,690
You came.

9
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,140
 Mom! Where are you?

10
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,170
 Dad! Dad!

11
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,770
 Where are you? Mom!

12
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,790
 Dad!

13
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,770
 Are you curious about who I am?

14
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,540
 When you get older, you're going to become the owner of this house.

15
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,870
 And I am the one who protects that owner.

16
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,000
It's not true, right?

17
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,560
It's not going to happen.

18
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,800
Why do you think it's not true?

19
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,360
Whenever I was in danger, you saved me and protected me.

20
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,740
Whenever I was struggling, you comforted me with your warm hand.

21
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,160
You were always on my side.

22
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,700
So there's no way you would do such a thing.

23
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,410
People only believe what they want to believe.  You are the same.

24
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,640
In order to become the owner of this house, there's a price you must pay.

25
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,310
This house can only become yours through pain and sacrifice.

26
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,830
The same goes for you. Without pain and sacrifice, there is nothing you can gain.

27
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,780
I cannot let her die.

28
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,330
The key to this problem is in your hands.

29
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,550
Whatever you choose will determine the outcome.

30
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,010
Your grandmother said that, right? Yes, I'm glad it all worked out.

31
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,250
When I tell Mother, she'll be so happy.

32
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,390
I'll go pick you up from the bus terminal when you arrive.

33
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,440
Okay. Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

34
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,270
Is he excited that you're going to Seoul?

35
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,650
Yes, he's excited. We agreed to meet at the bus terminal.

36
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,730
But Grandma, are you really okay with this? You won't regret moving to Seoul?

37
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,150
What regret?

38
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,450
Doo Rim, all of your friends moved after graduation,

39
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,110
but you stayed behind here like a well bucket with no rope.

40
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,740
But thanks to you,

41
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,740
I get to go to Seoul and experience a new world with new people.

42
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,530
It'll be nice.

43
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,970
Grandma, let's earn a lot of money in Seoul.

44
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,990
Once we earn a lot of money, we'll buy a nice house and a nice car.

45
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,680
We can even ride an airplane and vacation abroad.

46
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,980
Grandma, you wanted to go to Hawaii, right?

47
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,980
That's right. The twins' grandma went on a trip to Hawaii,

48
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,780
and bragged so much about it.

49
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,850
She made going on vacation abroad such a big deal.

50
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,200
I was so sick of hearing about it.

51
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,540
I thought even if I go into debt, I must go at least once.

52
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,180
Okay then. We'll go to Hawaii, America, and Europe.

53
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,550
Let's go everywhere you want to go.

54
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,450
Okay. Okay.

55
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:10,810
Then, I'll rub it in the nose of the twins' grandma.

56
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,380
At this rate, we might be up all night.

57
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,800
If you plan on leaving on the first bus tomorrow,

58
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,700
you need to go to sleep early. Let's go to sleep.

59
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,760
Yes, Grandma.

60
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,650
Let's sleep.

61
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,220
- Goodnight, Grandma.
 - You too.

62
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,000
Kang Ju?

63
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,460
Doo Rim is coming to Seoul?

64
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,980
That's great news.

65
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes. When she arrives, we were going to take a look at the store together.

66
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,620
Okay. Yi Hyeon, she'll need your help.

67
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,780
If she's moving to Seoul, there will be a lot of things she'll need.

68
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,150
Yes, I'll take care of it.

69
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,090
Then, I'll head out first.

70
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,060
Yes, okay.

71
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,850
Oppa.

72
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,480
Did something exciting happen today?

73
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,800
Possibly.

74
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,890
When are you going to introduce me to your girlfriend?

75
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,710
She doesn't know yet.

76
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,550
What? Then, is it a one-sided crush?

77
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,780
Mother might hear.

78
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,660
Give me some time.

79
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,420
Until then, keep it a secret from Mother.

80
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,620
Okay.

81
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,110
How incredible can she be that he's hesitating so much?

82
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,650
Yi Gyeong.

83
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,960
Yes, Mom.

84
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,940
You're looking at wedding dresses today, right?

85
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,050
Yes. Now that I'm going to look at wedding dresses,

86
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,610
I feel a little weird.

87
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,960
Don't be nervous.

88
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,860
Doo Rim is moving to Seoul.

89
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,770
- Really? 
 - For now, we'll keep her close.

90
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,980
We need to look for our chance.

91
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,230
Choose a pretty wedding dress.

92
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,940
You won't be wearing it. Doo Rim will be the one to wear it.

93
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,590
She'll be the tragic female lead that day.

94
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,060
She should at least wear a beautiful gown.

95
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:58,450
 Chinese Food

96
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,310
Wow.

97
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,150
How is it? Do you like it?

98
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,550
Yes, of course!

99
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,840
Ah, this restaurant. Is it really going to be mine?

100
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,750
- Do you like it that much? 
 - Yes!

101
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,900
I feel like I'm in a dream.

102
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,390
It used to be a restaurant so you just have to touch it up a bit.

103
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,520
I don't think there will be much to touch up.

104
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,540
The kitchen equipment is perfect. We just have to put up a new sign,

105
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,260
and paint it up a bit.

106
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,980
Oppa. It's totally awesome.

107
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,590
You're here.

108
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,980
What do you think of this?

109
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,340
Forget it. You won't have a need to wear that dress.

110
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,840
What do you mean?

111
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,350
Can't you understand?

112
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,590
You will have no need to wear a wedding dress.

113
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,900
I won't have a need to wear a wedding dress?

114
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,390
Are you saying you want to break off this marriage?

115
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,520
You finally seem to understand.

116
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,220
That's right. I'm breaking the engagement right now.

117
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:59,080
What's the reason? Why are you saying this all of sudden?

118
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,320
We never liked the idea of this marriage from the beginning. You and I both.

119
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm just saying we shouldn't force ourselves into an unwanted marriage.

120
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,710
Getting married against my will just because of my parents,

121
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,570
it's obvious what will happen.

122
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,330
No way. You can't do that.

123
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,530
Please don't do this.

124
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:26,610
If there's something you don't like, I'll fix it.

125
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,840
This marriage was wrong from the beginning.

126
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,730
There's nothing you can do to fix it.

127
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,730
So ...

128
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,240
from this point on, you and I,

129
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,730
are nothing to each other.

130
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,340
If you do this now, what am I supposed to do?

131
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,310
You can't do this.

132
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,660
Right now, you may resent me and find it hard to understand.

133
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,480
But there will be a day when you will thank me for my decision.

134
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,410
No. I can't accept it.

135
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,170
Whether you accept it or not, I won't change my mind.

136
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,010
I'm going to tell my parents today.

137
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,210
And soon there will be an official announcement.

138
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,800
If you want to charge me with any financial, emotional, or mental anguish,

139
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,980
do it all. I'll give you enough compensation.

140
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,100
That's as much as I can do for you.

141
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,520
Kang Ju! Kang Ju!

142
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,640
What? Break the engagement?

143
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,540
Did you do something wrong?

144
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,800
Did you do something to change his mind?

145
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,160
No, there was nothing like that.

146
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,730
If not, then why is he breaking things off?

147
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,100
I need to know why he's saying that all of a sudden.

148
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,140
I don't know either.

149
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,940
By any chance, did Doo Rim do something wrong?

150
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,920
Just think about it. It hasn't been long since I've been back.

151
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,180
It's impossible for Kang Ju's heart to do a 180 during that time.

152
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,080
Yi Gyeong.

153
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,160
The heavens must be helping us.

154
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,390
This is our chance to bring Doo Rim back.

155
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,160
The store is really spacious. When we open our restaurant, we're going to become rich.

156
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,000
While I'm here, I'm going to look into a few things so I'll be home in a few days.

157
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,320
The Director agreed to help me.

158
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,060
The Director?

159
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,880
- Your grandmother? 
 - Yes, she's asking to speak to you.

160
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,470
It's me, Grandmother.

161
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,690
Yes, yes.

162
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,650
Don't worry about Doo Rim. I'll be right next to her, helping her.

163
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,270
Okay. Then take care.

164
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,840
Your grandmother wants me to take care of you. She's leaving you in my hands.

165
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,090
Grandma is so funny.

166
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,340
Seriously. What if I change my mind and kidnap you instead?

167
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,530
Oppa, seriously.

168
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,720
If I took you for myself, what would you do?

169
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,290
Oppa, aren't you hungry? Hurry and eat.

170
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,150
Why aren't you eating?

171
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,510
It's delicious. Hurry and eat.

172
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,750
I think the food you cook tastes the best.

173
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,750
Eh, you're lying.

174
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,440
There are so many tasty things in this world.

175
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,060
Cooking isn't hard.

176
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,500
When the restaurant opens up, come by anytime.

177
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,640
If you want, I can cook you three meals a day every single day.

178
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,620
Doo Rim.

179
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,310
Yes, Mother.

180
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,270
What? Break the engagement?

181
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,330
Doo Rim, I think you need to meet Kang Ju.

182
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,560
- Mother. 
 - Yi Hyeon, you stay out of this.

183
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,320
Doo Rim, you've only been gone a few days and now he wants to break the engagement. It doesn't make any sense.

184
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,540
There must have been something that happened between the two of you.

185
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,340
Why are you pulling Doo Rim into this now? It's not her responsibility.

186
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,030
He spent far more time with Doo Rim.

187
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,580
Are you saying it still has nothing to do with her?

188
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,290
I'm not trying to place the blame on her.

189
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,830
We need to at least know why Kang Ju is doing this all of a sudden.

190
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,700
- What is Yi Gyeong doing? 
 - Do you really not know.

191
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,090
She's happy that she isn't part of this forced marriage anymore.

192
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,620
She's cheering and just letting the whole things happen.

193
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,170
What are you doing right now?

194
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,520
Can't you see? I'm packing.

195
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,100
For now, I'm going to the villa in Cheongpyeong.

196
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,870
You're not taking one step out of this room.

197
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,880
- Oppa. 
 - This is your problem now.

198
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,660
You need to figure it out. You can't runaway now.

199
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,140
You can't be like this to me too.

200
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,570
I'm going crazy.

201
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,610
You don't think I did anything?

202
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,940
No, I did as much as I could.

203
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,740
I cried my eyes out trying to hold onto Kang Ju.

204
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,530
I beeged him not to.

205
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,160
I told him I would fix whatever I did wrong.

206
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,050
But he still wanted to call it off so what am I supposed to do?

207
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,410
I can't do this anymore.

208
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,260
Oppa.

209
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,090
I'll meet with Kang Ju.

210
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,610
So what is it you wanted to tell us?

211
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,770
Is there a problem with the company?

212
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,150
No.

213
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,990
Then what is it that's so hard for you to tell us?

214
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,690
Kang Ju.

215
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,640
I ...

216
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,520
am breaking up with Yi Gyeong.

217
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,220
Kang Ju.

218
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,370
I met Yi Gyeong today and told her I'm  breaking the engagement.

219
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,380
I'm sorry.

220
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,210
What's the reason?

221
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,020
I don't want to get married to someone I have no feelings for.

222
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,360
It wasn't an easy decision.

223
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,330
My reasons ... my decision ...

224
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,390
I hope you can respect them.

225
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,450
I'll going to my room.

226
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,310
The two must have had an argument. I'll go speak with Kang Ju.

227
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,890
You should act like you didn't hear anything.

228
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,430
What are you doing right now? Do you think marriage is some kind of game?

229
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,870
You can't just break the engagement just because you want to.

230
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,360
You know very well why I'm doing this.

231
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,490
Don't be careless.

232
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,050
I'll talk to your father, so we'll just pretend this never happened.

233
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,730
Then, should I get married to Ru Mi?

234
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,970
What?

235
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,700
No matter what you say, I'm not going to change my mind.

236
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,260
Please leave. I'm tired.

237
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,790
Hello, it's me.

238
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,640
We just heard and we were shocked.

239
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,810
I'm really sorry. I called in case you misunderstood.

240
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:51,420
We plan on continuing with this marriage as planned.

241
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,200
Kang Ju has been overwhelmed with work,

242
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,520
and with the marriage on top of that, he's been a little sensitive.

243
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,070
I think that's why he made such a rash decision.

244
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,630
Anyway, I'm so sorry for making you worry about this.

245
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,300
Yes. Yes.

246
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,990
We can discuss the details in person.

247
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,730
Yes. Then ...

248
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,410
What did Choi Kang Ju's mother say?

249
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,090
Just because Kang Ju wants to break things off, it's not going to end that easily.

250
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,900
Kang Ju's mom doesn't want this called off just as much as us.

251
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,140
I don't know why Kang Ju is acting like this all of a sudden,

252
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,770
but his mom will do whatever she can to convince him to go through with this marriage.

253
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,830
We were able to use this as an excuse to bring back Doo Rim,

254
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,950
so all we have left is to change Kang Ju's mind.

255
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,480
Will you be okay?

256
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,560
If you don't want to, it's not too late to walk away.

257
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,030
You don't have to feel pressured to meet him just because my mother asked you to.

258
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,100
This is not your responsibility.

259
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:41,480
No, your mother has a point.

260
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,170
He broke things off only a few days after Yi Gyeong returned.

261
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:51,140
And your mother was really good to me all that time.

262
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,220
I'm not comfortable just ignoring the situation either.

263
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,990
I told you not to worry.

264
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,840
Call me as soon as you're done meeting with Choi Kang Ju.

265
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,800
Okay.

266
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,930
What are you doing?

267
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,970
Because this marriage was wrong from the beginning?

268
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,950
Isn't that too obvious?

269
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,080
I need to know the exact reason why.

270
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,480
Why are you breaking up with me?

271
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,800
President, it's time for your meeting.

272
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,550
Do you think I'll give up this easily?

273
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,460
Choi Kang Ju, you have a talent for making me angry.

274
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,060
Not yet?

275
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,620
Yes, the meeting seems to be going long.

276
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,070
Are you okay? You've been waiting a long time.

277
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,380
Where is the conference room?

278
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,990
 Taeyang Department Store

279
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,610
Is what Yi Gyeong said true?

280
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,540
I didn't hear her wrong, did I?

281
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,620
Why are you suddenly breaking the engagement?

282
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,260
Lee Ru Mi.

283
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,600
Do you want to marry me?

284
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,790
What are you talking about? Stop speaking nonsense.

285
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,800
What? You don't want to?

286
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,390
Isn't this what you wanted?

287
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,440
Answer me.

288
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,580
Oppa.

289
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,910
The reason you gave us a wedding present all of a sudden, did you think I wouldn't know?

290
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,800
Things won't happen the way you want.

291
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,750
I won't let it.

292
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,140
If you have a legitimate reason, I'll back off on my own.

293
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,170
So tell me.

294
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,300
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

295
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,230
There's no other reason. I just don't like you.

296
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,780
Honestly, this marriage was just business from the beginning.

297
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:36,950
But even if it was for business, it was wrong.

298
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,030
When I calculated everything, I would be losing too much.

299
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:48,010
You should be able to make up for what your family lacks. But honestly,

300
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,320
what's so great about you?

301
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,350
Think about everything you've done so far.

302
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,790
Is there anything you did right?

303
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,210
Every time you caused an accident,

304
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,680
do you know how much I suffered cleaning up after you?

305
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,220
When I think about having to continue that after we get married,

306
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,360
it's like looking into a black hole, it's awful.

307
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,290
I'll do better. I won't cause any more accidents.

308
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,330
From now on, I have to be responsibly for Taeyang Group.

309
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,920
I don't need someone like you. I need someone I can trust and depend on.

310
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,000
A woman who is smart and sensible.

311
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,700
You're unqualified. We don't fit together.

312
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,510
Then were you just playing with me this whole time?

313
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,790
Was I nothing to you?

314
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,770
- But I— 
 - I'll admit it now.

315
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,260
Honestly, there was not a single thing I liked about you.

316
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,310
Fine. This marriage I was being forced into,

317
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,340
I was just going to close my eyes and do it.

318
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,410
But I can't ruin my life because you of you. Don't you think?

319
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,430
You said if the reason was legitimate, you'd back off on your own.

320
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,570
I think this is enough of a reason.

321
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,370
But ...

322
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,460
But it wasn't like that for me.

323
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,030
My feelings ...

324
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,700
Kang Ju.

325
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,950
Listen to me.

326
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,240
I don't know why you're doing this but it's all a misunderstanding. Trust me.

327
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,050
Misunderstanding?

328
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:33,810
Yes, I wish it was a misunderstanding. I want to be wrong.

329
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,510
I told you it's not true. Why can't you trust me?

330
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:40,990
Then, what do you think about Ru Mi instead of Yi Gyeong? Answer me.

331
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,630
Why are you being like this?

332
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,600
That's not possible, right? Of course not.

333
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,350
Because it's different than what you planned.

334
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:57,360
Just leave Yi Gyeong alone. You can't do this to a girl who has nothing to do with any of this.

335
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,640
Does it not matter what happens to Yi Gyeong as long as you get what you want?

336
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:07,410
If something bad happens to Yi Gyeong, were you planning on replacing her with Ru Mi, the one you favor?

337
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,890
What are you talking about right now?

338
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,470
What is Kang Ju talking about?

339
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,890
I'm asking what all that was about.

340
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,500
Why do you keep meddling?

341
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,680
What are you doing coming up with such foolish plans?

342
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,360
It's because you keep doing things like this that Kang Ju wants to break the engagement.

343
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:44,320
What are you going to do now? Before this misunderstanding gets any bigger, you need to change Kang Ju's mind.

344
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:52,250
Kang Ju won't listen to me.

345
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,950
No matter what I say, he doesn't want to believe it.

346
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,710
Honey, what is going on?

347
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,170
The Young Master wants to break the engagement.

348
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,220
This is the first time I've ever heard the chairman raise his voice.

349
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,390
I know. The Young Master isn't the type to do something like that.

350
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,750
I don't know what he heard.

351
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,160
Speaking of, you need to watch your mouth.

352
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:39,050
You know what happens here cannot leave this house, right?

353
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:42,220
Don't worry about it.

354
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,110
I'll put a lock on my mouth.

355
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:57,080
There's no way Ru Mi would have said anything to Kang Ju, would she?

356
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,140
I totally lost my mind when I saw all those cosmetics.

357
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,600
I said things I should never have said.

358
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,800
In any case, things need to get better soon.

359
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,780
♫ It's a snake. It's a snake. ♫

360
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,090
♫ Fill me up with love ♫

361
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:21,030
♫ My love battery must be low ♫

362
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,340
♫ Let's abandon all our worries ♫

363
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,530
Doo Rim.

364
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,100
Oppa, you're here?

365
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:36,420
Oh my, have you hit rock bottom too?

366
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,920
I've hit rock bottom too.

367
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,630
Doo Rim, let's go. You're really drunk.

368
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:50,060
What now Oppa? I ruined everything.

369
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,550
He said I'm not qualified.

370
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,170
There's not a single thing,

371
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,370
he likes about me.

372
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:03,040
That jerk!

373
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,400
What did I do so wrong?

374
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,830
But you know what's strange?

375
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,950
Why does it make me so angry?

376
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,020
I'm just a Yi Gyeong knock off.

377
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,170
I just acted like Yi Gyeong.

378
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:27,130
So why ...

379
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,890
That jerk! You jerk.

380
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:35,920
Hey. Get her out of here. She's had a lot to drink.

381
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,660
I'm sorry.

382
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,800
Shut up!

383
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,870
I'm sorry.

384
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,060
That jerk.

385
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:54,340
Doo Rim, try to hold yourself up a bit.

386
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,170
Bad engagement breaker!

387
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,330
Oppa, you can go now.

388
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,950
Goodbye.

389
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,960
Please take care of Doo Rim.

390
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,340
Yes, don't worry too much Director.

391
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,890
Let's go inside. Oh, smell like alcohol.

392
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:22,500
♫ It's a snake. It's a snake. ♫

393
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,620
Choi Kang Ju, you jerk!

394
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,620
Be quiet. The entire neighborhood will hear you.

395
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,550
- Hey! 
 - Hey!

396
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,310
I knew this would happen. It seemed strange from the beginning.

397
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:49,320
So this was all because of Doo Rim.

398
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,660
You can't blame Doo Rim now.

399
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,600
I'm not blaming Doo Rim.

400
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,700
But she did cause a lot of trouble.

401
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,720
What do we do now? How can we change Kang Ju's mind?

402
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,450
Yi Gyeong is here now. She can do it.

403
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,920
I'm agreeing to the break up.

404
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:16,620
Mom. Oppa. Let's stop this now. I want to stop.

405
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,100
Like Kang Ju said, this marriage was wrong from the beginning.

406
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:25,000
It's right to stop this now. I'll meet with Kang Ju and take care of it.

407
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,260
- Yi Gyeong. 
 - I told you I don't want to. I don't want to do this anymore.

408
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,370
If you keep doing this, we have no choice but to bring back Doo Rim.

409
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:37,930
Fine. Then bring her back and put on an act again.

410
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:42,450
If Doo Rim is able to somehow change Kang Ju mind, I'll get married.

411
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:47,680
No wait. If she wants to marry him, tell her to go ahead. I'll stay out of it.

412
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,100
What are you saying? Stop talking nonsense.

413
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:55,080
Then, does bringing her back to act like me make sense?

414
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,520
If I'm supposed to marry a man who doesn't even realize his fiancée is a different woman,

415
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,150
it's a hundred, no a thousand times better to live alone.

416
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,640
You see? Getting Yi Gyeong involved won't work.

417
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,800
Our only choice is to ask Doo Rim for help.

418
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,100
I'll try to speak with Yi Gyeong.

419
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,830
There's no point. No matter how much you try, she won't change her mind.

420
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,030
Do you think I want to bring Doo Rim back into this?

421
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:31,600
You know that if this marriage is called off,  it's only a matter of time before our company has to close.

422
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,320
So should we listen to Yi Gyeong and  break the engagement and close our company?

423
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,590
We can't do that.

424
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,930
I know it wasn't an easy decision.

425
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:40,660
And I also understand why you had to make that choice.

426
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,730
You don't believe in that curse, do you?

427
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,460
Never mind your mom,

428
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,500
but why are you being so foolish?

429
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,540
If it's because you're afraid you'll lose Yi Gyeong—

430
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,730
It's not like that, Father.

431
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:13,420
I just ... don't want to go through with an unwanted marriage.

432
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,790
- Kang Ju— 
 - I'm sorry Father.

433
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,810
No matter what you say, I'm not going to change my mind.

434
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,260
I'll head inside first.

435
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,160
 Personnel Record

436
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,360
You called for me, Chairman?

437
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,890
I think I need to meet this man.

438
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,790
For Kang Ju's sake, I need to know the truth.

439
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,780
You're up already?

440
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,610
I couldn't sleep.

441
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,810
Why? Because of Choi Kang Ju?

442
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,560
I knew that man had no consideration for others,

443
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,540
but how can he say such hurtful things?

444
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,250
It was like he was poking me with a needle,

445
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,110
he just kept digging into me.

446
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,240
Don't be too upset.

447
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,100
You weren't the real person anyway. You were the knock off.

448
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,080
Still, how can a person

449
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,370
change so much in just a matter of days?

450
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,700
They say there's no reason for falling in love,

451
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,540
and there's no reason for falling out of love.

452
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,610
Don't you think Choi Kang Ju would be the same?

453
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:14,180
That's true. If he doesn't like me, he doesn't like me.

454
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:22,240
Are you crying?

455
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,390
No, why would I cry?

456
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:28,290
Something just flew in my eye.

457
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,990
It's cold. Let's go inside.

458
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,010
No way. Does she actually like Choi Kang Ju?

459
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,870
What's all this?

460
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:49,010
You were all depressed a moment ago. You made all this in that short amount of time?

461
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,040
Anyway, Na Doo Rim, you have a lot of energy.

462
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,560
That man isn't even blinking an eye.

463
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,370
So what's the point in getting upset about it? It'll just be my loss.

464
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,020
Let's eat.

465
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,530
 Choi Kang Ju's Father

466
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,900
It's Choi Kang Ju's father.

467
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,810
Are you okay?

468
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,030
Hello, Father.

469
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,620
Today? Yes, I'm free.

470
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,700
Yes. Then I'll see you soon.

471
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,260
Yes, goodbye.

472
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,230
What did he say?

473
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,070
He wants to see me today.

474
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:58,880
What do I do? I drank so much last night, my dark circles are no joke.

475
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,370
I don't have time for this. What do I do?

476
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,130
You're not eating?

477
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,690
I don't have time to eat.

478
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,810
I need to wash up.

479
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,200
I'm sorry.

480
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:18,660
I know my Yi Gyeong is lacking in many ways.

481
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,430
However, it wasn't right for CEO Choi to treat her that way.

482
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,250
Since this was an arranged marriage,

483
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:35,190
I think we got to this point because we pushed too hard without thinking.

484
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:40,300
Everyone is bound to have some doubts at least once before getting married.

485
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,310
CEO Choi isn't such a careless person.

486
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,520
I think Yi Gyeong was really hurt by this incident.

487
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,230
This isn't just any marriage.

488
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:58,150
It's a marriage that everyone in Korea knows about.

489
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:04,720
It would be hard for anyone who was once engaged to marry into a good family.

490
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,880
You should know that very well.

491
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,540
Of course. I'm sure.

492
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:14,710
I hope you can help Yi Gyeong understand.

493
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,410
It's times like this that Yi Gyeong needs to stay strong,

494
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,830
and help Kang Ju understand his feelings.

495
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,400
What if CEO Choi still resists?

496
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,370
It's a decision made by the heads of the household.

497
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:33,700
As long as you can ignore it, there's nothing Kang Ju can do.

498
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,780
In the end, he'll do what we want him to do.

499
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,310
 The marriage can't end now.

500
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:52,900
 I can't let all my efforts disappear into thin air.

501
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,830
 You and I are dancing around a line that cannot be crossed.

502
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:03,960
 Fine. Let's see who will win this race in the end.

503
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,950
Why is he not here yet?

504
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,530
Aigoo, Madam. Madam.

505
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,800
Are you just getting home? Please hurry and go inside.

506
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,820
Why? Did something happen?

507
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:27,370
Kang Ju's maternal grandmother is here.

508
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,840
Is Kang Ju's wedding planning going well?

509
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,170
Yes, well ...

510
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:40,920
You said she's the daughter of Ohseong Construction?

511
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,600
Yes.

512
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,510
I was hoping it would be Ru Mi.

513
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,460
Ru Mi has always liked Kang Ju since she was young.

514
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,200
And having a prosecutor in the family would be helpful for Kang Ju too.

515
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,850
Other than that, how long will you be staying?

516
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:03,230
Next week is your aunt's 80th birthday. They called you too, right?

517
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,440
Yes.

518
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,500
I figured I'd come for your aunt's 80th birthday and take care of some other things while I'm here.

519
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,240
And I wanted to be here for Kang Ju wedding. Bring her by some time.

520
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,740
Why? You're not going to introduce me?

521
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:23,880
I'll be her grandmother. I should at least meet my granddaughter-in-law.

522
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,270
Of course, you should.

523
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,280
How are you? Is your husband still the same?

524
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,070
Why are you asking me that?

525
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:39,040
If it weren't for you, he wouldn't have been able to get married again.

526
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:45,690
Since you begged me. You said if it wasn't him, you wouldn't marry anyone else.

527
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:51,340
Mom, I have no regrets. I like how things are right now.

528
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,070
You're okay living with a shell of a person who's in love with someone else?

529
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:59,160
Has he ever looked at you with warmth in his eyes?

530
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:04,190
They say even the slightest touch can break down the Great Wall.

531
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:07,560
How can that man, for all his life ...

532
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,240
He's so heartless.

533
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,960
Please stop. I told you I'm okay.

534
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,540
A warm look. A caring touch. I never expected any of that.

535
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:24,320
I was okay just standing beside him like a shadow.

536
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,300
Isn't that enough?

537
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,760
I should get going.

538
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,390
Why? While you're here, you should at least eat dinner with us.

539
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:36,210
I'm okay just seeing your face.

540
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:57,320
Father. This place looks like a painting.

541
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,000
It's a beautiful place, isn't it?

542
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,620
Yes.

543
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:21,520
This is where ... the person who was my everything,

544
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,100
where that woman sleeps.

545
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,990
We had a joyous wedding.

546
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:41,960
But that moment of happiness was short lived.

547
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:50,970
On our honeymoon, I lost that woman to a senseless accident.

548
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:00,810
After she died, they used her death,

549
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:04,200
to spread strange rumors.

550
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:14,100
The first bride of the first-born son

551
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,960
is sacrificed because of a curse on our family.

552
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,970
What do you mean?

553
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:26,370
In the history of our family, there have been many instances where the oldest son's first bride

554
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,330
died because of an accident or illness.

555
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,710
So people who like to gossip came up with this story.

556
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:40,230
As the story spreads, people start to believe it more and more.

557
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,040
The reason Kang Ju wanted to break the engagement was because of that.

558
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:50,410
What?

559
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:58,250
Yi Gyeong,was afraid he would lose you.

560
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,720
That's why he wanted to break up.

561
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,400
Just like I lost my first love,

562
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:14,890
he's afraid he might lose you too.

563
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,580
Kang Ju is a lonely child.

564
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:30,670
After he was hurt by someone he trusted as a child,

565
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:33,650
he grew up with a wall around his heart.

566
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:40,560
He never trusted anyone. Nor did he let anyone get too close to him.

567
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:51,160
However ... he seems different around you.

568
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,100
I won't force it.

569
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,670
I will respect whatever decision, whatever choice you make.

570
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:15,570
But what I told you today,

571
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:18,370
I'd like it if you kept it to yourself.

572
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,480
You understand, right?

573
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,720
Yes Father.

574
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,870
What's the matter?

575
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:09,480
I need his signature, but can you get it for me?

576
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,680
Why don't you ask him yourself? The CEO is inside.

577
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:17,220
Please do me this favor.

578
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,780
Okay.

579
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:22,590
Here you go.

580
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,690
Thank you.

581
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,720
What is all this?

582
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,060
The CEO hasn't been eating well lately.

583
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,540
I just bought a few snacks.

584
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:41,730
He won't die just because he hasn't eaten in a few days. Whether he starves to death or not, just leave him alone.

585
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,360
You haven't been eating well lately.

586
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:04,110
You seemed to like roasted sweet potatoes, so I brought you some to eat.

587
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,880
Take this.

588
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,000
That store is now yours.

589
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,080
Thank you.

590
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:44,040
I met with Kang Ju's mother today.

591
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,070
Kang Ju's family has no plans to call off this marriage.

592
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:53,070
Kang Ju is doing this on his own.

593
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:57,330
So all you have to do is help change his mind.

594
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,630
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

595
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,190
Yes. I understand.

596
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:32,860
Oppa, go back inside.

597
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,910
Why are you doing all of this?

598
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,010
I told you it's not your responsibility so why?

599
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,510
I already got the contract so how can I just walk away?

600
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:47,560
Is it really because of the contract? No other reason?

601
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:55,740
Of course. What else could it be? I'm leaving now.

602
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:16,060
 That's right. It's because of the contract. There's no other reason.

603
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,850
You've been working for Kang Ju's maternal grandmother for some time now.

604
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:01,560
Yes. It's been more than 30 years.

605
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,800
Tell me everything you know

606
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,320
about the car accident 30 years ago.

607
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:22,830
Wasn't the reason you called me because of that?

608
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,830
After you leave this car,

609
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,760
I never want to see you again.

610
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:58,440
If you ever appear in front of me again,

611
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,930
I'll make your life a living hell.

612
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,150
Do you understand?

613
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,970
Yes. Chairman.

614
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,510
Look here.

615
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,690
If you don't want to lose your life, don't go around running your mouth.

616
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:27,690
Go live a quiet life.

617
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,800
Remember that I'm always watching you.

618
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:49,100
Chairman, are you okay?

619
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,280
Let's go.

620
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,790
Yes sir.

621
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,170
Mother came today.

622
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,490
Mother-in-law?

623
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:19,740
Yes. She came without warning, so she only stayed for a bit and left.

624
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,840
Why did she come back all of a sudden?

625
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,030
Next week is my aunt's 80th birthday.

626
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:32,160
And she also wanted to see Kang Ju's wedding.

627
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:39,100
Please make some time this weekend. We should all go visit her.

628
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,970
I'll prepare some tea. Come on out.

629
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,270
I worked at a department store

630
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,980
greeting customers with a beautiful smile ...

631
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:15,400
♫  Is it wrong if I  miss you?  ♫

632
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,770
♫   Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

633
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:30,010
♫   I'm sorry for loving you. I can't let you go.   ♫

634
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:34,330
 What? Do you want it to be just the two of us?

635
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,640
 No way!

636
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:41,250
 Are you asking me to shovel right now?

637
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,550
♫   I try to see you but I can't see you   ♫

638
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:48,600
 - Who do you think you're talking—
 - What's the point of being rich?

639
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,170
♫  You keep calling out to me  ♫
 What's the point in dressing head to toe in luxury items?

640
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:54,590
♫  from somewhere  ♫
 A person should be luxury.

641
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:59,480
♫  I keep thinking of you   ♫
 Our grandmother must feel refreshed.

642
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,930
♫   so I stop in place  ♫

643
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:06,220
♫   After a long time   ♫

644
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:11,150
♫   I call out to you in tears   ♫

645
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:16,130
♫   Is it  wrong if I want to see you   ♫ 
 Have some. This is pumpkin sweet potato so it's delicious.

646
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:19,820
♫   Is it wrong if I long for you   ♫

647
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:25,580
♫   What if I can't hold back any longer   ♫

648
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:29,500
♫   There are words I didn't get a chance to say  ♫

649
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:33,940
♫   Words I couldn't say because I'm thankful  ♫

650
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:41,560
♫  Words I couldn't say because I'm sorry. The words I love you.   ♫

651
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,040
♫   Even though it hurts   ♫

652
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:51,020
♫   I kept hoping that one day you would come  ♫

653
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:56,470
 How much longer do I have to clean up after you? How long?

654
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:02,960
♫   If I want to see you how can I do it?  ♫ 
  I'm sorry. That's the first time I ever apologized.

655
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,720
♫   Wanting to hug you how can I do it?  ♫

656
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:11,420
♫   What if I can't hold back any longer   ♫

657
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,020
♫   There are words I didn't get a chance to say  ♫

658
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:20,490
♫   Words that remain in my heart  ♫ 
  But it wasn't like that for me.

659
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:24,900
♫   Words that I held back a thousand times  ♫ 
   My feelings ...

660
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:31,690
♫   I am in love with you  ♫

661
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:46,750
On a day like today,

662
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,190
it would be nice if Yi Gyeong was here next to Kang Ju.

663
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:53,740
His maternal grandmother must be upset she won't be meeting her granddaughter-in-law.

664
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,970
Have a safe trip.

665
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,420
Have a safe trip, Young Master.

666
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:10,160
You, are you really that dense?

667
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,500
Everyone is already upset about the possibility of  breaking the engagement,

668
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,300
so why would you bring up Yi Gyeong?

669
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:21,080
I know. It's like my I just can't help myself.

670
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,790
Should I just sew my mouth shut?

671
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:47,580
Don't speak about breaking the engagement in front of your grandmother. She doesn't know anything yet.

672
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,440
Let's head inside.

673
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:00,340
Mother. Father.

674
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,460
Welcome.

675
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:11,060

676
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:18,230
♫  Enter my heart. I will keep on loving you.  ♫

677
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:22,420
♫  Just come to me.  Keep on coming to me.  ♫

678
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,400
 Bride of the Century

679
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:32,310
♫  Suddenly you became the only person  I longed  for you while smiling.  ♫

680
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:40,060
♫  Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever.  ♫

681
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:46,640
♫  The moments right now are unbelievably exciting  ♫

682
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:52,520
♫  I also unknowingly end up looking only for you  ♫

683
01:06:54,330 --> 01:07:01,530
♫  I’ve been falling more and more for you. Even if I tried to push you away, in the end it was you.  ♫
