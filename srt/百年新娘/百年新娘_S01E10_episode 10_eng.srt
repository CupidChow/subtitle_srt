1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,400
 Bride Of The Century

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,900

3
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,140
Don't bring up the broken engagement in front of Grandmother. She does not know yet.

4
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,120
Let's go in.

5
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,900
Mother! Father!

6
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,210
Welcome!

7
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,270
What are you doing here ?

8
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,110
Eh, Mother.

9
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,710
Did I come somewhere I shouldn't be? I came to give my greetings to Grandmother.

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,620
Let's go in.

11
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,270
Are you going to keep standing there?

12
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,800
What the heck are you doing?

13
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,910
Why are you here?

14
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,360
Don't come in if you don't want to.

15
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,220
What happened?

16
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,840
I went to Kang Ju's office and they said he went to his maternal Grandmther's house.

17
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,390
I didn't come when I shouldn't right?

18
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,550
No, you did well. Let's talk about the details later.

19
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,240
But ...

20
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,600
what is all of this?

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,420
This is ...

22
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,240
I wanted to see what she'd do,

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,990
so I said I wanted to eat a dish that requires a lot of effort  to make like handmade noodle soup,

24
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,190
but I didn't know that she would actually make it.

25
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,260
Why?

26
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,400
Are you worried because I'm putting your wife-to-be to work?

27
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,990
No.

28
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,740
How's the office work? Isn't it hard?

29
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,560
He's doing better than I thought he would.

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,070
More than that, how is your health, Grandmother?

31
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,240
You look thinner than the last time I saw you.

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,550
When you get older, things break down here and there.

33
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,420
Our Kang Ju is already about to tie the knot.

34
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,830
Now I can breathe a sigh of relief.

35
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,390
Mother! Please go and chat outside.

36
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,160
I will take care of everything in here.

37
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,630
How will you do all of this alone? Let's do it together.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,500
Mother, can I call a helper instead?

39
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,850
What are you doing right now in someone else's house?

40
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,480
Why is this someone else's house?

41
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,200
If Grandmother heard you she'd be so hurt.

42
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,390
Why? You should just lay down and live here then!

43
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,190
Ah! That sounds like a good idea.

44
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,230
Should I just stick around here like a piece of rice?

45
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,390
Just because you're doing this doesn't mean I''ll change my mind.

46
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,500
Don't waste your energy!

47
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,010
Do it right!

48
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,370
As a man, don't you have strength?

49
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,120
You really!

50
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,270
Oppa, you're home?

51
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,000
Oppa!

52
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,690
Why are you like this?

53
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,170
Are you not going to talk to me or look me in the eyes?

54
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,630
Why do you think I'm doing that?

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,330
Is it because you don't like me standing back and just watching?

56
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,360
Do you think I like the fact that you do whatever Mom tells you?

57
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,380
I know you're upset with me, but...

58
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,300
I'm not upset with you!

59
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,570
I don't even have any right to be upset.

60
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,160
It's because I am upset at myself!

61
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,740
Forcing you who doesn't even want to,

62
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,550
and using Doo Rim to act as your fake are not things I want to do.

63
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,760
But, because there's nothing I can do,

64
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,170
because my ability is only up to here.

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,530
Oppa!

66
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,980
Lee Ru Mi?

67
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,980
Grandmother, how is it? Does it suit your tastes?

68
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,300
It's good!

69
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,640
Hey, I think she would do well if we open her a restaurant in the future.

70
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,300
The noodles are chewy and the soup is very refreshing!

71
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,810
Thank you, Grandmother. Please eat before it cools down.

72
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,410
Talk to Kang Ju and ask him to give you a spot at the department store.

73
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,180
What do you think about it?

74
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,960
Didn't you hear Father?

75
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,640
Grandmother, don't you smell something burning somewhere?

76
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,200
I don't know...

77
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,110
Did you put something on the stove?

78
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,690
Don't you smell my insides burning?

79
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,420
Our Kang Ju must be bothering you a lot.

80
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,680
Grandmother, actually... 
Ah!

81
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,410
What's wrong with you?

82
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,020
What did I do?

83
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,730
Grandmother, it's because you don't know but...

84
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,490
If you let her out, she'll cause a lot of trouble.

85
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,400
What problems will you cause... Ow

86
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,450
Grandmother and Father are here, what's with the noise instead of eating?

87
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,950
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,250
Grandmother, try the dumplings as well.

89
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:54,020
I heard that you didn't like meat, so I made yours especially with mushroom and vegetables.

90
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,900
Oh really?

91
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,440
It tastes light and delicious.

92
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,420
Mother and Father, please try them as well.

93
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,510
You eat as well.

94
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,430
Yes.

95
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,080
You worked hard cooking all day.

96
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,120
No, Mother.

97
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,380
I'm the one that rolled out all the dough.

98
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,800
Of course!

99
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,500
Out of everything Kang Ju made this little bit.

100
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,040
Eat a lot!

101
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,600
What are you doing here without contacting me first?

102
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,330
You look like you're not welcoming me at all?

103
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,740
I don't think you came for small talk...

104
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,690
...what is the point of your visit here?

105
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,720
About the broken engagement...

106
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,870
What will you do about it?

107
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,220
Why?

108
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,900
If my engagement gets broken off, do you think you'll have to take my place?

109
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,890
That will not happen.

110
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,370
Why I gave you the wedding gift,

111
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,530
Kang Ju Oppa was aware of it all.

112
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
The reason he wants to break off the engagement,

113
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,780
What do you mean by that?

114
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,770
You didn't know?

115
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,490
What is it?

116
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,720
Oppa did not tell you anything about it?

117
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,490
Please tell me in more detail.

118
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,310
You also know, right?

119
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,350
A few years ago,

120
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,630
some rumors were floating around about Kang Ju Oppa's family.

121
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,550
By rumor you mean...

122
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,240
The curse on the family,

123
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,010
where the first bride of the first born son is sacrificed.

124
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,950
What do you think about it?

125
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,130
What do you mean?

126
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,220
It's absolutely nonsense.

127
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,960
That nonsense thing,

128
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,640
Oppa Kang Ju believes it and that's the problem.

129
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,510
Then...

130
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,620
Yeah, you're right.

131
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,820
Yi Gyeong, because  he is afraid you may get hurt,

132
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,650
that's why he's trying to break off the engagement.

133
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,470
If he's willing to go as far as breaking off the engagement,

134
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,690
that means it's because Oppa really likes you.

135
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,100
So I am curious as to what you think. What will you do?

136
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,380
If it's not side views, it's just back views.

137
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,710
What are you doing here?

138
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,890
Mother.

139
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,750
You...why are you touching other people's belongings?

140
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,960
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,890
The man is the drawings is Father, right?

142
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,850
You must have had a hard time as well, Mother.

143
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,910
Even to be face to face with Father.

144
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,880
Kang Ju will also at some point look at me in the face right?

145
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,970
Because of Kang Ju, I know your heart is hurt.

146
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,100
The reason why Kang Ju said those words to you is...

147
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,630
I know, Mother. Why Kang Ju is being like that.

148
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,890
You know?

149
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:34,100
Yes, I heard everything from Father.

150
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,980
Then...you came here even though you knew?

151
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,150
Kang Ju has to go separately, so I'll give you my car and you ride back with your husband.

152
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,500
Escort them well.

153
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,110
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,870
I don't see Driver Hong.

155
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,410
Driver Hong quit.

156
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,440
Why suddenly?

157
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,510
There was a problem in his family and he said he'd go back to his hometown.

158
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,480
Oh really? I should greet him separately later.

159
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,700
Why?

160
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,490
We got along just  like family,  so I should greet him for the last time.

161
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,150
With you getting ready for the wedding, you have more than one or two things to take care of?

162
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,310
I have compensated him well so only worry about what you have to do.

163
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,170
I am going to get going.

164
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,210
Okay.

165
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,350
- Mother, Father, please go back carefully. 
 - Okay.

166
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,540
Grandmother, I will come back to visit you again.

167
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,500
Okay, you worked hard.

168
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,470
Not even. I enjoyed myself today, Grandmother.

169
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,790
Grandmother, please go back in. We will take our leave.

170
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,150
Okay, go ahead.

171
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,590
Did you not find Driver Hong yet?

172
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,310
Okay, I understand. Contact me once you find him.

173
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,040
This bastard was just threatening me. Now where is he off hiding like a rat?

174
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,810
Get out.

175
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,070
Don't confuse yourself. I am not planning to do anything with you.

176
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,920
Today, I stayed quiet because we were in front of Grandmother.

177
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,240
No matter what you do, I won't change my mind!

178
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,460
I know.

179
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,680
What do you know?

180
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,430
I know why you are being like this.

181
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:48,270
Whatever you're worried about will never happen.

182
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,490
I...nothing bad will happen to me.

183
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,290
Stop it.

184
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,560
Kang Ju.

185
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,310
Even if I were to live and get old alone and die single, I'd never get married to you.

186
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,520
Even if the Earth were to split in half, I won't get married to you.

187
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,510
According to who? Maybe if it was for another reason...

188
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,020
But I will never back down!

189
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,500
Really? Of course will your craziness just disappear?

190
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,760
Do whatever you want then!

191
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,620
Oppa.

192
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,200
About Choi Kang Ju ...

193
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,510
What Ru Mi said earlier, you heard it too right, Oppa?

194
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,330
This ...

195
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,020
I'm going to step out for a minute.

196
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,830
Oppa.

197
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,170
Why didn't you say anything on the way here?

198
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,490
Did Mother say anything to offend you?

199
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,560
It's because I am tired, so do not worry about it.

200
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,130
30 years ago ...

201
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:07,810
When you went for your honeymoon to the villa by the ocean ...

202
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:13,900
I drove Madam Seo there.

203
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,520
Madam Seo had asked me to leave her for a little bit,

204
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,590
so I parked the car besides the villa,

205
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,030
and I left her alone for a little while.

206
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,960
Even after some time went by, I didn't hear from her,

207
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:41,480
so I went back to where she was and some woman

208
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,700
was hit by a car and had passed out.

209
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,120
Madam Seo was scared,

210
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,330
...and didn't do what to do.

211
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,360
Did you happen to see what happened yourself?

212
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,750
I didn't see it for myself,

213
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,460
but I could tell at once what had happened,

214
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,210
just from watching.

215
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,530
I only found out later,

216
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,630
that the woman who was hit,

217
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:27,250
was the woman who had gotten married to you.

218
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,990
Whenever you hear that song playing,

219
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,570
you never let anyone go to see Father.

220
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,960
It's because it's the time your Father wants to be alone.

221
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,020
But you were always alone, Mother.

222
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,810
Did you talk things over with Yi Kyeong?

223
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,990
Don't give Yi Gyeong too much of a hard time.Yi Gyeong...

224
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,900
Do you want me to end up like you and Father?

225
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,360
Kang Ju!

226
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,630
Do not try to lock me inside the world you've created for yourself.

227
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,360
Nothing will work out like you want!

228
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,560
 Did you get a girl?

229
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,050
 This tie...right?

230
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,530
 Who gifted you this tie?

231
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,890
 Who did you get it from?

232
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,540
 Later.

233
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,880
What are you doing in here?

234
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,080
Mom. Do you know who gave him this?

235
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,540
Doo Rim gave it to Yi Hyeon as a birthday present, right?

236
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,400
What? Doo Rim did?

237
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,240
Oppa, when did you get here?

238
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,940
It's cold outside. Is Jin Joo inside?

239
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,270
Did you meet Choi Kang Ju?

240
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,410
Yes. His grandmother came back to Korea,

241
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,050
so I visited her house.

242
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,620
You should stop.

243
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,520
What?

244
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,390
It's hard for me to see you when you're with Choi Kang Ju.

245
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,870
What do you mean?

246
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:41,000
I wanted to make you stop acting as Yi Gyeong, but I couldn't.

247
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,770
But I can't take it anymore. I can't handle it.

248
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,690
Oppa.

249
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,350
At first, I thought it was pity.

250
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,890
Your hands are so different from Yi Gyeong's.

251
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,990
But, one day, my fears disappeared as I held your hand.

252
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,400
I wanted to walk with you forever.

253
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,140
Will you accept me?

254
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,960
I'm sorry.

255
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,230
Is it because of Choi Kang Ju?

256
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,550
- Of all people, why h— 
 - I know!

257
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,810
I'm a fake, so I know I can't be with him.

258
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,830
It started because of money,

259
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,120
but I don't know how I feel anymore.

260
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,610
With the way I feel right now, I can't hold your hand.

261
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,790
Oppa, I need to talk to you.

262
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:21,910
Mom said your necktie was a gift from Doo Rim.

263
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,250
The woman you like is Doo Rim?

264
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,330
How could you like someone like her?

265
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,180
You just met with her, didn't you?

266
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,880
Were you going to give that ring to her?

267
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,630
Did you propose to her?

268
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,490
What the heck are you going to do?

269
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,070
Stop it. I was already rejected by her.

270
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,740
She rejected you?

271
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,860
Why would she reject you?

272
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,970
Is it ... because of Choi Kang Ju?

273
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,630
Things took a very interesting turn.

274
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,120
If we use her feelings right, we can make her choose

275
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,590
without us interfering.

276
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,790
Use her feelings?

277
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,420
 Are you telling me to shovel right now?

278
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,230
 Step aside.

279
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,220
 Damn fur.

280
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,610
 You don't have a mom either.

281
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,130
 Don't worry, I'll be your mom.

282
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,950
Break off the marriage? This is so out of the blue.

283
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:04,190
You heard correctly. We decided to break it off.

284
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,300
Why?

285
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,800
Do you know the real reason why Kang Ju would want to break it off?

286
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,960
It's because of a curse on that family.

287
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,790
Not that you would know would know about it.

288
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,920
Those are just stories people made up. They're not true.

289
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,510
You knew about it?

290
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,080
Yes.

291
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,190
Then, why haven't you said anything?

292
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,690
His father specifically asked me not to.

293
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:46,480
Also, that's such a ridiculous rumor. Who would believe it?

294
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,590
That's why I didn't talk to you about it.

295
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,090
We looked into it secretly,

296
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,740
and before they agreed to our engagement, they had asked other families.

297
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,640
However, they all rejected.

298
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,840
Why do you think they would do that?

299
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,260
They don't want their precious daughter to be in a risky household.

300
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,370
We didn't even know.

301
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,810
Still, breaking the marriage for that reason...

302
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:21,490
Anyway, we can't marry our daughter off to a household like that.

303
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,790
So you should stop, too. You don't have to make Kang Ju change his mind.

304
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,520
We'll meet with his mother today and settle everything.

305
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,430
You are never to meet Choi Kang Ju again. Understood?

306
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,900
Why aren't you answering me?

307
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,600
Yes, I understand.

308
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,670
Oppa.

309
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,330
Did you meet Mother?

310
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,700
Yes, I did.

311
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,250
Did you hear?

312
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,150
Oppa, you believe that as well?

313
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,610
No.

314
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,570
Then, why aren't you stopping her? Don't you need to stop her?

315
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,350
Why do you think I didn't stop her?

316
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,370
Go.

317
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,030
It's because I do not want to see you standing by Kang Ju's side.

318
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:24,000
Before I meet your mother, there's something I want to confirm first.

319
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:29,700
What is the real reason you want to break up with Yi Gyeong?

320
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,360
Tell me the truth. For Yi Gyeong's sake.

321
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,720
It seems you already know.

322
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,440
I want to hear it from you.

323
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,780
The reason you're thinking,

324
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,240
it is correct.

325
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,420
Thank you for telling me the truth.

326
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,890
I guess this is as far as we're meant to go.

327
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,730
I have one last favor to ask.

328
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,690
If you care about Yi Gyeong,

329
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:29,540
then no matter what she says, don't ever see her again.

330
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,890
If you break off this marriage, there is nothing for you to gain.

331
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,440
No matter how desparate I may be,

332
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,550
there's no parent in this world that would risk their daughter's life for a marriage.

333
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,790
So are you saying you want to break off this engagement?

334
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,490
For no other reason than this ridiculous rumor?

335
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:17,520
Whether it makes sense or not, you would know best.

336
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,600
I want to be very clear, we will not be moving forward with this wedding.

337
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,080
No, we cannot.

338
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,190
Does Yi Gyeong feel the same way?

339
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:34,340
Considering how she came to Kang Ju's grandmother's home on her own two feet ...

340
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,760
I can just help change her mind.

341
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,220
I'll tell you one more time, over my dead body,

342
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,930
will this wedding happen.

343
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,790
We'll see. I don't think things will go the way you want.

344
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,170
Who does she think she is to break off this engagement?

345
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,590
How could you say that to Yi Gyeong's mother?

346
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,180
Why do you keep making things worst?

347
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:23,070
If they say they don't want to, then let it be.

348
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,860
Why are you also being like this?

349
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,710
You can't force two people to get married.

350
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:34,530
Getting caught up in this nonsense and not being able to judge the truth, you and she are the same.

351
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,240
If that's the family's decision,

352
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,260
there's nothing we can do to convince them.

353
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,100
But ...

354
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,520
Kang Ju, listen carefully.

355
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,460
Because you're so caught up in this nonsense,

356
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,100
are you going to lose something you shouldn't? Think about it carefully.

357
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,100
Don't be swayed by what us parents want,

358
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,160
but know that the fate of you and Yi Gyeong rests in your decision.

359
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:37,220
 If you really care about Yi Gyeong, no matter what she says,

360
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,300
 don't ever see her again.

361
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,110
 The key to this problem is in your hands.

362
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:46,750
 Depending on what you choose,

363
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,340
 the result will also change.

364
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,890
 Property Lease Agreement

365
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:05,390
 Forget about everything. Move to Seoul with your grandmother and work hard to make your restaurant successful.

366
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,530
You're just getting home?

367
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,820
How did job hunting go?

368
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,360
I was rejected because I can't speak English. I was rejected because I'm not attractive enough.

369
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,040
I was even rejected because I don't come from a wealthy family.

370
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,900
There were too many reasons to be rejected.

371
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:45,330
Jin Ju ... do you want to work in a restaurant with me?

372
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,260
We're just starting out so I can't pay you much, but I can pay you the same wage as others.

373
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:57,500
And if the restaurant does well, I can raise your salary and give you plenty of bonuses.

374
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,970
It will really help me out if you worked with me.

375
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,800
Right? It won't work right?

376
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,730
Sorry, I was just asking.

377
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:21,720
If you promise me paid holidays and vacations, then I unconditionally say yes.

378
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,830
Yes?

379
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,650
Boss Na Doo Rim, I look forward to working with you.

380
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,350
Jin Ju, let's make lots of money.

381
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:38,810
- When we make a lot of money ... you said you want to try a French restaurant, right? 
 - Yeah.

382
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:42,010
- We'll go there and have a full course meal. 
 - And buy luxury bags!

383
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,720
- And go on vacations! 
 - And get boyfriends!

384
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,990
- Let's go! Fighting! 
 - Let's go! Fighting!

385
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,120
Hello. It's Taste of Doo Rim.

386
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,230
Please stop by to eat.

387
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:00,900
Hello. Please stop by.

388
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,430
Hello. It's Taste of Doo Rim.

389
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,500
Roasted sweet potato, coffee, dessert is free.

390
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,630
Free is good. I should try this today.

391
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,420
- Please enjoy. 
 - Thank you. It's delicious.

392
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,960
- Come again. 
 - Thank you.

393
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,860
Welcome. Oh you're here.

394
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,970
Aigoo, welcome.

395
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,220
Wow, there are a lot of customers.

396
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,020
- Of course. 
 - When is the grilled mackerel coming out?

397
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,460
One more seafood soybean stew!

398
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,620
Yes, one moment please.

399
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,090
Grandma, one more cubed radish kimchi please.

400
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,450
Have a seat here.

401
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,290
One more bowl of rice please.

402
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,130
Ah, yes, yes.

403
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:33,110
- It's delicious. 
 - Yes, please come often.

404
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,800
One more bowl of rice.

405
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,570
Sir, are you not leaving yet?

406
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,490
The time is ...

407
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,250
Leave first.

408
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:37,020
To Taste of Doo Rim!

409
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,100
Everyone worked so hard today.

410
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,730
We were running around so much we didn't even get a chance to eat. Eat up.

411
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,530
Grandma, don't worry. We're strong.

412
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,050
Is that so?

413
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:59,560
Thank so much for helping Doo Rim set up this restaurant.

414
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,460
It was nothing. I told you, Doo Rim saved my life.

415
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,190
I almost had a bad accident at the construction site and Doo Rim saved me.

416
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,800
For someone who saved my life, this is nothing.

417
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,210
Is that really the only reason? You don't have any other reason?

418
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:21,940
What I'm trying to say is, do you have other feelings for Doo Rim?

419
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,130
Grandma, your glass is empty.

420
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,730
Grandma, should we do a love shot together?

421
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:32,170
Hey, no. Not with me. Do it with the Director instead.

422
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:40,630
Love shot! Love shot! Love shot! Love ...

423
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,860
Grandma, you take one with me, love shot.

424
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,720
What are you saying, at me age?

425
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,520
Do one with me, a love shot.

426
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,710
Doo Rim, on a day like today, we need to sing.

427
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,960
- Choose a song. 
 - Yes, sing a song.

428
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,730
Alright.

429
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,700
♫ Fill me up with love ♫

430
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,850
♫ My love battery must have run out ♫

431
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:18,420
♫ Forget all your worries, everyone Cha, Cha, Cha ♫

432
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,810
♫ Be well I'm leaving ♫

433
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:26,890
♫ Without saying goodbye ♫

434
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:30,400
♫ Leaving ... ♫

435
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,010
I'm leaving.

436
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,320
Oppa, give this to Madam.

437
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,300
I packed some of our grand opening rice cake and some food.

438
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:52,020
Oppa ... thank you ... so much.

439
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,220
And ... I'm sorry.

440
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,140
Don't be sorry.

441
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:05,120
If you're sorry, then I really feel like I have no chance.

442
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:13,180
I'll wait ... out there somewhere for you to come.

443
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:21,860
I hope you are successful President Na Doo Rim. Bye.

444
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,620
Six ...

445
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:41,260
Doo Rim, look at all this. This is all the money we made today.

446
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,790
We're going to be rich soon.

447
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,290
Grandma, aren't you tired?

448
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,370
Grandma, go inside and rest. We'll clean up out here.

449
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:56,020
Okay. I was running around all day today, I'm tired.

450
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,860
I'm going to go inside and rest.

451
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,210
Goodnight, Grandma.

452
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,950
564, 800 won  (~$474 US Dollars)

453
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,630
We're clos...

454
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,280
Secretary Kim.

455
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,990
I found the right place.

456
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,290
What brings you here ...

457
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,370
I saw your post.

458
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,320
I hope you are successful.

459
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,790
Thank you.

460
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:34,310
I'm not sure if I was intruding by just showing up.

461
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,480
No. I'm glad you came.

462
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,760
This is someone I worked with at the department store.

463
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,400
This is the owner.

464
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,140
Hello.

465
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:51,360
Hello. I have a cold so ...

466
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,320
Cold.

467
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,990
Thank you for coming.

468
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:59,130
I'm sorry for coming so late. I was going to come earlier,

469
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:02,410
but our company's CEO hasn't left yet.

470
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,620
Is the  CEO doing well?

471
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:11,620
Don't get me started. He hasn't been eating well lately,

472
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,270
and he stares off into space all day.

473
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,190
Why?

474
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,520
I think he broke up with his fiancée.

475
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,060
I heard there will be a formal announcement soon.

476
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,490
You two continue to chat.

477
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:31,950
I'll prepare some snacks.

478
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,140
 Just wait. I'll make sure you see Doo Rim again.

479
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,890
Please give this to the CEO.

480
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,560
It's not much. You said he hasn't been eating well,

481
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,030
so I included our grand opening rice cakes and some food.

482
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,960
I'll get it to him.

483
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,140
Okay. Then ... get home safely.

484
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:00,570
Jin Ju. I can come again right?

485
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,340
Huh?

486
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,110
I can't?

487
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,590
No, well ...

488
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,040
I'll come again.

489
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,230
Doo Rim, Doo Rim.

490
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,540
What's wrong? Are you sick?

491
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,060
No, I'm just tired.

492
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,890
Did Secretary Kim leave?

493
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,260
But what was with the food? You asked me to give it to him so I did but ...

494
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,600
Just because it was our grand opening.

495
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,160
I wanted him to try some.

496
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:05,570
What I'm saying is whether he tries some or not, he doesn't have anything to do with you anymore.

497
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,200
Wait, do you ...

498
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,980
Speaking of, what's going on with you and Secretary Kim?

499
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,170
Have you gotten that close during that amount of time?

500
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,000
Don't change the subject.

501
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,120
I can see clearly that you're suffering silently.

502
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:25,970
Don't just keep it to yourself,

503
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:30,390
tell me. There's nothing we can't tell each other.

504
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:34,390
If you just keep it to yourself, you'll make yourself sick.

505
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:41,200
Don't go overboard Miss Oh Jin Ju. It's not like that.

506
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,740
What will happen to Young Master?

507
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,930
Who's there? Oh you scared me.

508
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:29,970
You're doing things you never do. You scared me to death.

509
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:45,880
The Young Master looks like a ghost with clothes on.

510
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:52,000
That's what I'm saying. I feel so bad for him.

511
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,780
After you are done with your 10 o'clock meeting, you need to go straight to your business show taping.

512
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,990
And this.

513
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,660
- What is this? 
 - A lunchbox.

514
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,530
You remember Oh Jin Ju, right?

515
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:15,970
She opened a restaurant and wanted me to give this to you.

516
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,330
I'll have some later.

517
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:35,860
What? Aren't you being too much? Why are you just telling me this now?

518
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,860
Is anything going to change if I told you?

519
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:44,290
No. I just thought Hyung and Yi Gyeong were having a lovers' quarrel and that's why they were breaking up.

520
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:47,410
I had no idea that was the reason.

521
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,410
In any case, I figured you would find out anyway so that's why I told you.

522
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,870
Don't say anything useless in front of your brother. Just pretend you don't know.

523
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,930
Don't worry.

524
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,730
And Mom, I broke up with LeAnn.

525
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,450
There will be an official announcement in a few days.

526
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:06,680
Why are you being like this too? Can't you see that it's already chaotic enough in this house?

527
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,450
Mom, Mom. Stay out of it. And don't say anything.

528
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,050
Does it look like I won't say anything?

529
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:18,140
Mom. Why do girls always talk about marriage when they're dating?

530
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,460
Dating is one thing. Marriage is another. Can't we think about it as two different things?

531
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:28,560
You ... don't do anything rash and just stay put.

532
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:33,230
Do you think marriage is a game? Even if you don't do anything, we'll take care of it for you.

533
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,000
Mom, Mom.

534
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,450
I will never be part of an arranged marriage.

535
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,820
I'm going to marry someone I bring home.

536
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,320
And you have someone to bring home?

537
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,460
That is ... there is someone I want to bring home.

538
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,340
But will you give me permission?

539
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,640
Stop talking nonsense.

540
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,570
If she's anything those other girls, I don't even have to meet her to know what she's like.

541
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,480
Hyung.

542
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,410
Are you just getting home?

543
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,470
Should I go speak with him?

544
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,340
Hyung.

545
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,110
Kang Ju.

546
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,030
Hyung.

547
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,520
You're making me upset.

548
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,230
I took time out of my busy schedule to console you.

549
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,570
Do you love Yi Gyeong?

550
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,830
The way I see it, you're not.

551
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,010
What are you hear to say?

552
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:55,380
I heard everything from Mom. It's not like you are filming a horror movie.

553
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,540
I don't understand why you believe in some curse about our family.

554
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,980
So the best solution you could think of with that smart brain of yours was to break up?

555
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,450
I'm letting you go because I love you. All that is bull.

556
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:15,160
When you love someone to death, until you go crazy, then see if you want to let her go.

557
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,480
Love is selfish.

558
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,150
You want to keep it, you want to touch it,

559
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,120
and you don't want to lose it.

560
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,260
You don't like her that much so isn't that why you're letting her go?

561
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:35,320
I'm asking because I'm sincerely worried about you.

562
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,400
What is this?

563
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,050
Kang Ju is carrying around a lunchbox?

564
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,400
Let's see what there is.

565
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,690
What's this? Dumplings ...

566
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:07,160
The dumplings are made of vegetables and mushrooms. It's delicious.

567
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,960
But why is it sour?

568
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,300
What is this?

569
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:18,910
Awesome. It's sweet potato.

570
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:22,200
It's so good. Do you want some?

571
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,030
But it tastes weird when I eat it together.

572
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:37,660
You're burning up. This won't do. Get up, let's go to the hospital.

573
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,670
No. I'll be fine once I take some medicine.

574
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:45,660
Aigoo, you're body is not made of steel. Will medicine be enough?

575
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:50,720
It's because I overworked myself for a few days. I'll be fine.

576
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,550
Will you really be okay?

577
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,300
Madam, you're here?

578
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,960
You did a good job decorating the place.

579
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:26,590
- You're grandmother? 
 - She went to the market.

580
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:30,880
How is business going? Is it doing well?

581
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,860
Thanks to you.

582
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,840
Let's chat.

583
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,780
I want to talk about Yi Hyeon.

584
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:57,460
You know how he feels about you, right? I wanted to say ...

585
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:02,640
Don't worry. I know what you want to tell me.

586
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,170
You don't have to worry.

587
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:11,850
May I ask why you turned Yi Hyeon down?

588
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,330
That's ...

589
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:17,900
Is it because ... of Kang Ju?

590
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,510
I must be right.

591
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:28,170
I saw Kang Ju lingering around our house and just leaving.

592
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:33,890
He stared at Yi Gyeong's room for a long time and left.

593
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:39,770
I didn't know you two were so serious about each other.

594
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,350
Madam, I ...

595
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:45,030
I'm not here to blame you.

596
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,650
I'm sorry.

597
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,860
What is there for you to be sorry for?

598
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:59,970
It's just heartbreaking to watch something that can never be.

599
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:05,470
Don't worry too much about it.

600
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:09,790
I'm okay. I've already forgotten everything.

601
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,720
You haven't eaten yet, have you? Have some food before you leave.

602
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,570
Okay. I haven't had food you've cooked in awhile.

603
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:26,330
Wait here a moment.

604
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,310
What's wrong with her?

605
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:13,230
Doo Rim, Doo Rim. Doo Rim, wake up.

606
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:16,680
Doo Rim. Doo Rim.

607
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:21,020
 She's been overworking her body so it went into shock.

608
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,570
 She'll need to rest for a few days.

609
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,300
 Jang Yi Gyeong's Mother

610
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,000
Yes Mother.

611
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:52,250
What?

612
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:12,990

613
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,140
 Bride of the Century
