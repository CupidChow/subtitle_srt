1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,930

3
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,670
♫  The battery of love is done  ♫

4
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,950
♫  I can not live without you  ♫

5
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,990
♫  You are my battery  ♫

6
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,350
Jang Yi Gyeong.

7
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,610
What are you doing here?

8
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,800
Why are you at a place like this?

9
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,700
- Let's go. 
 - Let go of me!

10
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,040
- I am not Jang Yi Gyeong. 
 - No.

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,030
- That is not possible. 
 - Look with your own two eyes.

12
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,810
I am not Jang Yi Gyeong.

13
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,650
Then who are you?

14
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,520
Who are you, if you aren't Jang Yi Gyeong?

15
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,890
Didn't you come here knowing everything? What more do you need to confirm?

16
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:13,300
Are you really the Jang Yi Gyeong I knew?

17
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,510
Man, I wanted to live quietly.

18
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,690
You're annoying me.

19
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,330
Is that what you should say right now? Do you not understand what you've done?

20
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,850
Then did you think I'd beg for forgiveness on my knees? What did I do that was so wrong?

21
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,520
The one who was fooled is the fool, I've done nothing wrong.

22
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,410
Just...

23
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,040
why did you do this? Why?

24
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,590
Someone might say you aren't from a rich family. Can't you tell?

25
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,070
I got a nice shop, I got rich.

26
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,610
I played along as a fake, and I received a shop and money.

27
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,330
Do you

28
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,730
even have a heart?

29
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:27,970
Well, I guess a fake couldn't have something like that.

30
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,150
Life must be so nice for you.

31
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,560
You even use feelings to scam people and earn money.

32
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,120
You were the first person I ever gave my heart to.

33
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,040
- Choi Kang Ju. 
 - Shut up.

34
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,010
Don't call my name so casually.

35
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,340
I hate myself for falling for your tricks.

36
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,350
Doo Rim, are you okay?

37
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,350
I wanted him to never learn the truth.

38
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,000
He must be in a lot of pain.

39
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,190
But there's nothing I can do for him.

40
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,150
Did you think I'd never know for the rest of my life? How long were you planning on hiding this from me?

41
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,370
You can't do this to me, Mother. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why?

42
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,150
Because I knew you would act like this. I knew you would be hurt, so how could I tell you?

43
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,840
This was not for me! Can't you tell?

44
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,760
I don't want to see you in pain.

45
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,050
Just forget all the memories you had with her up to now.

46
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,380
That girl completely toyed with you. You have no right to get mad or feel betrayed!

47
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,060
- Mother! 
 - Snap out of it! You are the successor to Taeyang Group.

48
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,270
If something goes wrong, our entire household will be ruined.

49
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,060
What kind of deal could you have possibly made with Jang Yi Gyeong's mother?

50
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,630
What did you give in exchange for taking in Jang Yi Gyeong?

51
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,020
She's as sly as a snake. She's as scary and cruel as poison.

52
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,910
She isn't someone you should go up against lightly.

53
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,150
You should remember that you hold the responsibility of Taeyang Group.

54
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:34,730
Just know that all of this was done for you, for Taeyang Group.

55
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,040
You can't ever tell your father about this.

56
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:46,430
You and I have to keep this secret for the rest of our lives.

57
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,730
Please, Kang Ju.

58
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,410
Don't you think something happened? Why else would the young master explode like that?

59
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,230
Do you listen with your eyes? Shut your mouth. Understand?

60
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,210
Okay.

61
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,510
There's definitely something, though. I think someone used the young master?

62
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,300
Do you think it's about a woman other than Yi Gyeong?

63
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,360
- I really can't deal with you. 
 - Wait, another woman?

64
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,460
Na Doo Rim, 25. She grew up in Namhae, and was middle and high school buddies with Oh Jin Ju.

65
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,160
Both her parents are deceased, so she runs a restaurant with her grandmother.

66
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,260
As for the restaurant building, it was originally owned by Oh Seong Construction's CEO,

67
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,130
but was recently transferred to Na Doo Rim—

68
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,200
That's fine, you can stop.

69
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,770
Why did he suddenly ask about the owner of Jin Ju's shop?

70
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,250
So this is your true self?

71
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:36,210
The high Choi Kang Ju was fooled by this low-class girl?

72
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,440
You can't go any lower, can you? Now I understand your crappy preferences.

73
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,420
Okay. Insult me all you want, if it makes you feel better.

74
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,910
You are pathetic for pulling a stunt like that for money,

75
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,650
but I feel more pathetic for falling for it.  Do you know that?

76
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,160
- I'm not finished. 
 - Can't you see I'm working?

77
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:12,540
You should close it down for today. I'll reserve the entire space.

78
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,680
What's wrong? Your someone who can even play with feelings for money.

79
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,930
You probably didn't even believe the curse on our household was true in the first place.

80
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,330
That's why you put your life on the line to be fake.

81
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,290
If you had believed it, you wouldn't have agreed to it.

82
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:46,890
No matter how much you love money, you wouldn't do anything that might get you killed.

83
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:58,830
Did you think I'd let you go quietly? No way. For whose benefit? I will stop by constantly.

84
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,780
Until you understand exactly what you did to me.

85
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,860
- Kang Ju... 
 - I told you not to call my name.

86
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,040
Don't say my name. It's sickening.

87
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,010
Kang Ju, you're here.

88
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:00,990
Kang Ju, look. Mother bought it for me. It's pretty, isn't it?

89
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,980
Ru Mi, what are you doing here...

90
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,530
I didn't know you and Yi Gyeong were going to be here.

91
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,590
What's wrong with us all eating together? It's not like you don't know each other.

92
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,570
Have a seat.

93
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,990
Yes.

94
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,780
Mother, you're probably tired from all that shopping.

95
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,410
We should go get a massage after our meal.

96
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:01,350
Shall we? I only have sons so I was always jealous of mother's who have daughters.

97
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,730
Now that I have you, it's nice.

98
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,890
We can go shopping and get massages.

99
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,790
Mother, you went out with Ru Mi quite a bit too.

100
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,230
You treated Ru Mi like she was your own daughter.

101
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,570
Jang Yi Gyeong, you'll have to work hard to keep that position.

102
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:26,300
Our Mother favored Ru Mi since she was young.

103
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,450
Everyone thought I would marry Ru Mi.

104
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,190
Kang Ju.

105
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,640
I'm joking Mother. It's not like I was lying.

106
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,370
Mother, I apologize. I'll be leaving first.

107
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:22,660
Mother. Something is going on with Kang Ju, isn't there?

108
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,740
What is it? I also need to know.

109
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,450
Why are you acting so childish?

110
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,270
I understand your feelings but using me like that...

111
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,490
Then ... how about you stop playing the bridesmaid?

112
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,200
Do you want to marry me?

113
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,930
You're crazy.

114
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:58,240
Wouldn't it more strange if I wasn't going crazy?  How could I not lose my mind right now?

115
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,110
Are you saying if it isn't Na Doo Rim, it doesn't matter what woman you marry?

116
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,150
Yes, it doesn't matter. As long as it's not Jang Yi Gyeong,

117
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,410
it doesn't matter who it is.

118
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,830
Whenever I see Jang Yi Gyeong,

119
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,140
I think of her. That's why it can't work.

120
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,490
What do you want to do? Do you want to marry me?

121
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,130
I'm being completely serious.

122
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,740
Since you're being serious, I'll answer seriously.

123
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,940
No thank you.

124
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,740
I didn't want to lose you to anybody.

125
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,000
You know as well as anyone. How hung up I was on you.

126
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,780
But that ... I think it was just an obsession.

127
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:16,190
Someone once told me ... the need to hold onto something isn't always love.

128
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,400
The way you're acting right now is no different

129
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,950
than a child holding onto his mother's dress and throwing a tantrum.

130
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,200
I know.

131
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,040
I look ... pretty sad and pathetic, don't I?

132
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,210
But ...

133
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,140
it's strange.

134
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,690
Every time I said something hurtful to that girl,

135
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,380
I thought I would feel better.

136
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,320
But I didn't.

137
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,390
It just came back at me like a boomerang.

138
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,410
It hurt me.

139
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:15,840
Do you think that girl for even one second

140
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,820
was sincere towards me?

141
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,370
I can't figure out what was real and what was fake.

142
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,700
She knew you'd be like this so she asked me not to say anything.

143
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,990
She didn't want you to know that she was with you even for the briefest moment.

144
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:55,560
Because if you knew, you would have a hard time.

145
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,540
She was more concerned about you than herself.

146
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,750
♫   Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

147
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,110
♫    Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

148
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,440
♫   Because I'm sorry for loving you,   ♫

149
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,540
♫   I can't let you go.  ♫

150
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,190
- Careful, careful. 
 - Careful.

151
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,430
Why did he drink so much?

152
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,990
Hold on. Clothes first, clothes first.

153
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,560
Take off his jacket first.

154
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,420
Go hang this up. And move this.

155
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,590
Cover him up.

156
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:57,030
♫   You keep calling out to me from somewhere  ♫

157
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,180
♫   You're hiding behind my tears  ♫  
 I'll do it.

158
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,020
He's completely drunk.

159
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,760
- Take care of him. 
 - Yes.

160
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,390
Why did you drink so much? What wrong? What happened?

161
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:18,340
I told you to talk to me if you're going through a rough time. If nothing else, I can at least listen.

162
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,920
I want to erase it,

163
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,330
but I can't.

164
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,520
♫    keep thinking of you so I stop in place  ♫

165
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,800
I can't erase it.

166
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,760
♫   After a long time  ♫

167
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,020
I can't erase it.
  ♫  I call out to you in tears  ♫

168
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,470
♫   Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

169
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,870
♫   Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

170
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,450
♫   What if I can't hold back any longer?  ♫

171
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:02,530
 Kiddo, you can't fall for this Oppa. He just became a married man.

172
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,980
♫   Words I couldn't say because I'm thankful  ♫

173
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,210
♫   Words I couldn't say because I'm sorry.   ♫

174
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:17,040
♫   The words I love you.  ♫

175
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:38,980
I'll speak to you, not as the fake Jang Yi Gyeong you placed a ring on and vowed your love to,

176
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:45,120
but as me, the real Jang Yi Gyeong.

177
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,920
You're fearless.

178
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,760
What is there to fear?

179
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,790
Nothing's going to change just because I got caught putting on an act.

180
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,710
It means there's nothing you can do at this point.

181
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,600
Do you want to hold onto that girl, Na Doo Rim?

182
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,140
Is she hoping you will return to her?

183
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,270
What is it that you want to say?

184
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,300
Doo Rim was the one who sought us out to make a deal first.

185
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,720
She became more and more demanding toward my mom. If my mom refused,

186
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,340
she threatened to reveal everything to you.

187
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,160
In order to stop that, my brother got seriously hurt.

188
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,330
My brother cherished and liked her a lot,

189
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,030
even more than me, his sister.

190
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,790
Doo Rim won't be able to leave my brother's side.

191
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,240
I'm sorry for deceiving you that whole time.

192
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,930
I have nothing to say even if you were to accuse me of playing with your heart.

193
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,990
Forgive me.

194
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,810
But the person who tried to play games with my life first was your mother.

195
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,230
Knowing that, I couldn't just sit still.

196
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:39,110
Now forget about that girl Doo Rim who volunteered to role play as me.

197
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:44,530
Let go of the things we can't control and let's focus on the things that we can control.

198
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,870
You're a great storyteller.

199
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,170
It was touching.

200
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:07,390
But ... now you should stop thinking that I'll believe everything you tell me.

201
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,810
You want to eat some too, don't you?

202
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,790
They're pastries from the bakery across the street.

203
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:26,720
When it's fresh out of the oven and still steaming,

204
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,900
it's so good. We need to go eat it together later.

205
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,620
And this. What do you think? Do you like it?

206
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,460
I think it would really suit you.

207
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,810
When you get discharged, I'll buy them for you.

208
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,450
Ah ... and ... this ...

209
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,290
This is a picture of the sky I took from the restaurant when I was in Namhae.

210
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,620
You're such a virtuous woman, aren't you?

211
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,190
You risked your life for money, but the person who really risked his life ...

212
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,680
is that person, Jang Yi Hyeon. It was so touching I was about to cry.

213
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,520
Don't speak so lightly about Oppa.

214
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,460
You can say whatever you want about me, but I won't let you speak that way about Oppa.

215
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,940
You called him Oppa and never thought anything of him.

216
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,230
Turns out what you said on the outside didn't match what you felt on the inside.

217
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,580
You showed me the true master of cheating.

218
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,760
The puppet was Jang Yi Gyeong, but me.

219
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,870
- You had me in the palm of you hand. 
 - You feel humiliated, resentful, so angry you could go crazy, right?

220
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,480
You want to take revenge, don't you? Then live a happier life than me.

221
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,740
That would be the best revenge, you got it?

222
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,550
Don't tell me what I should do.

223
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,560
It's because you look so pathetic. Who wouldn't know you're from a rich family?

224
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,100
Because of this little thing, you feel like the entire world hurt you

225
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,590
and you're still wallowing in your own self-pity.

226
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:22,170
- Are you done? 
 - No, I'm not done.

227
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,980
If you have time to follow me around, then why don't you focus on your work?

228
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,800
I wonder if your employees know their CEO is going around doing things like this.

229
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,460
You act like this and still take every cent of your pay, don't you?

230
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,290
Don't keep wasting your time and leave.

231
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,220
Of all things, now you're trying to lecture me? You're nothing but a knock-off.

232
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,500
- I don't have time play around with you, Ahjussi. 
 - Ahjussi?

233
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,760
You told me not to say your name anymore. So it's either Oppa or Ahjussi.

234
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,970
And I don't just call anybody Oppa.

235
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,900
Now can you please leave? I'm a bit busy.

236
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,120
Hey! Where are you going?

237
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,220
Hello.

238
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,580
I'm sorry. The entire restaurant is reserved today so we can't take any customers.

239
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,370
Come again next time. I'll give tons of freebies.

240
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,660
- You need to give us a lot then. 
 - Yes.

241
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,810
Please come again. Thank you.

242
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,840
Wow, a group reservation for 30 people.

243
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,260
Doo Rim, we prepared enough food right?

244
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,120
Of course. Everything's ready.

245
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,810
- Why are you here again? 
 - I came as a customer today.

246
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,810
Sorry, but the restaurants reserved today.

247
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:08,630
That reservation ... I made it.

248
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,860
What?

249
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:15,290
You didn't hear me? I made the reservation. For the whole restaurant.

250
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:21,120
Aigoo, customer. Today we have a group reservation so we're not taking any customers.

251
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,760
Grandma, he's the person who made the group reservation.

253
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,530
Ah, is that so?

254
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:36,170
But ... why is he early?

255
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,840
Jin Ju, take Grandma.

256
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,650
Grandma, come with me.

257
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,120
What are you doing?

258
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,450
Where are we going?

259
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,430
What are you doing? Aren't you going to give me a menu?

260
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,930
The service is a mess. You get paid to run your business like this?

261
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:30,740
Oh spicy! Are you expecting me to eat this?

262
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,630
This is nothing. Chili sauce is usually a little spicy.

263
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,300
What should I do?

264
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,870
I'm going to have to cancel my reservation.

265
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:56,600
- What did you say? 
 -The food doesn't taste good.

266
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,500
You said I could cancel up to 2 hours before the reservation, right?

267
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,440
It's exactly 2 hours 3 minutes and 2 seconds.

268
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,620
What am I supposed to do with the food I prepared for 30 people?

269
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,120
We already turned away all of our customers.

270
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,380
- That's not my concern. 
 - You're doing this on purpose to get under my skin, aren't you?

271
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,450
Bingo.

272
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,180
You should have been more careful when taking the reservation.

273
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:27,490
You should have caught on when I asked if I could cancel after tasting the food.

274
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,330
You're the one who was fooled.

275
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,710
I didn't deceive you.  Agreed?

276
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,630
I'm the type of person who can't just let things go.

277
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,770
Then have a good day.

278
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:56,420
What are you going to do? Choi Kang Ju looks determined to make your life miserable.

279
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,050
Leave him alone.  He'll get tired of it after a few days of this.

280
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,820
- That rude little punk! 
 - Grandma!

281
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,380
You rude punk! If you show up here again,

282
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,820
I'm going to kill you.

283
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,160
♫    Just come to me  ♫

284
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,180
♫    Keep on coming to me  ♫

285
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,960
She gets her temper from her grandmother.

286
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,820
♫    Suddenly you became the only person  I longed  for you while smiling  ♫

287
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:31,420
♫    Even if I try to hide it I will be looking all day always for you. Forever  ♫

288
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:48,970
Why is the heir of Taeyang Group here?

289
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:07,080
You said you got this bracelet as a gift, right? Who did you get it from?

290
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,820
If you answer my questions, I can tell you everything I know.

291
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,100
It's a win-win for both of us. There's nothing to lose.

292
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,640
Who are you? Why do you keep asking strange things when you come here?

293
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,970
I'm not a weirdo.

294
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:27,380
I'm someone here to help you. I would never try to hurt you.

295
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,750
Why was the heir of Taeyang Group here?

296
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,950
There's no reason a person as high as the heavens would be here at this hole in the wall.

297
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:41,180
Perhaps ... you two know each other?

298
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,770
- Are you curious? 
 - Very.

299
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:56,530
- If you're curious, pay me 5 million won ( approx. $4100 USD ). 
  - Not 500 won ( approx. 0.41 USD ) but 5 million won?

300
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,000
You said you were very curious.

301
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,640
If you don't like it, then that's fine.

302
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,120
It's because I know who gave you this bracelet. I've met her before.

303
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,110
You're curious now, aren't you?

304
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,930
I'm fine.

305
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,690
If you change your mind, come find me.

306
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,990
Yi Gyeong's side put Na Doo Rim's life on the line to use her as a fake.

307
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,700
I don't know who offered the deal first,

308
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,770
but I can say for sure that after you two exchanged vows,

309
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:09,910
they saw that Na Doo Rim was perfectly fine and alive,

310
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,820
because she ended up fine.

311
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:18,090
Yi Gyeong's brother got into an accident trying to help Doo Rim.

312
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,740
Miss. Miss!

313
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,380
You look like you've had a lot to drink already. Why don't you call it a day?

314
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,840
Pour me a drink.

315
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,370
- I'm sorry? 
 - I said, pour me a drink.

316
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,440
You can't do this here, sir.

317
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,550
I can't? Can't I ask you to pour me a glass?

318
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:51,920
Don't be like that, and come here. Pour me a glass now.

319
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,820
Do you want to leave quietly or do you want to be kicked out with a broken wrist?

320
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,050
I got it, ow!

321
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:23,000
Choi Kang Ju, what are you doing?

322
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Closed

323
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,710
Where is she going this late at night?

324
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,790
Oppa, I'm here!

325
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,400
You look good today.

326
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,000
Does she just work 24 hours a day?

327
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,750
Wait. Why am I hiding? I've done nothing wrong.

328
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,360
What are you doing here?

329
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,620
I didn't follow you. I came to visit someone.

330
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,710
Is your body made of steel? Hire a caregiver.

331
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,200
Mind your own business.

332
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,120
What did you do with all your money? Is it a waste to spend it here?

333
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:59,400
I have a caregiver. This is just my shift.

334
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,170
I'll do it. You do something else.

335
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:38,730
I came to visit a patient, but I came empty-handed.

336
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,370
I have to do something, at least. Get out of the way.

337
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,790
Wash him slowly and carefully, then.

338
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:31,130
You conned me using a fake, yet you can lie here like this?

339
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,870
I can't even get mad.

340
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,120
Please wake up soon.

341
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,590
Then I can fight you or something.

342
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,220
Also,

343
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,750
thank you for protecting her

344
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,820
so she doesn't get hurt.

345
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,020
This isn't an inn.

346
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:03,930
You said you're here to visit but you're just annoying him.

347
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:09,380
And whose fault is that? Watching you all day —

348
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:19,050
If you've finished your visit, you should get going. Oppa has to sleep, too.

349
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,790
Okay, then.

350
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,130
Hey, idiot.

351
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,920
What, you don't like it?

352
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,980
Then, knock-off. What should I call you?

353
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,910
Ahjussi. What do you want now?

354
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:54,620
You're not going to say your farewells? Don't you know how  to give a proper send off?

355
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,520
I cannot leave this room unattended.

356
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,870
Goodbye, Ahjussi.

357
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,040
Are you just getting home?

358
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,700
Are you having fun? With all your childish revenge games.

359
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,970
Don't worry about it.

360
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,520
I'm telling you to not drag it out too long.

361
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,460
Don't you know that everything you do every minute of the day gets reported to Mother?

362
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,520
I'll marry you. Are you happy now?

363
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,120
If you keep this up, it'll only become more difficult for that girl.

364
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,820
For now, I know how you feel,

365
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,490
so Mother isn't doing anything about the fact that you keep lingering around her.

366
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:12,890
However, if you continue, do you think she'll just sit back and watch?

367
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,440
Is that a warning?

368
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,930
No, I'm warning you.

369
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,080
Don't cause trouble because of your reckless courage.

370
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,520
For whose sake do I have to do such a thing?

371
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,160
For all of our sake.

372
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,260
For  all of our sake?

373
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:38,030
Does that include me too?

374
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,390
Because it doesn't seem like it matter what I think.

375
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:02,590
Are you just getting home? We decided to announce your marriage publicly tomorrow.

376
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:07,200
We'll be officially acknowledging Yi Gyeong as part of Taeyang Group's family.

377
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,360
In order to bring you clarity, wouldn't it be best to announce it as soon as possible?

378
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:58,390
 I, Choi Kang Ju, take you as my bride.

379
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:03,280
 And swear to spend the rest of my life with you.

380
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:18,350
 It's pass the time.

381
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:33,960
 Taeyang Department Store

382
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,150
President Choi is late.

383
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,940
He must have had business offsite. He should be here soon.

384
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,800
Team Leader.

385
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,660
What happened? Where's the CEO?

386
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,240
That is ... He was here right after the event ended ...

387
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:21,600
But he disappeared somewhere and we can't find him. He's not answering his phone either.

388
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,660
I would like to apologize.

389
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:44,160
CEO Choi Kang Ju was on his way from an offsite event but got into a small car accident.

390
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,810
He is currently receiving treatment at the hospital.

391
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:51,350
Unfortunately, we'll have to cancel today's press conference.

392
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,060
How can you do this?

393
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,100
When will the next press conference be?

394
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,200
There was rumor of a disagreement between the two. Is that the real reason?

395
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,030
 Which hospital is he at?

396
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,100
The picture ... release it to the media immediately.

397
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,740
Yes, I understand.

398
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,290
Kang Ju has declared war.

399
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,350
Too bad it's a fight he can't win.

400
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,340
What are you doing right now?

401
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,150
Doo Rim!

402
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,360
Just what ...

403
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,390
 Choi Kang Ju Disappears Before Press Conference. 
  Choi Kang Ju Has Secret Wedding.

404
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,150
Where is Kang Ju right now?

405
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,530
We're looking for him.

406
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,190
Why in the world did he do such a thing?

407
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,000
Is there a problem between Kang Ju and Yi Gyeong?

408
00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:00,420
No, it's nothing like that.

409
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,900
Get out.

410
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:36,690
What are you doing right now?

411
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:41,130
This is the only way to make things right.

412
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,830
Let's tell my father the truth.

413
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,970
I don't know about anyone else, but my father will be on our side.

414
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,080
He supported us.

415
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,520
We can't.

416
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,010
This is our last chance.

417
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:59,820
If you come in with me, we can make everything right.

418
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:06,730
I can't. I can't go in.

419
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:11,560
Is it because of Jang Yi Hyeon? I know he cared a lot about you.

420
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,930
So what? Are you saying you share the same feelings so you can't?

421
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,070
Still, it doesn't matter.

422
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:26,950
It doesn't matter who you like, I need to keep you by my side.

423
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:35,960
Let go of me. You're acting like this because of your own greed.

424
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,820
Don't you care about anyone else?

425
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,640
Why are you only thinking about your own hurt?

426
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:58,710
Yes. I'm Jang Yi Hyeon's guardian.

427
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:05,000
What? Yes, I'll be right there.

428
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,660
Please let go of me.

429
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,350
I have to go.

430
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:28,110
