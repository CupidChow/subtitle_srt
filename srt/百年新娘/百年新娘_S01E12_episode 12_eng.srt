1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,450
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:12,180

3
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,360
Why the packed lunch?

4
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,530
Oh, hold on.

5
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,250
Who are you going to meet right now?

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,210
Oppa Yi Hyeon. He said he was working late today.

7
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,190
- You ... 
 - What?

8
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,620
Aigoo, she's even packing him food.

9
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,140
They're definitely dating.

10
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:14,010
Aigoo. If you came all the way here, you should at least come in. You can't just leave.

11
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,390
Grandma, don't do this. I'm scared of you.

12
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,110
Are you going to bring me in just to beat me up again?

13
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,420
Aigoo, no, no.

14
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,750
Come in. Sit, sit.

15
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,330
Sit right here.

16
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:38,080
At that time, I didn't know you were such an esteemed person.

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,590
I'm so sorry.

18
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,750
I still can't get over it.

19
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,410
Your predictions were so accurate.

20
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:57,330
That night my granddaughter was rushed to the ER and nearly died.

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,040
Grandma, do you believe me now?

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,060
Of course.

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,760
So please continue what you were telling me that day.

24
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,440
Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's ...

25
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,330
I don't know what this is,

26
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:33,200
but there is an ominous and dark energy here. My throat is dry too.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,720
Aigoo. Where are my manners? Wait one moment.

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,130
I'll bring you a grand meal.

29
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,630
Yes.

30
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,940
Grandma, I'll be right back.

31
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,790
Okay. Have fun.

32
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,120
Where did you get this bracelet?

33
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,000
- What are you doing? 
 - I asked where you got it.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,400
I received it as a gift. Someone gave it to me as a lucky charm.

35
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,390
Why are you grabbing my granddaughter's hand? Let it go.

36
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,160
Grandma, who is this person?

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,320
You don't need to know. Hurry and leave.

38
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,710
Grandma, that young lady is your granddaughter?

39
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,630
Of course. She's my one and only precious granddaughter.

40
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,150
How could this be?

41
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,500
Grandma, I'm sorry. I don't think I can share this with you.

42
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,380
But you have to finish what you were telling me. How can you just leave?

43
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,910
Grandma, don't do this.

44
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,200
- You can't go. 
 - Grandma, I can't.

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,430
- I'm sorry. 
 - Stop.

46
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,120
Because of that grandma, my style gets ruined every time I come here.

47
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,080
Anyway, what now?

48
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,240
She doesn't even realize it's not luck but the shadow of death closing in on her.

49
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,770
It won't be easy to spare her life.

50
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,890
Should I tell her or not?

51
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,230
It's not something I can just say.

52
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,750
I don't know.

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,670
An oath of love?

54
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,220
Why? You don't like it?

55
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,360
Just the two of us without anyone knowing?

56
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,090
I know it's bad to lie to our parents but that's the only way.

57
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,090
And is there a law that says we have to get married in a huge ceremony in front of lots of people?

58
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,120
Who cares about formalities?

59
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,760
What's important is that our hearts don't change in the years and years to come.

60
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,280
Even if I don't have a diamond ring or fancy wedding dress ...

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,920
Even if I just have a dandelion crown and ring ...

62
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,220
And the wind passes through my fingers,

63
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,310
and leaves whisper in the wind.

64
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,370
And the sun shines through the trees and blesses us,

65
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,770
I think that's meaningful and beautiful enough for me.

66
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,470
Think about it.

67
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,090
It's the only way for us to be accepted by our families.

68
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,990
You said you're the protector of this home.

69
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,100
Then guard this house.

70
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,220
I'm ... going to protect the owner of this heart.

71
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,520
If this is my fate, I will face it head on.

72
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,990
Even if I fall and break,

73
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,770
it'll be for the sake of my heart's owner.

74
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,190
- Where are you? 
 - I'm in front of the department store.

75
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,040
Didn't you say you were working late today?

76
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,550
Where are you? I packed some food.

77
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,320
I'm almost there. Wait in my office.

78
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,400
Okay.

79
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,290
Oh, I changed my mind. I'll wait here.

80
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,770
Then I can see your face a little sooner.

81
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,950
And you need to find me.

82
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,530
I told you to wait inside. You really don't listen.

83
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,380
Okay. Wait there. I'll be there soon.

84
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,930
♫  Cause you're my girl  ♫

85
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,830
♫   You are the only one I love  ♫

86
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,950
♫  It's just you  ♫

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,700
He's taking so long.

88
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,720
Hello.

89
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,530
Hello.

90
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,070
You can leave first.

91
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,480
- Are you here to see the CEO? 
 - Ah, yes.

92
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,700
- Are you just leaving? 
 - Yes.

93
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,000
But the CEO isn't in his office.

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,330
Does he know you're here?

95
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,930
We agreed to meet here but I've been waiting a long time.

96
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,420
- Should I give him a call? 
 - Oh no. It's okay.

97
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,440
All the employees have left and they're going to be closing soon. Are you sure you want to wait here?

98
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,450
I'll wait for just a little while longer.

99
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,310
Thank you for your concern.

100
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,830
Then, I'll head out now.

101
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,730
Why isn't he coming?

102
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,900
What's going on?

103
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,690
It's the moon.

104
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,040
You found me. You knew I was here.

105
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,010
You're always wherever I am.

106
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,190
But why the moon? And what is this?

107
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,120
When a red string is tied around two people's fingers,

108
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,970
they are destined to be together forever.

109
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,520
You and I are tied together.

110
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,640
To the ends of the heavens and to the ends of the earth.

111
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,320
Even if we're miles apart,

112
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,190
once it's tied it can never be untied.

113
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,220
Even if we end up walking down a heart-wrenchingly painful path,

114
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,640
I won't ever lose you again.

115
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,930
I love you.

116
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,570
Be my bride.

117
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,100
It took you long enough.

118
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,300
I'm not very good at wait—

119
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,710
I'll take all the shots from now on.

120
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,320
If bullets are shot, I'll take them. If they need to blame someone,

121
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,390
I'll take it all.

122
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,620
Once your  family finds out, they're going to flip out.

123
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,760
Don't say a word and just sit tight. I'll take care of everything.

124
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,490
You trust me, right?

125
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,830
Get home safely.

126
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,570
Go inside.

127
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,710
Are you confident you won't regret it?

128
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,980
I asked if you're sure you won't regret it.

129
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,670
Yes. I won't regret it.

130
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,620
Because of your decision, it looks like we'll both become Choi Kang Ju's bride.

131
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,110
One person in death ...

132
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,570
And the other in life.

133
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,140
It's not a bad deal for me.

134
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:22,020
As you said, if something bad happens to you, I can take your place as someone who looks like you.

135
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,130
And everyone will be fooled.

136
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,430
Perhaps ...

137
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,690
We look the same for this very reason.

138
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:44,670
To make an otherwise impossible fate possible.

139
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,350
You may not want to believe in that family's curse,

140
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,570
but there's a spirit that protects that home.

141
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,090
A spirit that transcends time has lingered there throughout the years.

142
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,130
You'll probably meet her soon.

143
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:10,920
Will you feel the same way even after you meet that spirit?

144
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,550
 Today, I received a marriage proposal.

145
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,960
 It feels like a dream. I'm so happy, it scares me.

146
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,170
 I'm scared this happiness will shatter.

147
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,570
 She was a woman I met for the first time.

148
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,810
 She asked me,

149
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,650
 Would you marry him even if you lose your life?

150
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,770
Your necklace is pretty.

151
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:19,750
You ... How did you know I was here?

152
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,940
You want to be the owner of that necklace, right?

153
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,310
Who are you?

154
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,240
What do you want from me?

155
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,320
The bracelet I gave you ...

156
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,800
Do you still believe it will bring you luck?

157
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,600
In exchange for gaining love, you will lose your life.

158
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,820
 There's a spirit that protects that home.

159
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,040
 A spirit that transcends time has lingered there throughout the years.

160
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,030
Answer. Even if it costs you your life,

161
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,160
do you still want to be his bride?

162
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,620
What is she doing?

163
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,600
Jin Ju.

164
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,730
What happened? Weren't you meeting the Director?

165
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,520
Let's talk.

166
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,480
 Wait, if she marries Kang Ju, she's going to die anyway.

167
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,070
 Then I don't need to get rid of her.

168
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,000
 This is getting interesting, Jang Yi Gyeong.

169
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,130
You said you were meeting me, but who were you really meeting?

170
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,320
Were you with Choi Kang Ju?

171
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,800
I'm sorry, Oppa.

172
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,460
No, stop immediately. I told you it can't work with Choi Kang Ju.

173
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,850
- Oppa. 
 - Do you think it's just a coincidence that Yi Gyeong disappeared?

174
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,660
Everything was planned from the beginning,

175
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,210
just to bring you into this.

176
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,080
What does that mean?

177
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,380
They were playing with your life from the beginning.

178
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,320
My mother knew about the curse on Choi Kang Ju's family.

179
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,650
That's why she made you come all the way here. Do you still not understand?

180
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,480
She's had you in the palm of her hands all this time.

181
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,680
That makes no sense ...

182
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,010
How can she ...

183
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm not sure what you two talked about,

184
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,210
but she's been planning to replace you with Yi Gyeong all this time.

185
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,060
Trust me. Even if you don't want to believe it, it's true.

186
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,500
I don't believe in the curse on that family.

187
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,610
What I'm worried about is that, even if the curse isn't true,

188
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,990
you'll be in danger if you don't give up on Choi Kang Ju.

189
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,610
Only one woman can be Choi Kang Ju's bride, yet two women have the same face.

190
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:04,720
If one of those two has to disappear, who do you think that will be?

191
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,280
It's not too late to give up.

192
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,060
If you can just let go of Choi Kang Ju, nothing will happen.

193
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,270
I used to hate this song.

194
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,140
Because whenever I heard this song, you were like a different person.

195
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,920
I'm sure it was painful for you too.

196
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,090
After losing your first love,

197
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:16,320
all the days you spent longing for her in this study.

198
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,700
After watching you, I thought ...

199
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,140
I don't want to live like you.

200
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,060
But now ... I think I have to make the same choice you did.

201
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,650
If I lose Yi Gyeong now,

202
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,230
I think I'll regret it forever.

203
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:31,650
 Answer me. Even if it costs you your life, do you still want to be his bride?

204
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,600
 I want to be his bride.

205
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,960
 Even if you lose your life?

206
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,810
 Yes.

207
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,020
 Even if I lose my life.

208
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,000
Our grandma is so pretty.

209
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,710
Isn't the color too much?

210
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,150
No. It's perfect on you. Let's get this one.

211
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,020
Aigoo. I have no place to wear this. I'm fine.

212
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,430
Doo Rim, just buy something for yourself.

213
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,920
Okay, okay.

214
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,430
After we buy something for you, let's go find something for me.

215
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,160
Please ring this up for us.

216
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,220
Let's go.

217
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,830
How is it Grandma? Does it taste good?

218
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,000
Yes. I don't know if it's because it's expensive but it's delicious.

219
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,670
The meat is so tender.

220
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,930
Try some of this.

221
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,810
This is sweet and delicious too.

222
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,640
What are you doing? Eat some.

223
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,230
Okay.

224
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,610
I'm sorry Grandma.

225
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,670
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

226
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,390
Because I couldn't bring you to a place like this sooner.

227
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,770
I always said I would make sure you lived a nice life but I never did.

228
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,700
What are you talking about?

229
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,740
I made you work so hard every day,

230
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,420
and there's nothing I've done for you as your grandmother.

231
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,920
What are you sorry for? I'm the one who should be sorry.

232
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,530
Why are saying you haven't done anything for me?

233
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,750
You raised me to become who I am now.

234
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,490
Now that the restaurant has become more established,

235
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,070
you just have to meet a nice man

236
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,010
and get married. There's nothing more I can wish for.

237
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,340
Grandma, should I not get married,

238
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,860
and just live with you forever?

239
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,230
Careful. Don't say things like that even as a joke.

240
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,620
You're words will become reality.

241
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,290
Doo Rim, you're like a gift from heaven.

242
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,800
So I know you're going to meet a nice man and get married.

243
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,090
Who knows? They say things are always closer than you think.

244
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,740
Your other half may already be beside you.

245
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,580
Grandma, I need to visit Namhae tomorrow.

246
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,450
What for?

247
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,710
I got a call from the twins' mom regarding Bong Sook.

248
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,470
Did they find her?

249
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,880
Yeah. People in Namhae saw her.

250
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,340
So I was going to go look for her.

251
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,140
Oh my.

252
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,760
Even if you have to search all of Namhae, you must find her.

253
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,940
People like her that run off with other people's hard earned money,

254
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,720
deserve to be found and put in jail.

255
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,920
Grandma, hurry and eat.

256
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,590
What is it at this hour?

257
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:28,600
I just wanted to see your face before I left.

258
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,240
I saw you took some days off.

259
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,940
And you bought couple rings at the jewelry store.

260
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,940
And?

261
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,310
I think I know where you're going,

262
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,310
and what you're planning on doing.

263
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,270
Are you confident you won't regret your decision?

264
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,370
I won't regret it.

265
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,710
Fine.

266
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,200
Then I'll end my one-sided crush starting today.

267
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:13,020
But there's a saying that the end is the start of a new beginning.

268
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,820
After today, things you never even imagined may happen.

269
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,910
I'm not sure if you won't regret it then.

270
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:31,400
The reason you can't trust people, why you don't give them your heart,

271
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,150
I think I can understand now. Because you hurt as much as you trusted.

272
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:41,940
Don't trust anyone, not even yourself.

273
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:48,410
Tell your first bride that I said congratulations.

274
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,290
It's tomorrow?

275
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,250
Are you rushing because of our company?

276
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,810
Or because my mom asked?

277
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,090
That's not necessarily why.

278
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,490
It's to take responsibility for the choices I've made.

279
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:29,900
I don't know what will happen because of my choices,

280
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,190
but I can't ask anyone else to take on that burden.

281
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,390
I need to take responsibility.

282
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,730
I was told it was my last chance. That if I want to live, I should run away.

283
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,880
I'm going to go down the path I've chosen.

284
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,850
It's the only way,

285
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:03,490
I can stay by Kang Ju's side forever.

286
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,470
What is Choi Kang Ju to you?

287
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,890
Is he so important that you would risk your life for him?

288
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,260
It was the first time ...

289
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:26,180
That I considered someone else more important that my own life.

290
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,220
How can I let go of someone like that?

291
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,760
Na Doo Rim. Be honest.

292
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,700
You're not going to Namhae, are you?

293
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,030
What?

294
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,940
I called my family in Namhae and confirmed everything.

295
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,620
You can fool a ghost but not me.

296
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,460
You didn't tell Grandma, did you?

297
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:20,030
If you don't tell me, I'm going to tell Grandma everything.

298
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,730
Where are you going and with whom?

299
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,230
Sorry, Jin Ju.

300
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,670
I left the easy road and chose the more difficult one.

301
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,800
You ... and Choi Kang Ju?

302
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,250
Aigoo, Young Master. You look like a groom about to get married.

303
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,280
You look so handsome.

304
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,770
Where are you going?

305
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,470
I'm meeting someone. What about Father?

306
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,680
He's in the study.

307
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,830
I have something to tell you.

308
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:12,510
We thought this was the only way for our families to accept our relationship.

309
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,360
If that's how you feel, then go ahead.

310
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,850
A poet once wrote, "A flower does not bloom effortlessly".

311
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,850
"A flower that blooms against strong wind is that much more precious"

312
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,540
"and will be that much stronger".

313
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,790
 After tonight, everything will fall back into place.

314
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,750
 After tonight.

315
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,810
Be careful. Have a safe trip.

316
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,160
Tell the twins' family and the others I say hello.

317
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,630
Yes.

318
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,760
Jin Ju, take care of Grandma while I'm gone.

319
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,440
Okay.

320
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,750
I'll be back soon, Grandma.

321
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,250
Call when you arrive.

322
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,660
Let's head inside.

323
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,670
Leaving on a long trip?

324
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,830
My goodness. You really are skilled.

325
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:47,840
Our Doo Rim had business in Namhae so she just left.

326
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,010
Grandma, that's not it.

327
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:56,620
You just said our Doo Rim will be going on a long trip.

328
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,510
That long trip ... you see ...

329
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:07,630
My goodness. You'll make an old lady pass away. Hurry up and tell me.

330
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,420
It's not a literal long trip,

331
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,480
but it's a long trip towards death. She's on a path leading to death.

332
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:22,050
What? Death?

333
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,430
You little rascal! How dare you say such a thing about a girl who has her whole life ahead of her?

334
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:34,890
I should rip your mouth open!

335
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,480
Grandma! Why do you keep doing this?

336
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,890
You asked me to tell you the truth about your granddaughter so I did.

337
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,060
What you do with that information is up to you.

338
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,800
You rascal!

339
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,470
Aigoo, that little ...

340
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,280
Doo Rim.

341
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,530
Oppa.

342
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,430
What's going on? You came all the way here without even calling.

343
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,330
I didn't take you away from something important, did I?

344
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,310
But are you going somewhere?

345
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,020
I have some business in Namhae, so I was headed there.

346
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,220
I just stopped by on my way.

347
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,900
And it's been awhile since I've seen you.

348
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:30,950
And this. I packed some food. Have some when you feel hungry.

349
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,060
You're ... okay, right?

350
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,110
And Choi Kang Ju ...

351
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,080
Don't worry.

352
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,160
Okay. Go to Namhae, take in some of the ocean breeze, and just leave everything there.

353
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,870
I know that I don't have the right to say,

354
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,730
thank you and I'm sorry to you.

355
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,290
I'm going to go now. Head back inside.

356
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:18,230
Thanks for the food. Have a safe trip.

357
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,750
I won't forget,

358
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,260
all the times you comforted me,

359
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,720
and were kind to me.

360
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,610
I'm going now.

361
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,450
 I'm sorry and I am really thankful to you.

362
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,850
I, Choi Kang Ju,

363
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,220
take you as my wife,

364
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,460
and swear to spend the rest of my life with you, until my dying breath.

365
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,520
I will not be shaken by temptation.

366
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,130
I will stay strong for hundreds,

367
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,770
thousands of years like a strong boulder that will not break.

368
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,600
I promise to cherish and love only you always.

369
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,580
I ...

370
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,030
 I ...

371
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,210
 Na Doo Rim

372
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,040
I, Jang Yi Gyeong,

373
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,430
will be your bride,

374
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:29,000
and sweat to spend the rest of my life with you, until my dying breath.

375
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,520
Even after hundreds, thousands of years,

376
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,030
like the wind and sunlight,

377
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,390
I will remain by your side,

378
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,750
and promise to love and cherish you eternally.

379
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,560
Look.

380
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,040
It's shining brightly.

381
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,740
Doesn't it feel like the whole world is blessing us?

382
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,370
Truth is ...

383
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,930
The brightest things in the world

384
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,340
is the one standing in front of me ... you, Kang Ju.

385
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,870
Ta-da.

386
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,470
They're wish coupons that I made myself.

387
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,910
"Wear matching couple shirts", "Sing a song" ...

388
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,630
"Give a kiss"...

389
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,590
"Cook a meal"

390
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:09,260
"Hold hands and go on a walking date"

391
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,430
Where did you buy these clothes?

392
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,640
Why?

393
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,730
They're cute.

394
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,160
Spicy rice cakes and blood sausage.

395
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,200
Yes. Thank you.

396
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,370
You know how to eat this?

397
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,960
Have some.

398
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,630
Hurry.

399
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,870
It's good, isn't it?

400
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:58,660
You have the taste of an elementary schooler.

401
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:05,010
You need to dip the blood sausage in the spicy rice cake sauce.

402
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,800
Oppa.

403
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:20,780
Is that Unni your girlfriend?

404
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:25,100
You have good eyes for a kid. Kiddo,

405
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,570
you can't fall for this Oppa.

406
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:31,140
He just became a married man.

407
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,920
Oppa, you're too good for her.

408
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,430
What?

409
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,270
She said I'm too good for you.

410
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,800
Ahjumma,

411
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,720
I'll pay for this young lady's food.

412
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:57,740
Don't even look at her.

413
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,370
It won't end well for you.

414
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,600
Eat up.

415
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,210
Eat up.

416
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,340
My twins?

417
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,430
What?

418
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,630
They say the birthrate has been really low lately,

419
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:28,140
it would help our country and wouldn't they be cute?

420
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,150
Like cute little puppies.

421
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,770
They would be so pretty.

422
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:38,350
Other girls get so scared.

423
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,610
But you want twins?

424
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,090
I'm really curious about your brain.

425
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,730
What exactly is inside of that head of yours?

426
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,620
Choi Kang Ju.

427
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,300
You said you were curious about my brain.

428
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,960
In my head, Choi Kang Ju

429
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,400
is the only thing in there.

430
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,160
If you keep being this obvious,

431
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,370
you'll lose your charm.

432
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:08,290
Men who avoid the obvious also have no charm.

433
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,940
What was that?

434
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,050
I used my kiss coupon.

435
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,310
What? Are you joking right now?

436
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:28,900
How can you use this now? I stayed up all night to make those.

437
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,360
No, no. Take it back.

438
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,970
It's okay.

439
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,240
Do you only have one of these coupons?

440
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,770
I like this one.

441
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,140
Or maybe instead of this,

442
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:49,510
an X-rated, hot and steamy erotic coupon.

443
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,390
You should make one of those.

444
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:56,660
As a wish for having twin babies.

445
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,110
Cheers.

446
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,680
What are you talking about?

447
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,220
Where are you going?

448
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,970
Let's go together.

449
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:34,200
 To Oppa Yi Hyeon  ...

450
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,040
 Doo Rim

451
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,590
I don't think I can peel anymore.

452
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:09,480
Other men are able to peel a truckload.

453
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,750
Okay. I'll peel them. I can just peel them.

454
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,820
I specialize in cooking fish,

455
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:31,200
But why did it have to burn on such a special day?

456
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,010
Taste it.

457
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:53,860
Of all the fish I've tried at 3-star Michelin restaurants in the UK,

458
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:59,230
this doesn't even compare. It's delicious. Very delicious. Good!

459
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:03,610
What's going on? You're even complimenting me.

460
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:17,210
What if ...  just what if ...

461
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:22,090
someone was lying to you,

462
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:27,060
but they were lying because they had no other choice,

463
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,860
what would you do?

464
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,830
That's the thing I hate the most.

465
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:40,230
Fooling people. Lying.

466
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,760
I wouldn't even acknowledge them.

467
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,910
You ... are you hiding something from me?

468
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,080
Like an elaborate relationship you had in the past or something like that?

469
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:02,480
It's nothing like that.

470
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,490
You stammering like that makes it more suspicious.

471
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,510
I told you it's not.

472
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,840
Hurry and eat.

473
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,580
Tell me.

474
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:39,960
When did I start making your heart race?

475
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,520
I don't remember.

476
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:48,060
I remember.

477
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:57,290
When I was hurt at this villa, you lifted me up

478
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,720
and put me in a wheelchair.

479
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,550
My heart was racing so fast, I thought it was going to burst.

480
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:11,310
Now it's your turn to tell me.

481
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:15,990
No, don't tell me. I'll try to guess.

482
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:32,850
Even when you try to think about it, you can't think of one moment, can you?

483
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:38,800
Tomato, cake eating contest, wall climbing ...

484
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,590
There's only outrageous memories.

485
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:45,890
I thought of one. Back hug at the hospital.

486
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,640
Nope.

487
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,510
It's not?

488
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:59,800
Then when was it?

489
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,880
When was it? When?

490
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,290
I can't stand being curious.

491
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:11,000
If you don't tell me, I'm going to follow you around and bother you all night.

492
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,280
Fine. I'll tell you later.

493
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,620
Later when?

494
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,870
Tomorrow.

495
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,830
I'll tell you tomorrow.

496
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,540
Tomorrow?

497
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,760
Tomorrow. Tell me tomorrow.

498
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:09,500
- Yes, Jin Ju. 
 - Doo Rim told me not to tell anyone,

499
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,100
but I'm too worried about her.

500
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,430
She left with Choi Kang Ju?

501
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:21,510
For now, don't tell her grandmother. Let me look for her first and I'll call you.

502
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:36,020
 The person you are trying to reach is unavailable—

503
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,200
Where is Doo Rim right now?

504
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,390
Why are you asking me where she is?

505
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:03,780
This is the lease from the apartment you stayed at when you disappeared.

506
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:12,550
This is a copy of the CCTV footage of you and mom going in and out of that building.

507
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,800
You know better than anyone else what this means.

508
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:24,130
I know what you and Mom are trying to do with Doo Rim.

509
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,920
Doo Rim wanted to do it.

510
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,720
Doo Rim is the one who chose Choi Kang Ju.

511
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:34,030
We don't have to do anything, Doo Rim is sacrificing herself.

512
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:39,100
Doo Rim knows all about you and Mom's plan, but she still chose Choi Kang Ju.

513
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,540
If she decides to tell Choi Kang Ju the truth,

514
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,780
you and Mom's plan will also disappear.

515
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:50,910
This is dangerous for everyone. We have to stop this immediately.

516
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:53,980
How could you go as far as to take someone else's life?

517
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,190
You and Mom are out of your minds. How can a person do this to another person—

518
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,730
It's possible because we are human.

519
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:02,300
Fine. Because I'm human, I don't know what I'll do next.

520
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:06,930
I could go to Choi Kang Ju's house right now. Is that what you want?

521
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:37,780
Mom, Oppa is on his way to the villa right now. And he said Doo Rim knows all about our plan.

522
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,120
She might tell Choi Kang Ju everything.

523
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,670
Then that's all the more reason she can't stay alive.

524
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:49,090
We have no choice but to silence her forever.

525
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:55,290
This will be all over tomorrow. Stay strong and wait.

526
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:13,790

527
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,650
 Bride of the Century
