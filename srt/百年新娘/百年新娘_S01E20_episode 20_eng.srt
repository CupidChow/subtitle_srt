1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,860
 Bride of the Century

2
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,820
It's not the end, it's just the beginning.

3
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,220
You taught me that longing and patience,

4
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,360
are also love.

5
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,340
Now put your sadness behind you and move forward.

6
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,870
And at the end of that road,

7
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,910
you'll see what's waiting for you.

8
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,060
This award is really meaningful.

9
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,370
It's a nationally acclaimed award,

10
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,540
so it will be good for the department store's image and we'll probably see an increase in revenue.

11
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,750
Particularly, your idea to standardize part-time and full-time employee benefits,

12
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,790
is a hot topic lately.

13
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,300
I already know who is responsible for your change.

14
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,810
What? So are you saying I can't or what?

15
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,570
The return window has passed so it will be difficult.

16
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,070
Also, the damage is not our fault so ...

17
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,820
Are you saying I'm being cheap about a stupid purse.

18
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,570
I'm a VVIP customer. Give me a refund now!

19
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,730
- I'm sorry. The company policy ... 
 - Why you ...

20
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,230
- Ahjumma. 
 - Ahjumma?

21
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,110
It's obvious that this luxury bag doesn't suit you at all.

22
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,780
- Give her a refund. 
 - Yes, sir.

23
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,540
And ... apologize to our employee.

24
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:44,990
Seriously, I can't ...

25
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,000
Follow her.

26
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,500
President Choi, thank you. Thank you.

27
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,340
- I'll work harder. 
 - Work hard.

28
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,130
Oh, President Choi.

29
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,700
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

30
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,330
I had a photo shoot at the department store today.

31
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:22,680
- I hope you weren't uncomfortable at all during the shoot. 
 - There wasn't but ...

32
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,900
You saw the news about my break up, right?

33
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,690
If you have time, I'd like to have dinner with you.

34
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,740
Why haven't you gotten married yet?

35
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,170
I guess you didn't know.

36
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,630
I ... am married.

37
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,190
Then, if you'll excuse me.

38
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,010
Married?

39
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,340
To that Na Doo Rim or whoever, that phantom bride?

40
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,150
Did I just get rejected because of her?

41
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,470
Where's your mom? Where's mom?

42
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,810
Where is your mom? Mom?

43
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,430
Jun Ho!

44
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,030
There's your mom. Your mom is here.

45
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,360
Thank you!

46
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,000
It's been one year already,

47
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,100
since you left the house.

48
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,750
I know it doesn't compare to the years you spent waiting,

49
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,600
but one day felt like a year as I waited for you.

50
00:06:53,070 --> 00:07:01,470
For the remainder of my life, Kim Myeong Hee, I want to live as your man.

51
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:13,660
I finally realized that you being in my life was something to be cherished.

52
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,430
One day when I leave this world and become ashes,

53
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:29,080
I hope the wind blows me to meet you.

54
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,460
And what if I reject you?

55
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,670
 After that woman left, another winter has come.

56
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:20,990
 And ... just as she had hoped, life became more peaceful.

57
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,200
 And a person who had left has returned.

58
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,140
Hyung, we're all ready. Hurry and come out.

59
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,130
Oh it's good.

60
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,930
Everyone needs to come out to my next showcase, okay?

61
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,960
We understand,. We'll be there.

62
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,070
But Mom, why of all things sweet potatoes?

63
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,290
It makes me miss Doo Rim.

64
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,680
She would have loved to come to our next showcase.

65
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,440
- Mother, have some. 
 - Okay.

66
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,850
- Oh, what is this harmonious mood? 
 - Hey, what about me?

67
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,610
- Dongchimi ...  (T.N. water radish kimchi)  
- I've been eating dongchimi.

68
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,280
- Honey, have some of this. 
 - Shall I?

69
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,010
Let's see here.

70
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:20,250
 After that woman left, we realized just how many gifts she left us.

71
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,930
 In the empty space she left, it is being filled with laughter instead of tears.

72
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,960
It's tastes good. It's really good.

73
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,970
 I ... really miss her.

74
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,880
- Grandma, I'll be right back. 
 - Okay.

75
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,650
Kang Rim, Mom will be right back.

76
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,100
- Oh yeah, don't forget your lunch. 
 - That's right.

77
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,510
Don't skip any meals and take care of yourself.

78
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,920
Okay.

79
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,860
Mommy. Bye-bye.

80
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,400
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

81
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,600
- Unni! 
 - Yoo Jeong, are you coming home from school?

82
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,240
Yes.

83
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,140
- I got first on my final exam. 
 - Really?

84
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,440
Good job Yoo Jeong.

85
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,300
Here are some side dishes and other things to eat.

86
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,560
Prepare a nice meal for your grandfather.

87
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,690
And this is medicine for your grandfather.

88
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,010
Here. A gift for getting first place on your final exam.

89
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,280
Thanks, Unni.

90
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,270
I'll study really hard and make it up to you.

91
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,400
Okay.

92
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,690
- Are you knitting that for Kang Rim? 
 - Yeah.

93
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,110
Look at this. It'll look so cute on Kang Rim.

94
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,310
I want to see Kang Rim.

95
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,050
- I'll come by and see him this weekend. 
 - Okay.

96
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,220
Your grandfather's probably waiting. You should get going.

97
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,530
- Then, I'm leaving. 
 - Bye.

98
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,680
 Are you doing well?

99
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,990
 I'm doing well.

100
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:25,530
 Our son that looks just like you, must be a gift you sent for my lonely heart.

101
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,370
 Whenever I want to see  you, I look at our child

102
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,030
and my longing heart can endure.

103
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,450
 You're probably looking at the same sky.

104
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:49,940
 I hope somewhere in that sky, I am able to meet you again.

105
00:12:51,560 --> 00:13:01,640
  I ... miss you ... a lot.

106
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,950
The weather has gotten much nicer.

107
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:36,060
When the spring comes, flowers that slept through winter bloom again.

108
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,470
And birds that left, return again.

109
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,880
Good news will come soon.

110
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,640
- Are you here to see your compatibility? 
 - No.

111
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,420
We're looking for someone. Her name is Na Doo Rim.

112
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,900
If you're looking for someone, you should have gone to the police, a service center, or some place like that.

113
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,190
Although I am skilled, I don't have the ability to find people.

114
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,140
- What's going on? 
 - My mom just told me ...

115
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,020
Well, while you're here, why don't you look at your compatibility?

116
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,900
Just by looking at you, you two were made for each other.

117
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,630
- Made for each other? 
 - Ah, yes.

118
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:40,500
I've never seen two people better fit for each other.

119
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,030
We're not in that kind of relationship.

120
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:48,800
If you two don't end up together, both of you will be unhappy.

121
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,840
That's enough.

122
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,130
Let's go. We don't need to hear anymore.

123
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,800
You can't even recognize the gem you have right in front of you.

124
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,240
You're pushing your own happiness away.

125
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,660
You can choose to believe me or not.

126
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,580
A gem?

127
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,390
Hold on to it, tight.

128
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,850
And when you do, your luck will be

129
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,610
like a dragon flying up to the skies.

130
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,210
What are you doing? I said let's go.

131
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,000
Aigoo ...

132
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,140
Thank you!

133
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,080
Oh just my luck.

134
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,440
Getting ordered around by a kid. That rude little ...

135
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:10,040
Aigoo ... I lost my skills so I don't even have any customers.

136
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,970
And here I am playing games with people. Seriously.

137
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,990
When will this woman be back?

138
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,280
It was posted online but we've had so many false leads,

139
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,530
don't get your hopes up.

140
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,690
Even if it's false, I should still check it out.

141
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,590
If you get any other leads, let me know.

142
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,730
Okay.

143
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:50,980
Dear God, Dear Buddha, please let them meet this time.

144
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:25,800
♫  Is it wrong if I want to see you?  ♫

145
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,210
♫  Is it wrong if I long for you?  ♫

   - I don't think she's there.

163
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,190
 Another lead came in from Sokcho Police Station.

164
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,620
-   They look similar. I think it's a legitimate lead.   
 - Okay.

Kang Rim. Daddy is here.

180
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,410
I named him Kang Rim.

181
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,260
I took a part of yours and my name.

182
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,890
His eyes, nose, mouth ...

183
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,020
They look like yours.

184
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,850
For not forgetting and coming back for Doo Rim,

185
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,640
I'm very thankful.

186
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,390
I'm really thankful.

187
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,300
Thank you.

188
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,420
Grandma, please accept my bow.

189
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,600
For coming so late,

190
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,430
I'm sorry.

191
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,700
I'm really sorry.

192
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,290
Daddy. Daddy.

193
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,340
Have a nice day.

194
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,290
Welcome.

195
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,470
Is the the restaurant where Choi Kang Ju and Na Doo Rim's love story began?

196
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,540
We saw this and came here.

197
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,340
- Choi Kang Ju and Na Doo Rim's love story. 
 - Yes it is.

198
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,980
This is Na Doo Rim's restaurant.

199
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,040
We're on a pop-culture tour right now.

200
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,390
- Pop-culture tour? 
 -Choi Kang Ju and Na Doo Rim's love story,

201
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,930
is really romantic and touching.

202
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,780
The department store and this restaurant is getting popular as the birthplace of romance.

203
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,710
When I read their love story, I cried all night that my eyes were bloated.

204
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,700
But where is Na Doo Rim? I want to receive her autograph.

205
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,690
She's not here right now. She went to her in-laws.

206
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,290
Her in-laws? So Choi Kang Ju's house?

207
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,600
 Birthplace of the Touching Choi Kang Ju and Na Doo Rim Romance

208
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:06,660
Do you also believe that rumor?

209
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,390
The first bride of the eldest son

210
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:28,800
will be sacrificed on the first night to the spirit that protects this house.

211
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,680
Do you really believe that there's a spirit?

212
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,080
Soon Bok.

213
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,040
That rumor was made up by  me.

214
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,020
That was the only way to make you my bride.

215
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,600
The first time I saw you was on a spring day,

216
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,670
when you came to do some needlework for my mother.

217
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,410
My mother praised you for your skills.

218
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:39,140
You smiled shyly in the shade of the trees.

219
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,200
More so than the pink clothing you had sewn,

220
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,380
you were so much prettier.

221
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:58,570
I think it was from that time that I kept you in my heart.

222
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,850
I wanted to make you my bride.

223
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,640
But it was obvious that my family would oppose it.

224
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,530
So I started that rumor.

225
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,200
People believed in that rumor.

226
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,570
My grandfather and my father's first bride,

227
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,530
died by either an accident or illness. Nonetheless, they both died.

228
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:29,560
In the end, prearranged marriage plans were called off and daughters from upper class families refused to marry me.

229
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,590
So they had no choice but to pay someone to marry me.

230
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,230
And that was you Soon Bok.

231
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:50,020
So you don't have to be afraid.

232
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:57,030
This was all so that I could have you.

233
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,320
What happened?

234
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,300
Did you find a body?

235
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,040
- No, sir. 
 - You didn't.

236
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,330
And the thing I asked you to look into?

237
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:03,720
Last night, a young man from her village,

238
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,060
disappeared also.

239
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,300
- And... 
 - What is it?

240
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,300
Tell me!

241
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:20,130
Before Miss Soon Bok married you,

242
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,290
she was in love with that young man.

243
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:53,350
 You rejected my love and ran away in the hands of another.

244
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,590
 For that I resent you over and over.

245
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,880
 You loved another man that much,

246
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,040
 that you had no choice but to reject me.

247
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,230
 I loved and still love you.

248
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:32,500
For what I've done to this family,

249
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,800
I ask for forgiveness.

250
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,560
Finding a good match,

251
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:53,040
is as hard as a blind turtle finding a piece of wood in the ocean.

252
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,870
While you were not meant to be with Kang Ju's grandfather,

253
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,920
many years later,

254
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,110
our Kang Ju and your granddaughter were able to meet.

255
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,260
I believe it's fate.

256
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,660
It's a precious meeting made by the heavens.

257
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,500
That is what I'll choose to believe.

258
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:55,970
After waiting 100 years, this is my bride who will carry on the family name.

259
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,030
Mom?

260
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,790
The guest we've been waiting for is here.

261
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:05,630
It's me, Doo Rim.

262
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,520
Yes, it's me Doo Rim.

263
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,630
- Can you recognize me? 
 - Doo Rim.

264
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,660
Yes, it's me.

265
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:37,900
Why did you just come now?

266
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,030
I waited so long for you.

267
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:49,830
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

268
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,200
Will you be able to forgive me?

269
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:38,000
Kang Ju and I picked this out because we thought it would look good on you.

270
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,710
It's all done, Father.

271
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,650
How does it look?

272
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,130
You look so handsome. Like a gentle Englishman.

273
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,350
Thanks.

274
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:59,930
Mother, Father is all ready.

275
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,470
You two look really, really good together.

276
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,550
The best couple award will go to the both of you.

277
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:10,900
- After dinner, we'll be staying at the villa for the night.
 - Yes.

278
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,720
Father, have a good time.

279
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,610
Now, shall we go?

280
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,190
Okay. We'll be on our way.

281
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,500
You don't need to come out.

282
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,660
- Travel safely! 
 - Okay.

283
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:39,680

284
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,020

 Among the ways to treat that,

285
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,950
is to eliminate the biological cause of the problem. But that's ...

286

Oppa, look. My ugly hands became so silky.

292
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,940
But wasn't that too much?

293
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,070
I'm making a lot of money. The company is doing well lately.

294

Thank you Oppa.

295
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,060
No need to thank me. I'm the one who should be thankful since you returned.

296
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,680
Let's go.

297
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,970
Grandma, go inside and rest. I'll do the rest.

298
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:53,390
- Then work hard. 
 - Have a good night.

299
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,880
Oh, Sae Jin.

300
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,750
Jin Ju, let's talk ...

301
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,370
for a moment.

302
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,170
What is it? Did something happen at home?

303
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,950
No, it's not that.

304
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:29,710
Is this a bee farm? Why are you shaking so much?

305
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,950
- There's something in there, isn't there? 
 - What? No.

306
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:42,710
- Let me see. 
 - Jin Ju, hold on ...

307
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:58,960
I've been carrying it around in my pocket for over a month.

308
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,800
To give it to me?

309
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,720
Yes.

310
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,940
What are you doing? Hurry up and put it on me.

311
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,630
Ah, yes, okay.

312
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:24,330
- Jin Ju. 
 - Oh, it's so pretty.

313
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,330
I had no idea such a day would come in Jin Ju's life.

314
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,350
Oh yeah!

315
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:41,830
I spent all night preparing cool things to say, but I didn't get a chance to say any of it.

316
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,270
It's still amazing even without you saying anything.

317
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:51,470
Today is the happiest day of my life.

318
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,000
Oh yeah!

319
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,980
Aigoo, why don't you go in and rest.

320
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,380
You been up since dawn and working non-stop.

321
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,860
You'll get sick if you're not careful.

322
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,810
Today is a special day.

323
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,900
I want to prepare the table for the memorial ceremony myself.

324
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,190
Sure, do that then.

325
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:26,960
Where should I put these?

326
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,680
Wow, this is awesome.

327
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,660
Kang In, you're home?

328
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,570
Wow, you have a kid now?

329
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,240
The great Choi Kang Ju?

330
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,970
Na Doo Rim has me around her finger these days.

331
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,550
So cute.

332
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,090
Sister-in-law, when Kang Rim get older, he's going to break a lot of hearts.

333
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,970
Don't worry. He's only going to have one girl in his heart.

334
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,220
Because he's like me.

335
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:11,240
But who's memorial is today?

336
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,980
- You came all the way here and you don't know? It's our great-great grandfather's memorial. 
 - Great ...

337
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,320
And there's one other person.

338
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,200
The one who kept this family line going.

339
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,950
It's the first time we're preparing a memorial table for her.

340
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,530
I feel like we solved a huge homework problem.

341
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,780
I feel a lot better.

342
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:28,960
If it wasn't for that person, you might not have been born in this world.

343
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,140
Then we might not have met.

344
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:39,920
I hope the person who sent you into this world will also be at peace.

345
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,720
Oh, I'm curious about something.

346
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,080
- What? 
 - Remember what I asked you at the villa?

347
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,330
When did your heart started racing after meeting me?

348
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,290
- When was it? 
 - You want to know that bad?

349
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:00,400
Yes, I'm curious. Tell me.

350
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,510
Well, it was ...

351
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,970
The day of the family meeting.

352
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,990
 Mom!

353
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,600
The day we kissed when you fell in front of the restaurant while holding my tie.

354
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,310
Really?

355
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:34,760
Then, what about the kiss during Kang In's showcase?

356
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,680
That wasn't an act.

357
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,670
It just looked that way.

358
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

359
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:03,980
My heart still flutters whenever I see you.

360
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:14,210
Of course, once you fall for my charm, there's no backing out.

361
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:17,230
Who am I?

362
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,600
Yes. Choi Kang Ju.

363
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:29,530
When I see you, my heart flutters too.

364
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,260
Ah, this is so hard.

365
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,930
Indeed, it's hard.

366
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:11,010
Oh my back. My back. Oh this feel good.

367
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,930
Welcome.

368
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:32,200
It's been so long. I'm about to cry.

369
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,360
This is the first I've seen you smile.

370
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,180
Did something good happen?

371
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:44,560
I finally ... was able to eat at my memorial table.

372
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,810
She did a great job. She put in a lot of care.

373
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:51,700
Congratulations. Congratulations.

374
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:57,550
But ... there is ...

375
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:01,100
one thing I am curious about.

376
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,750
Those two girls.

377
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:10,740
They're not related at all so how can they look exactly the same?

378
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:17,770
No matter how much I think about it, I can't figure out this mystery.

379
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:20,370
Perhaps ...

380
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,540
Oh, my Doo Rim.

381
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:30,590
Doo Rim.

382
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:33,150
You're so pretty.

383
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,830
Oh my baby is so pretty.

384
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:40,130
Yi Gyeong, it's mommy.

385
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:45,880
Do you recognize me? You're so pretty.

386
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,030
Those two are no longer the sun and shadow.

387
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:29,030
They will become their own ray of sunlight,

388
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:33,310
- and travel down their own paths. 
 - Then ...

389
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:38,920
since you resolved all of your grudges,

390
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,940
will you be leaving this place forever?

391
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:46,820
- Do you want me to leave? 
 - No, not at all.

392
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:52,060
I know what you want. Your business is not doing well so you want me to stay here.

393
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:58,550
Although I want you to stay ...

394
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:05,650
will you be leaving forever?

395
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,820
When you meet, you must bid farewell.

396
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,200
Once you bid farewell, you are bound to meet again.

397
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,550
That's how the world works.

398
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,070
That's so depressing.

399
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:48,000
Aigoo. If I want to eat and live, all I can do is study.

400
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,190
Where is Kang Rim's mother?

401
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:08,910
She was just here. Did she go somewhere?

402
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:14,160
To learn everything from you, she even brought out all the tea cups.

403
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,450
Alright, godori  (T.N. "five birds" set of cards worth 5 points) .

404
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:34,620
Why aren't you giving me a pi card  (T.N. junk card that helps make up a set for high points) ?

405
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:39,130
- Why did you lay that card down? 
 - And I asked you to lay down the cards I needed.

406
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:42,610
- Father, you ... 
 - What are you all doing here?

407
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,290
And you wanted to learn tea ceremony rituals.

408
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:49,680
- I'm sorry, Mother-in-law. 
 - Really.

409
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,440
Kang Ju asked me to play.

410
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,740
- Kang Ju, you... 
 - When did I? You wanted to teach--

411
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,270
First, Alkkagi and now Go-Stop?

412
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:03,770
Honey, you should try. It's fun.

413
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,600
- Did you lose all that? 
 - You know I'm not good at these things.

414
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,070
Jeez.

415
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:15,220
You, deal the cards.

416
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,130
Mother, you know how to play Go-Stop?

417
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:24,970
Is there anything I can't do? Aside from stealing, I'm good at everything.

418
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:29,440
What are you doing? Deal the cards. Don't cry after you lose all your money.

419
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,480
Kang Ju, hand it over. I'll deal.

420
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:39,440
- That is  ... 
 - Watch me carefully. You lost everything.

421
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,640
Aren't you embarrassed in front of the kids. Watch me carefully.

422
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:08,410
You did well.

423
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:13,040
I have a long way to go to follow in your footsteps.

424
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:21,090
Mother, I have something to tell you.

425
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:26,820
I thought it would be nice to send Mr. Jang and Ahjumma on vacation.

426
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:32,660
Ahjumma seems to miss her married daughter a lot.

427
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:37,160
That's true. I didn't think about that.

428
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,800
Let's do that.

429
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,870
Thank you, Mother.

430
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:03,350
It's the key to the annex. From now on, you should be the one to take care of it.

431
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:08,000
It means you are the new lady of the household now.

432
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,490
No, Mother. I still have a lot to learn.

433
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:14,370
Just watching you take care of each and every person who works for you

434
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,700
I'm confident you'll do well.

435
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,560
Your grace is not like many others, so I know

436
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,410
you will take care of this household well in your own way.

437
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:31,520
Yes. I'll make sure to learn well from you so you will not be disappointed.

438
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,880
Have you seen Kang Rim?

439
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,350
He was playing in his room  nicely earlier.

440
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,710
Did he come by here?

441
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:45,830
That little rascal. Did he go there again?

442
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:51,260
The annex?

443
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:58,050
My goodness, I don't know how he can  behave exactly like the Young Master.

444
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:40,380
Kang Ju. It must really be Spring now.

445
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,540
I guess so.

446
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:47,270
Oh, let's plant a few flowering trees.

447
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:50,420
I want to plant a tree in Kang Rim's name.

448
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,070
So that he can grow big and strong like the tree.

449
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:00,900
Why are you looking at me like that?

450
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:09,380
You're not very good at shoveling.

451
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:18,140
I can learn. It's only shoveling.

452
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:23,410
It's more than just a grave for a cat. It's a tree.

453
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,410
We should just hire someone.

454
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:28,770
No. It's Kang Rim's tree so I need to be the one to plant it.

455
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,600
Absolutely not. No.

456
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,580
Okay. I'll make sure Kang Rim knows.

457
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,410
His dad planted this himself.

458
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,760
But where should we plant it?

459
00:58:55,250 --> 00:59:00,040
Right about here seems good.

460
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,640
Kang Ju. Look over there.

461
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,660
The flowers are already blooming.

462
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,730
You're right.

463
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:17,380
This is nice.

464
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,900
Let's find a place for the tree.

465
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:35,130

466
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:40,150
 Thank you to Channel Manager klore6

467
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:44,980

468
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:50,150
 Thanks to segmenters, cont.: c_scott, sylbi_18_751, klore6, dudie,

469
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:55,120
 Thanks to segmenters, cont.:  josselinelino, miss_rochester, and silentabyss203_410

470
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:00,110
