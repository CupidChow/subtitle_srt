1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,600
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,840
There is no cause without a consequence.

3
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,520
Until you are punished by  heaven, you cannot escape what you've done.

4
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,950
Na Doo Rim! Na Doo Rim! Wake up, Na Doo Rim.

5
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,210
Na Doo Rim! Wake up, Na Doo Rim!

6
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,530
Wake up!

7
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,660
Na Doo Rim!

8
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,010
Kang Ju...

9
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,040
It'll be okay.

10
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,010
 There is no cause without a consequence.

11
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,850
 Until you are punished by the heaven, you cannot escape what you've done.

12
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,350
100 years ago and now,

13
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,570
I only did what I had to do.

14
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,380
All human being commit sins.

15
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,340
There's no way to live otherwise.

16
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,260
I have no choice but to sin so that I can survive.

17
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,810
Right now, you probably don't want to listen to anyone,

18
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,140
nor say anything at all.

19
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,600
I think that's why you've closed your mouth and heart from the world.

20
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,750
I'm sorry, Yi Gyeong.

21
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,270
Your heart was getting hurt and bruised.

22
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,180
And I'm really sorry I couldn't be there for you.

23
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,540
I will be by your side now.

24
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,220
Even if people say otherwise, I will be on your side.

25
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:15,120

26
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,480
- Mother. 
 - Yi Hyeon, you haven't had dinner yet.

27
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,330
Come and eat.

28
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,920
- But it's not time for dinner ... 
 - Eat up.

29
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Just because Yi Gyeong is in that condition, doesn't mean we have to starve and lose sleep.

30
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,870
During times like this, we have to be more alert.

31
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,170
Do I have a baby inside of me? I eat and I eat but I'm still hungry.

32
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,890
I'm hungry to death!

33
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:08,030
The people who made my Yi Gyeong that way ... I'm going to bury them forever.

34
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:15,370
I'm going to make them rot in the darkness for the rest of their lives.

35
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,940
 Na Doo Rim Accepted Money to Act as Fake Jang Yi Gyeong  
It seems like Yi Gyeong's mother spread this to the media.

36
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,650
The company website was being flooded with so many  negative comments that we had to shut it down.

37
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,430
Even if we publish a statement, it's useless.

38
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,300
It's a witch hunt.

39
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,710
- Call a press conference immediately. 
 - The timing isn't good.

40
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:56,180
The media is already sympathetic towards Jang Yi Gyeong, who attempted suicide and now has aphasia.

41
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,260
To be frank, do you think people will believe it?

42
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,650
People will just see it as an attempt to cover up the truth.

43
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,730
Where do you think this is?

44
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,510
Leave right now.

45
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,690
I just want to see Yi Gyeong for a moment and then I'll leave.

46
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,110
My Yi Gyeong may be alive but she's not living.

47
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,200
She's no different than a living statue that can't speak.

48
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,270
What are you going to do after seeing her?

49
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,450
Be honest with me.

50
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,900
You're not here because you're concerned for Yi Gyeong. You're here for Na Doo Rim, aren't you?

51
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,270
What do you want?

52
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,810
If I take down the news articles and keep quiet, what will you do for me?

53
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,940
Will funding for Ohsung Construction be enough?

54
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,720
Even if you gave us all of Taeyang Group, it wouldn't be enough.

55
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,230
I stood by and watched Yi Gyeong go through hell and back.

56
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,320
I did it so the people who made Yi Gyeong that way will never forget.

57
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,370
I will tear down your family even if that means following you all to hell or haunting you as an evil spirit.

58
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,720
I'd better leave for today. I'll come visit you another day.

59
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,950
Mother.

60
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:58,150
Yi  Hyeon, don't you dare try and help Na Doo Rim.

61
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,960
If you do, you'll be killing Yi Gyeong twice.

62
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,450
If you don't plan on cutting yourself off from us forever, just stay put.  Do you understand?

63
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,540
What do I do?

64
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,530
What do I do...

65
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,730
Hey, do you know how expensive that is?

66
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,400
- Is it expensive? 
 - Of course, it is expensive.

67
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,980
How much?

68
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,770
50,000 won  (approximately $42 US dollars)

69
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,920
500,000?

70
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,560
5,000,000?

71
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,480
Seriously? How can it be so ... What do I do?

72
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,740
It's an antique from China that dates back to the Qing Dynasty.

73
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,350
Obviously it's expensive.

74
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,070
Oh, what do I do? It's not like I can glue it back together.

75
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,580
Sit down.

76
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,460
What are you going to repay me with?

77
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,360
You're right, what do I do?

78
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,750
Is now really the right time?

79
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,600
Then compensate me with money.

80
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,580
But you don't have any money so this is the least expensive way.

81
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,520
- Again. 
 - Why?

82
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,100
You didn't do it with feeling.  With feeing.

83
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,040
What are you talking about?

84
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,640
If you don't ...

85
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,590
Oh, you stupid dummy.

86
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,270
- Why did you hit me? 
 - I don't know if you're just foolish or innocent.

87
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,670
"In commemoration of Taeyang Department Store's 50th Anniversary. "

88
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,470
What? Qing Dynasty?

89
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,640
What did I do? You're the idiot who was fooled.

90
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,150
Seriously, you ...

91
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,010
Mother is waiting, let's go.

92
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,110
As soon as I mention my mother, you become ice.

93
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,460
Truthfully, I'm a little afraid of what she'll say.

94
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,660
- Let's go quickly. 
-  Let me clean this up first.

95
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:49,260
According to what people are saying, it seems like we're inviting a con artist to be part of our family.

96
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,560
You are aware that everyone is talking about our family and we're becoming a national joke.

97
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,350
You know very well that's not true, Mother.

98
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,840
Regardless of what others say about you,

99
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,730
I ... still don't think I could accept you as my daughter-in-law.

100
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,660
- I will work hard, Mother.  
 - There's no need for that.

101
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,860
You don't have to think about getting my permission.

102
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:23,070
I...am planning on leaving this house.

103
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,470
I feel like everything is my fault.

104
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,460
Both Yi Gyeong and Mother.

105
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,310
Everything.

106
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,510
It's not your fault. Don't think that.

107
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:51,600
If Mother leaves this house, I also won't be able to come in.

108
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,640
How can I enter if Mother won't even be here?

109
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,000
Whatever they choose to do, it's up to my parents to resolve.

110
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,190
For now, we just need to quietly let them figure it out.

111
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,630
People are boycotting the department store through internet portal sites.

112
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,060
Revenue keeps dropping and the store owners are protesting.

113
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,830
If we can't come up with a realistic solution, the situation will only get worse.

114
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,730
Na Doo Rim.

115
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:06,550
This is really good. You wouldn't know if someone died in front of you.

116
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,900
Here.

117
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,160
Choi Kang Ju is really doing all kinds of things.

118
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,230
Your grace is immeasureable, Your Majesty.

119
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,120
It will pass soon.

120
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,850
All the talking everyone is doing.

121
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,490
Like a boiling pot of water, it will all settle down after some time.

122
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:59,010
Mother may also be like that now. But she'll have a change of heart soon.

123
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:06,720
So, don't start thinking of weird things again?

124
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,510
What weird things?

125
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,180
You might disappear again.

126
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,350
You might disappear right in front of my eyes.

127
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,420
Where will I even go?

128
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:25,180
You're like oxygen to me.

129
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,580
How can I live without oxygen?

130
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,600
This is really good.

131
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,080
Is this ... childish?  (T.N. Purposely mispronounces kkingkkang or kumquat as ttaengkang or childish tantrum.)

132
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,730
Get rid of all this.

133
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,710
- Sorry?  
 - Now!

134
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,320
Yes ma'am.

135
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,800
What are you doing right now?

136
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,540
What? You wanted to get rid of this place too.

137
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,170
I wanted to do it with my own hands before I left.

138
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,130
- You really ... 
 - Did you not take me seriously?

139
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,200
My decision has not changed.

140
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,370
Your decision is very much like you.

141
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:55,610
You want things perfect and flawless.

142
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,990
If that's what you want to do, then go ahead.

143
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,420
There's nothing I've done for you.

144
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:20,430
This is all I can do. I'm sorry.

145
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,250
Madam. How can you leave like this?

146
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,810
You can't go.

147
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,530
Why are you like this, Mother? Don't do this, please.

148
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:02,250
Once I leave, bring that girl into this home.

149
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,330
I hate this house and I hate her too. I hate it all.

150
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,680
Why do you keep pushing her away?

151
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,050
- Is it because of her family, education, or social status? 
 - No.

152
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:19,140
Every time I see her, I'm reminded of how foolish I was for believing in this family's curse.

153
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,420
It's too hard.

154
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:27,400
Every time I try to forget, I see that girl ...

155
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,070
That girl may even have a curse on her.

156
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,770
Because of her, everyone became unhappy.

157
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,510
Please take care of the Chairman and Kang Ju.

158
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,500
- Madam. 
 - Madam.

159
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,550
- Na Doo Rim, is it true you made a deal in exchange for money? 
 - Wasn't this restaurant a part of that deal?

160
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,950
Is it true you were the first one to propose the deal? Please tell us.

161
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,140
You con artist. Do you have nothing better to do than steal other people's men?

162
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,310
You're a shameless gold-digger.

163
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,100
What? Gold-digger? Con Artist? Watch what you say.

164
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,670
She is a con artist. You con artists, leave this neighborhood immediately.

165
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:32,560
Leave now! Get out!

166
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,970
What is this?

167
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,550
Everyone, please leave.

168
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,280
If anyone messes with that woman ...

169
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,400
I will not stand for it.

170
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,410
- What? 
 - What is he saying?

171
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,870
Unbelievable.

172
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,850
How about you close your restaurant and go somewhere else for the time being?

173
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,360
I don't want to. I'm not going to avoid it.

174
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,520
If I avoid it, the misunderstanding will get even bigger.

175
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,880
You saw what happened before too.

176
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,070
They're not going to stop here.

177
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,330
Just do as I say.

178
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,190
Yi Gyeong, Doo Rim is here.

179
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,040
 You should never have been born.

180
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,120
 Die!

181
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,410
 I...am planning to leave this house.

182
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,520
 How dare you take another woman's man?

183
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,630
 You're shameless. You just wanted the money.

184
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,780
I never asked for much in my life.

185
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,750
And I never wanted something that wasn't mine.

186
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:54,120
For the first time ... just one person ...

187
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:02,020
I just wanted to stay beside that person. Why am I not allowed?

188
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,730
You resent the world, don't you?

189
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,840
You probably do.

190
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,600
Those people who do not realize your sincerity,

191
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,150
resent and hate them. Just like how I did.

192
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:33,270
One person is the sun and the other is the shadow.

193
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,990
If you stay with that person,

194
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:42,010
that other child will remain forever in her room, silent with her back turned against the world.

195
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:46,610
Just like me, who died silently without so much as a scream.

196
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,990
If you love him, don't think about anyone else's unhappiness.

197
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:03,860
Fulfill your heart's desires and have the person you want.

198
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,930
Grandma, don't you want to see the ocean?

199
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:39,300
Why? Do you want to see the ocean?

200
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,980
I miss the smell of the ocean, and I miss Mom and Dad.

201
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:59,630
I think I was more at peace when it was just you and me living in Namhae.

202
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,990
Eating roasted sweet potatoes,

203
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,740
and watching your favorite dramas.

204
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,760
Grandma,

205
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,600
should we ... go live near the ocean?

206
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:40,240
Can you ... forget him?

207
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,400
No.

208
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:52,030
I don't think I can go on without him.

209
00:26:53,570 --> 00:27:00,820
But ... if I'm making other people unhappy,

210
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,430
I can't find my happiness.

211
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,810
What do I do?

212
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,100
Grandma, what should I do?

213
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,710
You look tired.

214
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,030
Don't worry about me.

215
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:57,050
I'm more worried about you.

216
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,270
Father,

217
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,010
I don't know if I can say this to you.

218
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,170
Don't worry about it and tell me.

219
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,420
Kang Ju was that type of person to me at the start.

220
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,000
I couldn't go to him, and could only watch him from afar.

221
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,400
That hurt a lot and was painful.

222
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,680
That's how Mother lived all her life.

223
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:49,170
It would be good if you and Mother could reconcile.

224
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,400
You should make a space for her to return.

225
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,100
Young Master should be home soon. Why don't you wait to see him?

226
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,560
That's okay. I have some place I have to be.

227
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,830
Then ...

228
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,320
Ahjussi, goodbye.

229
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,360
Please stay healthy.

230
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,540
Yes, go safely.

231
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,390
That's strange.

232
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,370
She's acting like someone leaving to go far away.

233
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,740
I heard you stopped by the house.

234
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,540
What am I doing? I'm talking to you.

235
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,380
While thinking of you.

236
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,880
 Why aren't you saying anything?

237
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,730
Are you so touched that you're speechless?

238
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:15,060
 I even called you even though I'm exhausted from work.

239
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,640
-  Your grace is immeasureable, Your Majesty. 
 - That's it?

240
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,860
Sing me a song. There's the one you're always singing.

241
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,530
How is Mother?

242
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,460
 You said she was at your aunt's place.

243
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,240
I went yesterday, she's well.

244
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,940
 Let's go visit Mother this weekend.

245
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,280
I doubt she'll kick us out.

246
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,330
Okay. If she does, we'll go see her again.

247
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,980
Again and again.

248
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,910
That sounds like Na Do Rim.

249
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,690
Go to sleep soon. You must be tired.

250
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,060
Hey, who told you, you could hang up?

251
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,630
I didn't give you permission.

252
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,120
I told you to sing a song.

253
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,850
Sing me a song.

254
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:26,340
♫ The rain's wind is hitting the sea ♫

255
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:33,160
♫ When things calm down ♫

256
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:39,870
♫  I wonder if you will come   ♫

257
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,210
♫  Crossing over the sea  ♫

258
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:49,740
♫  Sparking in the night sky  ♫

259
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,610
♫  All the stars in the sky are lovely  ♫

260
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:01,520
♫  Your loving gaze  ♫

261
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:07,010
♫ Is even more beautiful ♫

262
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:17,810
♫  Only for you. I will wait.  ♫

263
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:28,740
♫  Forever for my love, I will wait  ♫

264
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:39,650
♫ Only for you, I will wait ♫

265
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:51,210
♫ Forever for my love, I will wait ♫

266
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,370
 Kang Ju, my Kang Ju.

267
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:27,730
 I hope you will not be too sad.

268
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,400
 Because our love has not ended.

269
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,980
 Even if your longing becomes unbearable, please endure.

270
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,970
 So that I can protect you.

271
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,030
 I'm not trying to run away.

272
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:53,630
 In a place where no one can find me,

273
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,690
 I want to love you even more.

274
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:05,500
 To Kang Ju, and all the people who loved me,

275
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,950
 I love you...

276
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,890
 Goodbye.

277
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:39,910
 By now, I'll be leaving Seoul with grandma.

278
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:48,470
 After I leave, will everything be back in its rightful place?

279
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:52,770
 I'm sorry, but I'm not thankful to you at all.

280
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,180
 If it weren't for you, this wedding would have been broken off a long time ago.

281
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:03,590
 Based on what happens, we both may become Choi Kang Ju's bride.

282
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:09,500
 One in death, and the other in life.

283
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,940
 What is Choi Kang Ju to you?

284
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,380
 Is he so important you would risk your life?

285
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,790
 Her name is ...

286
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,850
 Na Doo Rim.

287
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,710
 Na Doo Rim.

288
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:38,670
 Rather than anger and resentment,

289
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,990
 I hope my absence can be filled with happiness and laughter.

290
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,160
 I hope you can put down all the anger and despair in your heart,

291
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,710
 and find peace.

292
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,670
 I genuinely hope you get better both physically and emotionally so that you can be at peace.

293
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,210
Yi Gyeong, what's wrong? Are you hurt?

294
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,940
Mom ...

295
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,610
Yi Gyeong, can you speak now?

296
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,020
Can you hear me?

297
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,730
Mom ...

298
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,360
Why did you do it?

299
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,890
What?

300
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,170
Na Doo Rim didn't do anything wrong.

301
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,180
We did.

302
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:27,530
- Yi Gyeong. 
 - Mom, exactly how far are you going to go?

303
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,970
Stop it now.

304
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:36,000
You thought that my feelings would change if that girl disappeared? No!

305
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,170
Have you gone crazy?

306
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,610
You're the one who's gone crazy, not me!

307
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,820
I didn't want to say or listen to anything,

308
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,100
so I closed my ears and mouth to think.

309
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:56,080
And then I realized what you and I have been doing.

310
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,060
Something no person should ever do.

311
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:05,450
You, how could you say that to your mom?

312
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:10,470
- Who did I do all of this for? 
 - Don't say it was for me.

313
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,200
You know very well, Mom.

314
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,520
You only needed me to fulfill your own ambitions.

315
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,650
You, you aren't Yi Gyeong.

316
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,920
No, no.

317
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,890
You're not Yi Gyeong. No, no.

318
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,990
Mom!

319
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,020
Yi Gyeong, Yi Gyeong.

320
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,520
What did I do to you?

321
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,060
Mom.

322
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,140
Don't come closer. Don't come closer!

323
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,510
Mom.

324
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,930
Yi Gyeong.

325
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:08,110
Don't come. Don't come. I don't know what I'll do.

326
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:14,710
Don't come, don't come, don't come!

327
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,440
Mom.

328
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:25,640
- Mom, it's me, Yi Gyeong. Yi Gyeong.
 - No, no, no.

329
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,630
Mom. It's me, Yi Gyeong.

330
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:38,640
We searched all over Namhae but were unable to find her.

331
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,330
We also checked all the places Oh Jin Ju told us about.

332
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,980
You should leave.

333
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:13,700
Na Doo Rim. Where exactly did she go?

334
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:26,510
Mom, just have one spoonful.

335
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:36,040
Who's your mom? Where's my daughter Yi Gyeong?

336
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,310
- Yi Gyeong? Yi Gyeong? 
 - Mother.

337
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,800
Yi Hyeon, where's Yi Gyeong?

338
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,000
Find Yi Gyeong for me. I miss Yi Gyeong.

339
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,350
Mom, I'm right here.

340
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:57,340
I'm your daughter, Yi Gyeong.

341
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,460
Yi Gyeong. Where did you go?

342
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,360
I searched for you for so long.

343
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:17,870
Mom. I know right now you're in the prison you created for yourself.

344
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,450
I will protect you.

345
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,740
Mom, you can get through this.

346
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,210
Mom.

347
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,590
 Don't smile.

348
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,640
 I hate you for leaving me.

349
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,740
 And I hate the world that made you leave.

350
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:51,790
 If you were going to leave, why did you come to me?

351
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:55,670
 If everything stopped right now,

352
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:03,490
 this painful time ... my bleeding heart ... all of it ...

353
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,490
Please ... not her.

354
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:20,310
 I wasn't sure why I was brought into this world.

355
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:24,390
 I figured it out after she left.

356
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:30,870
 It was to meet one person, that person.

357
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:37,600
 Even if that means living far apart and longing for each other.

358
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,200
 I'm sure love can wait for long time.

359
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:48,030
 Even if we're far apart, we'll always be together.

360
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,160
 I ... understand your feelings.

361
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,700
 I can tell just by looking at your eyes.

362
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:24,960
 They're like the full moon, filled with love and longing.

363
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:34,790
 Why can't people understand even if you don't say anything?

364
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,900
 I can tell just by looking into someone's eyes.

365
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:43,670
 How can my Lord not know your feelings?

366
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,940
 When he returns from Donggyeong, I will tell him for you.

367
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:01,040
 How much you've waited for him and loved him.

368
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:23,910
 Unni, the baby is kicking.

369
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,380
 No!

370
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,980
 Mom!

371
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,500
 Boon Yi, thank you.

372
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,830
 For protecting my child, thank you.

373
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:13,250
 What I can't repay you in this life,

374
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,390
I will repay in the next life.

375
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,550
This isn't the end. It's just the beginning.

376
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,790
 Bride of the Century
