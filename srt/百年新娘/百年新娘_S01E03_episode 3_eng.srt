1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,780
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,990
Welcome, my Lady.

3
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,510
Hello!

4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,410
Alright.

5
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,470
Chaebol houses really are different. It's practically a palace.

6
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,970
- Let's go, my Lady. 
 - Ah, yes.

7
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,480
This is a list of information on Kang Ju. If you're going to manage Kang Ju like a shadow.

8
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,010
Then won't you need to know him well?

9
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,890
Foods that he likes, foods that he dislikes. And not just his taste preferences,

10
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,260
but also fashion brands he likes and the cosmetics and fragrances that he uses as well.

11
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:52,280
Every little thing is organized, so it should help you.

12
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,870
Yes.

13
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,140
And this contains our family's scheduled official events and meetings.

14
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,500
This will be your responsibility once you become aTaeyang Group's daughter-in-law.

15
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,800
- Yes. 
 - I won't say much, but our Kang Ju will accomplish big things.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,190
His wife has to do well for things in and out of the home to go well.

17
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,540
What happened at the inauguration can never happen again.

18
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,760
Be careful of every word and move you make, so that you won't be the object of other people's gossip.

19
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,490
Do you understand?

20
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:39,230
Yes. I'll try my best to meet your expectations, Mother.

21
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,940
Leave after eating dinner. Kang Ju is supposed to come home early today anyway.

22
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,560
Head to Kang Ju's room. You'll be called when it's ready.

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,330
Yes.

24
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,650
This place is like a gym.

25
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,900
♫  I like very much your expression when you're looking at me  ♫

26
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,170
Oh! What is all this?

27
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,280
Wow. Oh my, oh my.

28
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,310
Wow. Woah.

29
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:34,520
♫  I love you love you my heart which can't stop shaking  ♫

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,870
 I need you need you even if a long time passes

31
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,570
Choi Kang Ju.

32
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,010
♫  You are the person who makes me dream.  ♫

33
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,390
So cool.

34
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,520
♫  Baby,  sweet my girl, ‘cause you're my girl  ♫

35
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,440
♫  Will you be with me? Will you accept me?  ♫

36
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,760
♫  Sweet my girl, ‘cause you're my girl  ♫

37
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,650
♫  You are the only one I love.  It's just you.    ♫

38
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,250
What's with you? Are you always like this?

39
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,420
In front of other people, you pretend to be calm, elegant, and collected.

40
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:55,740
Once you're by yourself, you do all sorts of strange things.

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,270
It's me. I understand. I'll look over it and send it over via email.

42
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,350
You did all sorts of things when you were alone.

43
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,900
Is this an act, too?

44
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,140
Change your clothes and come out. I'll head down first.

45
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,120
You said you wanted to know about me.

46
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't you want to know about my body?

47
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,230
If you even touch a hair on my body, I won't let you off easily.

48
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,840
What are you doing now?

49
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,670
Kang Ju, listen to me carefully.

50
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,230
Just because we're engaged, doesn't mean that we're married yet.

51
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,380
We're not in our adolescence here either, so you should know better.

52
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,250
Though they say a baby in the womb is considered a basic dowry these days.

53
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,210
I think that certain things need to be protected.

54
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,330
So before we get married, don't even dream about it. Got it?

55
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,600
That son of a gun looks completely normal but is a complete pervert.

56
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,640
 Great grandmother's memorial, etc.

57
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,760
What do you mean his grandfather's death anniversary?

58
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,980
Choi Kang Ju's grandfather is Taeyang Group's founder.

59
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,030
The entire extended family and also Taeyang Group's senior staff, all attend the memorial.

60
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,610
It's one of the most formidable events of the year for the entire Taeyang Group.

61
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,960
Of course the future daughter-in-law should attend.

62
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,100
This is too difficult, I can't do it! It's different from what we promised.

63
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,360
At first you said that all I had to do was successfully get past the marriage meetings.

64
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,910
But now the memorial service, and the many events and meetings that come along with it?

65
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,670
- Are you telling me to do all of this? 
 - You said you wanted a shop under your name?

66
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,000
What if I offered to help you open up a shop?

67
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,180
The shop isn't the problem right now.

68
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,660
What?

69
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,340
I'll go. You said it was this weekend, right?

70
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,070
When it comes to memorials. I've attended both my mother's and father's so,

71
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,700
I'm good at frying round fritters. And if I put my hair down and mourn, I can do that too.

72
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,960
Because I know what it's like.

73
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,900
These are our great-uncles and great-aunt. Say your greetings.

74
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,400
Greet them.

75
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,810
Aunt. Accept her greeting.

76
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,030
Aunt. Aunt!

77
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,790
Aunt. Greetings, greetings.

78
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,930
You wench!

79
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,480
Where do you think you are?

80
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,850
Even if you fool a ghost, you can't fool me.

81
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,410
Oh, Aunt, why are you being like this again? Calm down, please.

82
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,450
This isn't Kang Ju's fiancée!

83
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,520
You need to leave. Kick her out immediately!

84
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,940
Leave now! You cunning wench!

85
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,520
- Aunt, Aunt!! 
 - She isn't Kang Ju's fiancée!

86
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,380
You must have made up your mind.

87
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,430
You don't have the brains or skills, so are you just going to use your body?

88
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,670
 Who is this woman? Is she Choi Kang Ju's relative?

89
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,680
 What do I do? I don't remember her.

90
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,970
Fine. Use your entire body to protect your position.

91
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:52,070
I didn't think you would back off easily. That wouldn't be fun, now would it?

92
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,480
Ru Mi, when did you get here?

93
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,640
Mother, hello. I just arrived with Kang Ju.

94
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,530
Why did you come when you're busy?

95
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,450
I had to come, it's Grandfather’s day of passing. He adored me so much when he was alive.

96
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,390
Mother, is there anything I can help with?

97
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,860
Help with what? I'm just thankful for your presence. Hurry and come inside. Let's have some tea.

98
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,900
Yes.

99
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,900
Ru Mi?

100
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,720
Lee Ru Mi. Taeyang Department Store''s Strategy Planning Team Leader.

101
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,570
A Hanguk University graduate with honors and her father is the Prosecutor General.

102
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,530
Jang Yi Gyeong's best friend?

103
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,200
What kind of best friend speaks to you like that?

104
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,690
What are you doing right now?

105
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,550
Can't you see? I'm working.

106
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:10,350
Isn't eating, putting on makeup, and shopping the only things you can do with your hands?

107
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,190
Isn't this also an act? Just keep on pretending.

108
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,250
I feel this whenever I see you, but it's so surprising.

109
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,950
How is it that you always talk in a way to make people lose affection for you?

110
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,770
Even if I try, you shut it off before I can.

111
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,930
You have a shocking talent to freeze any affection I might have for you.

112
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,800
What?

113
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,450
Oh my.

114
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,650
I'll leave the chives here.

115
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,220
Let's see.

116
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,830
Oh jeez.

117
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,800
- Hand that to me. 
 - What? To you?

118
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,820
Yes.

119
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,880
With fish, you open up the gill.

120
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,070
Then, between the back and belly, stick the knife in right in the center.

121
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,270
You need to cut it deep for the blood to drain properly. You're going to use the meat for pancakes, right?

122
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:28,520
Oh my world. Where did you learn all of this?

123
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,400
At a restaurant, for over ten years ...

124
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,400
They've been teaching this in cooking classes recently.

125
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,230
Ah, that's what it was.

126
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,550
Oh my, are you alright? Let me do all the hard stuff.

127
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,950
Really, she's so approachable and works so well.

128
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,520
She doesn't seem like all those other ladies.

129
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,400
Right? And I had thought she was a naive princess whose fingers never touched a drop of water.

130
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,910
That's right.

131
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,440
Oh my. They say it's still better to be alive even if you're rolling around in dog crap.

132
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,110
Only the deceased should be pitied.

133
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,410
Now that I see it, I do think it's true that the heavens decide who is Taeyang Group's daughter-in-law.

134
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,370
No one knows if the heavens or a human is manipulating all of this.

135
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,260
After the CEO's first bride died, there was so much talk.

136
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,690
There were all sorts of rumors going around.

137
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:36,280
After going on their honeymoon, she died in a hit-and-run accident. And they couldn't even find the culprit.

138
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,980
Oh my, then are the rumors true? That the ladies—

139
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,050
Speak softly. What if someone hears?

140
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,830
What kind of entertaining stories are you all telling?

141
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,430
Oh my, you surprised me.

142
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,210
I can't help my curiosity. What are you all saying?

143
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,120
Is there someone other than the grandfather who passed?

144
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,470
What are you doing?

145
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,820
Are you all in your right mind? You're preparing food for the deceased.

146
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,490
How dare you run your mouths and invite bad energy?

147
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,660
We're so sorry, Madame.

148
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,730
You shouldn't have conversations with people beneath you.

149
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,360
You'll have to supervise them in the future. Do you want to look easy to them?

150
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:33,070
If you look easy now, it'll be difficult to order them around in the future. Do you understand?

151
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,580
Yes, Mother.

152
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:05,920
This wench. Where have you been? My legs hurt. Carry me.

153
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,770
Aunt, you shouldn't be like this.

154
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,040
Carry me, you wench. Hurry!

155
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,110
Aunt, I will carry you.

156
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,140
Not you, you jerk.

157
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,970
- Mister, are you okay? 
 - Honey, are you okay?

158
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,440
Oh my back. Oh my back!

159
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,440
How can a man injure his back, of all places!

160
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,380
Oh jeez!

161
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,470
- Grandmother, I'll carry you. 
 - How will you?

162
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,460
It'll be alright, Mother.

163
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,730
Are you alright?

164
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,900
Oh, my Lady.

165
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,200
Oh, you should be careful.

166
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,990
How is it grandmother? It must feel nice. Does it?

167
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,740
Oh my. Oh, what are we going to do?

168
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,050
Oh my, oh my. What should we do?

169
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,690
Oh my, our grandmother must feel refreshed.

170
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,340
You must feel uncomfortable, I'll change your clothes quickly.

171
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,330
- Are you alright? 
 - I'm fine.

172
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:21,540
Let's go inside, Grandmother.

173
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,090
Let's go.

174
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,510
Our grandmother is so pretty.

175
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,920
You could even get married.

176
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,690
Grandmother, are you tired?

177
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,610
Alright, lay down here. Careful, careful.

178
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,190
Oh, oh ...

179
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,690
After not having worked in awhile ...

180
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,780
Should I lay down for a minute?

181
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,060
I wonder if my grandmother is doing well?

182
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,500
She must be so lonely by herself.

183
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,390
Grandmother.

184
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,770
- What are you doing here? 
 - What do you mean? I'm here to wake you up.

185
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,740
If you're here to wake me, you should wake me up! Why are you watching me sleep? It's perverted!

186
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,290
What? Perverted?

187
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:35,660
Do you think there's a man in this world that could perversely watch a woman snoring?

188
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:41,090
- I was snoring? Me?
 - Yeah, so much.

189
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,790
I was just ... really tired.

190
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,590
Forget it. Just come out. It's time for the service.

191
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,860
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

192
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,400
What are you talking about?

193
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,140
You knew Ru Mi was there and did that on purpose.

194
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,940
You're the one who came out of nowhere and surprised me.

195
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,290
Let's just stop.

196
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,940
What the heck?

197
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,240
Mother, what are you doing here?

198
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,530
She's so heartless.

199
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,500
Where is she? And what is she doing?

200
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,380
Is she even eating?

201
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,080
Yi Gyeong will be alright. Don't worry too much.

202
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,230
Did Doo Rim contact you?

203
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,190
Yes. She said they successfully completed the memorial service.

204
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,590
What is that?

205
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,320
They said it would make the relationship between the bride and groom better.

206
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,060
It was foolish.

207
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,740
What difference would this make?

208
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,500
It has no use.

209
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,540
Are you going to marry Yi Gyeong?

210
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,880
I asked if you're going to marry her.

211
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,020
She's the woman my family chose.

212
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,780
Are you saying it doesn't matter who it is? As long as your family decides it?

213
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,510
Yes. It doesn't matter to me.

214
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,930
Don't be like that. You don't even have feelings for her, so why?

215
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,640
What are feelings? Feelings ... love ...

216
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,150
Do you think those things exist?

217
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,470
I know why you're like this. Just forget about what happened in the past.

218
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,410
Not being able to trust anyone, not letting people get close to you ...

219
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,400
Lee Ru Mi, don't overstep your boundaries.

220
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,510
Stop acting like you know everything when you don't.

221
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,980
Can’t I even say these things to you?

222
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,910
I was by your side for how long?

223
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:06,320
I never asked you to stay by my side.

224
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,030
If it's a loveless marriage anyway ... And if it doesn't matter which woman it is ...

225
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,660
Don't you think I'm more of a suitable fit?

226
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,240
Does it really not matter to you?

227
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,270
Since I was young, I only had you.

228
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:40,710
Do you know how I feel whenever I see you and Yi Gyeong?

229
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,530
So stop it.

230
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,700
I said to stop.

231
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,650
I can't. What should I do?

232
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:29,350
Do you have to make expressions like that in front of me? You said you had no feelings.

233
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,930
But are you worried about her because she's your fiancée?  What is Jang Yi Gyeong to you?

234
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,440
Watch what you say! She's not someone you can talk about like that.

235
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,590
She's someone who has been approved by my parents and family.

236
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,500
Oppa.

237
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:01,750
Oh my! Choi Kang Ju and Lee Ru Mi had that kind of relationship?

238
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,600
Of course,  they did.

239
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,650
Lee Ru Mi, that girl might not have a tail. But she's a complete fox.

240
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,540
Would that guy Choi Kang Ju fall for her like that?

241
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:21,170
Well that's none of my by business! As soon as Jang Yi Gyeong returns,

242
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,860
my role as her double will be over. Over!

243
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,130
It's that woman.

244
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,260
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes.

245
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,880
Did you see another employee who passed by this way?

246
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,650
- No, I didn't. 
 - Ah, yes.

247
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,330
Am I seeing things? But she definitely went this way.

248
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,970
But where am I?

249
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,800
What are you doing right now?

250
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,950
You scared me!

251
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,060
You seriously—

252
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:30,660
Come here. Hurry.

253
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,310
Hold the cat for a second.

254
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,550
Why are you going back in?

255
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,060
Just a second.

256
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,860
I think the mom died.

257
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,040
Are you telling me to shovel right now?

258
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,230
Do you not know how?

259
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,420
I am the heir to Taeyang Group, Choi Kang Ju.

260
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,660
So? What does that have to do with shoveling?

261
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,070
Is there a law that prohibits the heir of Taeyang Group from shoveling?

262
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,800
Forget it. I can just do it then.

263
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,520
Move over. Hold the cat.

264
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,220
What kind of man can't even shovel right?

265
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,740
Of course. What would you have done with those hands? Just eat,

266
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,500
clean your poop, and use a pen.

267
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,030
What? Poop?

268
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,970
Poop!

269
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,570
Oh, the fur.

270
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,910
You must not have a mom either.

271
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:57,250
Don't worry, I'll be your mom. Let's go.

272
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,630
Are you just going to leave?

273
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,290
You can come in after exercising in the moonlight if you want.

274
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:24,180
It seems like Yi Gyeong is very thoughtful and respectful to the elders.

275
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,780
She's not like the kids nowadays.

276
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,960
She's fit to be Kang Ju's partner.

277
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:36,080
They say you can predict the change in tides but you can never know what a person is truly thinking. Let's wait and see.

278
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,850
You're the one who personally chose her and yet, you're still not satisfied.

279
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,990
Is it because you still feel for Ru Mi—

280
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,740
A human can't change anyone's destiny. What can we do?

281
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,160
It may be disappointing, but she just wasn't destined to be a part of our family.

282
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,970
Is that what you're thinking?

283
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,220
Your first love... Do you think I caused that?

284
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,230
Why bring that up again?

285
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,040
It's all in the past.

286
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,610
All in the past?

287
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,300
No... It's possible for Kang Ju...

288
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,950
Enough with that nonsense! Do you really believe that?

289
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:25,440
Make sure to watch what you say in front of the kids.

290
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm saying not to confuse the kids, who have a bright future ahead of them.

291
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,630
You're really too much.

292
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,030
We're already here?

293
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,820
Wipe that drool off your mouth before you start talking.

294
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,880
I was so tired from working all day.

295
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,210
Pretending not to see or hear anything...

296
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,740
you're really determined to be a puppet.

297
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,720
What you saw before with Ru Mi...

298
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,100
Oh no!

299
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,810
Is that cat that important when I'm talking to you right now?

300
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,040
I think he peed.

301
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,920
Whatever. Just get out!

302
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,760
Before you ruin the seats.

303
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,350
Also, you remember that we have an interview right? Don't be late. Understand?

304
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,390
Okay.

305
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,750
Let's go.

306
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,260
Jeez.

307
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,930
Is that really something to be mad about?

308
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,690
He only peed a little. Doesn't he pee also?

309
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,980
Our Yi Gyeong has allergies so she can't go near or touch cats or dogs.

310
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,590
Did you not see the list?

311
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,310
So how could you bring the cat here? Does Choi Kang Ju know?

312
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,700
Don't worry. He's doesn't know about anything.

313
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,410
He doesn't know anything about your little sister.

314
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,660
You have to think about when Yi Gyeong comes back.

315
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,520
Don't you think it'll be weird when Yi Gyeong comes back and behaves differently?

316
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,710
You eat raw fish whenever you want, you touch cats whenever you want,

317
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,560
then what do you want our Yi Gyeong to do?

318
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,250
I didn't think that far ahead.

319
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,520
I'm sorry.

320
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,550
I told you.

321
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:09,110
As long as you're in this household, you're no longer Na Doo Rim. You're Jang Yi Gyeong.

322
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,610
I'll be careful from now on.

323
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,350
But, can I still keep him?

324
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,580
While I'm raising him, when your sister comes back, I'll take him with me.

325
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,180
Just until she comes back, please?

326
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,300
Who am I? I'm Choi Kang Ju.

327
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,120
Why is she so worried when it's just a cat?

328
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,120
Not just that, she just sleeps so peacefully.

329
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,180
Could that be all for show?

330
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,360
The president isn't here?

331
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,900
That's weird. He's not at the yard either.

332
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,030
Where could he have gone in the morning without mentioning it to anybody?

333
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,860
I wasn't late, was I?

334
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,060
It took a while cause I was trying to match the dress code.

335
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,120
What about Kang Ju?

336
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,700
Kang Ju.

337
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,390
You should get rid of this bracelet.

338
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,480
The necklace is the main point today. The necklace needs to stand out.

339
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,790
What are you doing not taking it off?

340
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:50,010
If the bracelet bothers you that much, I can hide it instead.

341
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,650
Better?

342
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,660
Choi Kang Ju! You cold-blood, heartless, inconsiderate human!

343
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,970
You!

344
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,840
Take her away.

345
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,050
Let me go! Choi Kang Ju!

346
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,350
My family is about to live on the streets because of you!

347
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,960
My sibling may get sent to an orphanage!

348
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,450
Did you know that? You bastard!

349
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,840
Choi Kang Ju!

350
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,180
What are you doing? Do you not see everyone staring?

351
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,440
Are we not going to do the interview? Get her cleaned up.

352
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,100
Let's go.

353
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,460
What were you thinking?

354
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,390
Trying to protect that spot of yours by throwing yourself into that mess,

355
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,940
are you trying to show it off to me?

356
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,390
These are the interview's questions and answers.

357
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:49,030
These are the perfect answers to reply off of those questions so don't even bother questioning or changing the answers.

358
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,670
All you have to do is answer the way it says to.

359
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,280
What... what is it?

360
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,720
Is it because of no makeup? Your face is a bit...

361
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:19,510
Does it show? I got a little work done.

362
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,520
No wonder.

363
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,010
Why did that lady do that before?

364
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,150
She used to work at the information desk, but Kang Ju fired her.

365
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,520
She was smoking while working.

366
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,290
Team Leader, I tried bringing the dresses from every clothing stores

367
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,290
that matches the dress code. Please take a look.

368
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,980
Na Doo Rim.

369
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,500
Doo Rim! It's been forever!

370
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,360
Do you work here too? When did you come up to Seoul?

371
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,010
Oh Jin Joo! What are you doing?

372
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,100
Do you know who this is?

373
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,040
Who? Excuse me?

374
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,170
An employee at this department store, do you not recognize the CEO's fiancée?

375
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,980
The CEO's fiancée?

376
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,880
Whatever. Let's hurry. It's almost time for the interview.

377
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,430
I'm sorry.

378
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,240
I just started working here not too long ago.

379
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,600
You're getting in the way. You can leave now.

380
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,910
I'm sorry. Sorry.

381
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,850
Life is in the hands of fate and fate only goes so far.

382
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:45,850
I'm guessing your fate ends there too.

383
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,420
It's not your fault,

384
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,370
nor is it anyone else's fault.

385
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,410
I didn't know then,

386
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,820
but now that I think about it,

387
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:01,470
Seon Hwa probably predicted what would happen to her,

388
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:06,690
before the marriage, she told me something weird.

389
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,360
If something happens to her,

390
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,520
to spread her ashes around that tree that she loves so much.

391
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,560
At that time, I thought she was just anxious about marriage,

392
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,610
so I just believed that she was just having unnecessary thoughts.

393
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:25,900
Who knew that would be her last will ...

394
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,950
Stop coming here from now on.

395
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,800
Father-in-law.

396
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:51,320
Please forget about our Seon Hwa now.

397
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,830
It's been 30 years.

398
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:58,700
Her name and face should be fading by now.

399
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,180
Don't you think so?

400
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,990
What do you mean a snowman?

401
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:26,850
It was snowing so much, the traffic was barely moving.

402
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,160
The time was passing, I was getting impatient.

403
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:36,570
I thought it'd be better to run so I left the car and ran to Yi Gyeong's house.

404
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,000
Oh my. Really?

405
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:45,200
It was snowing so much, I thought he turned into a snowman.

406
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,420
His frozen face was so red.

407
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,750
He proposed to me by putting this necklace on me.

408
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,930
It sounds like a scene from a movie.

409
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:58,000
Your determination is amazing.

410
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,380
How can I try to please the customer,

411
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,400
if I can't achieve the heart of the woman I love?

412
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,620
I will work hard to cherish each and every customer.

413
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:15,750
Yes, with that heart of yours, you will definitely succeed

414
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,140
in running this department store.

415
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,460
As we look forward to the launch of their new luxury brand by JR Group,

416
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,370
this was Tae Hang Department Store CEO, Choi Kang Ju and his fiancée,

417
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,650
Jang Yi Gyeong.

418
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,570
Thank you for your time.

419
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,250
Thank you.

420
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,820
Cut! Okay.

421
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,920
- You did so well. 
 - Yes.

422
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,810
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

423
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,970
Good Job.

424
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,890
This is not part of the interview but

425
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,910
I heard you majored in piano.

426
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,450
Excuse me?

427
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,280
Yes, I did.

428
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,570
I would love to film you playing the piano.

429
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:01,990
Since there is a piano here, if you don't mind.

430
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,620
Please prepare the camera settings.

431
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,300
Oh no.

432
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,170
The interview today was great.

433
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,820
Really?

434
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,510
I'm pretty sure that she's Doo Rim.

435
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,810
Jin Joo, what's wrong?

436
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,980
Huh? It's nothing.

437
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,800
Everything's set. please get ready.

438
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,920
Okay!

439
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:46,170
Can you get me some water? It's been a while since I played so I'm getting a bit nervous.

440
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,700
- Jin Joo 
 - Yes! I will get the water.

441
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,760
What are you doing?

442
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,770
Yes?

443
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,540
Oh my!

444
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,600
I'm so sorry!

445
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,010
It's okay.

446
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,700
Oh Jin Joo! Where is your mind wandering off to?

447
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,260
Are you not hurt anywhere?

448
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,910
I'm okay.

449
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,600
What should we do? I don't think we can do the piano scene.

450
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:32,600
Jin Joo!

451
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,610
Oh Jin Joo.

452
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,390
Oh Jin Joo.

453
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,040
Na Doo Rim

454
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,670
Hey! How did you know—

455
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,450
How did you know?

456
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,100
It was so obvious.

457
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:07,220
When you were heading towards the piano, your hands were shaking like crazy.

458
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,420
From that moment, I knew it was you.

459
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,830
But, why are you our CEO's fiancée?

460
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,570
That is ...

461
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,000
It must've been so hard pretending to be some fake princess all the time.

462
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,660
Say no more. The way I'm living is not living anymore.

463
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,680
But how on earth could this have happened?

464
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,420
How could you guys have the same face?

465
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,960
I find that really weird too.

466
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,020
By any chance, were you guys twins separated at birth?

467
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:48,630
Or some secret at birth?

468
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:52,700
You must've watched too many dramas. How could you say that about my mom and my dad?

469
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,720
The fruit of my mom and dad's pure love was just me, okay?

470
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:03,940
I read this in a book once. There is a possible chance that there is someone in this world who looks exactly like you.

471
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,060
A doppelganger?

472
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:10,980
Everything I told you has to be a secret, okay?

473
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,220
Yeah. Don't worry.

474
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:17,980
My lips are heavier even when it's combined with yours.

475
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,120
Let's have some grilled pork and soju next time we meet.

476
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,510
 Withdraw this unfair firing! Choi Kang Ju must go!

477
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,420
Why did you smoke?

478
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:52,570
I only smoked once.

479
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:55,680
A customer left theirs in the bathroom.

480
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,080
I worked so hard for that past 3 years whether it snowed or rained.

481
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,150
Firing me for just one mistake, isn't that too cruel?

482
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:09,030
I heard you say something about an orphanage?

483
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:14,360
My siblings are still very young.

484
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,080
I have to be the breadwinner.

485
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,060
What about your parents?

486
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,860
My mom passed away.

487
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,010
My dad left the house a long time ago so we lost contact with him.

488
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,350
I know I was wrong.

489
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:36,530
But it was so hard, so I thought maybe I could relieve some stress by smoking.

490
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,900
I was only going to smoke once and go back to work.

491
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,340
You're right. Living is really hard.

492
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,550
No, it's okay.

493
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:02,120
What should I do? This is all I have right now.

494
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,200
What are you doing?

495
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:21,260
She said that she's the breadwinner. Can't you just let this go? She's in a tough situation.

496
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:26,480
Is the company some kind of charity? You want me to overlook every tough situation?

497
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,470
Her siblings are being sent to an orphanage. She doesn't even have a mother.

498
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:32,430
Just stick with the kitten.

499
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:37,400
Is that woman some kitten? Are you going to take care of her just because she has no mom?

500
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,040
Yeah.

501
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,520
What would you know when you're so inconsiderate?

502
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,130
You'd never know what it feels like to have no mother.

503
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:52,250
Of course, you wouldn't know when you were born with a golden spoon.

504
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:55,500
Even when I was hit by a tomato, all you did was get angry.

505
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:03,920
Rather than getting worried, you were getting angry thinking the interview was ruined.

506
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,720
- You're despicable. You're so fake inside and out! 
 - Are you done now?

507
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,760
- Who do you think— 
 - What's the use of having so much money?

508
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:19,020
Who cares if you're wearing luxurious clothing from head to toe? A person should be luxurious themselves.

509
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:45,630
What should I do? My stupid mouth.

510
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,690
About the Chairman.

511
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:27,880
Once in a while, the Chairman leaves secretly to go somewhere.

512
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,240
You know, right? Where the Chairman goes?

513
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:36,120
Just like you said, it's a secret so why bother asking?

514
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:41,190
He's not having an affair, is he?

515
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,970
Are you crazy? What do you see the Chairman as?

516
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:52,940
- The Chairman only has one woman in his heart. 
 -Yeah, but that woman isn't the Madame.

517
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,320
Be quiet.

518
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,820
Oh Madam. Madam, do you need anything?

519
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:04,470
Ah, yes.

520
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,850
From now on, don't go by yourself.

521
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,000
You know that your health wasn't like how it used to be.

522
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:38,570
I can't block your heart from flowing that way.

523
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,460
However,

524
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,680
you can't go alone.

525
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,150
Don't worry.

526
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,210
I have no reason to go back there again.

527
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,340
Did the interview go well?

528
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:21,210
Ah ... yes, well ...

529
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:24,020
You came home early today.

530
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,180
Oh, what happened to your hand? Did you get hurt?

531
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,750
It's nothing. I hurt it slightly at the construction site.

532
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:37,030
You should have been more careful. Let me take a look.

533
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,220
I said it's fine.

534
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,400
Ah ...

535
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:51,100
You haven't eaten yet, right? I'll prepare something. Wait here.

536
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,530
What is it?

537
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:10,100
- It's nothing. You should eat. 
 - Yes.

538
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:15,300
So ...

539
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,360
You haven't heard from your sister?

540
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,310
We have people looking for her. Why? Is something wrong?

541
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:28,340
Ah, it's nothing.

542
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,800
Your soup is getting cold. Hurry and eat.

543
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,370
 What's the use of having a lot of money?

544
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:54,140
 Who cares if you're wearing luxurious clothing from head to toe?

545
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,720
 A person should be luxurious themselves.

546
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,410
What did you need so early in the morning?

547
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:21,750
I was wondering if there's something I could help with.

548
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,400
Ta-da. What do you think?

549
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:36,780
Better than expected.

550
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,400
I have something I need to do today. Is it okay if I go out somewhere?

551
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:49,930
Last year, after the Chairman suddenly collapsed,

552
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:52,610
he seems to be more in a hurry.

553
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:57,860
His surgery went well but he could relapse at any moment.

554
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:02,650
I'm not sure if that's why but he wants to move up the wedding as soon as possible.

555
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,070
Yes.

556
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,230
So that's why I'm saying this,

557
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:14,190
I was hoping we can quickly set a wedding date.

558
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,780
It would be nice to have the wedding as quickly as possible,

559
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,670
but the bride's side still has a lot to prepare.

560
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:24,810
If that's the case, you don't have to worry.

561
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:29,020
You just choose a good day and let us know.

562
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,900
We'll take care of the rest.

563
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,000
Member Kim Bong Sook?

564
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,010
Do you know this person?

565
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:45,130
- Do you know how much this person owes us? 
 - What?

566
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:49,270
She's driving us crazy. By chance, are you friends with her?

567
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,460
Do you know her new number?

568
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:56,910
- Oh, I'm sorry. 
 - Customer, hold on. Customer. Please wait.

569
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:59,200
Kim Bong Sook, that little ...

570
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:05,450
 Yes, everyone. I know you must be busy but if I could get your attention. Please turn your attention this way.

571
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:10,100
 Bong Mi Bakery is having a cake eating event.

572
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,070
As you can see, first place

573
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:15,560
is a 3D ready TV. Second place is a free cake gift certificate.

574
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,550
Third place is a bakery 70% off coupon.

575
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:23,240
Do I have any interested participants? One more time, first place is a 3D—

576
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:29,650
- Oh, me, me, me, me. - Okay. Good. Okay, anyone else? 
 - Me, me, me, me.  - Oh, you look good.

577
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:34,820
- Anyone else?  - Me, me. 
 - Oh, you look like you can eat. Anyone else?  - Over here.

578
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:40,910
- Okay. Any other participants? - Here, here. 
 - One last person. There's one last seat, anyone else?

579
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:43,010
One last seat. Anyone else?

580
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:45,370
- Me! 
 - Okay, young lady.

581
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:51,140
Please give a big round of applause to all of our participants.

582
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:57,900
We have a lot of great prizes for the winners of this event.

583
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,560
Let's see who will win today's cake eating contest. Don't be nervous.

584
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,040
Get ready. Start!

585
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:13,220
A round of applause. They're all eating really well. Looks to me that contestant number 2 may get first place.

586
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:20,210
But contestant number 3 is eating well also. Number 5 is no joke either. Who will be the winner? Oh, it looks like number 2.

587
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:27,490
Number 2 ... Number 2 is ... Wait, number 3 ... Number 3!

588
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:34,710
Number 3 isn't playing around. She's hungry! Wow, what's happening. She's crazy.

589
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:40,530
She's crazy. Number 3 is going crazy. Oh my goodness, how can a woman ... How can a woman act like this?

590
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:46,750
Number 3 ... three, three, three, three ... Number 3 is ... Number 3 is the winner.

591
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:50,350
Here is today's winner.

592
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:54,210
Congratulations. She finished in 1 minute and 27 seconds.

593
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:57,030
What? What are you doing?

594
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:00,000
I mean ...

595
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,310

596
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:10,900
 Bride Of The Century
