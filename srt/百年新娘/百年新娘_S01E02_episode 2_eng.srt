1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,100
 Bride of the Century

2
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,630
 She's made it through a dangerous situation but needs surgery as soon as possible.

3
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,100
Doo Rim. Doo Rim. Doo Rim.

4
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,620
Grandma, I'm right here.

5
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,230
Doo Rim, were you crying?

6
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,940
Crying? No.

7
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,410
My poor child.

8
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,690
All that money ...

9
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,590
You worked so hard every single day

10
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,460
to save that money.

11
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,670
God is so heartless.

12
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:36,800
Once I get discharged, I'm going to find that wench even if I have to travel to the ends of the earth.

13
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,220
Even shredding her to pieces won't be enough.

14
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,940
Even if we chopped her up and fed her to the fish, they wouldn't eat it because she's so dirty.

15
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,880
Grandma, should we keep going? It's not good for your heart to get so worked up.

16
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,170
I can always earn more money. I just need you.

17
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,740
So don't worry about anything and get some rest.

18
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,990
 Celestrial Kirin rides on northern wind.

19
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,460
I know you don't like it.

20
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,130
But what can you do? It's your mother's will.

21
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,930
To protect this house.

22
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,470
If you want to get rid of this place,

23
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,790
then get rid of that picture of your first love, the one you keep in your study.

24
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,470
Sir.

25
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,140
It's getting late.

26
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,540
 CEO Choi Kang Ju

27
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,040
Don't worry about me. You should go home.

28
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,790
Yes.

29
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,330
Oh my, Eternal Love.

30
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,400
This classic luxury item. It's so romantic.

31
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,130
This is a luxury item over 30 years old. It probably cost a fortune.

32
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,620
It's about the price of a Gangnam apartment.

33
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,940
It's the least that the future daughter-in-law of Taeyang Group's heir should get. Don't you think?

34
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,740
Ru Mi, I heard you worked hard to get this.

35
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,020
If it were me, I would have thrown that necklace out a long time ago.

36
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,370
Jang Yi Gyeong, I'm not sure about anything else, but your perseverence is something else.

37
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,220
I suppose since there's not much else you can do anyway.

38
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,090
Except endure, endure, and keep enduring.

39
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,190
What are you talking about?

40
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,790
Just something. Let's have some wine.

41
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,150
Why did they choose me and not you?

42
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:24,470
Family background, education, skill ... you're not much different than me.

43
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,090
So why me?

44
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,800
As much as I don't want to admit it, I'm the daughter of the Attorney General and you're the daughter of a construction company.

45
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,170
If only that money laundering incident didn't happen last year. You know about that.

46
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,420
You know how that case impacted Taeyang Group and my family.

47
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,880
On top of that, everyone knows that Taeyang Group has been eyeing Ohseong Construction.

48
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,950
If that's true, then you have no chance even if you were to die and come back to life.

49
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,890
So why don't you just give up?

50
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,780
Oppa Kang Ju and I have been like siblings since we were young.

51
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,260
So much so that I learned to say Oppa before mom. He's a special person to me.

52
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:23,830
You asked why after college graduation I turned down so many great opportunities to join the Taeyang Department Store.

53
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,490
Why there of all places?

54
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,450
Because my place is where Kang Ju is.

55
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:36,530
So don't give me an opportunity. Because as soon as I see an one, I'm going to take it.

56
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,580
This is my last warning as my friend of 10 years.

57
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,860
Thanks for the warning, but you won't be able to stop this wedding. Never.

58
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,770
I'm going to get married even if I die. No, I have to.

59
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,370
You know our company is hanging on the edge of a cliff right now.

60
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,820
We needed help and Taeyang Group provided a valuable lifeline.

61
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:10,550
Even if I don't know much about the world, there's no way I'd let that go.

62
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,270
You're no different than a poor beggar.

63
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,840
So you don't care about your own pride if it's for your family?

64
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,260
I suppose a family like yours who got rich quick didn't have much pride left to protect.

65
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,990
And you know what? The moment you threw away the last of your pride,

66
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,630
you really became nothing but a puppet.

67
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,750
Oh, you know about the inaugural ceremony tomorrow, right?

68
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:46,970
President Kaneko will also be there so make sure you wear that necklace.

69
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,890
 You're right. You're a puppet.

70
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:21,270
 If something goes wrong with this marriage, you and I, the company, it's all over.

71
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,450
 Inauguration Ceremony

72
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,750
Some lady wanted me to give this to you.

73
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,250
Where's the lady who asked you to give this to me?

74
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,190
She left earlier.

75
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,860
Excuse me.

76
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:02,790
 Mom, for the time being, don't look for me. I need time to think.

77
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,760
 I'm returning the necklace to protect the last bit of my pride.

78
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,920
What is this about?

79
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,460
Yi Gyeong.

80
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,460
You came.

81
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,510
Yes, Chairman.

82
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,090
CEO Choi Kang Ju, congratulations on your inauguration.

83
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,440
We're about to become one family. Aren't you two being too formal?

84
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,530
Especially when there are so many people at an inauguration ceremony, formality should be maintained.

85
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,250
I don't see Yi Gyeong.

86
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,700
Oh yes ... the truth is ...

87
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,310
Yi Gyeong. Yi Gyeong.

88
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,230
Yi Gyeong. Yi Gyeong.

89
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,660
She's not home either.

90
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,300
Hyeon, Yi Gyeong really disappeared.

91
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,890
What do we do now? What do we do?

92
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,820
Mother.

93
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,310
What if something happens to Yi Gyeong? What do I do then?

94
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,190
Mother, please don't worry. I'm sure she's fine.

95
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,920
I'll do everything to find her. I'll make sure to find her.

96
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,000
Yi Gyeong.

97
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,920
How did you get these photos?

98
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,760
The Group's administrative office sent them.

99
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,270
A celebrity reporter happened to have taken the photos.

100
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,520
They caught it early on so were able to block it from going public.

101
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,500
The photos were taken on the same day as Kang Ju's inaugural celebration.

102
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,850
For someone who got suddenly sick with acute pancreatitis,

103
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,210
she was able to drive herself to Gangneung.

104
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,710
I... the truth is...

105
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,670
Whatever the reason, I don't want to hear it.

106
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,870
I don't want to know, either.

107
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,230
You do know that there are already rumors that the engagement was broken off.

108
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,310
I'm sorry.  This is all my fault.

109
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,340
Since the Chairman collapsed last year,

110
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,440
we were unable to have a formal meeting between our two families.

111
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,310
We rushed our son back from abroad to announce the engagement without much thought.

112
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,160
So I was thinking we should have an official engagement dinner between the families,

113
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,660
and choose a wedding date.

114
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,180
Since this involves the marriage of our two children,

115
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,750
if your daughter fails to attend again,

116
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,990
we'll have to rethink about this marriage arrangement.

117
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,930
I asked for this meeting in order to say this.

118
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,540
What are you doing that you haven't found her yet?

119
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,170
We checked all the hotels, pensions, bed and breakfasts, and saunas in Gangneung.

120
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,360
We've searched everywhere she might be.

121
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,340
You can go now.

122
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,590
Please report any updates as they come.

123
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,850
Mother, please calm down.

124
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,980
If we don't find Yi Gyeong,

125
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,970
our company will shatter to pieces like a piece of glass.

126
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,270
How can I calm down?

127
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,210
If we can't find her before the engagement dinner ...

128
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,210
The engagement cannot be broken.

129
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,510
With Taeyang Group's investment, we finally have room to breathe.

130
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,180
As the talks of the engagement breaking off goes around, the investors become restless and the stock prices are critical.

131
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,510
If this continues, the company won't be able to handle it.

132
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,230
If anything goes wrong, the company will be ruined.

133
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,850
How can she stay carefree despite knowing that?

134
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,100
We're in a tight spot and will probably all go down.

135
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,970
We need to find some solution!

136
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,790
There is one solution ...

137
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,500
If we can make it through the meeting of the bride's and groom's family for now, we can buy some time.

138
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,380
What are you saying?

139
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,330
Collateral? I don't have anything like that.

140
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,240
The ad said collateral isn't needed.

141
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,950
If I had one, why would I need a loan?

142
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,050
These people are just wanting the money without having to work for it.

143
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,390
Oh no! Grandma must be waiting.

144
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:16,000
 Doo Rim Restaurant

145
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,140
Can I help you?

146
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,210
I... perhaps...

147
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,750
They're not open for business today.

148
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,470
14 ...

149
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,420
15 ...

150
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,430
16 ...

151
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,650
19 ...

152
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,990
 This is the only thing I can give you.

153
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,160
 They say this lucky charm will bring love.

154
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,720
This is a lucky charm?

155
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,760
For the last time, let's buy one more.

156
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,240
 Jang Yi Hyeon

157
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,770
 Jang Yi Hyeon

158
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,800
 But you never know so please stop by the hospital.

159
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,930
 If anything is wrong, contact me at this number.

160
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,050
Even so, this isn't right.

161
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,720
Am I in the position to be picky right now?

162
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,500
Fine. I have nothing to lose anyway.

163
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,820
 To Protect My Family Tomorrow, First Be Careful Around Fire

164
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,560
Yes, this is Jang Yi Hyeon.

165
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,420
Hello, this is Na Doo Rim.

166
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,190
So ... that is ... I'm ...

167
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,750
At the construction site the other day ...

168
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,880
The one who got it on the head?

169
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,590
Yes, I remember.

170
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,050
Ah, you remember.

171
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,610
The reason I'm calling is,

172
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:11,590
my head has been hurting since yesterday so I went to the hospital.

173
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,920
The doctor said,

174
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,150
it would have been bad if I had waited a little longer.

175
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,710
 My head got severely bruised

176
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,640
so they said the after effects would stay for a long time.

177
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,090
So ... that's why ...

178
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,710
I need some money for treatment ...

179
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,170
I'll head over there now.

180
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,930
What?

181
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,050
No, you don't need to come here.

182
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,330
Hello? Hello?

183
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,480
Can we talk?

184
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,990
Yes ...

185
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,920
Brush your hair back.

186
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,220
- What? 
 - Your hair ... brush it back.

187
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,310
There is no external wound. It looks fine on the outside.

188
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,190
They said something like a blood vessel popped inside—

189
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,620
What are you doing?

190
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,200
I can't believe it ...

191
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,260
It's true I lied. You're right ...

192
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,170
I didn't do it on purpose,  I have a reason.

193
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,660
I'm sorry.

194
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,120
I need you.

195
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,950
- Huh? 
 -  To be a fiancée.

196
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,280
Fiancée?

197
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,920
To the heir of Taeyang Group, Choi Kang Ju.

198
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,820
Choi Kang Ju?

199
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,880
What are you doing?

200
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,380
Huh?

201
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,550
Go in.

202
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,120
Okay.

203
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,610
Welcome.

204
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,420
Say hello. This is my mother.

205
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,290
Hello!  My name is Na Doo Rim.

206
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,430
Just based on what Yi Hyeon had said, I was wondering how much you looked alike.

207
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,930
Wow ...

208
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,450
You must be tired. Please go upstairs and rest.

209
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,730
Yes, then ...

210
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,190
It's one problem after the other.

211
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,140
Even if her face is the same, what can we do about her being a country bumpkin?

212
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,420
You can stay in this room while living with us.

213
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,650
Please get a good rest for now.

214
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,910
The bathroom is in the hallway on the right.  Let me know if you need anything.

215
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,430
Okay. Goodnight.

216
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,610
This is a first.

217
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,320
How can she be so identical?

218
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,690
Is it possible that your father—

219
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,060
No, Mother.

220
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,010
I looked into Doo Rim's parents and family background,

221
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,880
and it's not what you think. She's completely unrelated to our family.

222
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,420
Well, I thought that as well.

223
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,210
I said it because she's so identical.

224
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,390
There are a lot of things in the world that do not make sense.

225
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:30,930
That's right. Anyway, this is something we should be grateful for.

226
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,170
It's like a princess' room.

227
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,920
We're similar and yet totally different.

228
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,900
This is no different from a cosmetics store. So cool.

229
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,920
It's cotton candy.

230
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,990
No one will know if I eat one, right?

231
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,860
What are you doing?

232
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,550
This is Yi Gyeong's room.

233
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,730
I'd appreciate if you won't go into this room from now on.

234
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,040
Don't touch Yi Gyeong's things so carelessly, either.

235
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,850
I'm sorry. I'll be careful in the future.

236
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,610
♫  Baby sweet my girl cause you're my girl  ♫

237
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:41,250
♫  Will you be with me? Will you accept me who fusses over you  ♫

238
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,960
♫  Baby sweet my girl cause you're my girl  ♫

239
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:53,700
♫  You are the only one I love.  It's just you.    ♫

240
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,950
Yes, I just finished.

241
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,170
Yes. I'll head over to the lobby.

242
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,680
So what happened?

243
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,460
I told you that Taeyang Department Store has a commercial filming.

244
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,540
I'll be there in 10 minutes so hurry it up.

245
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,200
Are all Seoul people like this?

246
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,950
My bracelet!  What happened to it?

247
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,560
Did I leave it in the store?

248
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,660
Why are you here?

249
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,000
- Please go ahead. 
 - Yes.

250
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,980
The filming for the department store commerncial is in this studio.

251
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,060
I stopped in briefly while passing by.

252
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,540
Oh, really?

253
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,530
I have a business meeting.

254
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,970
You must be busy. I'll meet you at the engagement.

255
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,430
Bye.

256
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,330
Oh!

257
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
♫  You're in my heart. You keep coming into my heart  ♫

258
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,310
♫  You only come to me. You keep coming to me  ♫

259
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:19,140
♫  At some point I end up smiling while longing for only you  ♫

260
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,220
♫  Even if I try to hide it  ♫

261
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,950
I found it!

262
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,120
Whoever it is has sense.

263
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,200
Thank you!

264
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,980
Why didn't you answer the phone? Did you meet Choi Kang Ju?

265
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,170
No.

266
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,490
I'm sorry.  You must have waited a long time.

267
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,800
I was looking for this.

268
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,080
This is a lucky charm.

269
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,500
When I wasn't wearing it, I got swindled of my lodge money. My grandma collapsed too.

270
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,210
A lot of bad things happened.

271
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,290
But when I wore it, I met you,

272
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,220
and I got Grandmother's treatment fee. A lot of good things have happened.

273
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,650
It's a priceless item to me.

274
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,880
Let's leave for now.

275
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,460
Starting from the left, this is a champagne flute,

276
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,850
then white wine. And this is for red wine.

277
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,930
Lastly, this is the water glass.

278
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,520
Water glass?

279
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,210
Water glass?  So confusing!

280
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,420
Please practice carefully in order to avoid any mistakes.

281
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Also, this is Choi Kang Ju's father, Chairman Choi Il Do.

282
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,110
Next to him, Choi Kang Ju's mother. Next,

283
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,270
I already know about Choi Kang In. He's Monster's leader. He's Choi Kang Ju's younger brother, right?

284
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,930
I'm Monster's fan.

285
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,910
Is Choi Kang In attending as well?

286
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,420
Is the person next to Choi Kang In, Choi Kang Ju?

287
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:09,080
Only the immediate family members from both sides will be there on that day so you can memorize just these people's faces.

288
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,750
Try to not say anything except to answer questions.

289
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,680
So just smile like this?

290
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,850
You should lower your speech with me.

291
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,430
What if you make a mistake and talk to me formally that day?

292
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,600
You're right. (  Speaking informally )

293
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,830
Okay, shall we practice again?

294
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,010
Relax and just do as we practiced.

295
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,620
Okay.

296
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,990
Just a moment.  I need to use the bathroom.

297
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,800
Okay, go.

298
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,300
That way ... I'll go ahead.

299
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,460
Red.

300
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,860
Who are you?

301
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:55,010
Are you happy going in and out of hotels after swindling off someone's precious money?

302
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,840
Doo Rim ...

303
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,630
- Doo Rim ...
- Kim Bong Sook, you!

304
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,000
Hey!

305
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,270
You are here already.

306
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,350
Welcome.

307
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,770
We just arrived.

308
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,930
Where is Yi Gyeong?

309
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,210
She came with just, but ...

310
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,990
- Hurry and go find her. 
- Yes.

311
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,160
No, I'll go instead.

312
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,450
Please have a seat.

313
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,030
Yes.

314
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,520
Hey, Kim Bong Sook!

315
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,740
Hey, you, Kim Bong Sook!

316
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,750
- Stop right there! 
 - Doo Rim!

317
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,880
Stop right there.

318
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,260
Doo Rim, forgive me.

319
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,380
I'm taking your wallet for now.

320
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,910
Doo Rim, you got really pretty since the last time I saw you.

321
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,350
They say that clothes make the person. I guess that's true.

322
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,680
Kang Ju!

323
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,190
- I have something to tell you. 
 - What is it?

324
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,560
That's Choi Kang In.

325
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,240
 The reception is totally crazy.

326
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,320
If he's Choi Kang In's brother...

327
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,110
Choi Kang Ju?

328
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,890
 - No. 
- Why not?

329
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,880
I've already contracted another model.

330
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,240
- Leave quickly! 
 - What?

331
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,690
Leave quickly!

332
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,290
Can I really leave?

333
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,590
If you don't leave now, I'm going to kill you.

334
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,490
Thanks!

335
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,200
Thanks!

336
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,640
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

337
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:26,200
You didn't appear at the inauguration and the place you ran off to was Gangneung Beach?

338
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:33,070
Why? After making your calculations, you realized you'll lose more than you'll gain?

339
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,570
Sorry. You must have worried a lot.

340
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,720
Your mother and brother were probably worried, not me.

341
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,850
They're the ones who were trembling in fear the most worrying about us breaking up.

342
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,960
Aside from that,

343
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,570
weren't you with someone?

344
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,370
Who would I have been with?

345
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,020
Then, nevermind.

346
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,500
What are you doing? Aren't you going inside?

347
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,240
I'm going.

348
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,090
You doing what you want during the inauguration, once is enough.

349
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,950
If your weak mentality can't handle this position,

350
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,180
you can quit right now.

351
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,950
Even if it's not you, there are a lot of people who can fill that place.

352
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:35,230
 What's with him? This punk is a total snob.

353
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,910
 Even the way he talks does not have sympathy.

354
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:44,690
Make your choice now. This is your last chance to stop.

355
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,150
The elders are waiting. Let's go in.

356
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,580
Oh my!

357
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:11,720
You! What are you doing?

358
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,190
What are you doing, kissing me?

359
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:17,010
I didn't do it. You did it!

360
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,060
Did I? So ...

361
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,720
You should have avoided it!

362
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,150
How poor is your athletic skills as a man that you couldn't avoid that?

363
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,840
What?

364
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,970
Did you do it on purpose?

365
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,980
Did I get shot in the head?

366
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,720
Did you do it on purpose?

367
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,160
Let's go in and talk later.

368
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,920
 What's this? He's totally ignoring me.

369
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,600
 I thought he was just coldhearted but he's also ill-mannered.

370
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,830
 Choi Kang Ju, because of you, I lost my catch.

371
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,320
 I'm not smiling right now because I want to.

372
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,500
 My precious money ... What should I do?

373
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,350
Oh! It's a song from our Monster's 1st album.

374
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,640
Noona, do you like pop songs, too?

375
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,380
As a piano major, I thought you only liked classical music.

376
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,190
I like all the Monster songs. I'm a fan.

377
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,560
Really?

378
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,930
Noona, we're having a showcase for the upcoming comeback. Do you want to come?

379
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,060
Can I?

380
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,820
Of course! It's really nice to have a new family member.

381
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,170
No one in my family knows my music.

382
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,620
I had no idea you're a fan of our Kang In.

383
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,700
Well ... since we'll be one family,

384
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,820
there are things we should know about each other.

385
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,640
True, we'll be in-laws soon.

386
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,000
You're even taking interest in Kang In. You're putting lots of effort into this.

387
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,580
Please eat.

388
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,850
You eat really well.

389
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,820
I didn't like how young ladies these days keep complaining about food.

390
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,590
There's an old saying about receiving lots of blessings when you eat well.

391
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,810
Of course! Father-in-law, I'm not picky and I eat everything well—

392
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,490
Judging from last time, she wouldn't even try sushi.

393
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:23,190
That's not true. I love fish so much—

394
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,440
My child eats everything well,

395
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,400
but after eating fish a long time ago and getting a really bad stomachache,

396
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,400
she wasn't able to eat raw food.

397
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:45,540
Now that Kang Ju is back, wouldn't it be good to waste no time with their wedding?

398
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,990
My friends are already taking care of their grandchildren,

399
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:52,120
so we also wish to have a grandchild soon.

400
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,770
It's not a problem for us but it hasn't been long since CEO Choi's inauguration. He must be busy.

401
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:02,480
What will he be busy with? We can just do the wedding preparations.

402
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,480
I will meet with In-law in private to talk about the wedding date.

403
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,220
Kang Ju, we'll leave first.

404
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,900
- You two stay longer. 
 - Yes.

405
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Goodbye, Mother-in-law, Father-in-law.

406
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Okay, let's meet again.

407
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,100
Yi Gyeong, we''re going to head home first.

408
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,200
Please get home safely.

409
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,000
- In-law, let's go.
- Yes.

410
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,600
Let's go.

411
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,100
- Hyung, I'm going.
- Okay.

412
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,400
 Why does he keep looking at me?

413
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,040
You're strange.

414
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,350
 Is he suspicious?

415
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,900
Did you commit a sin? Why can't you look me in the eye?

416
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,900
Why would I?

417
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,760
Of course, if you committed a sin, it's probably a big one.

418
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,660
It's not like you're holding a dog's leash. How could you grab someone's neck tie without his permission?

419
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,000
You even ... My lips ...

420
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,990
Are you sure, you didn't do it on purpose?

421
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,150
No ... that's ...

422
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,700
You're such a kidder, Kang Ju.

423
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,940
I'm leaving first. I have work to do.

424
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,200
If you're going right away, why did you say we'll stay by ourselves?

425
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,200
I need to pretend we're staying together so they feel at ease.

426
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,260
Why? Do you want to stay together?

427
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,700
Of course not!

428
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,130
Bye.

429
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,120
That punk ... I'm still technically his fiancée.

430
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,770
He didn't even say he'll take me home. Cut me off like a roll of tissue

431
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,180
and left by himself.

432
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,300
Hello. It's been a while.  (in Japanese)

433
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,900
- Hello!
- You're wearing that necklace today as well. It suits you.

434
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,010
Ah, okay. Thank you!

435
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,360
I was sad that I didn't see you at the inauguration.

436
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,960
I heard you were very sick. Are you feeling better?

437
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,660
What is she saying?

438
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,560
Aren't you CEO Choi Kang Ju's fiancé?

439
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,700
We've greeted each other before. Do you not remember?

440
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,500
Does she know Choi Kang Ju? What do I do?

441
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,790
President Kaneko.

442
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

443
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:32,470
I'm Jang Yi Hyeon whom you met at CEO Choi Kang Ju's inauguration.

444
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:36,180
Mr. Jang, it's been a while.

445
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,890
I was too nervous. Good thing I returned.

446
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,020
I made a lot mistakes today, didn't I?

447
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,780
For now, it's good that you weren't found out and we got through it.

448
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,420
That's true,

449
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,060
but I don't know about others but why is her fiancée like that?

450
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:10,780
How little does he care that he doesn't even realize his fiancée is a different person?

451
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,570
Your sister,

452
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:16,360
As a woman I completely understand your younger sister a thousand times over.

453
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,700
I get why she disappeared. Who cares if he's handsome and rich?

454
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,780
Having to marry someone like that is ...

455
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:29,020
I guess this is what arranged marriages in dramas are like.

456
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:41,150
Sorry. I was just ...

457
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:45,320
You didn't say anything wrong. There's no need to be sorry.

458
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,710
My heart is still racing.

459
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,610
So she took off with other people's money and is spending her time getting massages now.

460
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,100
Why did Choi Kang Ju have to show up right then?

461
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:32,570
And my lips that I protected for 25 years ...

462
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,980
I was so nervous today.

463
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,160
Still it went well.

464
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:55,100
I even sent away the housekeepers. The house is a mess.

465
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,980
How long do we have to do this?

466
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,800
I thought we would find her right away but it may take longer than we thought.

467
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,900
Did you sleep well?

468
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,300
What are you doing?

469
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,440
What's wrong, Mother?

470
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,470
You are probably hungry. Come and have a seat. I just have to heat up the soup.

471
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,760
Oppa, have a seat as well.

472
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,500
When did you make all of this?

473
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,460
There's no use in sitting around the house all day.

474
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,310
You can't even call the housekeepers because of me.

475
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:47,030
You don't have to worry anymore about the household chores. Cooking, the laundry, and cleaning, I'll do it all.

476
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:51,530
No, that's okay. We can always get another housekeeper.

477
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:54,230
Why would you waste your money?

478
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:57,770
I don't know about anything else, but working with my hands over ten years

479
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:02,160
has built my muscles so I can do anything around the house.

480
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,330
Ta Da.

481
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:17,400
I used the ingredients in the refrigerator but I'm not sure if it'll fit your tastes.

482
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,360
It tastes good.

483
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,340
I think it's better than the ahjumma's.

484
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,400
What a relief that you like it. Enjoy!

485
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:48,140
- After you finish eating, we'll start your intensive training. 
 - Yes.

486
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,650
Seafood is so good. She doesn't even eat sea squirts or sea cucumbers?

487
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:58,700
Sea squirts, sea cucumbers, those are the things Yi Gyeong hates the most. In addition to raw octopus.

488
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,810
When your sister returns, bring her by our restaurant.

489
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,710
If she tastes the ones I catch and make myself, she'll probably want more.

490
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,300
But she does eat salmon, caviar, and lobster.

491
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,080
Also, Yi Gyeong doesn't like sweets.

492
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,210
But I love sweets.

493
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:22,920
She does eat organic cake, organic cookies, and organic dark chocolates.

494
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,480
She likes mangoes the best and hand drip coffee.

495
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,900
She can drink about three or four glasses of wine.

496
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,840
Is something wrong?

497
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,450
Ah ...

498
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,610
You keep saying "our Yi Gyeong, our Yi Gyeong".

499
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:48,300
I know you're her older brother, but you care so much and know everything about her.

500
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,740
If Choi Kang Ju was even a quarter like you, it would have been nice.

501
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,550
This is Choi Kang Ju's family tree.

502
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,840
This is a list of Yi Gyeong's friends from school.

503
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,000
Make sure you memorize those.

504
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,250
And use this as your cell phone.

505
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:23,570
I put in the numbers of Choi Kang Ju's family and Yi Gyeong's friends.

506
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,570
What do I do? It's Choi Kang Ju's mother.

507
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,380
What do you mean? Hurry up and answer.

508
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,000
Yes, Mother. It's me.

509
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,200

510
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,040
 Bride of the Century
