00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,510
(Episode 51)

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,080
I flew to the US after that,
as if I were fleeing.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,850
The thought of returning kept me going.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,820
I know that feeling.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,490
I felt exactly the same...

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,720
when I boarded the plane to the US
after my parents died.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,900
People think
you can forget it all and move on.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,100
But some memories...

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,100
become clearer as time goes on.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,700
You can't forget.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,970
You shouldn't forget.

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,640
That's why...

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,210
I need you just to watch what I do.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,010
Don't try to stop me.

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm doing this
because I know how it feels...

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,020
to fail to protect a loved one.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,790
Director.

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,760
Fine.

19
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,260
Do whatever you want.

20
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,530
If that's the best you can do.

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,530
But I, too,

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,070
will do what I can.

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,710
Don't do that.

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,780
I told you that's no good for me.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,630
Why won't you say anything?

26
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,730
It's not something
we can pretend didn't happen.

27
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,070
What do you mean?

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,880
Clear up whatever misunderstanding
you have in my presence.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,780
CEO Min, you apologize first.

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,250
You assaulted her.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,720
Don't do this, Chairman.

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,660
I don't need an apology.

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,760
Don't just stand there.

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,100
You knew I had a guest over,
but you returned drunk out of your mind...

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,140
and grabbed her by the hair.

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,270
That's vulgar and crass.

37
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,670
Apologize immediately.

38
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,140
If you apologize first.

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,980
Apologize for giving away Mother's ring.

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,410
I bought your mother that ring.

41
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,880
The cardigan she wore
was a present from me for Mom's birthday.

42
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,920
How dare she wear that?

43
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,290
I suddenly felt a chill.

44
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,830
I'd wanted to impress your family,
and the nerves had gotten to me.

45
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,300
I went in not knowing it was your room,

46
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,060
and I wore the first thing I noticed.

47
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,630
You did know whose room it was.

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,300
Manager Gong said she told you.

49
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,500
Is that what she said?

50
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,140
It was an innocent mistake.

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,140
I wouldn't have touched it if I'd known.

52
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,380
You lie at every turn.

53
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,250
If the chairman
likes you enough to marry you,

54
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,520
do you think Mingang will be yours?

55
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,990
That thought never crossed my mind.

56
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,090
It never crossed your mind?

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,030
You approached him on purpose.

58
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,390
What do you think you're doing?

59
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,360
You should be ashamed!

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,930
Don't make things any worse and apologize.

61
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,000
Anyone would say you were in the wrong.

62
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,340
Father!

63
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,540
If you won't apologize, pack your things.

64
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,610
Don't think of seeing me again,

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,310
and stay well away from the company.

66
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,550
You won't give in?

67
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,020
Get out!

68
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,730
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,810
Don't be sorry. I feel even worse.

70
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,350
How dare she...

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,120
My goodness.

72
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,790
I hope you understand.

73
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,730
Will you calm down?

74
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,640
Relax.

75
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,080
Talk to me. Who made you so angry?

76
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,040
That woman.

77
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
What happened this time?

78
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,420
I apologized to her.

79
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,090
I, Min Kyung Chae, had to apologize!

80
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,500
She has more pride
than anyone in the country.

81
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,470
Why would you antagonize her?

82
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,040
Do I have to care about that?

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,540
She's nothing without her pride.

84
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,780
You worry a great deal about her.

85
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,480
She's the only connection you have.
You wouldn't want her to go down.

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,690
Are you making such a fuss because
you consider the chairman your connection?

87
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,050
Not yet.

88
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,360
If I use that connection to do something,

89
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,690
you will suffer the consequences too.

90
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,070
"Madam. Please spare me."

91
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,800
You'll beg on your knees.

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
"Madam?"

93
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,800
Yes, "madam."

94
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,010
If you want to survive,
pick your side wisely.

95
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,710
I should side with you?

96
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,450
Who knows? I might show you some mercy...

97
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,580
for old times' sake.

98
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,990
That darn brat.

99
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,060
Say no during work hours.

100
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,060
He might be the chairman,

101
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,200
but you can refuse to visit his office
for personal reasons during work hours.

102
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,340
I can't say no.

103
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,640
Shall I refuse for you?

104
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,110
- Director.
- I told you...

105
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,080
I'd do things my way.

106
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,110
Before, I didn't know about your plan,

107
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,150
but now that I know what your plan is,

108
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,620
I can't let it go on.

109
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,090
I told you that doesn't do me any good.

110
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,020
Let's say I'm doing what's good for me.

111
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,390
I will protect you for my sake.

112
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,530
How's that?

113
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm allowed to protect my loved one.

114
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,800
I don't want to lose anyone close to me.

115
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,940
Is that too much to ask for?

116
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,670
Your hurt.

117
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,340
It's not just yours anymore.

118
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,560
I gave you a hint.
Why won't you do anything?

119
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,190
What do you mean?

120
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,400
I told you about Lucia's relationship
with the chairman.

121
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,570
Was I mistaken?

122
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,070
Don't you have feelings for her?

123
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,300
I care for her...

124
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,210
only as a subordinate and nothing else.

125
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,110
That's a lie.

126
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,910
Soon, you'll regret telling that lie.

127
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,820
What is it that you want from me?

128
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,820
You get to protect the woman you love.

129
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,520
And I get to protect my father... No.

130
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,660
I get to protect the company.

131
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,460
Get that woman away from the chairman.

132
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,900
Others might fail,

133
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
but you, of all people, can do it.

134
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,840
Madam.

135
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,010
Your husband seems to be out.

136
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,250
He's at home.

137
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,380
Why? Do you want to talk to him?

138
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,050
Yes. I'd like to ask him something.

139
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,320
He's in that room. Go see him.

140
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,490
He won't let me anywhere near the place.

141
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,400
Okay.

142
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,730
Money's rolling in, rolling in like crazy.

143
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,400
It's rolling in endlessly
from all directions.

144
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,670
Cash, money...

145
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,840
Excuse me.

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,770
You are not excused!

147
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,840
How dare you come in here?

148
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,310
I'm so sorry.
Your wife said you'd be in here.

149
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,610
So you waltzed in? Get out immediately.

150
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,620
Outsiders are banned from this room.

151
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,320
Sorry. I had no idea.

152
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,060
Exactly how big is your house, sir?

153
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,520
The site is 755m²,
the floor space is 390m²,

154
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,260
this room is 8m²,
and this safe is 0.33m², okay?

155
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,400
Now get out!

156
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,360
That's a pretty decent floor area ratio.

157
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,930
Why do you care about that?

158
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,030
Yes, sorry. Let's see...

159
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,140
He has no idea what room this is.

160
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,310
Not even the National
Intelligence Service is allowed in.

161
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,110
These secret documents
are worth a fortune.

162
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,250
"How much are they worth, Pan Sool?"

163
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,080
Tens of millions of dollars.

164
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,120
Mingang's shares are divided
in a way that's unique to the industry.

165
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,890
His family has an absolute majority.

166
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,930
On top of that,
Min Doo Sik set up many safety measures...

167
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,400
in case someone unrelated to them...

168
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,100
were to take an influential position.

169
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,200
He's so thorough.

170
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,240
The bottom line is,
the company stays within the family.

171
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,950
If you marry into the family,
you have no choice but to help them...

172
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,480
keep control of the company.

173
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,780
Yes.

174
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,420
Min Kyung Chae and Min Soo Jung
are still single,

175
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,690
and there's the youngest to consider.

176
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,960
The three future sons-in-law...

177
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,060
will affect the succession.

178
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,100
He'll say you're his
and that he'll look after you,

179
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,930
but I think Min Doo Sik...

180
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,770
will suspect and test you
until the very end.

181
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,840
Don't worry.

182
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,970
I'm getting through each day
thinking it's an endless trial.

183
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,880
Father, you can't just eat your food.

184
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,790
I'm watching what I eat.

185
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,620
That's not what I mean.
You should say something.

186
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,330
The house
was turned upside down last weekend.

187
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,660
We deserve an explanation.

188
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,660
Yes, Father.

189
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,370
You should tell us about that woman...

190
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,930
so we can think about it.

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,040
If you don't say anything,

192
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,270
our imagination will run wild.

193
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,950
We'll imagine scenes from third-rate films
that we'd rather not.

194
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,550
Can't you tell?

195
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,920
He invited her home.
It means they're dating.

196
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,320
Dad. Will you marry that lady?

197
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,990
Finish your meal.

198
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,390
You might as well answer.

199
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,390
I'd like to know too.

200
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,830
You're not considering marriage, are you?

201
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,470
Have you lost your mind?

202
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,670
What? Is there a reason I can't?

203
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,040
(Mingang Distribution)

204
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,620
Why did you want to see me?

205
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,390
To confirm what you said to me before.

206
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,260
If I were to "sort out" Lucia for you,

207
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,290
you said you'd give me what I wanted.

208
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,960
Did I say that?

209
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,600
Yes. Give it a go.

210
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,870
You won't ask what it is that I want?

211
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,270
Do I have to?

212
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,070
I'll give you anything.

213
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,510
Promise me one thing, then.

214
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,110
That if you were to find out
some new details about me,

215
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,250
you won't use it
as an excuse to change your mind.

216
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,920
"New details?"

217
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,150
It must be something disappointing.

218
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,060
Sure.

219
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,260
Even if you wore a mask
and pretended to be someone else,

220
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,930
I'll let it slide.

221
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,900
Getting rid of that woman is my priority.

222
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
Very well, then.

223
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,070
I'll come to your place...

224
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,240
and speak with the chairman.

225
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,110
It will be much more effective...

226
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,380
if he were to hear it in person.

227
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,580
I tested them both.

228
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,690
Oh Pan Sool is practically impenetrable.

229
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,720
He must have something on his wife,

230
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,660
because she's not allowed
anywhere near the room with the safe.

231
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,500
The only option is to hope
that he has a change of heart.

232
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,600
That's impossible.

233
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,670
His daughter is married to
Min Doo Sik's son.

234
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,010
He won't let the Min family go down.

235
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,610
What should we do, then?

236
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,580
Min Doo Sik offered to repay
my gambling debt.

237
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,180
That was why I turned myself in
and said I caused the accident.

238
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,890
Mr. Jo.

239
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,060
That means there must be...

240
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,030
a gap between the accident
and when you turned yourself in.

241
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,130
Of course.

242
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,270
Your parents died in the accident
at Mucheon Roundabout,

243
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,840
and I was somewhere else.

244
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,570
By the time Min Doo Sik
had sent me to the scene of the accident,

245
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,670
quite a lot of time had passed.

246
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,980
Hang on.

247
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,180
If the police accepted your statement
because there were no witnesses,

248
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,820
in other words, we just have to prove...

249
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,190
you weren't there
when the accident happened.

250
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,790
Do you think so?

251
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,220
Mr. Jo. When you were somewhere else,

252
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,460
were you with someone?

253
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,890
Let me see.

254
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,400
The person I was with then...

255
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,270
(30 years prior)

256
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,070
It wasn't me.

257
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,840
I didn't steal it.

258
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,340
Why would I take a woman's underwear...

259
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,040
when I can't sell it for anything?

260
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,170
Don't make excuses.

261
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,680
You look exactly like the person
the victim described.

262
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,610
Come on. If that's the case,

263
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,010
let's check the CCTV footage.

264
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,220
What sauna has surveillance
in the locker room?

265
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,990
Are you allowed to jail the innocent
based on a victim's statement?

266
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,490
It really wasn't me!

267
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,220
I didn't take anything!

268
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Come back!

269
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,500
I was accused of petty theft
and locked up in a holding cell.

270
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,930
I had a long record,
so they didn't believe me.

271
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,540
I was released
only after they caught the real thief.

272
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,410
I got Min Doo Sik's call
just as I was leaving the police station.

273
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,740
There must be a record, then.

274
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,080
I'm sure the police keep such records.

275
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,250
If we can confirm that,
we can apply for a retrial.

276
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,680
A retrial?

277
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,450
Another trial, you mean?

278
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,360
Yes. If that works out,

279
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
the car accident
will be expunged from your record.

280
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,830
Are you sure?

281
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,300
A bucket list?

282
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,160
Yes, a bucket list.

283
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,400
You list up things you want to do
and then do them all.

284
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,040
I know what it is.
You're saying you want to do that with me.

285
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,310
You don't want to?

286
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,840
It's not that I don't want to.

287
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,210
Will you make me do weird stuff?

288
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,910
What will we do?

289
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,880
It's a secret.

290
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,380
It's childish to have secrets.

291
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,250
Okay, then. I have to do what you ask.

292
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,290
I have no say.

293
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,590
What will you do?

294
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,030
Lawyer Kim will come by soon.

295
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,970
He'll tell my father about that woman.

296
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,030
I don't know what he'll say,

297
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,470
but I hope it's enough
to change the chairman's mind.

298
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,900
I would hope so.

299
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,010
I regret...

300
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,080
telling the chairman to find a good woman.

301
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,650
I'm sure it wasn't anything you said.

302
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,110
I have a bad feeling about it.

303
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,450
Your late mother's ring and cardigan.

304
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,520
And the way she makes you look bad.

305
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,960
That woman
has something against your family.

306
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,700
You need to watch out.

307
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,770
It's game over
if Father crosses the line with her.

308
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,670
I almost passed out
when I heard what he said.

309
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,710
I thought he'd say no
when you asked if he'd marry her.

310
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,910
We're not just any family.

311
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,710
Do you think this even makes sense?

312
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,920
She's an employee
and young enough to be his daughter.

313
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,190
If the word were to get out,
people would say Father was senile.

314
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,160
I get what you're saying,

315
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,590
but what influence do we have?

316
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,890
It's his life, and he gets to decide
what he does.

317
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,630
I think so too. It's Dad's life to live.

318
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,670
You two are acting weird.

319
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,340
I thought you'd be
hopping mad and against it.

320
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,540
I respect his decision.

321
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,140
It depends on how you think.

322
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,340
Me too.

323
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,380
What got into them?

324
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,820
What if you and I
are the only ones to object?

325
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,090
No.

326
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,190
There's one other person
who will give her life to object.

327
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,090
Kyung Chae?

328
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,200
We must join forces, then.

329
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,630
I'm not exactly on good terms with her.

330
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
This isn't the time to be timid.

331
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,400
Your subordinate
could become your stepmom.

332
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,140
Why did Father
have to pick her of all people?

333
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:20,210
Why don't you go to the office tomorrow
and see how things are?

334
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,360
I got these for the chairman's office.

335
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,230
If I can't do everything at once,
I'll take small, gradual steps...

336
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,630
to change him and his surroundings.

337
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,700
You will change him? Know your place.
Who do you think you are?

338
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,240
I don't want to have to say this,

339
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,440
but I think you need to hear it.

340
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,850
Don't you think
you should watch your language?

341
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,710
What?

342
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,920
I'm not just anyone.
I'm dating your father.

343
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,520
Telling me to "know my place..."

344
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,160
It's disgusting to watch you act
as if you're an item.

345
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,030
He gave me a ring...

346
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,600
and introduced me to his family.
Doesn't that make us an item?

347
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,170
I'd like you
to watch your language from now on.

348
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,620
Good morning.

349
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,260
What are the flowers for?

350
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,760
I want to brighten up your office.

351
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,130
This is what a chairman's office is like.

352
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,170
Here's my bucket list.

353
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,410
You want to do this with me?

354
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,770
Yes.

355
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,340
At my age? It's embarrassing.

356
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,450
What about your age?

357
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,350
Today is the youngest you'll ever be.

358
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,420
Will you do it with me?

359
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,720
Are you free this weekend?

360
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,590
I'm not. Lawyer Kim will come over.

361
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,430
Let's do it some other time, then.

362
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,110
Yeon Ah.

363
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,480
Kim Sun Jae will bring the ledger
to the house this weekend.

364
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,010
Be careful, okay?

365
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,750
He knows you.

366
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,480
Don't you worry.

367
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,690
I'll do this for you.

368
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,080
What are you doing in our office?

369
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,620
Why put on an act when it's just us?

370
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,350
Shall I speak freely, then?

371
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,560
Why are you here?
Who do you want to spy on now?

372
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,630
I decided to show some grace...

373
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,930
before dropping the bomb.

374
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,170
What?

375
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,540
I'll see the chairman this weekend.

376
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,970
So what?

377
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,510
I have other business too,
but the biggest topic is you.

378
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,480
I'm going to tell him who you are.

379
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,980
My past will come up too,

380
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,550
but I'd rather risk that
than let you marry...

381
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,050
my chairman.

382
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,660
You should've stopped when I told you to.

383
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,200
You'll get kicked out of Mingang...

384
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,730
if your past were to come up.

385
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,070
I thought about that,

386
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,440
and I don't think they'll make a fuss
about a past relationship.

387
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,870
If they want me gone...

388
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,910
But you know,

389
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,810
they can't fire me first.

390
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,610
I have something on them.

391
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,820
What is it this time?

392
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,290
It's the knight in shining armor.

393
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,200
That makes Moon Tae Kyung your third man.

394
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,670
I'm your first,

395
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,600
and Min Doo Sik is your second.

396
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,440
What was that about?

397
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,820
Goodness.

398
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,390
If the chairman realizes who you are,

399
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,120
things will get much more dangerous.

400
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,990
He'll think you deceived him.

401
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,060
I don't get it.

402
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,000
Why didn't Lawyer Kim
use that against you if he knew all along?

403
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,330
It's because...

404
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,470
What if he was waiting...

405
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,110
to use it to cause more damage?

406
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,310
He's...

407
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,610
my daughter's birth father.

408
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,150
What?

409
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,750
What did you say?

410
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,490
Hang on.

411
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,960
Then Lawyer Kim and you used to...

412
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,260
We met at our university.

413
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,260
I quit my studies to support him.

414
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,000
Then I got pregnant...

415
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,500
Not another word.

416
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,570
He wanted to be successful,

417
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,680
so he abandoned his girlfriend...

418
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,980
and his daughter.

419
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,080
Are you disappointed in me?

420
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,450
No.

421
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,390
I'm surprised, though.

422
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,600
You came here and were reunited
with someone you can't stand.

423
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,100
That must've been so tough.

424
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,810
I hope the lawyer likes the food.

425
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,280
They're his favorites, so he will.

426
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,750
I'm sorry to make you come over
on the weekend.

427
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,120
It's fine.

428
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,660
I said I'd like to help
whenever you need it.

429
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,240
Are you worried?

430
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,510
Your sister said she'd manage.

431
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,710
I'm worried anyway.

432
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,420
What if Sun Jae recognizes her?

433
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,220
It's too late to tell her to back off.

434
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,020
Kim Sun Jae will be there by now.

435
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,720
I should go there myself.

436
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,610
Hello.

437
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,540
Can I have a word first?

438
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,480
You really won't tell me?

439
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,750
Hear it from the chairman later on.

440
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,190
Are you sure it's big enough
to get rid of...

441
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,420
Lucia for good?

442
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,000
Nothing much has changed.

443
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,800
I'm handling...

444
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,110
the slush fund, window-dressed ledger,
and shell company well.

445
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,470
It's not that I don't trust you.

446
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,810
I need this as an excuse
to see you at home.

447
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,840
Of course.

448
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,510
You sly old man.

449
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,490
I hope this is enough.

450
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,420
It's not just enough. It's a true feast.

451
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,030
Thanks for everything.

452
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,060
Can I use your toilet before I leave?

453
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,570
Sure, you can. Thanks for the help.

454
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,600
You're welcome.

455
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,990
Actually,

456
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,130
I have something more important
to share than the ledger.

457
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,160
It's more important than the ledger?

458
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,760
I'm going to tell you...

459
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,100
about someone's past.

460
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,110
The table is set.

461
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,640
Let's eat first if it's not too urgent.

462
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,410
Excuse me for a moment.

463
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,300
You little rat.

464
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,740
You dare take my ledger?

465
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,720
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

466
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,810
Yeon Ah!

467
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,510
Why do you want confirmation
of something as embarrassing as that?

468
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,580
I need that confirmed
if I'm to clear my name.

469
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,350
Did Soo Jung say she was all for it?

470
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,820
That's why we should
put our feelings aside...

471
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,760
and team up
when it comes to Father's love life.

472
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,260
What was that
you didn't get to say yesterday?

473
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,260
Whatever I say,
you must trust and believe me.

474
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,890
Many years ago, I dated...

475
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
