00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,910
(Episode 99)

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,920
Se Ri...

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,890
is really my granddaughter?

4
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,630
Ho Se.

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,000
They're saying she's your daughter.

6
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,100
The child Min Kyung Chae secretly had
and raised on her own...

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,940
is your flesh and blood.

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,980
Ho Se.

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,380
What am I supposed to do now?

10
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,730
Did you get the results?

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,360
I did.

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,630
Can I see you now?

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,730
I'll be right there.

14
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,710
The bad blood you created 20 years ago...

15
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,710
has come full circle
to become my lifeline.

16
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,920
Madam Jang is his mother.

17
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,290
She's the birth mother of the man
you were so dead set against.

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,890
From now on,
with blood thicker than water,

19
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,660
I'll get my hands on Mingang Distribution.
Just watch how I do it.

20
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,560
It's one of those things that's hard
to believe, but also hard to deny.

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,630
How did we meet like this?

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,540
Tell me about it.

23
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,010
I never dreamed I'd get entangled
with you like this, Madam.

24
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,840
I kept telling myself it couldn't be true,

25
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,280
but I guess there's no denying it now.

26
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,080
Are you disappointed?

27
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,220
I'm happy because Se Ri feels like a gift
that Ho Se left behind for us.

28
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,060
Do you remember my Ho Se?

29
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,830
How could I ever forget him?

30
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,930
He was the first and last man in my life.

31
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,700
I bet Kim Sun Jae
wouldn't like to hear that.

32
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,910
That's not something you should say while
wearing another man's engagement ring.

33
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,440
Madam, do you really think
I'm in love with Sun Jae?

34
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,850
Do you think I got engaged out of love?

35
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,720
Hey, do you know
what our Articles of Incorporation...

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,890
say about a situation like this?

37
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,920
The Articles of Incorporation?
What about it?

38
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,760
With the chairman gone and CEO acting,
who gets to fill the vacant CEO position?

39
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,500
Beats me.

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,730
They have to appoint someone.
It's the CEO spot, not a reserved seat.

41
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,070
They can't just leave it empty.

42
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,640
That's true. Some approvals
go through the CEO's office...

43
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,240
before reaching the chairman's office.

44
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,380
Approvals? That's not all.
The online and chain store teams...

45
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,180
are juggling multiple projects at once.

46
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,380
You expect them to run everything
by the chairman's office?

47
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,720
The chairman's staff would be swamped.

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,750
The CEO is supposed to filter things...

49
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,720
and handle other matters
at their discretion.

50
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,190
Reports and proposals aren't sent
directly to the chairman's office.

51
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,660
And we can't just put
any Tom, Dick, or Harry in the seat.

52
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,660
It has to be someone
from the owner's family.

53
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,600
Then it's either you or me.

54
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,940
Exactly. That's why we need to check
the Articles of Incorporation.

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,270
Lawyer Kim would know best about that,
wouldn't he?

56
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,210
Hey, Sun Jae.

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,550
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

58
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,180
Why were you looking for me?

59
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,150
You know
our company's Articles of Incorporation...

60
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,150
inside and out, right?

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,320
With the CEO position vacant like this,
who do you think should be in that seat?

62
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,260
Tell me what you really think.

63
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,030
Why? You think you have a shot?

64
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,960
Don't get your hopes up.
That seat's already taken.

65
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,830
- Who?
- Min Kyung Chae.

66
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,700
She'll be coming back soon.

67
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,880
What is he talking about? She got fired.

68
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,750
I've always been a good judge of people.

69
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,550
How could I have looked at Se Ri
and not been reminded of Ho Se?

70
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,090
You know how they say you can't see
what's right in front of you.

71
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,060
I noticed Se Ri
didn't look like her mother,

72
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,830
so I wondered who she took after.

73
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,000
Who do you think she looks like, Madam?
Our Se Ri.

74
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,400
Madam?

75
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,040
Me? I'm not sure.

76
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,840
About Lucia...

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,310
How long are you planning
on keeping her around?

78
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,920
I told you how Lucia really feels
about our Se Ri.

79
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,550
How Lucia's acting toward Se Ri now
is not genuine.

80
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,390
I know it for a fact.

81
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,590
It's a mother's intuition,
something only a mother...

82
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,630
who's carried a child and endured
the agony of childbirth can have.

83
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,360
When I gave birth to our Se Ri,

84
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,770
I was on the verge of passing out
and never waking up.

85
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,500
With no family by my side,
I passed out from the labor pains.

86
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,270
And I was just left there for hours.

87
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,410
But even now,

88
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,180
if you ask me what the best thing
I've ever done is,

89
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,290
I'd say it was
giving birth to our Se Ri...

90
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,860
and bringing Ho Se's child
into this world.

91
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,820
Are you really not going to open
the desk drawer?

92
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
That drawer...

93
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,190
It could be part of
Chairman Min Doo Sik's grand scheme.

94
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:30,160
I'm sure he has another safe deposit box
at his primary bank.

95
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,400
You think he kept the will
and contracts there instead?

96
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,640
And then he'd slyly leave this one locked
on purpose.

97
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,770
When you finally open it,
there's nothing inside,

98
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,010
but it's a brilliant way to see
who's been snooping.

99
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,110
So it's a kind of trap?

100
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,710
Knowing Chairman Min Doo Sik, I'd say so.

101
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,550
But it doesn't feel right to give up
when it's right in front of us.

102
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,990
The moment Chairman Min wakes up,
you'll be the first person he goes after.

103
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,960
Then maybe we should ask Madam Jang
for her opinion.

104
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,200
Maybe ask her what she would do
in this situation.

105
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,930
Good idea. Madam Jang...

106
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,100
was heartbroken
about what happened to your parents.

107
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,840
I'm sure she'll find a way to help.

108
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,450
Yes, it's me.

109
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,380
I wanted to ask your advice on something.
I'll drop by later.

110
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,290
No. Don't come. We can talk later.

111
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,690
- I'm not feeling well today.
- What's wrong?

112
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,860
It's nothing.

113
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,560
Don't worry about it.

114
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,630
- Shouldn't you go to the hospital?
- I'm fine. Just don't come.

115
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,800
Absolutely do not come here. All right?
You can't come here today.

116
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Yes, okay.

117
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,240
What is it? Did the call drop?

118
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,780
Yes.

119
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,280
She's being so strange today.

120
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,420
I don't think I can see her today.
She said she's not feeling well.

121
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,860
Really?

122
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,990
I wonder what's wrong with her.

123
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,330
Was it that woman?

124
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,030
Yes, she wanted to come,
but I told her not to come.

125
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,470
It just didn't feel right
for her to come over now.

126
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,870
See?

127
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,970
Now that you know who your family is,
you're torn about siding with a stranger.

128
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,040
Please, you have to help me, Mother.

129
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,150
- "Mother?"
- As Ho Se's mother, you're my mother too.

130
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,820
I have to get back into Mingang.

131
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,790
I have to get the CEO position back
and kick Lucia out of the company...

132
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,730
and grow Mingang even bigger
so I can pass it down to our Se Ri.

133
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,260
So what you're saying is...

134
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,800
you want me to betray Lucia
and take your side?

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,430
It's only natural, Mother.

136
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,470
Blood is thicker than water.
Don't you agree?

137
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,270
Mother, what's your favorite food?

138
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,910
Why?

139
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,140
Are you offering to treat me?

140
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,040
We should at least have a meal
together with Se Ri.

141
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,180
With Se Ri?

142
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,080
Yes, your granddaughter.

143
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,350
Hearing you call her my granddaughter...

144
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,820
makes my heart race.

145
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,090
Some other time.

146
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,560
I don't think I can go out today.
I feel like I'm going to collapse.

147
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,730
I suppose it was a shock for me too.

148
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,900
Then please get some rest.

149
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,970
There's no need to rush.

150
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,270
We have all the time in the world
to spend together.

151
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,410
I'll be on my way, then.

152
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,800
With the chairman gone and CEO acting,
who gets to fill the vacant CEO position?

153
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,600
And we can't just put
any Tom, Dick, or Harry in the seat.

154
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,500
It has to be someone
from the owner's family.

155
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,940
If they're choosing from the owner family,
then it's obviously me.

156
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,080
Does he really think he's a candidate?
He's completely unqualified.

157
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,450
Come to think of it, Min Kyung Chae held
that position for way too long.

158
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,080
Sitting in the CEO's chair,
she looked down on everyone.

159
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,330
Who's there?

160
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,370
(CEO Jung Lucia)

161
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,410
What are you doing here again?

162
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,750
I should be asking you that.
Why aren't you with the online team?

163
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,920
Don't tell me you're
seriously after that position, are you?

164
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,390
Why?

165
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,020
Is there a problem if I want it?

166
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,090
You really have no shame, you know that?

167
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,500
If you wanted that seat so badly,
you should've tried harder before.

168
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,040
How many chances did Dad give you?
You're the one who blew it every time.

169
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,200
Why are you bringing up the past?
That was then, and this is now.

170
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,280
We can't leave the position empty
for too long.

171
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,880
Obviously,
I'm the right person for the job.

172
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,450
Do I really have to spell it out for you?

173
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,250
The director is next in line for CEO.
Who goes from vice director to CEO?

174
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,250
Hey, if we're going by that logic,

175
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,420
there's someone
who started as a staff member,

176
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,820
skipped the line to become CEO overnight,

177
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,530
and is now the acting chairman.
So give me a break.

178
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,430
You're saying you have to be
the one to take it?

179
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,830
That's right. Why?

180
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,140
Where have you been running off to?

181
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,570
What about the report due today?

182
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,910
I'm working on it, okay?

183
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,450
That's what you always say.
I've heard that so many times before.

184
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,480
Gosh, you act like hounding people...

185
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,750
is the only way to get things done.

186
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,520
With some people, you have to hound them
just to get them to do their work.

187
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,990
Take it easy on me.

188
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,660
You never know how the tables will turn.
How do you know what I'll become?

189
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,360
And what exactly will you become,
Vice Director?

190
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,000
To be blunt, I could end up
being your boss.

191
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,240
So you'd better go easy on me now
before you live to regret it.

192
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,740
I'm not picking on you.
It's constructive feedback.

193
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,740
If you don't want to be penalized,
then do your job properly.

194
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,610
Until you finish that report today,

195
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,410
don't even think about going home.

196
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,520
Gosh, that guy. I swear...

197
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,720
You'd better get on my good side.

198
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,190
The minute I become CEO, you're toast.

199
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,100
Gosh, this report is a real piece of work.

200
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,310
I worked hard on it.
Is it not to your liking?

201
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,810
You think I'd be happy with this?

202
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,910
I could do a better job
with my eyes closed.

203
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,880
Listen here, Moon Tae Kyung.

204
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,550
Do you know what they call
people like you?

205
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,720
You don't, do you?
They call it being a freeloader.

206
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,320
Do it over again.

207
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
From scratch.

208
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,300
How many times have I redone this?
Why are you always picking on me?

209
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,170
I'm not picking on you.
It's constructive feedback.

210
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,270
If you don't get this finished
by the end of the day,

211
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,100
don't even think about going home.

212
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,970
What? Aren't you going to get to it?

213
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Unbelievable!

214
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,780
How incompetent.
It's the same thing every time.

215
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,970
So the CEO position is
in your stepmother's hands now?

216
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,410
Looks that way.
Normally, the board would meet,

217
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,080
nominate a few candidates for CEO,
and vote on one,

218
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,110
but we're in a state of emergency
right now.

219
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,420
So while there's an acting chairman,
they can't go through the whole process?

220
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,090
I don't know for how long,
but I want a turn as CEO, honey.

221
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,290
Think of how symbolic that position is.

222
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,160
Remember how Kyung Chae lorded it
over everyone from that position?

223
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,830
She treated people like they were nothing.

224
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,800
That's true. When Kyung Chae was CEO,
she didn't even treat you like a person.

225
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,740
Exactly! I want a turn at it too.

226
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,340
I'll call Kyung Chae in
and just put her in her place.

227
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,540
I'm in! I'm 100 percent behind you!

228
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,750
I don't care about anyone else,
but Kyung Chae has it coming.

229
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,680
So now, become the queen of housewives
and... I mean,

230
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,190
you need to get on Stepmother's good side!

231
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,090
The queen of housewives?

232
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,630
Yes. The queen of housewives!

233
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,660
After all, the CEO position has to go
to someone in the Min family,

234
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
so who else is there?

235
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,630
Who's left but me?

236
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,300
Yes?

237
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,910
What are you so deep in thought about,
Mother?

238
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,180
Why? Is there something you want
to say to me?

239
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,310
I was just wondering
if you were free tomorrow.

240
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,020
Tomorrow?

241
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,250
Well, I don't have any special plans.

242
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,520
Why do you ask?

243
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,490
Then let's go shopping together tomorrow.

244
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,790
We can also grab a delicious meal
at a nice place.

245
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,260
What's this, all of a sudden?

246
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,700
Come on. We've never done anything
like this, just the two of us.

247
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,970
We've been through a lot
as the Min family, haven't we?

248
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,340
Let's try to be closer from now on. Okay?

249
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,480
Please, Mother?

250
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,080
I suppose there's no harm
in getting along.

251
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,290
I'll think about it.

252
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,920
You may go now.

253
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
Okay, Mother. Have a good night.

254
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,600
What is she up to?

255
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,270
Honey!

256
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,880
Yes?

257
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,890
And what do you want?

258
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,290
What's with everyone tonight?

259
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,830
I'll get straight to the point.

260
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,100
Give me the CEO position.

261
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,830
And why should I do that?

262
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,700
When I said I'd give you my stake
before the shareholders' meeting,

263
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,340
what did you think that meant?

264
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,070
That you'd be on my side?

265
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,880
It didn't look that way to me.

266
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,280
- It was like revenge on your half-sister.
- Whatever.

267
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,020
You used my stake to end the meeting
and avert a crisis. It's a fact.

268
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,520
This is a two-way street.

269
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,560
So, in return,
I should make you the new CEO?

270
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,660
Frankly, who else is there?

271
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,730
You can't put my brother in charge.

272
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,370
And it's not like my sister is coming back
as CEO either.

273
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,510
(10 dollars)

274
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,780
Sir, why are you staring
at that so intensely?

275
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,920
Money...

276
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,690
I was just wondering what money really is.

277
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,460
I always thought money was king,

278
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,290
but it seems money isn't everything
in life.

279
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,830
That's not like you, sir.
What's gotten into you?

280
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,830
Ever since I heard my in-law is bedridden,
more dead than alive,

281
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,170
everything feels pointless,
and life has no meaning.

282
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,040
Life is fleeting, and beauty doesn't last.

283
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
No power lasts forever, and mutant.

284
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,680
Or not mutant. Anyway, I have no energy.

285
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,180
I've completely lost my appetite.

286
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,150
I understand.

287
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,920
I can see why you'd feel that way.

288
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,790
There is a good remedy for that.

289
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,590
There is?

290
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,090
What is it?

291
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,590
Tell me. I'll do exactly as you say.

292
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,060
Usually, in these situations,

293
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,330
people donate their entire fortune.

294
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,640
To the poor.

295
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,540
My entire fortune?

296
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,880
Yes.

297
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,250
Everything? Every last dime?

298
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,450
Without leaving a single penny?

299
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Yes.

300
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,990
Once you give away your entire fortune,

301
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,790
they say you'll find
the meaning of life again.

302
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,590
So, would you like me to look into
some charities for you?

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Forget it!

304
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,570
What good is life's meaning if I'm broke?
I'd be starving to death!

305
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,340
What good would the meaning of life
be then?

306
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,510
You're a real piece of work, aren't you?
There's a line, and you just crossed it.

307
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,810
My entire fortune?
Not even 20, 30, or 100 dollars...

308
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,880
but my entire fortune?

309
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,320
Are you trying to shake down Oh Pan Sool?
I'm not donating a single penny. Got it?

310
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,450
I'm taking it all with me to the grave.

311
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,350
Besides, I'm going
to the fiery pit anyway.

312
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,890
I'll need it to bribe
my way around down there.

313
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,790
Don't you ever say that again!

314
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,430
Gosh.

315
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,740
He's a real piece of work, you know?
There's a line you just don't cross.

316
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,080
What's wrong?
Did someone say something outrageous?

317
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,610
He told me to make a donation.
My entire fortune, no less.

318
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,250
Whoever that is,
he clearly doesn't know you at all.

319
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,020
Pigs will fly
before Oh Pan Sool makes a donation.

320
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,660
My point exactly! You're the only one
who really gets me, Yang Mal Sook,

321
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,290
but for some reason,
that's kind of insulting.

322
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,300
Let me be honest.
Cheapskate, tightwad, miser...

323
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,300
You'd take home the gold medal
in that field.

324
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,170
Shouldn't you be
in the Guinness Book of World Records?

325
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,940
When a same-age in-law collapses,
most are shocked into changing their ways,

326
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,580
but not Oh Pan Sool. You'd never change.
Once a money fiend, always a money fiend.

327
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,810
You're not wrong.

328
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,050
But now I feel even more insulted.

329
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,680
Is that money fiend
the term I'm thinking of?

330
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,320
That's right. That's the one.
A jerk who's crazy for money.

331
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,190
Money fiend-butt.

332
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,230
What's the "butt" for?

333
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,800
Try getting head-butted
by this money-crazy jerk!

334
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,760
Gosh, you blockhead!

335
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,600
Hey, Oh Pan Sool! Get back here!

336
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,170
Seriously. You blockhead!

337
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,540
Oh, my! You money fiend!

338
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,510
- Gosh, my head.
- Goodness, my head.

339
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,380
Honey!

340
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,680
Honey. How do I look today?

341
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,720
Do you think your stepmother will like it?

342
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,760
I was worried it might be off-putting,
so I chose something understated.

343
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,760
To really look the part
of a daughter-in-law.

344
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,900
It's great. Absolutely perfect.

345
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,730
But do you think Stepmother
will shop with you?

346
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,470
I get the feeling she's not into that.

347
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,470
Oh, please. You don't know anything.
What woman doesn't love to shop?

348
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,270
I'll be her shopping mate...

349
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,840
and sweet-talk her
into getting you the CEO position.

350
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,250
You know that's my specialty.

351
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,420
So don't you worry.
Just get ready to be called CEO.

352
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Being called CEO?

353
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
CEO!

354
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,390
Are you feeling any better?

355
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,200
Have you seen a doctor?

356
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,930
It's not that serious.
I'm just feeling a bit under the weather.

357
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,070
It's just my age, that's all.
Don't worry about it.

358
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,170
I'll stop by after work today.

359
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,040
- Don't go to all that trouble.
- It's no trouble at all.

360
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,540
Let's have dinner together.

361
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,580
- The person you called is unavailable.
- Who's she on the phone with for so long?

362
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,820
I'm getting another call.

363
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,260
I'll call you back.

364
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,200
- It's me.
- "It's me?" A strange greeting, Mother.

365
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,300
When are you going to stop
being so formal with me?

366
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,940
I always call you CEO Min or Ms. Min.

367
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,340
It's a hard habit to break.

368
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,710
Please don't. It makes me feel like
there's a wall between us.

369
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,510
You, me, and our Se Ri are the only family
Ho Se has left in the world.

370
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,950
I don't want us to be awkward
with each other like strangers.

371
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,650
You have a point.

372
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,150
So, what did you call about?

373
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,890
I was hoping we could
see each other today.

374
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,930
I thought we could go shopping
and get a bite to eat...

375
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,230
with Se Ri.

376
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
With Se Ri?

377
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,370
Mother!

378
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,870
What are you doing here?

379
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,910
You promised me last night.

380
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,210
You said you'd be my shopping mate today.

381
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,580
What are you talking about?
That wasn't a promise.

382
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,810
I said I'd think about it.

383
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,020
Oh, please. Anyway,
you don't have any meetings today.

384
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,350
I checked with your secretary,
and you have no outside meetings either.

385
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,600
Come on, let's go.

386
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,870
I'm telling you, I booked a restaurant
with an amazing ambiance.

387
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,910
(Mingang Distribution)

388
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,240
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

389
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,150
(Mingang Distribution)

390
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,860
- Here.
- Gosh, forget it.

391
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,900
I told you to get dressed properly
and follow me.

392
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,700
But why?
Why do I have to go meet that grandma?

393
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,140
Funny you should say that.

394
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,570
Exactly. Madam Jang is like your grandma.

395
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,240
So why not act like her granddaughter?

396
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,580
Let her ask
her own granddaughter to do that.

397
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,310
Why should I have to do it for a stranger?

398
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,480
Because she's not a stranger to us!

399
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,650
What's that supposed to mean?

400
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,720
What do you mean she's not a stranger?

401
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,690
Look, people even grant a dying wish.
Can't you do this one thing for me?

402
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,830
Does it cost money? Is it that hard?
What's the big deal?

403
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,670
Because I can't stand her, okay?

404
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,530
Do it whether you like it or not.
It's the only way we'll survive.

405
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,040
- Come on.
- No.

406
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,310
- Manager Gong.
- Yes.

407
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,110
Please get changed.

408
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,240
What's wrong with you?

409
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,580
Gosh, I can't believe this!

410
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,560
Say something.

411
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,190
What, did the cat get your tongue?
You haven't said a word.

412
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,930
What do you want me to say?

413
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,100
Se Ri doesn't seem happy to see me.

414
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,530
Should I be?

415
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,840
You're surprisingly unlikable,
you know that?

416
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,170
She just speaks her mind.

417
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,440
It's better than walking on eggshells
around adults.

418
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,580
I think it's because she's so carefree.
Her personality is very bright and open.

419
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,820
Se Ri, may I hold your hand?

420
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,630
It's so warm.

421
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,000
They say warm hands mean a warm heart.

422
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Goodness.

423
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,780
She may seem prickly on the outside,
but deep down, she's incredibly gentle.

424
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,950
I'm sure she is.
You know whose daughter she is.

425
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,820
Se Ri, would you like to go get
something good to eat with me?

426
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,530
Enjoy your meal, Mother.

427
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,230
You must have been tired
from all that shopping, right?

428
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,440
If anyone was tired,
it must have been you.

429
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,070
Seriously, how much does one have to shop
to become a Black Sapphire member?

430
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,180
It's nothing, really.

431
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,980
For me, spending money is
the easiest thing in the world.

432
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,690
All right, so what's the bottom line?

433
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,160
We're not even close, but you insisted
on me being your shopping mate,

434
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,460
and now this fancy restaurant.

435
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,000
You must have something
you want to ask me, right?

436
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,270
Goodness, you're sharp.

437
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,670
Since we're on the subject,

438
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,870
please make my husband the CEO.

439
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,370
He wants it so badly...

440
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,510
that he even talks about it in his sleep.

441
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,120
So that's what this was all for?

442
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,540
Wait, who's that?

443
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,240
Isn't that Kyung Chae and Se Ri?

444
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,650
But that woman with them...

445
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,460
Why is Madam Jang meeting
with Min Kyung Chae and Min Se Ri?

446
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,010
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

447
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,160
Are we that close?

448
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,730
Of course.
Se Ri and I are your family now.

449
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,770
What on earth would possess Madam Jang
to meet them in private?

450
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,200
I'll build the Min Kyung Chae empire
with me as its sole ruler.

451
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,070
I suppose there's no place for me, then?
And you're sure you can retake that seat?

452
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,010
- Madam Jang, how could you do this to me?
- Jung Lucia, you listen to me.

453
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,550
This time, I'm going to save you.
Saving you is the only way I can live.
