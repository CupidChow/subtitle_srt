1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,270
Hey, if you're not alone, just listen.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,380
(Episode 64)

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,810
What's going on?

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,450
Well, Manager Gong was here saying things
that were really strange.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,250
I'm talking about her boss,
Min Kyung Chae.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,350
She's never been married, right?

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,790
Well, she said Kyung Chae was actually
Se Ri's mother.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,990
What? What did you say?

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,090
What in the world is going on?

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,360
Running away from home?
Even Se Ri doesn't do that.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,860
Well, there's been a complication.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,000
If something was wrong,
you should have told me first.

13
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,130
Ms. Kyung Chae.

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,400
I don't think I can ever go back.

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,070
- I'm just calling to say goodbye.
- Manager Gong.

16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,340
Seriously, what's gotten into you?

17
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,350
Look, I have to get to work,
so come to the office later.

18
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,490
I just whipped up something simple
with what I had.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,220
I'll do some proper shopping
and make a real dinner tonight.

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,220
Where's Manager Gong?

21
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,690
Oh, she said something urgent came up,
and she couldn't come home last night.

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,700
So she really stayed out all night?

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,770
And all over one little thing I said.
Good grief.

24
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,070
Did anything happen while we were out?

25
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,100
No, of course not.

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,140
She's allowed to have a personal life,
you know.

27
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,850
Come on, eat up.
You must be in a rush to get to work.

28
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,680
Oh, right. I hear you're back at work
starting today?

29
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,890
Word travels fast.

30
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,990
Then again, I guess that makes sense
with Father right here.

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Congratulations.

32
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,090
You'd better work hard.
You don't want to disgrace the chairman.

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,060
You can't slack off like you used to.

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,100
I know exactly what you're like.

35
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,300
What's that supposed to mean?

36
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,240
By the way, why haven't I seen
hide nor hair of that brat Se Ri?

37
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,140
She got home late last night with friends.

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,380
She had a few drinks, too.

39
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,910
She's still wet behind the ears.

40
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,720
She has no right to get drunk
and sleep in.

41
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,080
Go get her.

42
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,020
Come on, don't be like that.
Shouldn't she be with friends at her age?

43
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,660
She's growing up just fine for her age,

44
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,860
so from now on,
don't scold Se Ri without my permission.

45
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,490
I'll get angry if you do.

46
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,310
Don't worry about Se Ri.

47
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,440
Once she's slept it off,
I'll make sure she eats,

48
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,510
and I'll get her something
for her hangover.

49
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,080
She's my daughter.
I have to be the one to take care of her.

50
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,730
(Mingang Distribution)

51
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,360
Director Moon, about that proposal
you made the other day...

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,600
The one about looking into our company's
cash flow that Lawyer Kim manages.

53
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,670
So, are you considering
letting me handle it?

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,770
I'll be honest,
your proposal did tempt me.

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,540
After we spoke, I did some digging myself.

56
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,950
It turns out we've given Lawyer Kim
far more authority than is typical.

57
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,280
And with very few safeguards in place.

58
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,290
Lawyer Kim impressed
the chairman early on,

59
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,460
so many protocols were overlooked.

60
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,090
But from now on,

61
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,200
you need to put those safeguards in place,
just like with our other partners.

62
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,270
How much should I trust you,
Director Moon?

63
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,700
Well, that's up to you, of course.

64
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,640
While I don't fully trust Lawyer Kim,

65
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,380
that being said,

66
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,810
I don't believe this is your place
to intervene.

67
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,620
Between Lawyer Kim and me,

68
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,390
we have a shared purpose
that's stronger than trust.

69
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,220
I know his type very well.

70
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,490
As long as our goals are aligned,

71
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,200
neither of us has any reason
to betray the other.

72
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,010
You may go.

73
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,650
What was that with Director Moon?

74
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
It was nothing.

75
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,130
I just had a personal matter
to discuss with him.

76
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,730
A personal matter?

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,400
You should discuss that with me.

78
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,430
I'm a much better option than he is.

79
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,930
And he couldn't possibly know your life
as well as I do.

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
No.

81
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,640
It had to be Director Moon.

82
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,280
I don't know what business
you have with her,

83
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,290
but cutting me out so you can whisper
is a bit out of line, isn't it?

84
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,690
So what is it you want to say now?

85
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,790
When did you become close enough...

86
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,100
to discuss Ms. Min's personal business,

87
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,770
but if you try to drive a wedge between us
or sow distrust,

88
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,500
I won't let it slide.

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,210
If you have nothing to hide, Lawyer Kim,
then there's no problem, is there?

90
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,610
So, what, you're saying I have
something to hide?

91
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,580
You'd know the answer to that better
than I would, wouldn't you?

92
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,220
Whether you're deceiving our superiors
and plotting to backstab them...

93
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,690
is something only you would know.

94
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,220
And what about you?
Are you completely squeaky clean?

95
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,690
Living a perfect life
with nothing to hide?

96
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,230
More than you are, at least.

97
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,870
I don't know why you're so suspicious,

98
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,330
but I'm not sloppy enough
to be taken down by you.

99
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,440
So, dream on.

100
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,670
Tailing me, digging into my life,
or stirring up trouble...

101
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,970
You won't get anywhere with any of it.

102
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,410
Oh, there you all are.

103
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Hello.

104
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,990
Hey, Lawyer Kim.
What are you doing here?

105
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,620
You're back at work already?

106
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,360
Already? I should've been back ages ago.

107
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Yes, speaking.

108
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,970
Yes, I understand. I'll be right there.

109
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,480
I was going to call,

110
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,580
but I figured I might as well see
your handsome face in person.

111
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,050
Oh. Well...

112
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,290
Actually, I needed to speak with you,
so this is good timing.

113
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,990
And what's that?

114
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,960
It's about the ledgers you gave me
the other day.

115
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,490
You said there were
five volumes in total...

116
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,500
Quiet.

117
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,200
There's a little rat spying on us.

118
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Don't turn around.

119
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,210
Meet me at the hotel after work.

120
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,360
Look at them, plotting something together
right out in the open.

121
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,430
As soon as Baek Sul Hee disappears,
Stella Jang makes her entrance.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,230
So, in the end, the three of them
are on the same side.

123
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,310
If I get you a job, you need to do it well
so you don't make me look bad.

124
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,380
- I know that much, okay?
- You only say you do.

125
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,450
This is your last chance.

126
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,750
If you mess up one more time,
you can forget getting your job back.

127
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,890
And it won't just be your job.
I'll kick you out of the house, you hear?

128
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Yes, sir.

129
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,290
What'd your father-in-law say?

130
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,890
He didn't have any objections
about the non-executive director position?

131
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,430
Objections? Like what?

132
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,870
Like thanking his son's father...
That kind of thing.

133
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,800
No, he didn't mention anything like that.

134
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
Is that right?

135
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,880
Money...

136
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,550
So, there is something that can make
the great Min Doo Sik shake in his boots.

137
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,020
Well, I guess you can't get away with
your sins forever.

138
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,820
Let's see here.

139
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
(Han Kyung Soo)

140
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,160
As long as I have this,
Mingang is practically in my hand.

141
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,230
I should make a huge demand sometime soon.

142
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,970
Half of Mingang?

143
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,710
If he doesn't want to do time,
he'll have to do exactly as I say.

144
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,510
Every single cent in the entire universe
will flow right into my grasp.

145
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,380
Money...

146
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,230
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

147
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,930
Come on in.

148
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,530
Have a seat.

149
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,910
What on earth is going on?

150
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,780
No one else will be coming in,
so please, speak freely.

151
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,980
Kyung Chae,
I'm afraid I made a terrible mistake.

152
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,650
What kind of mistake?

153
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,090
Should I tell her? Or not?

154
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,990
Oh, come on.
So what if I got drunk and made a scene?

155
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,130
How am I supposed to know what I said?

156
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,830
Come on, what is it?

157
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,500
It's nothing.

158
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,540
I just got on the chairman's bad side
for a bit yesterday,

159
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,270
and I stormed out.

160
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,670
It's no big deal.

161
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,440
That's not...

162
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,910
Then come back to work.

163
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,950
That's so unlike you, Manager Gong.

164
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,260
Where have you been?
You stayed out all night without a word.

165
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,890
Can I have a word with you?

166
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,510
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Manager Gong.

168
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,380
How about we grab a drink sometime?

169
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,920
- A drink?
- Yes, a drink.

170
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,060
After all, nothing loosens the tongue
quite like a drink.

171
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,030
They say drunken words are sober thoughts
for a reason.

172
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,860
Is she onto me?

173
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,700
That darn alcohol.

174
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,170
If only I could remember what I said.

175
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,270
Let's set a date.
It's the best way to open up.

176
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,210
We can clear the air too.

177
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,840
Welcome home.

178
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,760
I can't take this. I'm too on edge.

179
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,200
Oh, Yeon Ah.
Hey, I have a quick question for you.

180
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,440
It's about last night.
Did I say anything out of line?

181
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,840
- I didn't mention the family, did I?
- No.

182
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,080
You didn't say anything like that at all.

183
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,450
Really?

184
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,650
Gosh, what a relief.

185
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,150
The ledger Lucia smuggled out
is one of...

186
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,350
Chairman Min Doo Sik's slush fund ledgers,

187
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,920
which Kim Sun Jae manages.

188
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
I heard there were five volumes in total.

189
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,030
Then Kim Sun Jae must have
the rest of them.

190
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,200
Along with the accounting fraud books
and shell company documents.

191
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,300
It's his insurance policy, so to speak.

192
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,340
If he fails to become part of the family,

193
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,370
he plans to use them to make a killing.

194
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,140
By the way...

195
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,380
Did you try leaking that info
about Kim Sun Jae to Min Kyung Chae?

196
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,950
Oh, yes.

197
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,680
But their bond is stronger than I thought.

198
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,420
Of course it is.
They have a complicated relationship.

199
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,490
They're suspicious of one another,
but they also need each other.

200
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,530
But one ledger alone won't be enough
to expose Kim Sun Jae's corruption.

201
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,130
What should we do?

202
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,430
For now, you just keep driving a wedge...

203
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,000
between Kim Sun Jae and Min Kyung Chae.

204
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,470
And one more thing.

205
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,310
You need to get your father's contract
out of Oh Pan Sool's safe.

206
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,280
But, Ms. Jang,

207
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,020
there's something I'd like to ask you.

208
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,690
Why are you going to such lengths?

209
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,160
Who do you think this is a painting of?

210
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,870
Wait, isn't this Min Kyung Chae?

211
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,070
My son did this.

212
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,310
He said she was the woman he loved.

213
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,110
So your son and her...

214
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,350
He and Min Kyung Chae were lovers.

215
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Although he was brutally cast aside.

216
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,920
I see.

217
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,290
Then where is your son now?

218
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,020
He died...

219
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,720
in a car accident.

220
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,760
But you know what's strange?

221
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,970
The driver who confessed to the accident
was a homeless man,

222
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,240
but there's absolutely no way...

223
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,940
he could have been there
to cause a fatal accident.

224
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,210
And yet, he insisted he was the one
who did it.

225
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,910
As if someone had paid him
to take the fall.

226
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,310
How could that happen?

227
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,750
It's just like what happened
to your parents, isn't it, Mr. Moon?

228
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,790
Do you understand now...

229
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,890
why I'm helping Lucia?

230
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,060
In the end, Min Doo Sik ruined all three
of our lives.

231
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,570
Tae Joo, go to Oh Pan Sool's house soon
and get Han Kyung Soo's contract.

232
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
Yes.

233
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,850
Of course, a stolen contract
won't hold up in court.

234
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,550
But we can't just ignore
his last remaining weakness.

235
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,120
It's time we get our hands on it.

236
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,100
Sleep tight.

237
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,670
Where are you going?

238
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,740
I'm going to sleep with Se Ri.

239
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,140
Make me sleep alone so soon
after our wedding?

240
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,540
That's not very nice of you.

241
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,710
I know, but I can't help it.

242
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,820
Honestly, you're not the only reason
I married you.

243
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,850
What kind of hurtful thing is that to say?

244
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,990
You didn't know?
I married you to be called Se Ri's mom.

245
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,730
It has a nicer ring to it
than "the Chairman's wife."

246
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,600
Honestly, Se Ri is such an open book.

247
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,370
The more love you give her,
the more she blossoms.

248
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,300
Looks like Se Ri has finally
met her match.

249
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,810
She was so starved for a mother's love
that she got scammed and went astray.

250
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,740
She's finally hit the jackpot, that girl.

251
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,240
Get some sleep.

252
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,710
I don't even get a kiss?

253
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,380
What are you doing in my room?

254
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,350
To sleep with you.

255
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,090
What about Dad?

256
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,650
But I'd rather be with you.

257
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,590
Liar.

258
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,460
No, I'm not.

259
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,530
If you sleep with me once,
you'll have to do it every night.

260
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,060
What's the big deal?
We'll just sleep together every night.

261
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,870
Okay then, let's see
if you can handle sleeping with me.

262
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,140
Hey!

263
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,640
I can't lose, either!

264
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,640
Hold on!

265
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,310
Got you first!

266
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,350
Gosh, my stomach hurts so much.

267
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,450
Let me take a look.

268
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,160
This is why people misunderstand you.

269
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,360
What's that supposed to mean?

270
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,230
The look on your face right now...

271
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,400
is the classic look of a mother
whose child is with some other woman.

272
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,270
It's full of jealousy and resentment.

273
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,270
Shut up.

274
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,300
What do you know to be talking like that?

275
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,540
I told you, didn't I?

276
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,140
People are gossiping behind your back
that you're Se Ri's real mother.

277
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,640
Who's spreading that kind of nonsense?

278
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,250
I know.

279
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,150
I'm well aware that the hospital bills
are overdue.

280
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,020
That's why I'm telling you I'm sorry.

281
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,190
Since you've already waited this long,

282
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,330
if you can just be a little more patient,
I promise I'll take care of it.

283
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,730
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,540
Oh, excuse me.

285
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,280
Thank you for working hard.

286
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,080
I haven't seen you around.

287
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,150
Are you new here?

288
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,180
- I'm just filling in for a friend.
- Oh, I see.

289
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,550
Wait a second.

290
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,620
I'm sure I know you from somewhere.

291
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,160
Hey. You don't recognize me?

292
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,630
I don't think so.

293
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,460
I don't believe we've met before.

294
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,470
That can't be right.

295
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,270
You look so familiar...

296
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,670
Gosh, that's it!

297
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,770
CEO Han of Doeun Industries.

298
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,850
Talk about a spitting image.

299
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,950
You're a dead ringer for your father.

300
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,660
You don't recognize me?
I used to work for your father's company.

301
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,560
I... I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

302
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,130
I wouldn't know.

303
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,900
Anyway, I'll let you get back to work.

304
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,300
What? I'm sure I'm right.

305
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,650
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

306
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,120
I'm Kim Sun Jae, an attorney from
the Mingang Distribution Legal Team.

307
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,490
I saw you earlier by the elevators.

308
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,090
And it looked like you
and Director Moon Tae Kyung...

309
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,460
knew each other.

310
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
Moon Tae Kyung?

311
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,570
That's strange.
Why would he go by Moon Tae Kyung?

312
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,270
He has another name.

313
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,300
Another name?

314
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,970
So I guess Moon Tae Kyung
isn't his real name?

315
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,780
Come on, just tell me what you know.

316
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,380
Unbelievable.

317
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
Here.

318
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,920
What exactly do you know?

319
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,200
Excuse me.

320
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,870
Who are you?

321
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,040
The gate was open, so I came in.
This is Number 23, right?

322
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,710
You foolish woman.

323
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,610
If you leave the gate open,

324
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,180
all sorts of people wander in.

325
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,510
Who are you, barging into someone's house?

326
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,880
Trespassing will land you in jail!
You want me to call the cops?

327
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,780
How about I just call the cops?

328
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,720
I'm so sorry.
I guess this isn't Number 23 after all.

329
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,360
Goodness, Number 23 is next door.
You've got the wrong house, young man.

330
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,590
I don't care where you have to go.
Get out now!

331
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,900
Actually, stay right where you are.

332
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,630
I'll call the police. 1-1-2...

333
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,030
I'm sorry.

334
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,940
What are you staring at?
Hurry up and get out!

335
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,210
That young man is just as handsome
as our tenant, Tae Kyung.

336
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,540
Must be something in the water here.

337
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,780
That's the silliest thing I've ever heard.

338
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,820
You get googly-eyed over any young man.

339
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,250
Make sure you lock the gate.

340
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,090
There's money all over this place. Money!
Cash! Money, cash!

341
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,620
- Money!
- Stop it! You'll jinx us.

342
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,130
It doesn't look like there are any other
security systems in the house.

343
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,230
Then we just need to worry about
the CCTV in that room.

344
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,370
If we cut the power, go in,
and find the safe.

345
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,500
It won't be difficult.

346
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,470
It's Doeun Industries's CEO Han's
new technology transfer agreement,

347
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,710
so make sure you get it.

348
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,610
Yes, don't worry.

349
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,050
Oh, Lucia, what's up?

350
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,050
Is Tae Joo there with you?

351
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,550
Yes, he's here. Why?

352
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,450
Right now?

353
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Oh, okay. Got it.
I'll have him on standby.

354
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,490
Se Ri.

355
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,960
What are you doing in your room
on such a beautiful day?

356
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,300
Well...

357
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,040
Nothing much.
I don't have any plans or anything to do.

358
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,470
Perfect. Want to go for a bike ride?

359
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,740
A bike ride?

360
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,410
But I don't know how to ride a bike.

361
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,450
Even better. I can teach you.

362
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,620
But still, how did you get to your age
without ever learning?

363
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,790
Well, you know how it is with bikes.
It's not like you can take a class for it.

364
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,420
It's something your family is supposed
to teach you when you're little.

365
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,560
You know how my family is.

366
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,800
That's awful, really,
even if they were that busy...

367
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,500
If they actually cared,
would they have let that happen?

368
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,570
I'm getting upset just thinking about it.

369
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,640
They've never really paid any attention
to me anyway.

370
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,740
Better late than never. I'll teach you.

371
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,370
Really?

372
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,980
Go on, get ready.

373
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,550
We can ride bikes and get some snacks.

374
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,650
Okay!

375
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,120
Se Ri, where are you off to?

376
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,290
I'm going bike riding with my mom.

377
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,520
- Let's go!
- Okay.

378
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,330
My goodness,
the way "Mom" just rolls off her tongue.

379
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,500
You'd think Lucia was the birth mother.

380
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,230
Don't you think?

381
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,840
- I know.
- You know, seeing Se Ri these days,

382
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,040
I feel so sorry for Se Ri's birth mother,
whoever she is.

383
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,080
I mean, what's the point of going through
all that pregnancy and painful labor...

384
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,580
if some other woman gets to be
called "Mom?"

385
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,350
Gosh, this is scary.

386
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,630
You're doing fine. Slow and steady.

387
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,300
It's scary! I'm scared!
I think I'm going to fall!

388
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,800
You're doing great.

389
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,000
- Keep your balance.
- Okay.

390
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,170
You're doing great. That's it.

391
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,570
Mom, you can't let go no matter what!

392
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,370
I won't, don't worry.
Just look ahead. I'm holding on tight.

393
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,180
- Okay.
- I've got you.

394
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,810
That's it. You're doing great.

395
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Look at you go, Se Ri. That's it.

396
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,120
Hey, I'm doing it! I'm really doing it!

397
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,390
Oh, the light just changed!
Perfect timing!

398
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,840
Mom!

399
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,990
What's going on?
You never call this late.

400
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,690
I'm busy, so I'll call you back.

401
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,020
Are you the owner of this phone's sister?

402
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,330
Who is this?

403
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,230
I found this phone
at a car accident and called.

404
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,200
A car accident?
What are you talking about?

405
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,200
Are you saying my Se Ri was
in a car accident?

406
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,700
She was taken away in an ambulance.
You should hurry.

407
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,940
You'd better hurry.

408
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,510
It was a major accident.
I doubt even surgery can help.

409
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,380
What do you mean?

410
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,650
Just how bad was the accident?

411
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,420
Hello?

412
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,160
Was a 20-year-old woman
who was in a car accident brought in?

413
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,470
I received a call saying she was here.

414
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,170
Really? One moment.

415
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,170
Excuse me, the car accident patient...

416
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,610
Is she in emergency surgery?

417
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,780
- Her name is Min Se Ri.
- Sorry, I wouldn't know.

418
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,880
Why doesn't anyone know anything?

419
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,880
Where is my Se Ri?

420
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,780
Where is Se Ri?

421
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,190
Excuse me, are you looking for the student
brought in from the car accident?

422
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,120
Where is she? Right now?

423
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,290
She was just taken to the operating room.

424
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,390
It's that way.

425
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,770
(Operating Theater Center)

426
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,140
This can't be happening.

427
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,780
This can't be happening.

428
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,250
Save my daughter.

429
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,920
Save my daughter!
I said, save my daughter!

430
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,520
Se Ri!

431
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,190
Se Ri!

432
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,260
No!

433
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,460
No!

434
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,600
No, this isn't real. Se Ri.
Se Ri, wake up!

435
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,500
This can't be.

436
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
No.

437
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,500
No!

438
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,370
So, it was Se Ri after all.

439
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,040
Min Kyung Chae,
the very daughter you gave birth to.

440
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,750
Just you wait.

441
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,720
Now that I know Se Ri is your daughter,

442
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,580
I'll make absolutely sure...

443
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,750
that she never calls you her mother.

444
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,160
Se Ri!

445
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,630
Kyung Chae!

446
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,470
What happened? Why are you here?

447
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,870
Are you okay?

448
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,170
You're not hurt, are you?

449
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,910
It's just a little scratch. Why?

450
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,520
Mom!

451
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,690
(Operating Theater Center)

452
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,230
- Did it hurt a lot?
- A little.

(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

454
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,310
I'll make sure she dies without
ever hearing her daughter call her "Mom."

455
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,380
That's the only way she'll understand
a fraction of the pain of losing a child.

456
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,250
You know the man who's been posing as
Director Moon Tae Kyung.

457
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,550
Tell me what you know about him.

458
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,090
You have to trust me.
Just as you always have.

459
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,220
I'm going to find out who you are...

460
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,390
and make sure
you end up as your father did.

461
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,860
I will never let that happen.
