1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,380
Then we will proceed to the vote.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,850
All those in favor of the motion
to dismiss CEO Min Kyung Chae,

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,080
please raise your hand.

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,900
(Mingang Distribution)

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,170
And now, for her successor.

6
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,240
All those in favor of Jung Lucia,

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,810
please raise your hands as well.

8
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,090
What do you think you're doing?

9
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,700
Have you all lost your minds?

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,270
You're dismissing me?

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,030
By whose authority?

12
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,570
You think you'll get away with this?

13
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,940
Not long ago, you all begged for my favor.

14
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,440
You enjoyed every perk I gave you,
and now you do this!

15
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,450
So this is how you stab me in the back!

16
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,520
This vote is void.

17
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,980
I'm the CEO.

18
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,120
- I don't care what you say. I'm the CEO!
- Ms. Min.

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,290
Let go.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,520
- We have to go.
- I'm the CEO!

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,130
- Let's go now.
- Let me go!

22
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,500
- I said, I'm the CEO!
- Please!

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,470
How could they fire me?

24
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,540
They're all out of their minds.
They're completely insane!

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,240
After everything I did for them.

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,780
- You need to calm down.
- How am I supposed to calm down?

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,610
You saw them!
They betrayed me for that woman.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,050
I know, but you need to calm down.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,920
I'm not stepping down like this.
No way I'm letting that woman become CEO!

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,050
Ms. Min!

31
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,290
Going back in there
won't change the outcome.

32
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,460
Please welcome our new CEO
who was elected by a unanimous vote...

33
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,170
of the board with a round of applause.

34
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,540
(Mingang Distribution)

35
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,890
Well, that was unexpected.

36
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,960
Who would've thought
it'd turn out this way?

37
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,400
Since the directors
are all Kyung Chae's people,

38
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
I thought the motion to dismiss her
would be rejected.

39
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,710
Keep that in mind.

40
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,850
The board meeting is about to start.
Have you all decided how you're voting?

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,420
We're all just voting
according to our own thoughts.

42
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,950
Exactly. We'll each make up our own minds.

43
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,660
Why?
Do we look like we're plotting something?

44
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,030
Of course not.
You're all far too principled for that.

45
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,030
I respect the board's wishes
and will abide by its decision.

46
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,800
- Let's head into the meeting.
- Wait, I need you to see this.

47
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,250
Director Jung.

48
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,480
The source of your daughter's study
in the US is unclear.

49
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,450
And then we have Director Park.

50
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,730
The greenbelt land you illegally occupy.
I'm not sure who pulled strings for you,

51
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,460
but the zoning permit was approved.

52
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,500
And here's something on our Director Kim.

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,370
Oh, dear. Your wife was booked
as a habitual gambler,

54
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,310
and yet, she was mysteriously released.

55
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,940
What you three gentlemen have in common...

56
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,550
is that you're all receiving large sums
of money from an anonymous sponsor.

57
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,220
I traced who that sponsor was.
I don't know if it's a coincidence,

58
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,350
but the trail led back
to Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

59
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,260
I found a record
of suspicious withdrawals.

60
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,000
So, what should I report to the chairman?

61
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
He doesn't seem to be aware of this.

62
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,210
I know, right?
I didn't expect this outcome either.

63
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,340
You seem blessed in many ways.

64
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,720
I guess those guys finally know
which side their bread is buttered on.

65
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,350
In any case, this is great.

66
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Now that the board has passed the motion,
there's nothing we can do.

67
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,100
Like it or not, we just have to watch
as that woman takes over.

68
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,770
How can you even say that?

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,770
If she's the CEO, my fate is in her hands.

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,740
That's why I told you
we had to have it rejected by the board.

71
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,110
You think I don't know that?

72
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,880
Why on earth would they side with her?

73
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,680
Whatever their reason, the fact
that they turned their backs on you...

74
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,550
means the board is in her hands now.

75
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,360
So now,
you're officially in that position.

76
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,930
I couldn't tell
when you were the interim CEO,

77
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,030
but now that I see you,

78
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,700
it really suits you.

79
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,230
You think so?

80
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,170
Now that the board has approved it,
barring any major incidents,

81
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,340
there's no way you'll be removed
from that position, Lucia.

82
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,540
Min Kyung Chae isn't going to go down
without a fight.

83
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,510
What's she going to do about it?

84
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,810
It's the position that makes the person.

85
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,820
That's why people bleed and cry for it,

86
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,850
backstab, and conspire.

87
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,960
That position is
more than just a symbolic title.

88
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,330
It's a seat of absolute power
that lets you do anything.

89
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,960
Now that I'm the CEO
of Mingang Distribution,

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,570
I'll be granted access to secret documents
that only the owner family can view.

91
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,040
With that, I'm going to reinvestigate
your parents' accident, Tae Kyung.

92
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,180
I'll find everyone involved
in the cover-up and make them pay...

93
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,510
and reveal the truth.

94
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,320
So you did remember my parents' accident.

95
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,050
I've never forgotten it.

96
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,890
Just like I've never forgotten my Mi So.

97
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,540
Where is Ms. Min Kyung Chae?

98
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,370
I'm not sure.

99
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,570
By the way, what's the result
of the board meeting?

100
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,910
Nothing's been posted on the intranet yet.

101
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,750
As of today, Ms. Min Kyung Chae...

102
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,780
is a permanent employee
of our Online Business Team.

103
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,790
Not a temp. A permanent employee.

104
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,920
So does that mean the board removed her
as CEO?

105
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,000
And the new CEO...

106
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,560
is Ms. Lucia.

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,870
What?

108
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,330
No, this can't be happening!

109
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,270
Vice Director Min,
go find Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

110
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,180
I'm telling you, find a way.
I refuse to work under that woman.

111
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,780
As I've already told you,

112
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,750
there's nothing else we can do.

113
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,150
Find a way!
You're supposed to be brilliant!

114
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,360
Watch your act for the time being.
You need to lie low and ride this out.

115
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,360
It's how you'll get another chance.

116
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,800
Do you understand, Ms. Min?

117
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,840
But why?

118
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,370
Who does she think she is?

119
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,910
Hey! Is it true?

120
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,050
I heard you lost the vote
at the board meeting.

121
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,920
Did that woman really become the new CEO?

122
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,090
- Why are you here?
- Director Moon sent me to find her.

123
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,090
He said everyone's at their desk working,
except for Kyung Chae.

124
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,130
That jerk.
He really expects her to work after this?

125
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,930
Go tell him she's in no condition
to work today.

126
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,730
She should just go in.

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,830
- You know how stubborn Director Moon is.
- He thinks he's the only stubborn one?

128
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,370
She and I both have it out for that jerk.
Tell him to watch his back.

129
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,140
- We could snap at any moment.
- All right, fine.

130
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,080
I'll handle it and make an excuse.
You two should go.

131
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,120
Let's do that.

132
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,180
Let's just get you home for today.

133
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,860
Why are you back alone?

134
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,060
Kyung Chae is
not in a state to work right now.

135
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,560
What do you mean she is
"not in a state to work?"

136
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,670
She's at the office. How is she unable
to work? That's ridiculous.

137
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,940
Where is she right now?

138
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,340
- Take me to her.
- Wait.

139
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,610
She said she wasn't feeling well,
so I told her to go home for the day.

140
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,180
You let her leave?

141
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,850
You should have reported to me first.
Isn't that protocol?

142
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,920
A company isn't some kind of playground.

143
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,320
Hold on!

144
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,290
Just cut her some slack for today.

145
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,960
She was demoted to a staff member
from CEO all of a sudden.

146
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,690
It's more than a demotion.
It's practically a freefall.

147
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,530
With her temper, it's a miracle
she hasn't completely lost it.

148
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,450
Take her to her room
and help her lie down.

149
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,110
- She felt unwell and left early.
- I see.

150
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,090
What's wrong with Kyung Chae, Sun Jae?

151
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820
I'm leaving.

152
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,170
Hold on.

153
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,870
What on earth is going on?

154
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,710
I've never seen you look so pale,
Ms. Kyung Chae.

155
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,350
Where's Se Ri?

156
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,220
She stepped out for a second.

157
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,150
What's going on?

158
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,320
I lost my position as CEO.

159
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,760
- The board of directors approved it.
- What?

160
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,560
What do you mean?

161
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Then who's the new CEO?

162
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,370
Don't tell me...

163
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,570
it's that woman, is it?

164
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,280
Oh, good grief!

165
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,320
Goodness.

166
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,960
It was bad enough
when that woman with no background...

167
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,430
acted like she was the lady of the house.

168
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,330
But now, she's the CEO?

169
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,540
This isn't what I dedicated my entire life
to this family for!

170
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,840
Gosh, Ms. Kyung Chae!

171
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,440
My goodness. How could this happen?

172
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,550
The suspense is worse than
waiting for a Korea-Japan match.

173
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,720
What is? Are you still on
about the CEO of Mingang Distribution?

174
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,790
Gosh, if you're that curious,
why don't you just go see for yourself?

175
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,160
What kind of crazy talk is that?

176
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,300
You think their board meeting
is a public show?

177
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Something I can just go watch?

178
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,170
What do you mean "their board meeting?"
You're a non-executive director, right?

179
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,140
Next to the execs, I'm small potatoes.
And my job is entirely up to the CEO.

180
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,610
So, depending on who the new CEO is,
you could get the axe?

181
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,580
Don't jinx me.
Watch it, or you'll be the first one axed.

182
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,420
- Come on in.
- Hello.

183
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,950
I've been waiting for you
on pins and needles.

184
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,390
You were?

185
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,290
He's been dying to know all day
who Mingang Distribution's new CEO is.

186
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, you're talking about
the board meeting results?

187
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,930
Cut to the chase. Who is it?

188
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,170
The motion to dismiss the former CEO
was approved.

189
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,400
And a new CEO has been appointed.

190
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,070
Then what's going to happen?
What about Ji Seop?

191
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,740
What about my shares?
What about my daughter, Ja Kyung?

192
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,000
What are you doing?

193
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,000
Where's Manager Gong?

194
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,970
I told her I'd cook today.

195
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,770
I wanted to make you something delicious.

196
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,140
Can you guess what I'm making?

197
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,310
Pork belly?

198
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,110
But I can't smell a thing.

199
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,950
Ta-da!

200
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,520
Since the lid is on,
you can't smell what's cooking, can you?

201
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,660
What?
It's tilted so grease doesn't splatter.

202
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,890
This is so convenient.

203
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,090
With this, I could eat grilled pork belly
at home every day.

204
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,060
It keeps rotating automatically,
so we can just leave the cooking to it...

205
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,730
and go talk over there. What do you say?

206
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,710
At the board meeting today,
Kyung Chae was dismissed,

207
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,310
and I was made CEO.

208
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,450
Are you upset?

209
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,720
That I took Kyung Chae's job?

210
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,760
For the board to choose you
over my sister,

211
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,800
I'm sure they had their reasons.

212
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,700
The chairman will be home shortly.

213
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,050
So, basically, Kyung Chae is out,

214
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,810
and it's Lucia's world now, right?

215
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,520
The board approved her appointment,
so it's official.

216
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,750
She can do whatever she wants now.

217
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,450
But wait, I thought the board of directors
was on Kyung Chae's side.

218
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,720
- So why did they suddenly turn on her?
- How would I know?

219
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,660
Anyway, corporations are a strange beast.

220
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,130
Depending on whose side you take,

221
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,600
your whole life can change.

222
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,700
If you know that so well,
why aren't you playing the game?

223
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,440
Then you should pick a side.
You have to go with the winning team.

224
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,040
"Go with the winning team?"

225
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Yes?

226
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,510
Dinner is served.

227
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,580
It's cooked so evenly. It's delicious.

228
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,250
I know, right?
With this, even a total novice like me...

229
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,980
could cook with no problem.

230
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,390
Come on, honey.

231
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,560
You all probably heard the news
on the company intranet.

232
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,790
Your stepmother is the new CEO.

233
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,560
Did you already know?

234
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
And you?

235
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,970
- Yes.
- Well, if you all knew, I wasted my time.

236
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,210
Why wait? Raise your glasses.
We should have a drink to celebrate.

237
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,980
And eat some of
this perfectly cooked meat.

238
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,260
Unbelievable.

239
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,730
Every one of them is
so heartless, cold, and cruel.

240
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,660
Ms. Kyung Chae isn't here,

241
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,860
and not a single person
has asked about her.

242
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,670
That woman is the cause of all this mess.

243
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,380
You should stop drinking.

244
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,710
You won't make it to work tomorrow
if you keep drinking like this.

245
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,310
So what if I can't?
It's not like it's some amazing job.

246
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm just a regular employee.

247
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,290
Why should I even bother
showing up every day?

248
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,120
For that measly paycheck?

249
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,360
Or for a promotion?

250
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,460
Whatever the reason, you have to.

251
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,030
Until you win back the CEO position.

252
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,530
What's the use? She has it all.

253
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,170
The CEO position, the company shares,
and the chairman's favor.

254
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,170
And even Se Ri.

255
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,540
This is exactly when you need
to pull yourself together.

256
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,710
You have to tough it out.

257
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,810
If you give up and walk away,

258
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,680
you're just playing right into her hands.

259
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,720
Tough it out?

260
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,990
Absolutely.

261
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,020
It's the only way you'll get it all back.

262
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,730
The CEO position...

263
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,390
and Se Ri too.

264
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,600
You don't have to act like it's nothing,

265
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,210
not with me.

266
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,580
You mean about you becoming CEO?

267
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,180
I know how much Kyung Chae means to you.

268
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,680
It's okay to admit you're upset.

269
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,390
I know you were distant with Kyung Chae
because I told you to be.

270
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Well, that's just...

271
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,300
because she's been a real disappointment
in many ways.

272
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,070
I'm proud of you. You listened to me
and did as I told you.

273
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,240
Just keep doing as I say,
and you'll always be my perfect daughter.

274
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,750
Come here.

275
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,160
You're really not going to do it?

276
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,730
- I won't.
- Why not?

277
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,030
There are other people here.
Why are you picking on me?

278
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,640
You're the most junior member of the team.
Should your seniors do it instead?

279
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,140
If you're so eager to congratulate her,
you do it.

280
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,210
What do you think you're doing?

281
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,280
If you keep this up,
I won't tolerate it any longer.

282
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,020
Forget the performance review.
If you're not a team player,

283
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,590
I have no use for you!

284
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,950
(Mingang Distribution)

285
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,250
Oh, you really didn't have to.

286
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,590
That's why we kept it small,
just the team.

287
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,060
We felt we had to offer
our congratulations.

288
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Thank you.

289
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,560
The Online Business Team
hasn't changed a bit.

290
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,430
I've been wondering about all of you.
Everyone's been doing well, right?

291
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

292
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,910
I'm looking forward to working
with all of you.

293
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,410
We should be saying that to you, CEO Jung.

294
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,410
If you need anything at all,
feel free to come and talk to me.

295
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,420
My door will always be open
for all of you.

296
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,750
Oh, thank you, CEO Jung!

297
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,220
Just as we expected.

298
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,160
Hold on. It's the CEO's first day,
and there's not even a bouquet of flowers?

299
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,830
Hey, Tae Gon.

300
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,660
Didn't you take care of it?

301
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,300
I thought it was taken care of.

302
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,630
Oh, here she comes now.

303
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,330
Congratulations...

304
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,430
on your first day,

305
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,170
CEO Jung.

306
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,080
Thank you.

307
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,990
You did well.

308
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,120
For now, we just have to let it slide.

309
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,320
If we make a scene,
we're the ones who'll get burned.

310
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,030
We should be grateful we got off this easy
with the livestream incident.

311
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,170
I can't believe it.
Min Kyung Chae gave you a bouquet?

312
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,700
What a shame I missed the show.

313
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,170
You must have felt so satisfied.

314
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,380
More than satisfying,
it's just given me a lot to think about.

315
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,010
About what?

316
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,750
Just thinking about everything
it took to get here,

317
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,250
and how none of it was easy.

318
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,220
Right?
Where would you even begin with that?

319
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,590
Don't overthink it.
You're almost at the finish line.

320
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,830
You should keep the CEO job
until you become chairman...

321
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,860
and take over Mingang Distribution.

322
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,130
Now that we have the board on our side,
we'll just sweet-talk them,

323
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,170
secure their stake for us,

324
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,610
and kick out every last one of those Mins.

325
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,370
Then we'll be the ones calling the shots.

326
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,950
Is that for real?

327
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,450
Hey, don't even get me started.

328
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,550
She trembled
as she handed over the flowers.

329
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,420
It finally hit me that Kyung Chae's fate
is in that woman's hands now.

330
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,460
So what are you going to do now?

331
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,560
What can I do? I'll just go with the flow.

332
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,500
What about you?

333
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,570
Well, I'm not sure.

334
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,600
I don't know whether to side
with my half-sister...

335
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,210
or with that woman.

336
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,240
Hey, when in doubt,
just go with the winning side.

337
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,780
"Watch the show and enjoy the spoils."
They say that for a reason.

338
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,560
Take this to the CEO's office
and get it signed.

339
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,060
You want me to do this?

340
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,700
To the CEO's office, of all places?

341
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,400
Who else is going to do it?

342
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,570
You do it, Director Moon.

343
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,640
Hey, Ms. Min Kyung Chae!

344
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,870
(Mingang Distribution)

345
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,360
(CEO Jung Lucia)

346
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,830
I bet you want to throw it down.

347
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,260
From now on, do your job properly.

348
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,530
No more pulling tricks or deceiving people
like you did during the livestream.

349
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,970
If you pull something like that again,

350
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,970
I promise you, you're finished.

351
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,910
Aren't you going to answer me?

352
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Okay.

353
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,020
Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

354
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,320
Get it together.

355
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,160
I'll be watching you.

356
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,240
Just let her be.

357
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,640
Looks like she wants to play CEO.

358
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,810
I suppose I have to put up with it.

359
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,680
It's the only way I'll get it all back.

360
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Of course.

361
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,930
(Mingang Distribution)

362
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,290
This is the provisional contract for
our new store at Doil Department Store.

363
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,730
Since it's our first launch in one of
the country's big three department stores,

364
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,470
a lot of other companies
are showing interest.

365
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,070
When's the off-site meeting again?

366
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,500
In two hours.

367
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,840
We're finalizing the contract today
and solidifying our partnership.

368
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,410
It also seems like the perfect opportunity
to introduce...

369
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,950
our new CEO.

370
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,490
It's an important meeting
for the company and me.

371
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,790
It is.

372
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,520
It's your first official appearance
as the CEO of Mingang Distribution.

373
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,430
What about that report that was due today?

374
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,670
There was a lot more data than I expected.

375
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,040
I might only finish it
just before I leave.

376
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,770
I'm not slacking off, I swear.

377
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,910
Everyone here can vouch for me.

378
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
Did I say you were?

379
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,750
I have an off-site meeting later
with the CEO...

380
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,320
about the Doil Department Store deal,

381
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,980
so just get me the report by tomorrow.

382
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,120
Doil Department Store?

383
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,050
You mean for the new store contract?

384
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,460
Yes. What about it?

385
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,390
And who are you putting in charge of that?

386
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,900
Do you have any idea
how important that deal is?

387
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,570
That's exactly why the CEO
is handling it herself.

388
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,070
What, did you think they'd send
a regular employee like you?

389
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,810
Doil Department Store.

390
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,150
I put so much work into that deal.

391
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,210
The provisional contract alone
took a whole year,

392
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,780
and she's going to take all the credit?

393
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,750
I can't let that happen.

394
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,420
Absolutely not!

395
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,790
That's it.

396
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,370
(CEO Jung Lucia)

397
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,570
Mom. It's Se Ri.

398
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,910
I came by the office to see you,
and I accidentally fell.

399
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,310
I twisted my ankle.

400
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,980
I'm in the third-floor supply room.
Can you come right away?

401
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,820
(Tae Kyung)

402
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,090
About the meeting.

403
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,090
Traffic is going to be bad.
Shouldn't we get going now?

404
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,660
The meeting place
is in a really congested area.

405
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,830
Oh, right. I'll be right out.

406
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,770
What am I going to do about Se Ri?

407
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,820
The meeting comes first.
What is she to me, anyway?

408
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,350
I'm just playing the part of her mother.
Did I start to think I was her real mom?

409
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,250
Unbelievable.

410
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,630
Something just came up...

411
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,630
(Something just came up...)

412
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,610
But she'll wait for me until I get there.

413
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,160
I have to make a quick stop first.

414
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,530
It won't take long.

415
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,970
Se Ri!

416
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,240
Min Se Ri.

417
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,140
Min Se Ri, where are you?

418
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,720
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)
