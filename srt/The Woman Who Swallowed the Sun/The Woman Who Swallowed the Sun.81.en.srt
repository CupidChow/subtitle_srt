00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,080
(Episode 81)

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,780
This is all the evidence we need.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,310
Let's go straight
to the chairman's office.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,130
Hold on. Let me see that.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,930
And what are you going to do with it?

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,670
If you didn't steal it,
you'd have no reason not to show me.

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,840
I guess it was stolen, then.

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,370
- Watch your mouth.
- That's why I'm asking to see it.

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,810
I'm not going to take it from you.
What's the big deal?

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,150
Is it going to cost you money
or take any effort?

11
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,450
If it were me, I'd just show you
and get it over with.

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,920
Hand it over
while I'm still asking nicely.

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,490
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- You might get hurt.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,030
It'll be pretty humiliating
when I take it from you by force.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,230
Go ahead. Try me if you're confident.

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,230
But just by looking, it's pretty obvious
we're in different weight classes, right?

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,970
You're a lightweight.

18
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,600
And I'm a middleweight.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,040
What did you just say?

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,310
How dare you call me a lightweight?

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,910
Why you little...

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,180
Bring it on!

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,050
Hey!

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,760
Where did they get this?

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,200
- Stay still.
- How dare you manipulate sales and steal?

26
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,000
And you expect to be called the CEO?
This could get you kicked out of Mingang.

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,000
I said, stay put!

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,210
You think this will destroy the evidence?
Just you wait.

29
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,170
I'll make sure the chairman, the board...
No, every single employee...

30
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,310
will know exactly what you've done.

31
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,580
Give it to me!

32
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,210
Hey, let go of this! Get off me!

33
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,580
- I said, you're not getting up!
- Get off me!

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,880
I told you to stay down, you hear me?

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,750
Hey, I said let go!

36
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,950
Why you...

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,720
What do you all think you're doing?

38
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,730
What a mess.

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,130
What is the meaning of this?

40
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,930
Have you no respect?

41
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,840
Is she your friend?

42
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,040
You wouldn't even treat a friend
this horribly.

43
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,240
Forget treating her like your stepmother.
You should at least show some courtesy.

44
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,880
Are you okay?

45
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,450
- Are you hurt?
- I'd rather be the one who gets hurt.

46
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,090
I just couldn't stand by and watch them
burn our brand-new products.

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,060
What are you talking about?
Who would do that to our new products?

48
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,130
Are you going to tell him? Or should I?

49
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,100
What are you waiting for?
The chairman is waiting.

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,010
Gosh, what is this?

51
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,010
It's not going to hurt us one bit.

52
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,950
You clearly don't know how things work.

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,650
Even if he is the chairman,
firing and hiring a CEO...

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,220
is not something he can do on his own.
The board isn't a pushover.

55
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,190
Really? If it's not going to hurt you,
then why did you try so hard to stop us?

56
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,230
From what I saw, you were fighting
like your life depended on it.

57
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,500
That's because...

58
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,000
it does no good to make a scene.

59
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,500
My point is,

60
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,900
if you hadn't faked sales with bulk buys
and siphoned off products,

61
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,270
there wouldn't be a problem, would there?

62
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,710
So you're determined to
blow this out of proportion?

63
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,680
Over something so trivial?

64
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,480
"Trivial?"

65
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,220
You call
putting the CEO position at risk trivial?

66
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,660
If things had gone wrong,
someone could have died.

67
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,360
Died?
What on earth are you talking about now?

68
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,090
Are you really asking
because you don't know?

69
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,330
Because of what you did.

70
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,730
You know what? Never mind.

71
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,240
The truth will come out
one way or another.

72
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,600
And we all know how this will end for you.

73
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,440
So let me get this straight.

74
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,350
You're saying she used bulk buys
to steal inventory?

75
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,680
She hid it in the warehouse,
and you caught her.

76
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,490
I caught them just as they were about to
burn the products to destroy the evidence.

77
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,220
Is everything she's saying true?

78
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,530
That you faked sales, boosted performance,
and used a troll farm?

79
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,060
And that you tried to burn new products
we haven't even sold yet?

80
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,000
I could forgive the rest,
but does it make any sense for someone...

81
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,010
in the distribution business to destroy
a brand-new product with their own hands?

82
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,670
It's not like that, Father.

83
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,480
I would never do something like that.

84
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,410
It's all a misunderstanding.

85
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,750
Why would I?

86
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,650
Who do you think you're lying to?
Is the chairman your friend?

87
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,750
Why are you doing this to me?

88
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,220
I beat you fair and square.

89
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,890
Are you just being a sore loser?

90
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,530
What did you say?
Aren't you going to tell the truth?

91
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,730
Don't fall for it, Father.

92
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,900
You think I can't see what you're doing?
You're just framing me because you lost.

93
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,170
You have to turn my father against me,

94
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,500
so you can take
the CEO position officially!

95
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,340
Then call in Director Moon Tae Kyung
and ask him yourself.

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,550
He's seen the fake sales records,
the doctored shipping labels,

97
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,420
and the warehouse where the new products
were sent. He's confirmed everything.

98
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,190
As you can see here,
large quantities were bought with one ID,

99
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,130
and we can confirm they were all shipped
to the address in question.

100
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,770
- And where was that?
- A warehouse.

101
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,240
Our livestream products
were stacked up in there,

102
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,170
and according to the workers there,

103
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,010
they were ordered
to incinerate everything.

104
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,080
By Ms. Min Kyung Chae
and Lawyer Kim Sun Jae themselves.

105
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,280
If you'd like, I can bring them in
to confirm their story.

106
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,250
No, that's not true, Chairman!

107
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,920
I mean, Father.

108
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,320
He's lying too.

109
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,360
The two of them are in on this together.

110
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,160
Why are you all doing this to me?

111
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,130
Do you really think the chairman
is going to fall for your act?

112
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,300
You little...

113
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,970
Who's the one who's lying here?

114
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,440
Are you really going to lie
to your own father to the very end?

115
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,340
I told you it's not true.

116
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,870
Why would I do that to you, Father?

117
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,580
Please believe me.

118
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,780
I swear, I didn't do any of it.

119
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,150
Are you really going to deny it
to the end?

120
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,350
Do you want to see the chairman
collapse again?

121
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,530
So, what happened?

122
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,360
You should have denied it to the end.

123
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,930
I did.

124
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,030
I insisted,
whether they believed me or not.

125
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,100
Good.
Now the chairman can't rush to judgment.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,440
I know Father better than anyone.

127
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,910
He might let the other things slide,

128
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,810
but he'll never forgive me
for trying to burn new products.

129
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,810
So what do we do now?

130
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,680
This isn't going to blow up
in our faces, is it?

131
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,250
I don't know, okay?

132
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,590
The nerve of that brat.
A distributor treating products like that?

133
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,930
The buyer list, the troll farm they used,
the malicious comments about our products,

134
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,500
and even the sabotage of our sales.
I can provide proof for all of it.

135
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,270
- If you want, I can do it right now.
- That's enough. I've heard all I need to.

136
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,140
She inflated sales, bought her own stock,
and even tried to burn the products.

137
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,310
What more is there to say?

138
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,980
If word of this gets out,
our partners will be in a tough spot too.

139
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,280
So we should just bury it?

140
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,680
This is no small matter.

141
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,380
Let's keep this internal for now
and start by correcting the sales records.

142
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,320
We could get hit with a hefty fine
for reporting false revenue,

143
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,290
so let's contact the relevant department
and have them fix the data.

144
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,290
I can't believe what she's stooped to.

145
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,430
Seriously, how did Kyung Chae
get so messed up?

146
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,770
So on the livestream, your sister won big,
and your stepmom completely bombed.

147
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,810
She never should have gone up
against Kyung Chae.

148
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,240
She's no match.

149
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,080
That's because you don't know
the whole story.

150
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,380
Mom just had a bad day on the broadcast.
It's not like she's worse than Kyung Chae.

151
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,650
Why? What happened on the broadcast?

152
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,160
My mom is allergic to seafood, like me,
and she just had to pick that one.

153
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,360
Manager Gong, you know, right?
Mom went to the hospital that day.

154
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,360
That may be true,
but Madam Jung brought it on herself.

155
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,370
- No one else picked it for her.
- Exactly.

156
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,740
She picked it with her own two hands
in front of everyone.

157
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,240
Luck is a skill.

158
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,080
Nobody said it wasn't.

159
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,850
She won't let me get a word in edgewise.
Why is she so eager to defend her?

160
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,920
Her own daughter wouldn't even
defend her like that.

161
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,730
Ms. Se Ri, if you keep this up,
I'm done covering for you.

162
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,770
What are you talking about? What did I do?

163
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,910
Even Ms. Ja Kyung says so.

164
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,280
No matter what anyone says,
Ms. Kyung Chae is the rightful CEO.

165
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,880
Who said she isn't?

166
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,480
Please don't be like that.

167
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,010
Ms. Kyung Chae
is working so hard right now.

168
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,850
She got on the chairman's bad side
because of that last incident,

169
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,020
and she's working hard to make up for it.

170
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,150
Kyung Chae's been the CEO for a long time.

171
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,120
That's all the more reason for her
to aim for the chairman's seat.

172
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,060
No matter how much you like your mother,

173
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,860
you should be on your sister's side.

174
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,160
Blood is thicker than water,
and you should stay loyal.

175
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,840
- I don't care either way!
- But you should.

176
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,540
Chairman Min is being tougher
than I expected.

177
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,740
Then again, rather than being sent
to a nursing home,

178
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,610
letting Mingang be ruined would be
even more unacceptable to him.

179
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,620
After all, he's a man who values
his company more than his own life.

180
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,390
But he can't force Min Kyung Chae
out by himself.

181
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,120
The board will push back,

182
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,520
especially since they've always pushed
for family management.

183
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,160
- Then Min Kyung Chae's fate ultimately...
- Rests in my hands.

184
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,830
No. I have to make it that way.

185
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,070
To do that, I must be officially appointed
as CEO, no matter what.

186
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,940
If we can exclude Min Kyung Chae
from management somehow,

187
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,180
Kim Sun Jae will leave of his own accord.

188
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,950
The board is the problem.

189
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,850
If I can just get the board's approval,
I'll be able to breathe a little easier.

190
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,330
Why are you just standing around
instead of working?

191
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,370
Do you have something to say to me?

192
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,870
We need to talk.

193
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,350
Why are you backing me
into a corner like this?

194
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,580
What do you mean?

195
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,020
If you had competed fairly from the start,
none of this would've happened.

196
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,520
Who was the one who brought you
into Mingang in the first place?

197
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,790
Who was the one who trusted you
and stood by you through every crisis?

198
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,660
Why are you turning your back on me now?

199
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,260
Whatever you feel for Lucia,
she's with another man now.

200
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,600
There's no future for you with her.

201
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,770
What on earth are you talking about?

202
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,140
If it's not that,

203
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,610
do you really think siding with them
guarantees your future?

204
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,940
- It's definitely not that.
- Then why are you doing this?

205
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,810
Why are you making things so hard
for me at every turn?

206
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,180
Listen here, Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,050
Have you ever heard the saying?

208
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,290
Your sins will always find you out,

209
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,860
and your good deeds will be rewarded.

210
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,630
There's a reason they say
life is like a boomerang.

211
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,900
Because what you throw out comes back
to hit you.

212
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,500
That's why you have to live
an honorable life.

213
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,170
Because that's what life is all about.

214
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,250
(Mingang Distribution)

215
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,280
Yes?

216
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,590
It's about the chain store's payment
for the livestream event.

217
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,730
Sales were so low.
It's practically nothing.

218
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,700
I never would have shown their products
on the livestream if I'd known.

219
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,370
We would've made much more
if we'd run a sale at the store.

220
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,940
This position is too much for you
after all.

221
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,440
You fought to be the lady of the house,
but the company is another story.

222
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,780
The CEO position is no small thing, is it?

223
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,090
Since you lost to my sister,

224
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,920
shouldn't you step down as interim CEO?

225
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,260
You haven't heard the news, have you?

226
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,900
Min Kyung Chae...

227
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,470
will never sit in this chair again.

228
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,100
What do you mean by that?

229
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,770
But there's such a huge gap
in the livestream sales.

230
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,540
She really got on the chairman's bad side.

231
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,150
Forget being the CEO. She'll be lucky
if she doesn't get fired.

232
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,150
What does she mean,
"on the chairman's bad side?"

233
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,060
Come to my office now.

234
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,100
What is it?

235
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,310
I just heard something strange coming
from the CEO's office.

236
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,040
What on earth is going on?

237
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,810
Did something happen during the livestream
that I don't know about?

238
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,250
If I ask Kyung Chae directly,
I know she'd be too proud to tell me.

239
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,790
How can I help if I don't know
what's going on?

240
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,960
And what could you possibly do to help?

241
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,600
That woman, Lucia,
said Kyung Chae will never become the CEO.

242
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,530
Lucia said that?

243
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,900
She seemed so sure of herself.

244
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,210
Don't tell me you and Kyung Chae
cheated during the livestream.

245
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,410
So the chairman found out.

246
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,710
Then he'll call a board meeting soon,
won't he?

247
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,480
And you still think
you don't need my help?

248
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,850
It's not like everyone on the board
is on Kyung Chae's side.

249
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,160
The board requires a unanimous vote.
So go on, let's see how you do.

250
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,230
You want me to ask Soo Jung for help?

251
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,000
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

252
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,440
This is no time for pride.

253
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,470
At the board meeting,
if Soo Jung's right-hand man,

254
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,470
Director Oh, votes against you...

255
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,640
And you want me to go groveling
to Soo Jung?

256
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,410
Besides, a board meeting
hasn't even been called yet.

257
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,380
They probably will, and soon.
You said it yourself.

258
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,980
That the chairman wouldn't
just let this slide.

259
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,020
Even so, I'm not bowing down to Soo Jung.

260
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,590
Normally, I wouldn't push you like this.

261
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,460
But with Lucia by the chairman's side,

262
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,060
there's no telling what she'll make him do
to you.

263
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,730
Even so, you think Father
would kick me out himself?

264
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,900
No.

265
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,910
He won't have to.
Lucia will be more than happy to do it.

266
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,520
Being a regular employee would be fine.

267
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,920
What more can he do?

268
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,330
He won't call a board meeting.

269
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,200
He knows perfectly well
I have my people on the board.

270
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,570
Father wouldn't go that far.

271
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,970
Who becomes the CEO of Mingang
is a crucial matter for us too.

272
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,440
What are you talking about?
What difference does it make to us?

273
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,410
Is it going to make us money
or put food on the table?

274
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,980
- You're like a pickled radish, Mal Sook.
- A pickled radish? What does that mean?

275
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,620
- You're simple, ignorant, and a pain.
- Why you...

276
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,490
Think about it, okay?
If the in-law's older daughter returns,

277
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,130
it's a given she'll take over Mingang.
Where would that leave Ji Seop's chances?

278
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,800
And what if her young stepmom
takes over instead?

279
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,230
In that case, he might not become CEO,
but could be a director.

280
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,910
The young stepmom has no company allies.
And the chairman won't be around forever.

281
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,110
In a company, if you don't have allies,
you're toast.

282
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,510
So, to build her own base of power,

283
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,220
- she might take our Ji Seop on her team?
- Exactly.

284
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,680
You're not a pickled radish after all.

285
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,790
The eldest has a strong board behind her.
Would she even notice Ji Seop?

286
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,560
Oh, my goodness!
Now that you mention it, that makes sense.

287
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,930
Your sneaky little brain is one of a kind.

288
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,170
- What? Sneaky little brain?
- Yes.

289
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,600
Come here. See how you like a headbutt
from this "sneaky little brain."

290
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,470
Hey! You blockhead! Gosh, that hurts.

291
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,870
- Your head's a rock.
- How dare you mess with me?

292
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,440
Gosh, seriously!

293
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,840
You blockhead!

294

(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

295
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,450
As interim CEO,
I can only handle urgent approvals.

296
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,020
It's just frustrating being so limited.

297
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,020
If I were officially appointed CEO,

298
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,290
I could be so much more helpful to you.

299
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,300
It's not that I'm greedy for the position.
I just want to be more helpful to you.

300
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,770
I know,
but that requires the board's approval.

301
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,840
If all else fails,
I'll use my authority to push it through.

302
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,710
Please don't.
I need to go through the proper channels.

303
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,380
I must earn the CEO position legitimately.
Otherwise, this unfair appointment...

304
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,550
will come back to haunt you.

305
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,780
I'll handle it. Just call a board meeting.

306
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,220
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

307
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,600
Send out the official notice
for the board meeting.

308
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,800
And make sure you contact
every single director.

309
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,230
The agenda?

310
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,940
Motion to dismiss CEO Min Kyung Chae
and appoint Jung Lucia as the new CEO.

311
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,310
What did you say?

312
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,780
So you're saying
he gave that order officially?

313
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,620
He said to post it on the intranet.
Then, of course, it's official!

314
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,960
See?
I told you they'd call a board meeting.

315
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,670
The board is full of my people.
I didn't think he'd make a move so easily.

316
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,730
I'm telling you,
that woman put him up to it.

317
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,170
That's why you have to go to Director Min
and ask for her help now.

318
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,980
You're finished if this goes through.

319
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,980
Once the board approves it,
there's no going back.

320
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,260
What's the occasion? You actually knocked.

321
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,900
Of course I should.

322
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,870
I didn't want to interrupt your work.

323
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,270
It's kind of scary
seeing you act like this.

324
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
I think you've got me all wrong.

325
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,810
I just wear my heart on my sleeve,
that's all.

326
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,540
I don't play games.

327
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,110
Is that right?

328
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,720
Fine. What do you want?

329
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,320
- You know about the board meeting, right?
- I saw it on the intranet.

330
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,290
- And?
- Director Oh is your man.

331
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,160
I need your help.

332
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,560
Why would I do that?

333
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,630
We're sisters, aren't we?

334
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,040
And wipe that strained smile
off your face.

335
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,810
So, are you asking me for a favor now?

336
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,940
Yes.

337
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,380
I'm asking for your help.

338
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,580
Once the board meeting is called, I'm sure
the directors loyal to Min Kyung Chae...

339
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,480
will vote against her dismissal.

340
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,920
If that happens, you'll have no choice
but to step down.

341
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,620
Exactly. There can't be two CEOs at once.

342
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,260
Even after the mess Min Kyung Chae made,
you think they'll still vote against it?

343
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,300
They'll probably just cover it up,
considering how deep their collusion runs.

344
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,370
Then we have no other choice.
We must use those connections to win.

345
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,710
Oh, and before that, tell Min Soo Jung
to work her magic on Director Oh.

346
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,310
If Director Oh votes no, it's all over.

347
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,880
Min Kyung Chae has probably already gone
to her office.

348
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,810
She's likely pleading with her
as we speak.

349
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,920
So what's your plan?
Are you going to go plead with her too?

350
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,820
No.
That's not the way to handle Min Soo Jung.

351
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,690
So...

352
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,160
you want me to have Director Oh vote
for Min Kyung Chae's dismissal?

353
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,830
Director Oh is your man, isn't he?

354
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,970
Fine.

355
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,570
Easy enough.

356
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,510
Give me the chairman's stake,
and it's a deal.

357
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,940
- That matter is closed.
- Then it's no deal.

358
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,540
Is that so?

359
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,480
Then I suppose your position
won't be safe forever, either.

360
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,950
My sister came to ask for a favor.

361
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,950
But you're here threatening me.

362
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,620
Even if Director Oh votes no alone,
it won't change the outcome.

363
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,330
It will only delay the inevitable.

364
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,330
I'll become the CEO one way or another.

365
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,500
Then why did you even bother coming here?

366
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,070
I'm giving you one last chance.

367
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,540
A chance to get on my side.

368
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,040
- Excuse me?
- A chance to side with the one in power.

369
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,880
It's the only way to survive.

370
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,350
Since you clawed your way up...

371
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,450
as an illegitimate child
of the Min family,

372
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,720
you should know better than anyone.

373
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,480
It's all about the power dynamic.

374
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
And who's on top.

375
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,920
Since you went to such lengths,

376
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,790
I'm sure Director Min will do her part.

377
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,060
This is so demeaning and petty.

378
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,260
An interim CEO is one thing,

379
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,870
but if that woman gets formal approval
from the board...

380
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,570
and it's reported at the general meeting,
it can't be undone.

381
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,570
- We can't let that happen.
- Exactly.

382
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,740
I'm telling you, you have to be ready
to bend over backward for Director Min.

383
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,140
You want me to do more than that?

384
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,050
I was in her office, fawning and smiling.
I did everything I could.

385
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,080
Just put up with it
until the board meeting tomorrow.

386
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,330
Is there any coffee left?

387
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,530
Here, have mine.

388
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,210
I can count on you
at the board meeting tomorrow, right?

389
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,180
The way you're asking,
I can't exactly refuse.

390
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,250
Well, then,
why don't you get on your knees?

391
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,790
Right here?

392
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,120
Fine.

393
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,190
What does it matter where I do it?

394
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,900
Hey, I was just messing with you.
Are you really going to do it?

395
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,260
Why wouldn't I?

396
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,070
What are you doing?

397
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,240
It's nothing.

398
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,310
Okay, I see how important this is to you.
I'll think about it.

399
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,150
Wait, you weren't actually about to kneel
to Soo Jung, were you?

400
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,950
I must have seen that wrong, right?

401
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,690
You saw wrong.

402
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,720
So, what are you going to do about
the board meeting tomorrow?

403
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,960
If you actually get fired
and that woman becomes the CEO...

404
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,230
That's not going to happen,
so don't worry!

405
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,800
(Mingang Distribution)

406
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,280
Don't you worry.

407
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,720
Director Oh has sent word
that he won't be attending,

408
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,750
and that he'll abide by
the board's decision.

409
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,550
Oh, really?

410
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,360
Looks like Soo Jung pulled
some strings after all.

411
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,890
See? Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

412
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,330
Once you humbled yourself to Director Min,
everything was resolved.

413
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,370
I've already made a reservation
at a nice wine bar.

414
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,370
It's a foregone conclusion.

415
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,110
You're right.
The board would never vote to dismiss me.

416
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,550
They know which side their bread
is buttered on.

417
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,980
Even the chairman couldn't touch you,
knowing the board was on your side.

418
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,950
So what makes that woman think
she can change their minds?

419
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,360
It's almost too easy.
This vote is just a formality.

420
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,560
Maybe you should start getting ready
to take back your CEO position.

421
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,360
I don't think I'll be able
to keep a straight face.

422
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,530
Even so, you have to keep a poker face.
This is a serious meeting.

423
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,740
Should I look all pitiful and anxious,

424
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,110
maybe even shed a tear,
worried that I might get fired?

425
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,550
This meeting is to decide on the dismissal
of CEO Min Kyung Chae...

426
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,320
and the appointment of Jung Lucia,

427
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,420
who has been recommended as the new CEO.

428
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,330
Members of the board, please state
your positions on this matter.

429
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,570
Someone like you?

430
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,570
In your dreams.

431
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,840
They'd jump if I told them so.

432
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:15,380
There's no way they will dismiss me
and appoint you CEO.

433
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,080
We, the board of directors,

434
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,850
cannot possibly accept the motion
to dismiss CEO Min Kyung Chae.

435
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,660
Of course.
It's absurd to consider another CEO.

436
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,260
Yes, there was a minor misstep
during the livestream,

437
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,700
but to fire her overnight
for that is ridiculous.

438
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,570
She can be held accountable
for that mistake in other ways.

439
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,970
But to use it as an excuse to replace her?

440
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,910
This is an upstart trying to take over.

441
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,570
If it's not CEO Min Kyung Chae,

442
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,310
we will not recognize
anyone else as our CEO.

443
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,590
Then we will proceed to the vote.

444
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,790
All those in favor of the motion
to dismiss CEO Min Kyung Chae,

445
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,460
please raise your hand.

446
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,710
(Mingang Distribution)

447
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,950
And now, for her successor.

448
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,690
All those in favor of Jung Lucia,
please raise your hands as well.

449
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,440
Have you all lost your minds?

450
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,900
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

451
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,310
I'm not stepping down like this.
No way I'm letting that woman become CEO!

452
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,820
You need to lie low and ride this out.
It's how you'll get another chance.

453
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,720
Congratulations on your first day,
CEO Jung.

454
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,590
You'd better get your act together.
If you pull something like that again,

455
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,060
I promise you, you're finished.

456
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,560
So you're saying
there's no way out of this?

457
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,130
The chairman's will gives us a chance.
When the time's right,

458
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,030
you can take over
and make everything right again.

459
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,740
