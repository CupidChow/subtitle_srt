1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,240
This is our Se Ri we're talking about!

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,080
She, of all people, can't act this way!
She's her grandmother!

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,630
But Se Ri...

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,300
isn't Madam Jang's granddaughter.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,870
Her real granddaughter is someone else.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,140
And you have no idea
the two of them were switched.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,210
Knowing the truth,
how would Madam Jang take your side?

8
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,820
You're the only fool
who's still in the dark.

9
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,280
What did I just hear?

10
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,750
The two girls...

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,520
were switched?

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,360
(Episode 113)

13
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,830
Who are you people?

14
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,630
Who sent you?

15
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,070
That's none of your business.
You'd better come with us quietly.

16
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,340
If I come quietly, you'll let me live?

17
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,600
Well...

18
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,670
Come with us, and you'll find out.

19
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,340
Did Chairman Min Doo Sik send you?

20
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,850
Is this how you got rid of Jo Pil Doo too?

21
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,580
You ask too many questions.

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,520
What are you waiting for? Get him.

23
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,130
Why you...

24
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,850
My goodness, what's wrong?
Did something happen?

25
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,950
- Where's Se Ri?
- She's not back yet.

26
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,750
She called and said she'll be late.

27
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
Why?

28
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,200
What's gotten into you?
What awful thing did you hear this time?

29
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,570
Did that woman give you
a hard time at the company again?

30
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,510
That's not what's important right now.

31
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,050
What? Did something even worse happen?

32
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,920
Lawyer Kim says...

33
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,350
our Se Ri was switched with someone else.

34
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,160
Manager Gong, what's with that reaction?

35
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,830
Did you know about this?

36
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
No.

37
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,040
What would I know?
How could someone like me find out?

38
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,770
Is that all Lawyer Kim said?

39
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,380
Did he say who Se Ri was switched with?

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,380
Did he happen to mention
who the other girl's mother is?

41
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,110
No.

42
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,520
Just that Se Ri was switched.

43
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,350
Gosh, that's all?

44
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,190
Then it's nothing. Don't pay it any mind.

45
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,890
He broke off the engagement
to chase after Ms. Soo Jung.

46
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,890
The nerve of him.

47
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,960
He's nothing but an animal.

48
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,130
Why would you listen to a word
that man says?

49
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,270
It's just complete nonsense,
so let it go in one ear and out the other.

50
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,440
He's just trying to get a rise out of you.

51
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,510
It's so obvious what he's doing.

52
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,610
Do you really think so?

53
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,880
Of course. I'd bet my life on it.

54
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,150
Wait here.
I'll go make you some herbal tea.

55
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,120
It'll help you calm down.

56
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,890
I'll be right back.

57
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,240
Is Se Ri not back yet?

58
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,850
Look at her, fussing over her own child.

59
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,980
But as long as I'm alive,
she'll never get her hands on Ms. Se Ri.

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,550
Just you wait.

61
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,050
She called earlier
to say she was working late.

(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

64
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Oh, my.

65
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,610
What happened to your face?

66
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,020
I just had a run-in
with some thugs last night.

67
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,650
Did you report it to the police?

68
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,790
No. It wasn't really
that kind of situation.

69
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,860
What do you mean,
"not that kind of situation?"

70
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,690
Was it someone you know?

71
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,700
I don't know the guys who jumped me,

72
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,130
but I have a pretty good idea...

73
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,800
who was behind it.

74
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Don't tell me...

75
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
it was Chairman Min.

76
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,710
I'm sure my guess is right.

77
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,810
I told you that he's not going to
just stand by and do nothing...

78
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,010
now that he knows who I am.

79
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,350
He couldn't do anything
because he was unconscious,

80
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,980
but things are different now.

81
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,020
He'll try to get rid of me first
since I'm the biggest thorn in his side.

82
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,260
After everything he did to your parents,
how could he do this again?

83
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,930
You know he's not the type
to feel regret and reflect on himself.

84
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,200
He just piles new sins
on top of his old ones.

85
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,170
That's the only way he knows how to live.

(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

87
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,640
Don't do this.
Any evidence you get this way...

88
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,980
won't be admissible in court.
You know that perfectly well.

89
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,920
But I can't just sit back and do nothing.

90
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,390
Let's find your parents' contract
and take Chairman Min to court...

91

as soon as tomorrow.

92
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,490
All right. I know how you feel,

93
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,830
but let's just focus on
what's right in front of us.

94
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,530
I'll be fine.

95
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,920
- Manager Gong. I want a cup too.
- Okay.

96
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,360
Lawyer Kim says...

97
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,060
our Se Ri was switched with someone else.

98
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,900
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing?

99
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,230
What's on your mind? You're so out of it.

100
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,100
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

101
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,070
I can't just stay here.

102
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,240
Ms. Ja Kyung,
I need to step out for a bit.

103
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,080
Where are you going? Come on!

104
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,850
Look at her, dumping this on me again.

105
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,150
What am I going to do with this?

106
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,380
So, what did you want to talk about?

107
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,650
As if you don't know.

108
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,060
Why did you have to say something
so reckless to Ms. Kyung Chae?

109
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,920
She was grilling me
about Ms. Se Ri all night.

110
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,290
She was asking what you meant
when you said Ms. Se Ri was switched.

111
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,900
And she said she heard it from you.

112
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,070
Gosh, when did she hear that?

113
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,970
You came here just to argue about it?

114
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,770
Look, to be blunt,
it's not like I made it up.

115
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,640
Don't you know
what Ms. Kyung Chae is going through now?

116
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,070
Why tell her now, of all times?

117
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,740
Even if you and Ms. Kyung Chae are over,
a real man would've taken it to his grave.

118
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,020
Well, lucky Min Kyung Chae,
having such a loyal servant.

119
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,580
Too bad, though.

120
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,790
To you, she might be some revered lady
you're honor-bound to protect,

121
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,260
but not to me.

122
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,160
Min Kyung Chae was the one...

123
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,030
who threw away
any loyalty or trust between us.

124
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,730
Please, don't be like that.

on Ms. Kyung Chae.

If you could just make sure Ms. Kyung Chae
never finds out about this,

128

at the bar last night?

What did I say?

were switched at birth.

Did you think I was too drunk to hear you?

140

Did you really say something like that
so casually and hope I wouldn't hear it?

Who on earth was Se Ri switched with?

142
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,940
Did I say that? I don't seem to recall.

You don't recall?

144

I must have blacked out.

I'll be going.

to you now?

possibly have to talk about?

to get slapped. You hear me?

And apologize.

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,670
We need to talk.

175
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,140
What's with her?
She ignored me when I asked a question.

176
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,010
But what's she so serious about?

177
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,680
Kyung Chae looked absolutely livid.

178
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,260
I'm going to ask you something,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

179
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,830
- What's going on?
- Twenty years ago,

180
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,130
when I gave birth to Se Ri
at our holiday home in Yangpyeong,

181
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,970
you were the only other person there.

182
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,370
Right?

183
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,810
Why bring that up all of a sudden?

184
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,550
It's not like it was a big hospital
where dozens of babies are born every day.

185
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,110
So there's no way
she could have been switched.

186
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,520
If it had been a private maternity clinic,
I might have had my doubts.

187
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,360
What are they saying?
If they were a bit louder, I could hear.

188
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,430
It's not true, is it?

189
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,700
It's not, right, Manager Gong?

190
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,540
Kim Sun Jae is just lying
to mess with me, right?

191
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,710
You have to say it's not true.

192
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,240
You have to say it's not true!

193
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,680
Say it's not true.

194
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,680
Say it isn't true!

195
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,620
That's impossible.

196
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,850
Se Ri is my child
whom I carried for ten months.

197
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,890
How could she have been switched?

198
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,560
Why?

199
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,920
Just why?

200
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,960
What on earth was that?

201
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,160
How could Se Ri be Kyung Chae's daughter?

202
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,100
The truth is...

203
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,700
The truth is,

204
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,500
I've been deceiving you all this time,
Ms. Kyung Chae!

205
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,710
I didn't do it on purpose!

206
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,110
At the time, I believed
it was for your own good.

207
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,110
And I still believe that to this day.

208
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,690
After I found out what happened,
I didn't want to go on living.

209
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,260
For 20 years,

210
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,660
I've lived with this buried inside me.

211
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Do you think it was easy for me?

212
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,460
It's like my whole world
came crashing down.

213
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,340
What on earth are you trying to tell me?

214
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,810
That day,

215
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,980
right after you gave birth and passed out,

216
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,880
your baby had cyanosis...

217
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,920
and was struggling to breathe.
I wrapped her up...

218
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,550
and rushed to the hospital.

219
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,020
It was in the wee hours of the morning.
There wasn't a single car on the road.

220
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,690
I was going out of my mind.

221
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,300
But just then,

222
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,770
an ambulance drove by.

223
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,870
I forced the ambulance to stop
and hitched a ride.

224
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,540
Inside was another baby...

225
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,080
and her mother.

226
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Stop it.

227
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
I don't want to hear it.

228
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,120
You have to listen!
You need to know the truth now!

229
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,790
There was a car accident
near the hospital,

230
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,660
and when the paramedic got out
to deal with the accident,

231
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,130
your baby...

232
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,970
stopped breathing!

233
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,640
My mind just went blank.

234
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,240
If you found out
something had happened to the baby,

235
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,580
I was sure
you wouldn't have made it either.

236
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,550
But...

237
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,020
just then,

238
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,290
that little girl caught my eye.

239
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,390
Shut your mouth!
Or I'll rip that mouth off your face!

240
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,930
Nothing happened 20 years ago.

241
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,830
So until you're six feet under,

242
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,470
you'll keep your mouth shut
and live a quiet life!

243
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,740
Ms. Kyung Chae...

244
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,620
(Mingang Distribution)

245
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,890
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

246
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,500
No matter what anyone says,
Se Ri is my daughter.

247
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,230
Switched at birth? Don't be ridiculous.

248
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,600
She's my spitting image in every way.

249
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,940
(Mingang Distribution)

250
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,240
You know he's not the type
to feel regret and reflect on himself.

251
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,510
He just piles new sins
on top of his old ones.

252
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,350
That's the only way he knows how to live.

253
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,380
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

254
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
How did it go?

255
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,460
I told you to report to me immediately.
Why are you only calling now?

256
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,390
What?

257
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,530
You useless fools.
You're a waste of space.

258
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,770
Just wait a few days and hit him again
when his guard is down.

259
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,800
Useless fools.

260
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,010
They can't do one thing right.

261
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,880
I saw Director Moon Tae Kyung
at the company today,

262
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,510
and his face was a mess.

263
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,550
Really? How bad did that jerk look?

264
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,250
Did you do something to Director Moon?

265
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,190
You don't know what a depraved jerk he is.

266
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,030
He's the one who came after me
to get revenge for his father.

267
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,330
But even so,

268
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,870
do you really have to
go that far with Director Moon?

269
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,470
Of course I do.

270
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,110
I wouldn't be Min Doo Sik
if I couldn't take care of Moon Tae Kyung.

271
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
What's going on?

272
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,790
By the way, you're not actually dating
Sun Jae, are you?

273
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,690
You two are just doing this
to get under Kyung Chae's skin, right?

274
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,300
Is that really what's important right now?

275
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,730
Of course it's important.
This family is about to implode.

276
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,740
Our family has been a mess for ages.
This is nothing new.

277
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,140
More importantly, we have to see Dad.
It was one thing not knowing where he was,

278
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,740
but now that we know,
we can't just pretend we don't.

279
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
You've got a point.

280
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,350
- When should we go?
- We need to see him...

281
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,820
before the shareholders' meeting
to pick a side.

282
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,390
"We?" I mean, in this situation,

283
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,790
do we really need to be lumped together
as "we?"

284
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
Why?

285
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,760
Because Kyung Chae
will take my position and give it to you,

286
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,830
you don't want to be on my team anymore?

287
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,630
It's not that. Kyung Chae promised me
the director position,

288
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,240
so it makes sense to team up with her,
not you.

289
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,770
Hilarious.
You're getting way ahead of yourself.

290
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,980
That only works if Kyung Chae ousts Lucia
and becomes chairman herself.

291
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,940
Barring any major surprises,
won't that happen?

292
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,910
A major surprise has already happened.

293
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,250
- What surprise?
- I told you, Dad woke up.

294
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,420
You think Dad will just let Kyung Chae
kick out the love of his life, Lucia?

295
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,690
He was powerless when he was unconscious,
but things are different now.

296
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,460
The shareholders' meeting
will be pointless if Dad stops it.

297
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,630
Darn, now that you mention it,
you're right.

298
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,300
There's no way Father would allow
a meeting...

299
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,670
- to kick that woman out.
- Gosh, are you just figuring that out?

300
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,710
Do I have to spell everything out for you?

301
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Se Ri. Perfect timing.

302
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,420
You won't believe what I heard today.

303
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,250
Whatever it is, save it for later.

304
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,290
No, wait! It's a secret about one's birth.

305
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,790
Like in a drama?

306
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,360
Why? Was I switched at birth?

307
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,600
No way. How did you know?

308
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,100
Seriously,
you must be psychic or something.

309
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,510
Whatever. I just got back from work,
and I'm tired.

310
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,240
Let's talk later.

311
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,340
Wait... Gosh.

312
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,210
What was that?

313
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,110
She should set up a shop
as a fortune teller.

314
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,650
At this rate,
she'll be channeling spirits.

315
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,150
Gosh! What's going on?

316
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,790
What are you doing in here?

317
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,830
Manager Gong, are you crying?

318
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,930
No, I'm fine.

319
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,970
You're obviously crying.

320
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,270
What happened?
Did someone say something to you?

321
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,640
Even if they did, so what?
You've got way more seniority than that.

322
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,280
Why are you hiding in my room crying?
You should've just fought back.

323
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,810
Come on, what's really going on?

324
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,320
Who did this to you, Manager Gong?

325
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,620
I don't know who it is,
but I won't let them get away with it.

326
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,820
You can count on me, Manager Gong.
I'm 100 percent on your side.

327
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,170
Gosh, I tell you not to cry,
and you just cry harder.

328
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,150
Stop peeking into his room like that.
You'll give people the wrong idea.

329
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,520
It looks like
he's not coming home tonight.

330
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,050
This has never happened with Tae Kyung.

331
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,890
He's probably working late.
He's no slacker like you, Yang Mal Sook.

332
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
If he's late, it's overtime.

333
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,960
If he stays out,
he's pulling an all-nighter.

334
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,190
If there's a thud,
that means something fell.

335
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,760
If you hear a toot, someone farted.
It's not rocket science.

336
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,630
You'd know that if you ever had to work.

337
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,700
But he always calls when he's late
because he knows we'll worry.

338
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,810
Someone like him didn't say a word.
That's why I'm concerned.

339
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,210
Sometimes things just happen.
What's the big deal?

340
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,180
No, I have a bad feeling about this.

341
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,580
What if on his way home,

342
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,180
he ran into some thugs
and got beaten to a pulp?

343
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,350
That's the most ridiculous thing I heard.
Don't you know how tough he is?

344
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,690
He's more likely to be dishing it out
than taking it.

345
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,690
Anyway,

346
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,060
the more I think about it,
Tae Kyung has a lot of secrets.

347
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,960
What? Another crazy soap opera plot?
A secret about one's birth?

348
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,700
Think about it. When he first moved in,

349
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,770
he never mentioned
he worked for Mingang Distribution.

350
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,040
Now that you mention it,

351
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,070
he did hide the fact that he was
in the same department as Ji Seop.

352
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,410
That's what I'm saying.

353
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,410
There's definitely something more to it.

354
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,480
If it's not a secret about his birth,

355
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,680
it's a secret revenge plot.

356
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,750
Or a secret about his birth
and a secret revenge plot.

357
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,960
Right! He moved in here for revenge.

358
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,490
That's why he joined Mingang too.

359
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,290
He moved into our house for revenge?

360
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,300
Oh, he's the long-lost son
of Yang Mal Sook.

361
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,130
And the young lady of the Mingang family
is his secret lover.

362
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,530
He moved in here to destroy me...

363
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,340
and joined Mingang
to destroy our in-laws...

364
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,640
- to become Korea's biggest tycoon!
- This is so much fun!

365
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,540
Should I become a writer?
Oh Pan Sool, the master of melodrama.

366
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,510
I could get 100 episodes out of this.
No, I could get 200!

367
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,910
- I just love these crazy dramas!
- Of course you do. You've lived one.

368
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,320
Gosh, you!

369
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,950
Are you sure you heard that right, honey?

370
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,790
A secret about Se Ri's birth, so suddenly?

371
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,590
I wish I had misheard.

372
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,360
I'm serious. I've been on edge all day.
I couldn't focus on my chores.

373
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,800
But you don't do chores anyway.

374
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,100
Anyway, the point is that Se Ri
is Kyung Chae's secret daughter,

375
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,340
and on top of that,
Se Ri was switched at birth.

376
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,970
Does that even make sense?

377
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,340
As far as I know,
Kyung Chae has never even dated.

378
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,180
And how would you know
if Kyung Chae was seeing someone?

379
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:33,350
I have a sixth sense for things like that.
I can tell just by looking.

380
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,190
Oh, please. "I can tell by looking?"

381
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,520
Your intuition's awful. You have no idea.

382
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,090
I'm telling you,
I'm like a psychic when it comes to that.

383
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,260
I knew you were single before we met.
I pegged that right away.

384
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,230
See? This is why your intuition's garbage.
What made you think I wasn't with someone?

385
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,270
I was juggling a different guy
for every day of the week...

386
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
What are you talking about?

387
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,440
Honey. You had other men than me?

388
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
Tell me!

389
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,450
(Mingang Distribution)

390
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,520
What are you still doing out here
at this hour?

391
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,050
I just have a lot on my mind.

392
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,160
Are you afraid to go home?

393
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,530
Or are you trying to avoid seeing Se Ri?

394
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,330
If you're this torn up,
you might as well get a DNA test.

395
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,430
A DNA test?

396
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,370
It'll be easier for you
to get some closure that way.

397
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,340
What kind of closure?

398
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,710
If the results don't match,
do I just say, "You're not my daughter?"

399
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,910
"It was fun while it lasted.
See you. Bye."

400
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,920
Is that what you want me to do?

401
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,920
And what's next?

402
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,790
Go on a quest to find my "real" daughter?

403
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,290
It's better to just rip the band-aid off
than to keep suffering like this.

404
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,930
Let's be honest.
You're stuck in limbo right now.

405
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,460
What do you mean, I'm stuck?

406
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,430
You can't fully accept her,
but you can't fully reject her either.

407
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,170
What would you know about it?

408
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,500
Are you trying to lecture me?

409
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Se Ri is obviously my daughter.

410
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,310
We're alike in every single way.

411
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,210
Fine. Keep telling yourself that
if it makes you feel better.

412
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,280
But remember there's a truth
you still don't know.

413
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,490
When you find the courage
to face that truth, let me know.

414
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,720
And I will gladly open
Pandora's box for you.

415
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,460
(Mingang Distribution)

416
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,480
Gosh, that's spicy.

417
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,820
It's so spicy.

418
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,490
It's so spicy.

419
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,260
What are you eating at this hour?

420
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,960
It's a late-night snack. I skipped dinner.

421
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,130
Why didn't you ask Manager Gong
to make you something?

422
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,270
Manager Gong wasn't feeling well today,
so I told her to get some rest.

423
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,840
What about you?
Do you want some if you haven't eaten?

424
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
I'm not hungry.

425
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,290
If you were going to eat,
you should've had a proper meal.

426
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,960
What is this stuff?

427
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,730
It's fine. I can't eat this anyway.

428
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,970
Or this!

429
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,870
What is this?
This is all stuff that you like.

430
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,900
It makes sense, though.

431
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,170
Manager Gong plans the menu around you
so she can feed you.

432
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,710
It's all stuff I can't have.

433
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,950
Come to think of it,
we're not alike at all. Not in any way.

434
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,750
Especially our taste in food.

435
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,220
What do you mean we're not alike?

436
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,390
People say we're spitting images,
that we could be mother and daughter.

437
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,930
Who? Unless we say we're sisters,
people think we're complete strangers.

438
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,530
Who? Who said we look like strangers?

439
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,700
How could you and I ever be strangers?

440
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,330
Kyung Chae...

441
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,800
Eat them. These are all my favorite foods.

442
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,710
So naturally, you have to like them too.

443
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,680
How can you not even stand to eat them?

444
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,750
Kyung Chae, what's wrong?
You know I'm allergic to this.

445
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,350
Well, I'm not! So eat it!

446
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,950
Kyung Chae!

447
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,990
You're a carbon copy of me.

448
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,730
It's impossible that we're not alike.
How could we not be?

449
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,400
See? Mothers and daughters
are supposed to be alike!

450
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,300
Eat this too.

451
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,240
What do you think you're doing?

452
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,730
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

453
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,650
What's wrong with Kyung Chae?
She's acting like she's lost her mind.

454
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,980
So what happens
when Pandora's box is opened?

455
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,950
Is there a more terrifying truth
hidden inside?

456
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,720
I thought I told you to ask
when you're sure you can handle it.

457
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,920
If it succeeds, it's a revolution.
If it fails, it's a coup.

458
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,390
And you failed.

459
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,430
I'm sorry for sharing this now,
but you're my daughter.

460
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,490
You're my mom?
