1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,210
You can eat?

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,210
Just fine, thank you.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,080
It's delicious!

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,150
How dare you talk like that?

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,230
Fine. Let's see how you manage without me.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,660
I won't see you again until the day I die!

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,140
Did she just run away from home?

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,480
What now?

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,510
What if she gets into trouble
away from home?

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,510
What more trouble could she get in?

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,050
Shall I call the driver?

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
Leave her be.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,550
She needs to learn
how scary it is out there.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,760
She has no money and nowhere to go.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,890
She must suffer
if she's to learn a lesson.

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,070
What got into Kyung Chae?

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,170
She has changed so much.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,570
That's weird.

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,910
(Episode 42)

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,540
Why is the gate wide open?

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,710
Didn't you see Se Ri?

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,580
No. Did Se Ri go somewhere?

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,420
She ran away from home.

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,680
She did what?

25
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,990
What? Se Ri left home?

26
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,820
I sent Mr. Kim the driver to look for her.

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,660
Why didn't you stop her from leaving?

28
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,460
What did Kyung Chae say?

29
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,900
Why did you just watch and let her leave?

30
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,870
What if something irreversible happens?

31
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,910
She does whatever she wants.

32
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,480
You should've broken her leg,
if only to make her stay.

33
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,620
Do you get it now?

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,780
What kind of a nuisance
a child who goes against their parent is?

35
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,690
A bomb that could go off at any moment.

36
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,590
A grenade with no safety pin.
That's what she's like.

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,130
You wish they'd get out of your sight,

38
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,130
but you get anxious when they are.

39
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,630
A parent will take a plane to the US
or a rocket into space for a child.

40
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,870
Why would you let a child run away?

41
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,570
I'm different from you.

42
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,010
I bet you are. No one can beat you.

43
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,650
Do you think it was easy
for me to accept Soo Jung?

44
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,310
She's living proof
of my disgrace and flaws!

45
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,020
Whatever happens, a parent must never
give up on their child.

46
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,520
Find Se Ri and bring her home.

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,290
That's what a mother would do.

48
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,820
To Se Ri,

49
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,460
I'm nothing but an older sister.

50
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,430
Let her be.

51
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,530
If something goes wrong, so be it.

52
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,740
That's her fortune.

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,670
Darn it. How dare a beggar like you
belittle me?

54
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,860
(Mingang Distribution)

55
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,860
Wait here.

56
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,530
I'll go inside and get some money.

57
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,630
Okay.

58
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,700
Give me 50 dollars.

59
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,510
You don't have 50 dollars?

60
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,880
I'll pay you back. Hand it over.

61
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,150
Don't you know who I am?

62
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,750
I'm Chairman Min's
youngest daughter, Min Se Ri!

63
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,120
You're getting on my nerves.

64
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,860
It's just 50 bucks, and I'll pay you back!
Do you want to lose your job?

65
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,360
One word from me, and my dad...

66
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,200
Here's 50 dollars.

67
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,580
You must be a lowly nobody
if you stayed this late.

68
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,250
Who are you, and what team are you on?

69
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,680
I'll talk to my dad
and tell him to give you a bonus.

70
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,690
Why don't you go home?

71
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,520
Don't tell me what to do
because you gave me some chump change.

72
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,060
You can't spend the night
in this uncomfortable office.

73
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,760
Since you're lending me money,
why not give me enough for a hotel stay?

74
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,900
Come with me, then.
I'm going to a hotel myself.

75
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,570
Hey.

76
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,040
Why are you speaking so informally
when we only just met?

77
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,250
- I'm back.
- Welcome.

78
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,390
Say hello.

79
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,190
I can't greet someone I don't know.

80
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,060
You greet an elder politely,
whoever they may be.

81
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,830
I don't bow to just anyone.

82
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,740
My gosh. Look at her.

83
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,050
What were you thinking?
Why did you bring her here?

84
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,490
I think she ran away from home.

85
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,150
I'll let her stay the night.

86
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,890
Oh, my gosh.

87
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,190
Are you fraternizing with the enemy?

88
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,390
You can do that?

89
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,130
You can spend the night
with your daughter's enemy?

90
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,540
Spend the night here
and return home tomorrow.

91
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,610
The bathroom is over there,
and there are towels and clean clothes.

92
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,080
Hey.

93
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,920
Order me room service.

94
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,690
I haven't eaten all day.

95
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,940
Will you be okay?

96
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,310
I have to be.

97
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,010
This is just the beginning.

98
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,480
Yes. You need to gain control...

99
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,190
of that troublemaker.

100
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,060
Things worked in my favor.

101
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,560
I'll console her a bit
and slowly sink my fangs into her.

102
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,060
Yes, but she's
more of a nutcase than I thought.

103
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,500
She thinks everyone is beneath her.

104
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,370
I'm sorry to say this about a kid,

105
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,040
but I don't think I'd be able to face...

106
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,070
the person who killed my child.

107
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,080
I'd rather strangle them in their sleep.

108
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,010
She picked on me first.

109
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,610
That's all a lie!

110
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,410
Why would they report a lie?

111
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,310
Why?

112
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,280
What if people believe the news...

113
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,750
and criticize me?

114
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,530
Wake up, Mi So!

115
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,440
It's you, Mom.

116
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,610
It's not fair.

117
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,450
I'm so angry, and it's driving me crazy!

118
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,430
Mom.

119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Mom.

120
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,970
Mom. Don't go.

121
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,210
I got the CEO's approval.

122
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,080
Now I'll give you an opportunity.

123
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,850
What do you mean?

124
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,790
What opportunity?

125
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,860
You said you never had
the opportunity to shine.

126
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,160
Come up with a great promotion
for this regular sale.

127
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,900
What? What are you talking about?

128
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,470
Do you really mean...

129
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,640
I can take charge
and handle the whole promotion?

130
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,410
Give it a go, and do well, if possible.

131
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,240
I'll really do it.

132
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,840
From start to finish, however I want.

133
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,950
I'll offer whatever support you need.

134
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,680
I'll also tell the rest of the team
to be ready to back you up.

135
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,330
Take a seat.

136
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,670
What's up?
Why did you want to come to my office?

137
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,940
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?

138
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,570
Because of your youngest daughter.

139
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,710
How do you know that?

140
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,610
She's with me right now.

141
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,410
What are you talking about?

142
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,750
I met her by chance last night.

143
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,520
I meant to call you right away,
but too much time had passed.

144
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,690
She said she hadn't eaten all day,
so I gave her food,

145
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,590
and I let her sleep in my bed.

146
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,660
It can't have been comfortable.

147
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,530
I had no idea she was with you.

148
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,340
She got into a huge fight
with her sister and ran off.

149
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,210
You don't have to worry about her anymore.

150
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,750
I'll talk to her today and send her home.

151
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,650
I'm always in your debt.

152
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,220
Don't say that. I did what I should.

153
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,990
Goodness.

154
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,600
Why didn't you call me to come to you?

155
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,070
You should bow to Lucia in gratitude.

156
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,030
Why would you say that?

157
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,200
Why would you mention her out of the blue?

158
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,510
Why else? Lucia found Se Ri...

159
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,480
and took her in last night.

160
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,450
Do you know what that means?

161
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,920
You wouldn't. You don't think that deeply.

162
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,480
You just want to get rid of her.

163
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,250
No way.

164
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,450
How did Se Ri end up with her?

165
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,260
Se Ri took a taxi here and yelled at
the lobby staff to pay the fare.

166
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,190
Lucia found her and took her home.

167
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,700
Se Ri refused to go home,

168
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,460
and Lucia couldn't leave her here.

169
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,000
She took Se Ri home
in case she caused trouble here.

170
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,940
That's the kind of person she is.

171
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,810
I know you didn't sleep a wink last night.

172
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,310
That's what Se Ri means to you.

173
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,780
No one can deny that.

174
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,180
Don't hurt her with words you don't mean.

175
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,280
Bring Se Ri home.

176
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,030
I did as you said...

177
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,070
and put Mr. Min
in charge of the promotions.

178
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,170
Good.

179
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,440
You set the scene,
and he'll mess it up on his own.

180
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,010
Does that mean
we can work on the other thing?

181
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,080
I'll take the afternoon off.

182
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,650
I'm meeting someone
to discuss the promotion.

183
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,690
- Go ahead.
- What?

184
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,890
I can actually go?

185
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,830
Yes. You can take
many more afternoons off.

186
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,030
Helena Louise's new beauty brand.

187
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,570
It's hot in the US.

188
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,070
There's a huge demand in Korea
but not enough supply,

189
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,370
and it's such a shame.

190
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,610
It would be nice if we could get
exclusive sale rights.

191
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,550
I agree that would be a huge coup,

192
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,980
but all our competitors
failed to win exclusive rights.

193
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,820
It won't be easy.

194
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,660
I looked into it.

195
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,660
Stella Jang is friends
with one of the brand's executives.

196
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,460
They're friends?

197
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,670
Stella Jang? Aren't you close with her?

198
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,070
I am.

199
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,470
How about...

200
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,540
I handle the promotions
for the upcoming sale?

201
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,810
You can work on the next one. This time...

202
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,780
Why would you say something like that?

203
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,420
I thought you were better than this.

204
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,480
Don't steal my opportunity!

205
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,920
You might not know, but opportunities...

206
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,320
should be won in a fair fight.

207
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,790
Be like me, okay?

208
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,030
Darn you.

209
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,970
We dropped him a hint.

210
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,610
He'll do whatever it takes
to approach Stella Jang.

211
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,380
He's bound to go out on a limb.

212
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,610
Shall we get to work
and plan the actual promotion?

213
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,750
Yes.

214
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,930
Stella Jang is friends with the executive?

215
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,760
What are you doing out here?

216
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,670
Nothing.

217
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,370
Hey, do you have Stella Jang's number?

218
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,940
Why ask?

219
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,140
Yes or no? I'm busy, and I need an answer.

220
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,410
What if I have it?

221
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,210
Give it to me.

222
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,010
What is this about?

223
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,310
You're not going home, are you?

224
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,350
I took the afternoon off.

225
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,250
I have a lot to do.

226
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,520
I'm in charge of the promotions
for the upcoming regular sale.

227
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,960
You are?

228
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,360
Give me her phone number already.

229
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
My gosh.

230
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,000
Why are you back this early?

231
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,070
I have my reasons.

232
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,000
- Where's my wife?
- In your room.

233
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,180
Why is the gate wide open?

234
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,850
Someone just came in.

235
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,090
He never locks the door behind him.

236
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,860
I see.

237
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,230
This is the home of my sworn enemies?

238
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,230
I had no idea.

239
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,370
I'd have poisoned the food if I'd known.

240
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,000
Sul Hee told me
to find out whatever I can.

241
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,540
Come with me to the kitchen.

242
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,110
What? Oh, yes, okay.

243
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,150
Is that true?

244
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,610
The director put you in charge?

245
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,320
Yes. He did.

246
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,420
He acknowledged me at last.

247
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,820
You could say he bowed to my prowess.

248
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,790
I don't think that's it yet.

249
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,890
He just gave you a chance.

250
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,860
It's the same thing.

251
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,760
I got a chance because I'm good.

252
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,530
Not to mention, this sale is a big deal.

253
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,870
It's our fourth anniversary sale.

254
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,670
If this works out,
you could become a director.

255
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,610
Not just if this works out.
That's the natural progression.

256
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,450
Everyone says
Moon Tae Kyung will be dismissed...

257
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,150
after this sale is done.

258
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,950
I don't believe what's happening.

259
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,220
Does that mean I'll be a director's wife?

260
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,890
There's one problem.

261
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,290
The Hollywood celebrity Helena...

262
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,260
- Helena-something.
- Helena Louise?

263
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,730
She has tens of millions of subscribers.

264
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,230
She's so famous.

265
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,200
Yes, her.

266
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,900
She launched a cosmetics brand,

267
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,810
and I need to get
the exclusive sales rights.

268
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,940
It's not that easy.

269
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,310
Don't you know anyone who knows them?

270
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,410
Stella Jang is friends
with one of the executives there.

271
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,050
That's all I know.

272
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,390
What's the problem?
Ask Stella Jang for help.

273
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,820
Offer her money,
and anything will be possible.

274
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,560
I heard she's filthy rich.
Do you think money will help?

275
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,960
Have you seen a shrimp do an exercise
to straighten its back?

276
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,300
The rich love money...

277
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,340
and always want to make more.

278
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,840
You don't know anything.

279
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,710
Right?

280
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Your father?

281
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,910
Money isn't the only beauty in the world.

282
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,210
My dear Jang, Stella Jang.

283
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,120
Stella Jang...

284
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,060
Honey. Shall we have
spoon worms for dinner?

285
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,190
I can get some fresh ones
at the raw fish restaurant.

286
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,800
You can eat
whatever spoon or worm you want.

287
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,330
Shall I go to the fish market to get some?

288
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,840
They'll sell nicer ones at a better price.

289
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,970
Go to a fish market, dive into the sea,

290
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,410
or go to Alaska, whatever you want.

291
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,980
You're acting weird.

292
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,010
You love spoon worms enough
to jump out of bed for some.

293
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,180
What's this?

294
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,020
You're still staring at this woman's face?

295
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,160
"Stella?"

296
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,060
That witch is called Stella?

297
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,200
You like a Stella?

298
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,170
Are you a leech
standing in line to give blood?

299
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,170
I'm hungry.

300
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,340
- I'll have paper for dinner.
- My gosh.

301
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,670
Spit that out.

302
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,710
Spit it out.

303
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,840
Spit it out.

304
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,310
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

305
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,780
She took Se Ri home
in case she caused trouble here.

306
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,990
That's the kind of person she is.

307
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,000
Se Ri left home.

308
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,200
I guess she felt bad
about what she'd done.

309
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,270
Shouldn't we look for her, then?

310
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,940
Did you call the police?

311
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,470
We found her.

312
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Good. Where was she?

313
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,510
She's with Lucia.

314
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,120
It looks like they slept together
like mother and daughter.

315
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,050
What?

316
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,920
How did that woman...

317
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,990
I don't know.

318
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,390
Why her of all the people out there?

319
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,160
These surprising coincidences
make me so uncomfortable.

320
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,930
How come...

321
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,340
Baek Sul Hee.

322
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,780
Ms. Se Ri is with you?

323
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,820
Yes.

324
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,820
Why would you look after her?

325
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,450
She caused your daughter to die.

326
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,760
You'd still be a mom if not for her,

327
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,830
and you what?

328
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,200
You slept with her like a mom would?

329
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,460
What's wrong with that?

330
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,270
Is it okay for a dad
to stay loyal to the people...

331
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,770
who killed his child,

332
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,100
and wrong for a woman to take in
a child who ran away from home?

333
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,670
Baek Sul Hee, you...

334
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,210
Don't you care what I do.

335
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,680
That's best for you too.

336
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,690
The chairman filled me in.

337
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,130
Arrange a meeting
so I can take Se Ri home.

338
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,100
Don't scold her too harshly.

339
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,000
She's a grown girl
with the heart of a child.

340
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,400
You speak as if you know her well.

341
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,870
Do you feel like a mom
because you spent one night with her?

342
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,510
I could never be her mom.

343
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,180
I'm just saying
she'll lash out if you scold her,

344
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,580
so speak to her calmly.

345
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,520
What are you doing in someone else's room?

346
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,690
There's nothing to see anyway.

347
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,330
You can't just walk away.

348
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,460
"I'm sorry." You say that first.

349
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,160
I don't want to.

350
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,130
What's wrong with you?

351
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,830
You're helpless.

352
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
How great do you think you are, Grandma?

353
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,570
What did you call me? "Grandma?"

354
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,680
I don't look like a grandma.

355
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,840
You do, from head to toe.

356
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,680
My blood pressure is spiking.

357
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,380
You really need to leave.

358
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,780
And go where?

359
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,190
Anywhere. Do you think
you can stay here forever?

360
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,020
Why do you talk like that, Grandma?

361
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,660
You called me "Grandma" again?

362
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,760
What about you?
Do you think you sound nice?

363
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,100
Hi.

364
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,370
I need you to bring the kid over.

365
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,940
Right now?

366
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,960
You want me to look at the sea,
gather my thoughts, and go home?

367
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,960
Your sister is here.

368
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,500
Darn it.

369
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,840
Running away won't help.

370
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,040
Do you think you'll last
away from home for the rest of your life?

371
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,670
Let's say you manage
to never see your family again.

372
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,510
You still need money.

373
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,180
Run away if you think
you can live like a pauper.

374
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,040
Come home.

375
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,850
Under one condition.

376
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,950
There's a condition?

377
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,690
Don't mention your birth mom again.

378
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,420
Don't think of her,

379
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,230
and don't dream of tracking her down.

380
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,660
I'll let you come home
if you agree to that.

381
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,600
If not, then walk off.

382
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,000
What are you talking about?

383
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,310
I found my birth mom.

384
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,670
Something must've come up and she...

385
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,340
Do as you're told and don't look for her!

386
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,740
You can't find her even if you try!

387
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,150
What does that mean?

388
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,450
I can't find her even if I try?

389
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,550
What does that mean?

390
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,490
You were conned.

391
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,330
That woman isn't your mom.

392
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,100
I had our DNA tested.

393
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,230
Who are you to say that?

394
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,630
Your mom is dead.

395
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,570
What?

396
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,770
Your mom.

397
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,280
She's dead.

398
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,620
What do you mean?

399
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,650
How do you know that?

400
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,460
How do you know my mom is dead?

401
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,030
Did you kill her?

402
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,630
What?

403
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,840
You killed her.

404
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,810
That's why you didn't do a thing
when I wanted to...

405
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,680
find my mom so badly.

406
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,580
- What are you on about?
- That's why.

407
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,090
That's why you were like that.

408
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,170
Se Ri!

409
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,670
Se Ri!

410
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,160
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

411
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,940
Is it true that Se Ri walked into the sea?

412
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,680
Her identity would've gotten out
if you'd called for help.

413
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,820
Life gets extra hard
if you're too upright.

414
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,450
He's a good man.

415
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,190
Don't fall for him, though.

416
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,890
Are things not going too well?

417
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,890
Why do things keep getting messed up?

418
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,360
You speak as if you know well.

419
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,790
Is there something I don't know about?

420
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,030
You can side with me, then.

421
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,100
Who knows?
I could become the chairman's lover...

422
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,140
and control your future.

423
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,370
