00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,310
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,010
Is it true, Mom?

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,280
What you said last time.
That they arrested some other girl.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,180
How could they arrest someone else?

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,160
- I want to go and check.
- Stay here.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,920
How can I just stay here?

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,290
It's another problem
if they won't investigate,

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,330
but what would they do
with a fake culprit?

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,300
That doesn't make any sense!

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,030
Bo Ram and the coffee shop owner
gave a statement,

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,770
and there's video evidence too.

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,410
They helped, so we must catch
the person who's actually guilty.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,370
I'll take care of it.

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,040
You don't have to get involved.

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,050
I can't reach Bo Ram
or the coffee shop owner.

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,750
They cut contact with me
as if they're in on it together.

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,750
I'm so sad.

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,960
It's as if they're avoiding me.

19
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,400
Don't cry.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,550
Don't cry.

21
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,100
You must be busy with work.
Can you keep coming here?

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,030
Focus on getting better...

23
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,930
so we can plan our next move.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,400
What next move?

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,270
You won't come home?

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,580
I don't have to go to the US?

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,910
If you go, you'll only get into trouble
because you can't fit in.

28
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,550
You said it wouldn't be long
before the police identified me...

29
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,590
and Father found out.

30
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,560
Don't worry. I took care of what you did.

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,660
You won't be questioned or investigated.

32
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,000
Kyung Chae.

33
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll find an excuse to bring you home.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,340
Lie low until then.

35
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,470
You got really lucky this time.

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,640
Okay.

37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,280
You should join me for dinner.

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,480
No, sir.

39
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,490
Sit down with me.

40
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,420
I wouldn't dare join you at the table.

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,630
That would be asking too much of you.

42
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,660
It's hard to expect someone
to do the opposite out of the blue.

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,870
All but you
have dinner plans this evening.

44
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,400
I'd have eaten out too
if I'd known ahead of time.

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,070
I bothered you for no reason.

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,240
Why would you say that?

47
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,220
I sometimes wish
they'd all vanish from my sight,

48
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,960
but now I miss them.

49
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,460
But then,

50
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,730
having lots of children
doesn't mean you don't feel lonely.

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,530
Do you feel lonely?

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,470
Everyone feels lonely.
There's no one who doesn't.

53
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,640
You feel lonely
whether you have a partner or not.

54
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,610
You're still young.

55
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,410
If you were to find someone nice...

56
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,610
Don't be silly.

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,950
Not at my age.
A joke that goes too far is a curse.

58
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,050
Why say no?

59
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,020
Whoever she may be,
if you announce her as your wife,

60
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,380
I'm ready to serve her
as the lady of the house.

61
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,750
That will never happen.
Worry about your own future.

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,520
How long have you worked here?

63
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,790
A little over 20 years, sir.

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,800
You did great.

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,660
My family has
a lot of secrets and troubles.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,600
There are so many things
you must pretend not to notice.

67
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,110
I feel reassured and relaxed
that you never spread gossip.

68
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,910
Keep doing that for me.

69
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,810
I will, sir. I don't know anything.

70
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,690
I'm so full.

71
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,160
- Thanks for dinner, Mother.
- Sure.

72
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,090
The spicy braised monkfish...

73
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,990
was just fantastic.

74
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,700
- Visit more often.
- Okay.

75
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,030
I can cook you something much nicer.

76
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,970
Now give me the details...

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,270
on your sister.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,340
Kyung Chae came home one day
all down and discouraged for no reason.

79
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,840
Right after he left the talisman
you gave him in her office.

80
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,910
Watanka!

81
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,320
What does that mean, Father?

82
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,720
You don't know "watanka?"

83
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,950
It's a Native American exclamation
meaning "that's great."

84
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,120
Then watanka from me too.

85
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,360
You must shout it out.

86
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,490
Channel the energy from your belly.

87
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,330
Watanka!

88
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,400
From the belly?

89
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,870
Watanka!

90
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,900
That's it.

91
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,470
Wait and see. Your father
will soon call you to the head office.

92
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,270
- Will he really?
- Yes. I guarantee he will.

93
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,980
Whatever others say,
you will take over Mingang.

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,680
Why don't you serve us drinks?

95
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,250
We should drink on a day like this.

96
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,850
It's nice to have an excuse to drink.

97
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,950
Dad, let's drink the liquor
you got as a gift.

98
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,190
The 50-year-old one.

99
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,090
Did an octopus do a backflip
and sprain its ankle?

100
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,890
That's my prized treasure.

101
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,030
It's for your son-in-law.

102
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,200
Wouldn't he return the favor
when he took over Mingang?

103
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,100
Right, darling?

104
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,940
That's right.

105
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,370
If I were to become chairman,
I'd put Father on a literal pedestal.

106
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,180
Go and get the liquor.

107
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,580
Hastily, immediately,
speedily, urgently, quickly.

108
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,080
Let's open up the 50-year-old liquor.

109
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,480
Watanka!

110
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,680
Let's do the gesture too.

111
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,350
- Watanka!
- Watanka!

112
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,690
- Watanka!
- Watanka!

113
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,020
Please give me a call.

114
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,030
Please give me a call.

115
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,080
People are so mean.
Why would they throw it away?

116
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,810
What about the bar?

117
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,410
I closed it for a while.

118
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,680
It's almost dinnertime
and you didn't have lunch.

119
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,480
You might fall ill yourself.

120
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,290
Have some rice balls.

121
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,160
Missing a few meals won't kill me.

122
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,620
Do you think I'm worried you'll starve?

123
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,590
You need to eat well
if you're to solve the case.

124
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,030
I'll hand out the flyers.

125
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,660
Go on and eat.

126
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,830
You can eat over there.

127
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,980
Hello.

128
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,280
Can you please...

129
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,460
I'll accompany you...

130
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,030
when you meet Moon Tae Kyung.

131
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,430
What for?

132
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,570
I should assist you
with any official business.

133
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,700
And point out some legal matters.

134
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,310
We will talk business, yes,
but we'll discuss more than that.

135
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,880
You'll discuss more than business?
What other topics could there be?

136
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,840
Is it something personal?

137
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,210
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

138
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,050
Lawyer Kim. Do you know
you're overstepping your boundaries?

139
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,150
You asked how we'd do...

140
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,190
as a man and a woman.

141
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,260
Let me answer that now.

142
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,660
Let's keep things as is.

143
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,230
- Ms. Min.
- Let's do that.

144
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,200
As superior and subordinate.

145
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,280
We meet again.

146
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,620
I'm a regular here.

147
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,690
I dropped by for a drink
after meeting with a buyer.

148
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,930
My usual.

149
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,570
Is something bothering you?

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
You look very down.

151
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,140
Shall I lend you a shoulder?

152
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,410
What must I do in return?

153
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,850
You must want a payment of some sort.

154
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,950
I get it.

155
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,220
You want me to be your double agent.

156
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,920
Isn't that an old topic?

157
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,290
Why else would you...

158
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,390
offer to console me?

159
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,460
Didn't I tell you?

160
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,500
You want to be
more than just a superior...

161
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,140
and a subordinate with Kyung Chae.

162
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,340
I feel the same about you.

163
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,050
If it gets too hard,

164
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,880
come to me.

165
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,070
Hello.

166
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,810
I waited a while.

167
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,210
You have no reason to wait.

168
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,210
You thanked me more than enough
for helping your sister.

169
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,650
Come on.

170
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,620
We have something to discuss.

171
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,790
My sister told you who she was.

172
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,560
That means you should know who I am.

173
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,790
I'm Min Kyung Chae,
CEO of Mingang Distribution.

174
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,210
There's no way you don't like our package.

175
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,910
Well, it was the best
within industry standards.

176
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,110
Why are you dragging things on, then?

177
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,920
If you're trying to tame your employer...

178
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,150
"Tame?"

179
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,550
I don't like the nuance at all.

180
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,320
You're not hiring a servant.

181
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,130
I consider you a business partner.

182
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,660
Maybe you don't.

183
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,930
What is it, then?

184
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,360
Is there something more urgent
than starting your new job?

185
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,470
Perhaps?

186
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,500
I'd swept something
under the rug for 25 years,

187
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,170
but now I want to get to the truth.

188
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,610
What, 25 years?

189
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,710
Things move so fast,

190
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,210
even something that happened
an hour ago is buried in the past.

191
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,810
Why dig up something from 25 years ago?

192
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,650
It would have gotten moldy already.

193
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,220
Be cool and forget about it.

194
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,520
Success is in the future, not in the past.

195
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,530
There are also things
that should never be buried.

196
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,600
But some things are worth remembering.

197
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,510
Someone told me never to forget.

198
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,080
Don't risk losing out on
an important opportunity.

199
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,410
It's time to sign the contract.

200
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,050
Playing hard to get for too long
can make you a pain.

201
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,850
It's true that we desperately need you,

202
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
but we can't wait forever.

203
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,220
We have a schedule to keep.

204
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,360
Very well.
I shouldn't disrupt your schedule.

205
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,260
Shall we sign the contract?

206
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,030
I have a condition.

207
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,740
What is it?

208
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,670
Mingang Distribution.

209
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,540
It was run exclusively by the family
since it was established.

210
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,610
Yes.

211
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,310
Our new business is the first time
we ever hired a management specialist.

212
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,120
Company information
that only the family can access.

213
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,150
Share that with me.

214
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,420
That's surprising.

215
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,720
I didn't think that was what you'd want.

216
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,860
Is that a no?

217
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,960
(Searching for witnesses of an assault!)

218
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,000
(Searching for witnesses of an assault!)

219
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,140
(Searching for witnesses of an assault!)

220
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,770
I'll go over the timeline
for the new business...

221
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,000
and schedule PR and marketing events.

222
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,810
The manual and system
for the new platform are ready.

223
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,210
I should set up another division
to handle the new business.

224
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,910
What's the use of preparing things
when the executive isn't here?

225
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,450
I met with him.

226
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,220
You met Moon Tae Kyung?

227
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,290
How did you manage
when he seemed to evade you?

228
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,550
What did he say?

229
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,590
Will he join Mingang or not?

230
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,530
Why did he stall?

231
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,730
That's...

232
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,360
I'll tell you that in private.

233
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,970
Okay. You can report directly to me.

234
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,470
You have the upper hand, CEO Min.

235
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,510
If they will benefit our company,

236
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,440
we will hire even our sworn enemy's son.

237
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,680
That's business.

238
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,120
Did you really find him?

239
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,720
How? Where?

240
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,660
You have a lot of questions.

241
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,600
Find the answers yourself.

242
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,460
I don't know how you managed to find him,

243
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,570
but do you think he'll be loyal to you?

244
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,570
Let's wait and find out.

245
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,600
You have Lawyer Kim. Isn't that enough?

246
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,270
Why are you so greedy?

247
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,210
I'm not half as greedy as you are.

248
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,290
The food is extra good today. Well done.

249
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,730
I didn't do anything unusual.

250
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,030
You didn't? It tastes different to me.

251
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,770
It must be because your children are here.

252
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,900
Even the greatest feast
isn't enjoyable if you eat alone.

253
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,970
What do you mean, Manager Gong?

254
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,340
Father's not the type to enjoy food more
because we're around.

255
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,810
You know that much?

256
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,850
Seeing you ruins
what little appetite I have.

257
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,220
I heard you ate alone
the evening I visited my in-laws.

258
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,850
Did you feel lonely?

259
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,420
I guess you would.

260
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,190
You're not human if you don't.

261
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,860
We stick around because we're your kids.

262
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,800
Manager Gong is an oddity for staying
for over 20 years despite being sane.

263
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,230
What?

264
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,640
My goodness...

265
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,950
Do you know
Ohsung Group's chairman collapsed?

266
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,650
Why? He was in good health.

267
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,850
So what if he's healthy...

268
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,020
when he has a troublemaker for a kid?

269
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,130
He's in the ER and might not make it.

270
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,960
His youngest was a nuisance.

271
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,560
It's as if they were born
to kill their father.

272
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,430
See? You should consider yourself blessed.

273
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,200
You have us four and we're all good kids.

274
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,210
We don't dare talk back to you,

275
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,810
and we pretend to faint
if you tell us to die.

276
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,110
Don't say that
when you do a poor job of pretending.

277
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,650
How am I to call Se Ri a blessing?

278
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,550
I shouldn't criticize
someone else's child...

279
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,980
when I have one who's just as bad.

280
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,720
She has been quiet lately.

281
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,120
She must've grown up.

282
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
What else can she do?

283
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,790
I won't let her off again!

284
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,590
One more mistake from her
and she's dead meat!

285
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,030
The deities helped us.

286
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,800
Yes. I didn't even think of this.

287
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,710
Excuse me, sir.

288
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,680
Do you park your car here?

289
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,650
I mean, do you often park here?

290
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,620
Yes. Why?

291
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,390
Did you park here a week ago?

292
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,790
Yes.

293
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,190
Can I see your dashcam footage?

294
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,930
Just to check something.

295
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,330
What for?

296
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,670
Actually,
my child got into some trouble...

297
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,000
right in that alley.

298
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,170
She was assaulted by someone
her age, had surgery,

299
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,740
and is still in hospital.

300
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,610
But the police won't charge the culprit...

301
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,510
without any proof or witnesses.

302
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,580
Your dashcam might have caught it.
Could you check the footage for me?

303
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,850
Please, sir.

304
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,460
This tiny memory card
has a video of the assault?

305
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,700
Yeon Ah.

306
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,240
I'm scared.

307
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,940
This will show...

308
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,940
what Mi So went through.

309
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,280
I'm too afraid to watch.

310
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,920
You have to, though.

311
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,620
To punish the culprit.

312
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,650
You watch on your own.
I'll be out for a while.

313
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,120
I didn't know...

314
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,490
how much you'd suffered.

315
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,190
You must've been so afraid.

316
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,930
Mom will find her and punish her.

317
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,930
Hang in there.

318
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,970
(Mingang Distribution)

319
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,990
(Mingang Distribution)

320
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,260
You can't just walk into the CEO's office.

321
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,600
I won't be long.
I'm not here to waste anyone's time.

322
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,100
You can't go inside. Please, just leave.

323
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,540
It's important.

324
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,370
What's the fuss about?

325
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,310
She came here without an appointment
demanding to see the CEO.

326
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,910
I'm the CEO. Who are you?

327
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm Mi So's mom.

328
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,350
The parent of the teenage victim.

329
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,660
This is dashcam footage
showing the incident.

330
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,400
I took it to an expert
to have it verified...

331
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,530
and printed a screengrab
of the assailant's face.

332
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,210
I found out by chance
that she was the chairman's daughter,

333
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,640
but now that I have clear evidence,
I've decided not to let it slide.

334
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,180
What do you get
for making an issue out of this?

335
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,880
If you don't want this to become an issue,

336
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,390
release the fake culprit right away...

337
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,990
and tell your sister to turn herself in.

338
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,090
To be honest, I'm confused...

339
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,760
as to why things got this far.

340
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,560
It's a shame.

341
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,670
I should've taken care of it myself.

342
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,470
Since you're here, I'll compensate you.

343
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,970
How much do you want?

344
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,710
I came here to give you a chance.

345
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,510
A chance to earn forgiveness.

346
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,380
I regret coming here now.

347
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,690
I shouldn't have bothered.

348
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,020
You seem to be mistaken.

349
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,030
Forgiveness is what
the powerful give the powerless.

350
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,530
If you are planning to use
your daughter to get rich, give up.

351
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,470
I won't fall for it.

352
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,440
That's too vulgar.

353
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,180
Extortion disguised as maternal love.

354
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,140
You think we're equals
because I treated you as such.

355
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,110
Do you think I'm someone
you can insult in this manner?

356
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,710
I wondered who she was like,
and she was just like her sister.

357
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,520
I don't even have to wait and see...

358
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,120
what your sister will grow up to be like.

359
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,590
Shut your mouth. You don't know anything!

360
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,820
I'll take this video
to all the media outlets I can find.

361
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,030
I'll expose everything you people did.

362
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,460
You think you're above us
because you're rich.

363
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,030
You think you can get away with this,
but you can't.

364
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,830
I'll teach you
that there are things money...

365
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,670
and connections can't buy.

366
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,310
I don't want to talk to you.
Bring the girl's mom to me.

367
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,840
You'll never know how a mom feels.

368
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,780
You don't know. That's why you did this.

369
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,320
If you were a mom, you wouldn't try to...

370
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,890
cover up a child's
twisted antics with money.

371
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,990
You'd have tried to correct her
and turn her into a decent human.

372
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,460
You're just her sister.

373
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,490
That's why you threw money around
to brag and shut things down.

374
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,230
What?

375
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,400
How much do I want?

376
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,770
I won't give in,
even if you offer the whole company.

377
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,840
My child's body and soul are broken.

378
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,070
Giving her the whole world won't fix her!

379
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,480
Get the mom
who carried her for ten months...

380
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,080
and got torn open to give birth to her.

381
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,950
How dare you talk about maternal love
when you never had a child?

382
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,490
Darn you.

383
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,840
Yeon Ah, get me some ice water.

384
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,170
Why? What's the matter?

385
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,880
I've never met someone so messed up.

386
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,880
How dare she offer to buy my silence?

387
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,120
My gosh.

388
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,290
(Mingang Distribution)

389
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,920
You're just her sister.

390
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,990
That's why you threw money around
to brag and shut things down.

391
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,260
How dare you talk about maternal love
when you never had a child?

392
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,830
Darn you.

393
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,480
I heard from the lobby staff.

394
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,280
Do you know what just happened?

395
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,190
What a woman like that did to me?

396
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,790
- I apologize.
- You apologize?

397
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,330
Is that all you can do?

398
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,560
She had dashcam footage of the assault.

399
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,330
She'll go to
all the media outlets she can find.

400
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,630
She won't stop at anything
since she found extra proof.

401
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,970
A mom will do anything for her child.

402
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,840
I might go down for this too
if I leave you in charge and do nothing.

403
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,610
I'll clean things up...

404
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,840
so the worst doesn't happen.

405
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,650
What could be even worse than this?

406
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,850
Get out.

407
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,580
I'm sick of your face!

408
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,080
You don't look as bad as I thought.

409
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,110
Who are you?

410
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,850
Who I am doesn't matter.

411
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,990
I'm about to say something important,
so listen carefully.

412
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,590
You're smart enough to get into
an international high school early.

413
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,290
You'll get this too.

414
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,130
How do you know that?

415
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,030
Why won't you tell me who you are?

416
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,960
I told you that didn't matter.

417
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,670
What does matter, then?

418
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,070
Seeing reality.

419
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,300
Development starts with that.

420
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,410
You're the daughter...

421
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,510
of a single mom who owns a snack bar...

422
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,580
on the outskirts of the city.

423
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,380
Did you look into my family?

424
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,920
Isn't that what you do
to people who are guilty?

425
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,080
Tell your mom...

426
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,550
not to make a big deal
out of what happened.

427
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,390
What happened has happened.

428
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,630
Finding and punishing the culprit...

429
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,390
won't cancel out the assault.

430
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,160
Why should I do that?

431
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,930
Because that will be to your benefit.

432
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,800
Do you think I came here empty-handed?

433
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,270
My assaulter
must be from a powerful family...

434
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,140
if they sent someone like you.

435
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,440
Do you think finding and punishing
the culprit will change the world?

436
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,340
You're mistaken.

437
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,780
The powerless can squirm,
but that won't change anything.

438
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,480
The world is ruled by the powerful,

439
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
and people like you and your mom
are nothing.

440
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,890
You mean less than a single ant.

441
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,620
An ant that can't escape a shoe.

442
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,560
Cover up the assault.

443
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,260
Don't make a big deal out of it.

444
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,440
Do you think studying hard
will make you a great person?

445
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,540
That your smart brain and goals...

446
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,370
will help you accomplish something?

447
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,810
No.

448
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,680
Your twisted desire
will turn you into a monster.

449
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,180
You can't beat the people
who start way ahead of you.

450
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,820
You'll just end up working for them,
running their errands.

451
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,450
Just like you?

452
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,260
Mom. Who is this guy?

453
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,950
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

454
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,460
You became a hound for the rich.

455
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,860
Watch what you say.
I worked hard to get to where I am.

456
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,100
I'll do anything it takes to punish them.

457
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,700
They can't be forgiven for being rich.

458
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,770
Kyung Chae will be the first to ditch you.

459
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,540
Love it or hate it, that's our fate.

460
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,140
Bring Se Ri to me this instant.

461
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,570
I won't let it go this time.

462
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,670
She shouldn't even have been born.

463
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,140
- She can't even be recycled!
- Father!

464
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,650
Se Ri is the one thing
Kyung Chae doesn't give up on.

465
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,080
She is Kyung Chae's weakness.

466
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,180
We're in the same situation.
We should band together.

467
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,690
That's how we'll both survive.
