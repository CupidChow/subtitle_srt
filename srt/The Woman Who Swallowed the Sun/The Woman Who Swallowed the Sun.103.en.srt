1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,440
You won't leave us
even if Dad doesn't wake up, will you?

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,550
Of course not.
Why would you even say that?

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,020
I was scared you'd leave me and Dad.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,190
Why would I ever leave you?

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,390
What kind of mother
abandons her own child?

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,690
Besides, no matter what others say,
you're my daughter now, Se Ri.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,170
Yes, Doctor.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,440
What is it? It's so late.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,010
The chairman has regained consciousness.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,880
The chairman?

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,710
Okay. I'll be right there.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,550
The chairman has regained consciousness.

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,950
Dad did?

14
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,620
I'm going to the hospital for a bit.

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,560
Let me come with you.
I want to see how Dad's doing too.

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,330
Not right now. It's late,
and they asked me to come alone.

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,060
Besides, a crowd might just
make his condition worse.

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,070
Then you promise you'll take me later?

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,370
Okay, I promise.

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,770
How is he? You said the chairman
regained consciousness.

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,640
Yes, ma'am. He has a pupillary response,

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,050
and he's breathing on his own,
so we've removed the oxygen mask.

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,650
We're currently monitoring his progress.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,590
Lucia, why am I lying here?

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,160
I'm not hurt anywhere.
Why am I just lying here?

26
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,490
You have to tell them for me.

27
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,990
Tell them I'm fine.

28
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,760
That I'm perfectly fine.

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,830
So there's nothing else to be done?
We just have to watch him?

30
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,240
For now, yes.

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,070
No other medical intervention
is necessary.

32
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,980
All we can do is hope the patient
finds the will to wake up on his own.

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,280
He can understand everything we're saying.

34
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,050
That's a relief.

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,690
It's a miracle
that he's even regained consciousness.

36
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,150
Exactly.

37
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,360
If we just give it some time,
I'm sure he'll wake up before long.

38
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,930
He's a fighter, after all.

39
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,200
He certainly is.

40
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,870
Oh, right. Until the chairman
makes a full recovery,

41
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,340
don't let anyone else in to see him
besides me, just like now.

42
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,110
All the foot traffic will just
get in the way of his recovery.

43
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,980
Understood.

44
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,700
Se Ri.

45
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,300
Se Ri.

46
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,580
What are you doing sleeping out here?

47
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,610
Have you been here all night?

48
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,880
I was waiting for Mom.

49
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,720
Waiting for her? Where did she go?

50
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,120
To the hospital.
She said Dad regained consciousness.

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,790
When?

52
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,820
How is his condition now?

53
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,390
No. I have to see for myself.

54
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,800
Don't go. Mom said it would be disruptive,
so we shouldn't come.

55
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,700
And you're just going to stay put
because she said so?

56
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,500
Who is Lucia to take charge of Father
and keep us away? She's not even family.

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,180
- Because she said it's best for Dad.
- That's just what she wants us to think.

58
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,110
She's trying to control access to Father
to secure her own position.

59
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,980
That's why she's so desperate
to keep us away from him.

60
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,620
You have to wake up.

61
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,320
Chairman Min,
you can't let it end like this.

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,530
You have no idea what's happening
at the company, do you?

63
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,970
Your eldest daughter is doing everything
she can to take over the company.

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,300
She's going to suspend my authority
as acting chairman.

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,300
You have to stop Kyung Chae.

66
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,140
That brat's greed will ruin this company
and our family.

67
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,140
You have to protect them.

68
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,510
Protect Mingang and our family as well.

69
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,980
I want to fight for you,

70
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,920
but I'm too powerless right now.

71
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,290
My stake isn't big enough
to fight your eldest daughter anymore.

72
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,920
I'll give you all of my shares.

73
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,790
Become the majority shareholder,
and stop Kyung Chae.

74
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,060
As of today, Min Doo Sik's entire stake
belongs to Jung Lucia.

75
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,470
You will be my successor,

76
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,040
become the next chairman of Mingang,
and set everything right again.

77
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,670
I'm counting on you, Lucia.

78
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,680
Ma'am, I told you,
you can't just go in there.

79
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,150
What do you think you're doing?
Get out of here right now!

80
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,610
He's my father.

81
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,020
I'm his daughter! Who's going to stop me
from seeing my own father?

82
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,190
"Father?"
You have the nerve to call him that?

83
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,450
If you had any shame,
you wouldn't be here.

84
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,920
Did you just come to see
if the chairman is dead yet?

85
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,360
Watch your mouth.

86
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,760
I'm not the one who wants
my father to die. You are.

87
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,630
You should watch your own mouth.
He almost rotted in jail for life,

88
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,170
and who was it that saved him?

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,970
After all that, you still have the nerve
to walk around with your head held high...

90
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,280
and waltz around like you own the place,
and now you show up here?

91
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,850
What are you standing there for?
Call security and get her out of here!

92
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,530
Why in the world won't you
let me see my father?

93
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,030
That's because...

94
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,370
Madam Jung has forbidden all visitations.

95
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,740
"Madam Jung?"
Since when does she get to call the shots?

96
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,040
I've been his daughter my entire life,

97
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,840
and you expect me to let some young woman
he just married take everything from me?

98
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,410
Are you saying...

99
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,910
that you intend to take the chairman
from his wife?

100
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,350
But legally, she is his legal guardian.

101
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,880
Doctor Kim!

102
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,420
Let me repeat myself.

103
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,820
Madam Jung is his legal guardian.
Without her permission,

104
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,360
absolutely no one is allowed in.

105
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,330
So you were kicked out without checking
on the chairman's condition?

106
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,200
That woman is running the whole show
in there.

107
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
I suppose so.

108
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,470
Legally speaking, anyway.

109
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,510
That's what makes the law so powerful.

110
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,840
With the chairman in a coma,

111
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,080
he can barely communicate.

112
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
If he were to sign his stake over to her,

113
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,610
there's nothing you could do to stop it.

114
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,120
In fact, even if he were to pass away,

115
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,220
unless his will has a specific clause
about the stake,

116
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,360
it's a given
that she'll inherit the largest portion.

117
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,160
What does the will say?

118
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,560
In the most recent version of the will,
the inheritance of the stake...

119
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,800
is not mentioned.

120
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,200
So whether he lives or dies,
that woman still comes out on top.

121
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,530
That's right.

122
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,040
Unless they mutually agree to a divorce,

123
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,070
she stands to gain the most
as the chairman's spouse.

124
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,680
So if they get a divorce,
things would change?

125
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,080
(Mingang Distribution)

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
Yes, it's me, Mother...

127
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,290
- Madam Jang, what's the occasion?
- Is someone there with you?

128
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,590
Is that Lawyer Kim?

129
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,490
Yes, he was just giving me a report.

130
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Send him out.

131
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
That sounds like Madam Jang.
It's fine, you can talk.

132
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,900
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're strangers.

133
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
And it's not like I'm out of the loop
on your affairs.

134
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,170
You can speak freely, Madam Jang.

135
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,470
Tell him to stop kissing up and get out.

136
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,940
Who does he think he is, butting in?

137
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,880
Please leave.

138
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,110
What are you doing? I told you to get out.

139
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
(Mingang Distribution)

140
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,090
You can talk now. I'm alone.

141
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,000
I gave that old fox an inch,
and now she's trying to cut me out.

142
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,470
Jang Yeon Sook,
you're making a big mistake.

143
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,840
Just because Min Se Ri
is your granddaughter,

144
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,040
you think half of Mingang Distribution
is in the bag?

145
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,050
In your dreams. Not as long as I,
Kim Sun Jae, am here.

146
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,990
No one else is coming.

147
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,030
I've blocked the family from visiting.

148
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,330
So don't you worry.

149
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,400
How's the chairman?

150
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,410
He's regained consciousness,
but he still can't move.

151
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,440
He can understand everything, though.

152
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,880
Chairman, do you recognize me?

153
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,580
Yes, I remember.

154
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,090
I remember everything now.

155
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,460
Why I ended up like this too.

156
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,360
Do you even know
who Moon Tae Kyung really is?

157
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,430
- What do you mean, "who is he?"
- Moon Tae Kyung is...

158
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,470
the son of CEO Han Kyung Soo,
Doeun Industries.

159
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,270
Thirty years ago,

160
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,480
you had him murdered
in a staged car accident...

161
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,750
and stole his company and new technology!
He's the son of that Han Kyung Soo!

162
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,950
You think you can take me down?

163
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,620
- Chairman.
- Not a chance.

164
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,590
Not a chance! Not a...

165
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,230
- Chairman!
- Not a...

166
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,860
Chairman!

167
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,870
Chairman, stay with me!

168
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,370
That's right. It was this jerk.

169
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,270
This brat is the son of Han Kyung Soo
from Doeun Industries.

170
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,740
He wormed his way into Mingang to get me,
to avenge his father.

171
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,040
Moon Tae Kyung, you jerk!
You think I'll let you get away with this?

172
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,350
Lucia. Get away from him now.

173
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,050
He's deceiving you all.
He's just using you.

174
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,990
Chairman, what's gotten into you?

175
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,620
Please calm down.

176
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,760
This isn't good. I'll go get help.

177
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,630
Chairman, please calm down.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,170
Oh, no.

179
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,470
- Did something happen to shock him?
- No, nothing at all.

180
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,480
Okay, calm down and take slow breaths.

181
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,110
Slowly.

182
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,650
- Slowly.
- I'm going to take off.

183
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,250
I'll see you at the office later.

184
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,170
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

185
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,910
He definitely looked like
he knew something.

186
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,320
There's no other explanation
for his reaction.

187
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,930
Goodness, what a waste.

188
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:00,330
This was a brand-new, limited edition.
It's irreplaceable, no matter the cost.

189
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,930
No, what am I thinking?

190
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,170
You have to know
which side your bread is buttered on.

191
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,570
If you play your cards right,
you can get anything you want.

192
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,480
But still, this is such a waste.

193
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,650
Whatever. Who cares if it's new?

194
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,820
As long as my husband gets
that director position, right?

195
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,990
This thing is a small price to pay.
I'd give up even more. Of course.

196
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,640
This way, when Kyung Chae gets home,
she'll see them right away.

197
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,110
Let's see here.

198
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,910
Okay, the department store logo
and the luxury brand name right here.

199
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,080
- What are you doing in here?
- Gosh, you scared me.

200
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,650
Perfect timing.

201
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,320
Manager Gong, what do you think?

202
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,150
It'd look great on Kyung Chae, right?

203
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,960
Ms. Kyung Chae doesn't like this style.

204
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,090
It's not just flashy. It's gaudy.

205
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,860
What? Do you have any idea
how much this costs?

206
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,930
It costs as much as a compact car.

207
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,070
It could cost as much as ten cars,
and it's still not Ms. Kyung Chae's style.

208
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,640
But what's with the sudden gift?

209
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,280
Are you trying to ask Ms. Kyung Chae
for a favor?

210
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,450
A favor? Don't be ridiculous.

211
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,850
Can't family give each other nice gifts?

212
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,020
It's a token of my affection.

213
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,930
Honey, how did it go?
With the gift for Kyung Chae.

214
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,990
Don't you worry.

215
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,630
I found something that's just her style.

216
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,570
It's a new designer piece,
1 of only 3 in the entire country.

217
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,100
I left it perfectly laid out on her bed.

218
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,270
She's going to flip when she sees it.

219
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,880
No woman could possibly dislike it.

220
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,450
Gosh, you're the best wife. You did great.

221
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,020
You don't get something for nothing.
And this is no small gift.

222
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,190
She can't just take it
and pretend nothing happened.

223
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,490
Just you wait and see.

224
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,690
Kyung Chae will get rid of Soo Jung...

225
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,760
and hand the position over to you.

226
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,830
- You think so?
- Of course.

227
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,400
- Director Min Ji Seop.
- Hey, come on. I'm not the director yet.

228
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,170
But I have to admit, it sounds good.

229
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,840
Director Min Ji Seop.

230
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,940
Director Min Ji Seop.

231
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,410
Hey, Director Min!

232
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,440
Yes? What is it?

233
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,650
Director Min! Right!

234
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,050
It even sounds perfect.

235
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,950
What on earth are you doing?
Have you finally lost your mind?

236
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,590
It's nothing.

237
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,590
By the way,
about your director's office...

238
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,620
Keep it clean.

239
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,630
And don't redecorate it to your taste.

240
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,630
You must respect the next person's taste.

241
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,130
The next person? Who?

242
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,000
Is there someone else who'd be using
the director's office besides me?

243
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,000
Honestly, the things you say.

244
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,500
That position isn't yours forever,
you know.

245
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,440
Don't tell me...

246
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,610
you're not after my position, are you?

247
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,010
Why? So what if I am?

248
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,750
I know things aren't going well at work
or at home right now, but still.

249
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,230
That doesn't mean you should
start making trouble.

250
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,490
Just focus on being
a proper vice director.

251
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,300
You should have some decency.

252
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,070
The nerve of her.

253
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,540
Fine. We'll see about that.

254
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,110
Soon, I'm going to give my entire stake
to Kyung Chae,

255
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,140
and I swear
I'll take your position from you.

256
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,980
What? The chairman woke up?

257
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,380
This wasn't part of my plan.

258
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,990
So how did he wake up?

259
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
I don't know.

260
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,060
He can't communicate or move yet,

261
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,300
but he's definitely conscious.

262
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,100
That's a relief, at least.

263
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,400
If he could communicate
and had full use of his limbs,

264
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,470
then we'd really be done for.

265
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,470
So who's with him now?

266
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,540
Lucia.

267
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,950
What? And you're just letting her?

268
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,910
- You have to get her away from him.
- What am I supposed to do?

269
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,420
She's blocked all family members
from seeing my father except for herself.

270
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Yes, it's me.

271
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,730
If you're at the hospital,
just listen. Don't talk.

272
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,800
Chairman Min definitely knows.

273
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
That I'm...

274
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,540
the son of Han Kyung Soo,
the CEO of Doeun Industries.

275
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,980
Back in the hospital room,
he didn't have any particular reaction...

276
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,110
until he saw me.
You saw how violently he reacted, right?

277
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,820
Once Chairman Min recovers from paralysis
and can speak again,

278
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,420
the first thing he'll do
is hire someone to take me out.

279
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,220
Just like he did to Mr. Jo.

280
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,690
That's how...

281
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,430
Chairman Min handles things.

282
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,310
You're not really going to hurt Tae Kyung,
are you?

283
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,740
Have you forgotten what you've done?

284
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,450
If you hurt Tae Kyung as well,

285
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,180
you will never be forgiven,
not even in death.

286
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,650
If you wake up only to destroy him,

287
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,830
I'll make sure you never wake up again.

288
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,260
Failing to protect the one I love once...

289
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,230
was more than enough.

290
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,410
So no one can get near him,
and only Lucia is by the chairman's side?

291
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
If this keeps up...

292
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,980
and my father can suddenly communicate,
even as soon as tonight,

293
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,880
he'll give everything to the woman
who was right there by his side,

294
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,250
including his stake and the company.

295
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,620
That's usually what happens.
They leave everything to their caregiver.

296
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,530
Then we have to get Lucia away
from the chairman.

297
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,130
I already told you.

298
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,430
She's my father's legal guardian,
so there's nothing we can do.

299
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:12,140
If they're legally married, then it's true
all the rights go to the spouse.

300
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,640
The chairman's stake, his cash accounts,
and even his real estate.

301
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,480
Anything in the chairman's name,

302
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,350
the spouse receives the largest share,
be it inheritance or a gift.

303
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,450
That's what Lawyer Kim said,
but I don't know what to do.

304
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,620
Whether my father lives or dies,

305
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,860
that woman is the only one
who benefits in the end.

306
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,390
Then divorce is the only answer.

307
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,400
- Divorce?
- We'll have to make them.

308
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,430
You just said there's no other way.

309
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,940
Are you happy keeping Father to yourself
and shutting his children out?

310
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,180
Shouldn't his children have the right
to know his condition?

311
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,250
Since when have you all been so concerned?

312
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,990
I'm perfectly capable of taking care
of the chairman by myself.

313
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,330
I don't need any help from his children,
so just stay out of it.

314
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,200
Look at you, playing the devoted wife.

315
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,000
Father must be so lucky to have you.

316
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,800
Perfect timing. Everyone's here.

317
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,840
This lady here has something
to say about Father.

318
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,140
Go on, tell them.

319
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,740
We may not be allowed to visit,

320
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,280
but as his family,
we deserve to know how he's doing.

321
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,950
The chairman has regained consciousness.

322
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,720
But his body is still paralyzed,
and he can't speak.

323
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,290
What? When?

324
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,560
You should have told us right away!

325
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,830
Then we should go see him at least once.

326
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,700
We've been worried about Dad's condition,
but we couldn't visit because of you.

327
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,070
Then let's all just go together tomorrow.

328
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,470
But this woman here...

329
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,570
is refusing to let us visit again,
just like last time.

330
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,970
I wonder what she's plotting,
keeping Father all to herself.

331
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,880
Like I said,

332
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,310
I'm taking care of the chairman.
I don't need your help.

333
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,450
So without my permission, no one is to...

334
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,220
Still, shouldn't we see him
for ourselves at least once?

335
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,120
Just let us see Dad, please.

336
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,560
That way, we can prepare ourselves too.

337
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,860
Prepare yourselves?

338
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
For what?

339
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,190
I see.

340
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,230
You mean, prepare to split the inheritance
when the chairman passes?

341
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,430
Is that it?

342
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,240
Don't get the wrong idea.

343
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,070
The chairman is going to walk out of there
on his own two feet.

344
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,810
Let me say it again.
No one is allowed without my permission.

345
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,540
Don't even think about
visiting the hospital.

346
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,820
What is wrong with her, seriously?

347
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,590
You can't be so possessive of Father!

348
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,990
I can't let that happen.

349
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,760
What if he says something about Tae Kyung
in front of his children?

350
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,510
What is all this?

351
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,050
Ms. Ja Kyung left these for you as a gift.

352
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,010
A gift? Why all of a sudden?

353
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,480
I know, right?

354
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,150
I have no idea
why she's suddenly doing this.

355
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,060
I guess she's trying
to get on your good side for some reason.

356
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,820
I see.

357
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,430
Goodness, Ja Kyung is so easy to read.

358
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,540
So you're trying to separate Lucia
from the chairman?

359
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,110
I'm looking for a way,
but it's not proving easy.

360
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,310
It's ironic, isn't it?

361
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,780
In the past, you were trying
to get Lucia to marry the chairman,

362
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,820
and you stayed up all night
looking for a way, just like you are now.

363
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,630
But now, you're doing the same thing
to make them divorce.

364
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,230
I'm not the one who's strange.

365
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,030
The situation has changed.

366
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,600
Back then, I never dreamed
that Se Ri was Ho Se's daughter.

367
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Blood ties are a powerful thing,
aren't they?

368
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,910
What do you mean?

369
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,180
I always thought that to you, Lucia and I
were more than just a matter of blood.

370
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,980
But now that your own flesh and blood
has appeared, it's like we're nothing.

371
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,090
Tae Joo.

372
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,120
I'm not blaming you, Mother.
I'm just saying.

373
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,830
Anyway, let me know
when you've made up your mind.

374
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,930
I have to do my part.

375
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,680
Yes, Pan Sool.
What's this about so late at night?

376
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,980
Stella.

377
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,080
I hope I didn't wake a sleeping goddess
from her beauty rest.

378
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,990
No, I'm still up.

379
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,560
Still awake at this hour?
I wonder what you're thinking about.

380
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,890
The stars, the wind, a poem...

381
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,230
Or maybe Oh Pan Sool?

382
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,070
You did cross my mind.
But seriously, what's this about?

383
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,070
Well,

384
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,670
about that Mingang stake I entrusted
to you, Stella.

385
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
I was just wondering what happened to it.

386
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,850
I haven't heard from you at all.

387
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,750
I found a good prospect
and made an investment,

388
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,620
so don't you worry.

389
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,820
And here I was, completely in the dark.

390
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,490
I couldn't reach you, and I was worried
you had taken the money and run.

391
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,960
You scared me!

392
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,900
What are you doing sneaking around
instead of sleeping?

393
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,570
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

394
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,810
Your heart's still in your chest,
so you'll live.

395
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,510
You're acting suspicious. Why sneak out
to make a call in the middle of the night?

396
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,180
- Who is it? What floozy is it?
- Why cuss in the middle of the night?

397
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,350
Just get back in bed and go to sleep.

398
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,990
You're the one being shady,
so why are you getting so defensive?

399
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,960
Your face is scary enough
in broad daylight,

400
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,460
but out here in the pitch dark
with this light,

401
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,160
you'd even scare a ghost.

402
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,100
Here, take a look.

403
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,010
(Mingang Distribution)

404
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,890
You're here.

405
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,890
You said it was important,
but you could have just called.

406
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,930
I'm going to make your father and Lucia
get a divorce today.

407
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
What?

408
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,400
What are you talking...

409
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,200
Didn't you say
divorce was the only option?

410
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,340
As the chairman's wife, she's set to take
both the inheritance and his position.

411
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,910
You expect me to just stand by
and watch that happen?

412
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,480
I'll take care of everything,

413
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,050
so from now on,
you just do exactly as I say.

414
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,380
Got it?

415
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,330
Excuse me. Do you have a moment?

416
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,260
What brings you here?

417
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,970
There's something I need to say
to you and Lucia.

418
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,370
- What's this all of a sudden?
- I'm sure you have grievances with me.

419
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,710
I know how you two must be feeling.

420
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,920
That's why this is something
I have to say.

421
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,590
How about we meet at Pimaso
by the Mucheon Roundabout...

422
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,050
in about two hours?

423
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,560
Just say it here.
Besides, none of the other staff are here.

424
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,630
No, this is something we need
to discuss in private.

425
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,100
It's important.

426
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,630
I'll be waiting,
so make sure you're there.

427
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,680
Madam Jang wants to meet with us.
What should we do?

428
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,550
Madam Jang? What about?

429
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,250
She said she has something important
to tell us.

430
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,360
We should probably hear her out, right?

431
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,420
Yes, we should.

432

(Mingang Distribution)

433
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,600
Come with me to Hankuk Hospital.

434
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,840
I can do that, but may I ask why?

435
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,270
You'll see when we get there.

436
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,680
I'll be back soon.
In about an hour or two.

437
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,220
Don't you worry. I'll keep a close eye
on him while you're gone.

438
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,750
Thank you.

439
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,280
You're here first. Lucia isn't here yet.

440
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,530
- What's this about?
- What's the rush?

441
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,030
Let's order some tea first.

442
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,630
Excuse me!

443
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,780
Ms. Kim Sun Young?

444
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,280
Yes, that's me. And you are?

445
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,320
You're not allowed in here. Get out, now!

446
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,490
Your mother is Kim Myeong Sook, isn't she?

447
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,620
And she's at the Dodong Nursing Home.

448
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,960
How do you know my mother?

449
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,200
Did something happen to my mom?

450
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,860
Come with me, and you'll find out.

451
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,830
She's not doing very well.

452
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Okay.

453
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,550
What are you doing here again?

454
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,020
Go home. Right now!

455
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,330
I can't even stand to look at you.
Get out of my sight.

456
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,360
Lucia!

457
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,830
What are you waiting for?
Help me carry him.

458
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,740
We have to move him to another hospital.

459
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,740
Somewhere that woman won't find him.

(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

461
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,180
Just lie there and think hard
about what you did wrong to deserve this.

462
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,180
Is there anything we can even do?

463
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,210
There is one thing.

The locked desk drawer
in the chairman's office.

465
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,020
Baek Sul Hee, this is the last break
you're getting from me.

466
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,620
So you're really going
to go through with signing this?

467
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,990
I can't go through the same thing again.

468
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,020
This awful bond was my doing.
I have to be the one to break it.
