(Episode 52)

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,880
You little rat.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,380
You dare take my ledger?

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,150
Where's the darn ledger?

5
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,600
Yeon Ah!

6
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,570
Yeon Ah!

7
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,340
Wake up.

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,910
Yeon Ah!

9
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,440
Wake up, Yeon Ah!

10
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,980
Yeon Ah! Wake up!

11
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,550
Sul Hee?

12
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,150
It's me. Are you okay?

13
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,320
Yes.

14
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,520
Let's go to a hospital.

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,320
No, I'm fine. I wasn't hit by the car.

16
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,000
It could've gone really bad.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,600
I told you to be careful.

18
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,830
About the secret ledger you wanted.

19
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,270
No. I don't care if he took it from you.

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,770
As long as you're okay.

21
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,970
I didn't lose it.

22
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,510
What?

23
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,110
What do you mean?

24
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,950
I hid it in case...

25
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,480
he'd find it on me.

26
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,290
I hid the ledger
in the youngest daughter's bedroom.

27
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,330
You go and get it
before someone else does.

28
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,770
Why did you leave in a hurry yesterday?

29
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
I apologize.

30
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,810
Why was your phone turned off?

31
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,770
I was flustered and didn't realize.

32
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,980
What got you flustered?

33
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,950
What was that
you didn't get to say yesterday?

34
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,150
Well...

35
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,350
Whatever I say,

36
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,790
you must trust and believe me.

37
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,920
It's hard for me to tell you this.

38
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,190
Why are you being so long-winded?

39
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,660
Many years ago, I dated...

40
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,760
Excuse me.

41
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,170
Goodness.

42
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,170
As soon as you expose my true identity,

43
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,310
the whole world will see
Min Doo Sik's slush fund ledger.

44
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,140
That means your window-dressed ledger
will come out too.

45
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,050
Don't forget
that one of those ledgers is with me.

46
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,220
What did you do many years ago?

47
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,690
Something urgent came up.

48
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm sorry, sir.

49
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,530
What the...

50
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,530
My gosh.

51
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
Hey.

52
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,640
You dare blackmail me?

53
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,840
Why can't I do what you do every day?

54
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,780
You almost killed my sister.

55
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,510
She isn't dead, and she provided a cause.

56
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,510
Why did she take my ledger?

57
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,250
Don't you know that's theft?

58
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,520
Does the chairman know...

59
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,050
you're duping him with a fake ledger?

60
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,320
Who says it's a fake?

61
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,990
I'm hiding and investing his dirty money.

62
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,960
That's not all you're doing.

63
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,390
I know what you're like, Sun Jae.

64
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,500
You have another separate ledger...

65
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,960
you'll use to blackmail him with.

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,300
Watch what you say.

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,970
Hand it over before I turn really nasty,

68
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,710
or even I don't know what I'll do to you.

69
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,940
You want to bury me alive, don't you?

70
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,180
But guess what?

71
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,880
The chairman freaks out...

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,610
if he can't reach me for just a few hours.

73
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,680
Does this mean...

74
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,850
we know one secret about each other?

75
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,520
How can I believe you have the ledger?

76
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,120
I checked, and your sister didn't have it.

77
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,530
Don't believe it if you don't want to.

78
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,130
Does she really have the ledger?

79
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,860
She can't have it.

80
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,470
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

81
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,170
Did you tell the chairman?

82
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,640
Not yet.

83
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,950
Are you kidding me?

84
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,420
You acted as if you were
going to reveal something massive.

85
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,520
You didn't even tell me what it was.

86
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,050
You said you'd tell the chairman yourself.

87
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,720
The timing wasn't right.

88
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,120
When I'm more positive...

89
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,060
What secret
are you so reluctant to reveal?

90
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,060
You acted as if one word from you
would ruin Lucia forever.

91
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,270
Are you hiding something from me?

92
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,870
Why would I do that?

93
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,840
I have a feeling you are.

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,210
I hate that woman just as much as you do.

95
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,610
To be honest, I don't just hate her.

96
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,340
We're sworn enemies right now.

97
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,180
That had better be true.

98
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,050
Or things will get really bad.

99
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,650
(Trustworthy Police, Safe Country)

100
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,790
Come on.

101
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,420
Why is that so hard to look up?

102
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,820
I was held
in this police station 30 years ago.

103
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,590
Why do you want confirmation
of something as embarrassing as that?

104
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,300
I'm not proud of it,

105
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,570
but I need that confirmed
if I'm to clear my name.

106
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,970
What do you mean?

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,100
That's too long a story.

108
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,810
I just need to see
the holding cell records.

109
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,340
Those records...

110
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,250
aren't saved until
you're officially charged with a crime.

111
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,110
You said you were released right away.

112
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,250
Darn it.

113
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,120
Why don't you keep those records
when you keep everything else?

114
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,790
Wait.

115
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,360
Darn it.

116
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,530
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

117
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,800
(Stella Jang)

118
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,840
I meant to call you.

119
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,810
You're officially
a non-executive director.

120
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,650
No wonder.

121
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,380
I had a feeling
I'd get some good news today.

122
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,280
You could've called me.

123
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,590
I was busy and I forgot.

124
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,860
Why do you sound irritated?

125
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,330
You're not displeased
that I got the job, are you?

126
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,200
I had a lot to think about,
and now I have a headache.

127
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,230
We'll see each other more often now.

128
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,430
I'll work really hard.
I hope you appreciate it.

129
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,210
I see why she'd have a headache.

130
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,050
Do you work at Mingang now?

131
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,950
Not every day,
since it's a part-time position.

132
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,590
Mingang Distribution's equity structure.

133
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,860
Is what you got me all there is?

134
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,230
Are there any other variables?

135
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,530
There is one.

136
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,100
Oh Pan Sool, whose daughter
married Chairman Min's son.

137
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,000
He has a pretty big stake.

138
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,930
Oh, I remember him.

139
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,700
The silly man.

140
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,100
We met in Mingang's lobby.

141
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,370
If he were to give his shares
to his son-in-law, Min Ji Seop,

142
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,840
the situation would change.

143
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,610
We can't allow that. What should I do?

144
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,720
He's weird.
Why does he want to date at his age?

145
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,020
If things go really badly,

146
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,020
I might end up
with a mother-in-law my age.

147
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,390
He wouldn't marry her, I don't think.

148
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,820
He'll date her, then ditch her.

149
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,930
It doesn't look like that at all.

150
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,730
He even gave her
his late wife's diamond ring.

151
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,700
That's why Kyung Chae threw a fit.

152
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,700
It's pretty serious.

153
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,370
Why won't you say anything?

154
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,970
I don't like to talk a lot.

155
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,040
I prefer to communicate
with my eyes and expressions.

156
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,250
Don't you get what I mean?

157
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,650
So Ji Seop went to the office
to see his CEO sister?

158
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,790
Yes. He should be there by now.

159
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,190
You still don't get it?

160
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,060
He needs to side with his sister,
who also opposes the relationship,

161
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,930
and form an alliance.

162
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,430
The day the girlfriend
becomes a legal spouse...

163
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,600
is the day the worst happens
for the Min family.

164
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,280
Why are you here?

165
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,450
It's not exactly easy to talk at home...

166
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,850
with Soo Jung around.

167
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,790
Aren't you two close? You get along well.

168
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,060
That's because...

169
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,990
Forget it.

170
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,590
I'll hold back
because we need to join forces right now.

171
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,360
What does that mean?

172
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,800
That brat Soo Jung.

173
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,570
She doesn't care if Father marries Lucia.

174
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,270
She actually said she was all for it.

175
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,070
Se Ri is just a mindless kid.

176
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,810
Did Soo Jung say she was all for it?

177
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,710
That's why I'm so frustrated.

178
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,080
We should all get together
and object to the relationship.

179
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,510
Instead, we're scattered.

180
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,780
That's why we should
put our feelings aside...

181
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,990
and team up
when it comes to Father's love life. Okay?

182
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Goodness.

183
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,270
She's not here?

184
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,640
What are you doing here?

185
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,270
I know I quit my job, but how come...

186
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,110
you never even call?

187
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,780
You're the one who left without a goodbye.

188
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,150
Whatever.

189
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,880
Where is she?

190
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,180
Why do you want to see her?

191
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,920
She turned my house upside down.

192
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,990
Why?

193
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,990
Did the chairman
say something about Ms. Lucia?

194
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,860
You don't need to know
about my family's business.

195
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,530
Where did she go?

196
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,460
Darn it.

197
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,200
Whatever.

198
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,380
What are you doing here?

199
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,180
It's a family business.

200
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,250
Can't I drop by because I was fired?

201
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,280
You came to see Kyung Chae?

202
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,750
You want to see her
after what she did to you?

203
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,820
It's not because I'm nice or stupid.

204
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,790
It's because she's all I have right now.

205
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,460
Why? Will you two
gang up on Dad to stop him?

206
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,530
I don't get you.

207
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,530
If she were to marry our Father...

208
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,940
and become a legal member of the family,

209
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,570
she'd get some of Father's shares.

210
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,610
That will complicate our future.

211
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,210
I don't care about that.

212
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,080
Dad's happiness comes first.

213
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,150
Did that brat eat something weird?

214
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,260
You're leaving already?

215
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,360
I was here long enough.

216
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,930
You just got here.

217
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,030
I sat across from you,
and we talked and had tea.

218
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,070
I massaged your shoulders too,
and that's enough, I think.

219
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,700
Is it?

220
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,810
I hid the ledger
in the youngest daughter's bedroom.

221
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,610
You go and get it
before someone else does.

222
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,190
Can I visit you at home today?

223
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,320
Sorry. I'm meeting
a few other chairmen today.

224
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,630
Some other day, then.

225
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,170
Se Ri.

226
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,510
Are you surprised I called?

227
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,810
Not really. I'm pleased you did.

228
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,950
That's nice to hear.

229
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,350
Are you free right now?

230
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,050
Right now?

231
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,850
I'd like to see you all of a sudden.

232
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,590
I'll come over to your place.

233
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,530
Can't we meet somewhere else,
away from home?

234
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,200
No. I'll see you at home.

235
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,500
Can I go out for a while, Director?

236
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,640
Did something urgent come up?

237
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,040
I won't be long.

238
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,210
If it's important,
you can go straight home from there.

239
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,510
Can I do that?

240
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,150
We don't have any pressing business here.

241
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,990
You can go.

242
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,720
Okay.

243
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,470
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

244
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm going home.
Cancel the rest of my appointments.

245
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,250
I knew it. You're here for a reason.

246
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,280
It wasn't in the sister's bag.

247
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,990
She must've hidden it
somewhere in the house.

248
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,490
How dare you try to dupe me?

249
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,630
I wasn't expecting you.

250
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,100
Didn't Se Ri tell you?

251
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,670
I said I'd come and see her.

252
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,270
She just went out. She'll be back soon.

253
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,370
I'll wait in her room, then.

254
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,580
You can wait out here instead.

255
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,960
You're Manager Gong, right?

256
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,270
You must know
this belonged to the chairman's late wife.

257
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,170
Look carefully as to whose hand it's on.

258
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,370
Step aside.

259
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,840
Didn't you hear me?

260
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,890
The front gate was open.

261
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,830
Why are you home so early?

262
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,590
I don't feel too good.

263
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,160
Is someone here?

264
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,100
That woman is back.

265
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,500
What woman?

266
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,540
Where is she?

267
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,670
In Ms. Se Ri's room.

268
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,450
What are you doing here?

269
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,820
Why were you in an empty room?

270
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,020
Can I see that bag?

271
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
You can let me,
unless you have a dirty secret.

272
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,100
Let's see inside.

273
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,540
What did you steal that you can't show me?

274
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,180
What are you doing? Let go.

275
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,510
Give that back!

276
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,510
What are you doing?

277
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,520
What's wrong with you?

278
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,520
I asked her to come over.

279
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,120
You can't treat my guest like this!

280
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,220
I have a reason.

281
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,230
She took something from your room.

282
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,660
What's in my room?

283
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,260
There's nothing.

284
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,500
There's no cash or bank account books.

285
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,230
Oh, I don't even have any shares.

286
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,740
That's why I want a look.

287
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,240
Why are you so rude?

288
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,410
Is this what you're like?

289
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,550
Why do you treat people so badly?

290
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,580
I should go. See you some other time.

291
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,670
I'm sorry. Let me apologize instead.

292
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,170
No. You shouldn't have to apologize.

293
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,940
Did you really...

294
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,940
take something from my room?

295
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,350
No.

296
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,520
Kyung Chae isn't the type to lie.

297
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,650
You don't trust me either.

298
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,690
Do you want to search my bag too?

299
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,360
You must, if you don't trust me.

300
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,830
Here.

301
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Go ahead.

302
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,470
I shouldn't have come here.

303
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,570
This is what I get for wanting to see you.

304
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,780
Let's never meet again.

305
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,510
I'll tell the chairman.

306
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,150
I was serious.

307
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,850
I cared about you
because I thought of you...

308
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,890
as if you were my own.

309
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,890
I shouldn't care about just anyone.

310
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,190
I overstepped.

311
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,130
This is my last visit.
I won't come here again.

312
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,830
You can't say that.

313
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,140
You told me...

314
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,370
that I might be a weed now,
but I could become a flower.

315
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,240
You said you'd help me.

316
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,980
How can I help when you don't trust me?

317
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,950
I'm the only one who cares.

318
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,620
Don't give up on me.

319
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,350
I don't want to be a weed any longer.

320
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,320
As I said,

321
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,630
you need to trust me
if that's what you want.

322
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,460
You doubt me
because of what your sister says.

323
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,060
How can I help you?

324
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,370
It won't happen again.

326
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,850
Whatever others say,
you must trust me now.

327
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,820
Only then can I treat
and help you sincerely.

328
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,290
Do you get what I mean?

329
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Go back upstairs. I'll be in touch.

330
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,070
See you again soon.

331
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,130
I knew it.

332
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,970
I'll report you for a hit-and-run.

333
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,270
Go ahead! I'd actually love that.

334
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,510
That will expose who you are...

335
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,070
and what you're up to.

336
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,420
I told you that you wouldn't get your way.

337
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,890
- Give me that.
- No.

338
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,260
Now you can't threaten me
with Min Doo Sik's ledger,

339
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,360
so your fate is in my hands again.

340
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,800
You shouldn't have gone so far.

341
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,950
What are you two doing here?

342
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,320
Chairman.

343
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,250
What are you two doing outside my house?

344
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,690
I was leaving
after a short chat with Se Ri.

345
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,790
Is that why you asked if you could visit?

346
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
Yes.

347
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,030
What about you?

348
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,070
He was in the area on business.

349
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,240
We met by chance,
and he offered to drive me back to work.

350
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,370
Thank you, but I'll find my way home.
You can go ahead.

351
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,880
Why don't you come in for a cup of tea?

352
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,610
No, sir.

353
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,680
I have some work to finish.

354
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,320
- What about you?
- Me?

355
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,720
Shall I stay a bit longer
now that you're here?

356
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,850
Yes.

357
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,150
- You can go, then.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,500
Shoot.

359
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,500
Darn it.

360
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,630
Why are you back this early?

361
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,760
I came to change for a gathering.

362
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,960
What gathering is it?

363
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,630
I'll help you choose an outfit.

364
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,400
You're meeting a few chairman friends,
and it's not for work.

365
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,170
You should wear something casual.

366
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,840
I'll take care of that.

367
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,710
I pick out what the chairman should wear.

368
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,010
I think it would be nice for him
to wear something different for a change.

369
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,350
He should wear what suits
the time, place, and occasion.

370
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,820
An impulsive decision...

371
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,820
You're always in a suit and tie,
and it's a bit suffocating.

372
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,490
Is it?

373
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,590
You pick out something for me, then.

374
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,870
Let's see.

375
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,540
I don't like this.

376
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,070
What about this?

377
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,340
This suits you.

378
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,750
But then, everything suits you.

379
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,850
Don't be silly.

380
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,720
Didn't you know?

381
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,890
You make anything you wear stand out.

382
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,090
Anyone who didn't know you
would think you were a model.

383
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,820
You're such a liar.

384
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,090
You can joke like that too?

385
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,160
You look great, sir.

386
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,330
Isn't this too flashy?
I might look immature.

387
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,940
- It's a nice, young look.
- My goodness.

388
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,000
You're a great model for any look.

389
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,110
My gosh.

390
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,780
He's more thorough than I thought.

391
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,410
He acts like a loyal subject...

392
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,080
only to keep a dark secret?

393
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,120
I bet there are accounts
in borrowed names too.

394
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,320
He got agitated when I mentioned that.

395
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,860
Now that we have this,

396
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,790
he can't threaten you anymore.

397
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,500
Oh, I heard today
that I'm now a non-executive director.

398
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,530
That's great.

399
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,640
I looked into the structure
of Mingang's equity.

400
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,570
Someone else...

401
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,310
has a pretty big stake in the company.

402
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,880
His name is Oh Pan Sool.

403
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,110
His daughter married Min Doo Sik's son.

404
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,250
Who he gives his shares to
will become an important variable...

405
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,750
down the line.

406
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,780
What should we do?

407
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,490
I have a plan.

408
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,320
Did Moon Tae Kyung
say anything since then?

409
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,090
He'll be pretty distracted.

410
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,360
He secured his last chance to reveal
the truth about his parents' death.

411
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,500
You can't get
the holding cell records, then?

412
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,440
They'd have made an official entry
if I were charged,

413
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,040
but I was released soon after.

414
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,210
I see...

415
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,940
What should we do now?

416
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,450
There should be records
of them questioning me.

417
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,880
I wish that would prove my alibi.

418
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,650
I doubt we can get those records.

419
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,720
It was so long ago,

420
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,190
and it's just a hassle to them.

421
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,060
The detective was really mean to me.

422
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,100
I'll show up every day and bother him...

423
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,660
until he gives me what I want.

424
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,270
We'll see who wins.

425
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,770
I told you she was no pushover.

426
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,470
She could cause some real trouble.

427
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,280
You saw how Ms. Se Ri defended her.

428
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,180
I've picked out the chairman's outfits...

429
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,720
for over 20 years.

430
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,350
How could she take that from me?

431
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,760
If I were to go against my father,

432
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,060
who would you side with?

433
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,100
I'd side with you, of course.

434
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,330
Do you mean that?

435
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,130
I came to work here
when your mother was still alive,

436
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,800
and I met you
when you were Ms. Se Ri's age.

437
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,940
I don't know when,
but you became like a daughter to me.

438
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,880
My ties to you grew even stronger...

439
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,620
when your mother fell ill and then died.

440
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,290
I didn't give birth to you,

441
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,120
but you are...

442
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,060
practically my daughter.

443
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,360
That will do.

444
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,530
This is just the beginning.

445
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,840
(Mingang Distribution)

446
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,580
Are you Jung Lucia
with the Online Business Team?

447
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,010
Yes.

448
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,610
I'm with World Patch.

449
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,020
There's talk that you're dating
Chairman Min Doo Sik.

450
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,520
I'll answer
if you request an official interview.

451
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,590
How long have you been together for?

452
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,830
I'll explain that later.

453
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,360
Where did you meet,
and how did you grow close?

454
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,930
Could you go into detail?

455
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,840
Did you approach the chairman on purpose?

456
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,710
I heard you were a gold digger.

457
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
What?

458
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
A gold digger?

459
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,230
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

460
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,750
Why would you run the risk
of being called a gold digger?

461
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,050
I expected this much.

462
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,280
It's a mountain I must climb.

463
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,120
You don't have to if you take my hand.

464
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,850
You're making things worse.

465
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,690
You should've known your place
and backed down.

466
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,530
Our stock price might take a hit.

467
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,530
We'll use that as an excuse
to call a board meeting and condemn him.

468
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,600
At the meeting, you'll get him...

469
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,670
