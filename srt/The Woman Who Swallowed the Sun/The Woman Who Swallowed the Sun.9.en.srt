1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,310
What's wrong with the news?

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,240
(Episode 9)

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,080
Why did they make things up?

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,150
None of that is true.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
That's all a lie!

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,950
Why would they report a lie?

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,720
Why?

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,020
Mi So. Don't cry.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,690
You might pass out again.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,960
How can I not cry when it's not fair?

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,130
The people who were on my side
are now attacking me.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,400
- Did you see that too?
- What? Yes...

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,570
They said I started the fight.

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,110
They said I picked on her to get beaten up
so I could blackmail her for money!

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,780
Even if everyone else says so,
those two should deny it.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,820
But the two who were on my side
are now telling lies.

17
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,690
Calm down, Mi So.
Let's go to your room to talk.

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,830
Let's go and talk.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,230
Come along.

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,080
Have they both lost their minds?

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,050
Why would they lie in an interview?

22
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,350
They were so worried about me.

23
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,850
They volunteered to help me.
Why did they change their minds?

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,090
Did I do something wrong?

25
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,760
Did I upset them somehow?

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,060
It's not like that. Don't think you did.

27
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,700
What now?

28
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,040
Now everyone will think...

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,840
I started the fight to get paid off.

30
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,780
She picked on me first.

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,020
She tracked me down again...

32
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,990
and assaulted me in the alley.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Mi So.

34
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,000
I know the truth.
You don't have to tell me.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,700
What if people believe the news...

36
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,140
and criticize me?

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,240
It's okay as long as
you know you're in the right.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,940
You can be proud of what you did.
That's what you were like.

39
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,880
I don't know anymore.

40
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,780
I don't feel like that now.

41
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,260
Mi So.

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,060
Try to get some sleep.

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,490
You haven't rested since you got home.

44
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,460
I'll go to the TV station
tomorrow and ask...

45
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,470
what happened to the news
and if someone put them up to it.

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,700
I'll find out and take care of it.

47
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,740
Trust me and calm down, okay?

48
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,570
Can you do that?

49
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,900
Did you watch the news?

50
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,440
What happens now?

51
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,970
Don't worry.

52
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,370
There won't be any family issues
affecting the business.

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,740
The assault did happen,
so there was no denying that.

54
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,050
I thought it would be best
to create a reason...

55
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,950
So you bought the witnesses
and found a stand-in to take the fall?

56
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,650
To make the victim look bad?

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,190
Because that's the best option.

58
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,750
That's the best option?

59
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,160
That's what I was taught.

60
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,090
Who do you think I learned that from?

61
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,790
Do a better job.

62
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,160
If you must crush someone,
make sure they never get back up.

63
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,400
Do a poor job and it'll only urge them on.

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,300
The lower their birth,
the harder it is to crush them.

65
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,900
It'll be taken care of by the time
the new business launches.

66
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,440
Promise me one thing, Father.

67
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,770
Don't scold Se Ri too much
when she comes home.

68
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,410
Should I praise her
for what she did, then?

69
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,310
Or welcome her with open arms?

70
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,050
That's not what I mean.
She's disheartened already.

71
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,320
She's the mess she is
because you coddle her.

72
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,950
I never coddled her.
I offered minimal protection.

73
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,460
Think about it.

74
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,690
No one in the family was ever on her side.

75
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,260
She'll have felt lonely and alone.

76
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,730
Living abroad on her own from a young age.

77
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,600
What do you want me to do?

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,730
Should we all gather around her
and kiss her silly?

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,170
Treat her like any normal family
would treat a child.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
Then she'll change.

81
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,380
She must feel and learn things
if she lives with us.

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,280
I can't believe
I'm letting someone like her...

83
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,210
control my blood pressure!

84
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,510
Just this once.

85
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,150
Be merciful enough to let it go this time.

86
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,860
I get that you're looking out for her
as an older sister,

87
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,460
but don't go too far.

88
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,130
You can't let anyone think
you're trying too hard.

89
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,330
If people start to suspect,
they'll only cause a headache.

90
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,070
I know what you mean.

91
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,340
What you worry about will never happen.

92
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,680
I'm really impressed.

93
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,210
How did you turn the tide?

94
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,580
Do you know that what you did is a crime?

95
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,650
What are you saying?

96
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,150
However much you hated me,

97
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,960
however much you wanted my position,
you shouldn't have done that.

98
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,430
You leaked information
that could damage the company.

99
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,600
Did you lose control
because Father offered you my title?

100
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,030
Is there proof...

101
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,300
that I leaked the story?

102
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,940
Would you have left any?

103
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,970
I bet you didn't even call in person.

104
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,270
You'd have gotten someone
to call the press...

105
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,480
and told them
to run the story without proof.

106
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,610
With the plan to get Se Ri to confess
if nothing else worked out.

107
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,220
But luckily for you, something surfaced.

108
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,750
Don't blame the innocent.

109
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,450
I'm warning you.

110
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,290
If you do something like this once more,

111
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,430
look forward to what I'll do for you.

112
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,530
I'll risk my title to bring you down.

113
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,010
What is Mi So doing?

114
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,220
She just fell asleep.

115
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,490
Goodness.

116
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,290
I don't believe what happened.

117
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,860
We were hit by a bolt of lightning.

118
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,360
I need to go somewhere
as soon as the day breaks.

119
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,590
Can you watch Mi So for me?

120
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,330
Talk to her
so she doesn't get silly ideas,

121
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,800
and keep her at home.

122
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
Make sure she eats and...

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,670
Don't waste your breath
to say the obvious.

124
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,900
Do you think I won't do that
unless you tell me to?

125
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,410
Even if we must keep the bar closed,

126
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,480
I'll stay with Mi So, so don't you worry.

127
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,550
Okay. Thanks.

128
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,310
Do you think...

129
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,750
we can leave Mi So like this?

130
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,320
The news was a massive shock to her.

131
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,950
But then...

132
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,460
I was furious, so she would've been too.

133
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,260
They reported a lie and faked interviews.

134
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,760
Is that allowed?

135
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,060
Maybe it was wrong of me
to go to the newspaper.

136
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,930
And to ask Mi So
to watch the news with me.

137
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,110
I'm not in my right mind.

138
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,910
I gave my friend the video...

139
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,380
and told her the assailant
was Mingang's chairman's daughter.

140
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,550
That's what my friend understood too.

141
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,320
- Hello.
- Hi.

142
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,490
The interview clips came in
right before they went on air.

143
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,290
The story changed at the last minute.

144
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,360
My friend reported as she was told,

145
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,730
but who'd have expected a twist like that?

146
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,570
Then the person who gave the order
must be above your anchor friend.

147
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,970
I'd say so.

148
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,240
And anyone capable of
influencing someone high up...

149
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,640
would be someone
from Mingang Distribution.

150
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,480
That's a reasonable assumption.
They made a quick move.

151
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,420
Then print an article
to correct the facts.

152
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,690
That's easier said than done.

153
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,830
The TV station interviewed the witnesses,
so the burden of proof is on us.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,360
What should we do now?

155
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,270
My daughter saw the report
and is in shock.

156
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,870
I'm really sorry,

157
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,100
but there's nothing I can do.

158
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,640
Unless we find out who made them...

159
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,570
change the story and prove the lie.

160
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,290
(The victim was a baiter? No way.)

161
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,090
(She's picking up some bad tricks
at a young age.)

162
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,720
(The poor will do anything for money.)

163
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,670
Did you get Mi So to eat something?

164
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,470
I pleaded with her to eat,
and she had some fruit too.

165
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,080
Did she go to sleep? She has been quiet.

166
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,410
What did she do?

167
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,010
The same stuff.

168
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,180
Sit around or stare
far into the distance in shock.

169
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,750
What did the newspaper journalist say?

170
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,190
He doesn't know
where the story came from either.

171
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,160
Who would know, then?

172
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,500
You can't trust anyone these days.

173
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,530
What should we do?

174
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,770
Should we post on the Cheongwadae webpage?

175
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,970
Who knows?
Someone might read it and offer to help.

176
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,140
Oh, no.

177
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,550
What is this?

178
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,220
What's wrong? What is it now?

179
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,160
Don't read this.

180
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,360
People call me trash.

181
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,270
They want me to die.

182
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,200
Let's chat about other stuff
instead of reading this.

183
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
How...

184
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,480
can they tell someone to die?

185
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,310
Why would you even read this stuff?

186
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,180
Let's go shopping.

187
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,420
We can eat out and buy some clothes.

188
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,590
You need new clothes for high school.

189
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,260
What if I go outside
and people recognize me?

190
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,130
What if they do?
Did you do something wrong?

191
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,130
Why would you feel intimidated
when you didn't do anything wrong?

192
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,270
I don't know.

193
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,070
People say bad stuff about me,

194
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,270
and it feels like I did do something bad.

195
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,710
Mi So.

196
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,110
I can't do this anymore.

197
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,020
I'll go and ask and complain.

198
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,860
Bo Ram's family moved.

199
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,760
She transferred to a new school...

200
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,660
while you were in the hospital.

201
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,430
What about the coffee shop owner?
I'll talk to him, then.

202
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
He sold the cafe and left a while ago.

203
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,770
I trusted them both,

204
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,280
and this is what happened.

205
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,410
That's why I went
to where you were assaulted...

206
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,080
to find new evidence.

207
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,120
Yeon Ah helped too.

208
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,020
How could she do that?

209
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,990
Bo Ram was my best friend.

210
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,190
Do you know what people say?

211
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,590
They say I'm the assailant
and she's the victim.

212
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,700
They say a money-mad girl
from a poor family,

213
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,840
which is me,

214
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,070
preyed upon a rich girl
who knew nothing about the world.

215
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,480
There's even an online forum
of people rooting for her.

216
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,860
Darn it.

217
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,530
I can't even get into my own house?

218
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,440
It's all her fault.

219
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,810
A rat like her forgot her place
and dared to get on my nerves.

220
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,160
It's a fun report,
however many times I watch it.

221
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,860
(Lured into assaulting for pay?)

222
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,390
I'm loving the comments.

223
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,860
Yes. Get chewed out
until there's nothing left of you.

224
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,160
You'll want to die.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,670
Wait. I'm famous.

226
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,170
A forum of my fans?

227
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,740
I should join.

228
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,180
Kyung Chae is like a bulldozer
once she sets her mind on something.

229
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,880
She pushes her way through anything.

230
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:58,050
Ji Seop said
she was tough even as a child.

231
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,220
Even Father gave in
when she put her foot down.

232
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,490
She spent a fortune to cover up
the trouble the youngest caused.

233
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,360
That explains the sentiment online.

234
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,330
People are criticizing the victim
and defending your sister-in-law.

235
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,370
Kyung Chae is awesome at stuff like that.

236
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,770
She bought the witnesses
and made them lie in an interview,

237
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,370
then sent the tapes to the TV station.

238
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,970
And hired people
to flood the Internet with comments.

239
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,440
That's incredible.

240
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,780
How can someone be that smart?
I'm jealous.

241
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,150
That's why she's the CEO
of a massive company.

242
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,820
You need to watch who you side with.

243
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,350
If Kyung Chae becomes chairwoman,
be sure to appease her...

244
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,720
That makes as much sense
as building a bridge with jelly.

245
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,160
Why should she be chairwoman
when there's Ji Seop?

246
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,890
Is our son-in-law a fool?

247
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,430
I wish he'd become chairman,
but realistically speaking, it's unlikely.

248
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,700
As unlikely as you scalding your throat
by drinking boiling water from a kettle.

249
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,070
If you talk such nonsense again,

250
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,370
I'll kick you out, Yang Mal Sook.

251
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,110
What did I say? I just shared an opinion.

252
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,410
Can't I say what I think?

253
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,480
You can't, so don't. Shut your mouth.

254
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,350
Don't you dare belittle our son-in-law.

255
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,480
- I meant...
- My darling wife. Shut your mouth.

256
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,530
My gosh. Se Ri.

257
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,270
Hey.

258
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,140
Ja Kyung.

259
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,580
Come in.

260
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,020
Hello, Ms. Se Ri. It has been a while.

261
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,680
Manager Gong!

262
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,560
The chairman told me to prepare
the second-floor guest room.

263
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,190
That's your room now.

264
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,730
Dad said that?

265
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,700
I guess Father is willing to forgive you.

266
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,640
I was scared for no reason.

267
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,940
I'm dead tired.

268
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,440
I waited outside for hours.

269
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,020
Manager Gong, I'm hungry. Set the table.

270
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,520
Stop!

271
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,490
- Darn it. Get him.
- Oh, no.

272
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,190
- What the heck?
- Shoot.

273
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,900
- You! Stop right there!
- Leave me alone.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,530
Oh, no.

275
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,970
Shoot!

276
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,140
Darn it.

277
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm asking you nicely to hand it over.

278
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,860
How dare you take the stakes?

279
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,260
I took my money.

280
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,560
I knew right away
that you were conning me.

281
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,600
As if we were.

282
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,530
The money you put on the table
is ours once the game starts.

283
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,000
No one's allowed to take it and run.

284
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,550
Darn you. Die.

285
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,510
How dare you?

286
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,850
What are you doing?

287
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,650
What's this?

288
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,460
Who are you?

289
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,730
Oh, are you working with him?

290
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,500
He stole our money and ran.

291
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,900
I didn't steal it!

292
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,800
You're both frauds!

293
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,770
That's enough. I see you all feel wronged.

294
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,440
How about we let the police...

295
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,810
decide who committed a worse crime?

296
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,180
I'm not working with this man.

297
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,380
I'm just a passer-by
who saw a fight. Right?

298
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,720
I suggest we all go to a police station
and decide whose money this is.

299
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,690
Oh, we might not have to go anywhere.

300
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,730
I could ask some officers to come over.

301
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,860
- No, leave it.
- Don't call anyone.

302
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,200
- Darn it.
- It's our loss.

303
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,700
Don't you want to stay
and get your money back?

304
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,950
Give me that.

305
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,430
Why do you insist on finding out...

306
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,200
what happened over 20 years ago?

307
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,770
I want to reinstate my parents' honor.

308
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,040
They died before their time
and lost their company.

309
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,570
I should do what a son should
and correct it.

310
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,080
I guess they would feel wronged
considering what happened.

311
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,380
What really happened that day?

312
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,920
Someone was behind the accident, right?

313
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,860
They took my father's secret document.

314
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,790
You just won't give up.

315
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,460
Who would it be if not me?

316
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,130
Min Doo Sik.

317
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,770
Chairman Min Doo Sik...

318
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,200
of Mingang Distribution.

319
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,180
Look into my eyes
and say I'm wrong if I am,

320
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,980
and I won't pester you ever again.

321
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,580
It's Chairman Min, isn't it?

322
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,550
The person behind my parents' death.

323
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,130
I can't say much today
because of my busted lip.

324
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,430
Come back another time.

325
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,830
Let's have a drink.

326
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,090
Let me through.

327
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,460
You need to stop doing this.

328
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,430
You did this once before.

329
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,230
Don't you know why I'm doing this?

330
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,300
Don't you know what your CEO did?

331
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,370
We're following our manual.

332
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,370
We weren't told to let you in.

333
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,870
That's why I want to
talk to her and not you.

334
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,710
Go away. We can't let you in.

335
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,710
Listen!

336
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,010
What's the matter?

337
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,120
Didn't you say you'd found
new evidence to bury me with?

338
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,980
You were so confident.

339
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,150
How could you air a lie on TV?

340
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,790
How dare you buy the witnesses?

341
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,990
Do you know the state my daughter's in?

342
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,990
Why should I care about your daughter?

343
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,660
Did you make things worse
for my sister's sake?

344
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Your sister's in the wrong.

345
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,240
You both should've done the right thing.

346
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,140
If you didn't like the news report,
call the Press Arbitration Commission.

347
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,540
Report the TV station.

348
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,780
You might as well sue me too.

349
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,150
Why come here and scream
when you have a lot to do?

350
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,550
What else am I supposed to do...

351
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,380
when my daughter is withering away?

352
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,050
I'm just a sister,
so I don't know how a mom feels.

353
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,990
Take legal action.

354
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,560
Isn't that more efficient?

355
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,560
Do you think I'll let this go?

356
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,460
Do whatever you want.

357
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,730
I won't stop you.

358
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,230
Hey. Stop right there.

359
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,470
Let go of me!

360
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,740
We were talking! Come back!

361
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,510
Let me go so I can talk to her.

362
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Darn it.

363
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,030
What are you doing?

364
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,930
What do you think you're doing?

365
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,170
How dare you come here and cause trouble?

366
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,700
You're the one causing trouble.

367
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,770
The CEO you're so loyal to
and your company.

368
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,010
This is why I left you.

369
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,340
Don't you know how things work?

370
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,540
You can never win.
Mingang is a powerful company.

371
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,780
No. I refuse to back down.

372
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,520
Why should the truth be covered up?

373
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,480
The story they make up becomes the truth,

374
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,150
not the story that powerless you tell.

375
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,490
Get in touch with reality.

376
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,760
See how things work in the real world.

377
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,290
The world...

378
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,500
or at least Korea sides with the powerful.

379
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,430
You can't change anything.

380
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,370
Demand a fortune in compensation.
Money is what they have too much of.

381
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,370
Getting a massive payout is best
for you and your daughter.

382
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,980
You want me to be a coward
like you and compromise?

383
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,740
Oh, come on.

384
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,610
Hey. If you keep doing this,

385
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,020
both you and your daughter
will end up in danger, okay?

386
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,590
You just crossed the line.

387
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,530
You should never
have threatened my daughter.

388
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,860
Not you at least.

389
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Wait and see what I do to you.

390
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,340
My gosh.

391
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,050
Darn it.

392
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,830
There's no need to act scared.
It's your home too.

393
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,040
There's no need to be all stiff.
Relax and eat.

394
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,470
Okay.

395
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,880
How about...

396
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,220
we have a drink to celebrate
the safe return of our youngest?

397
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,990
Raise your glasses.

398
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,520
Eat in silence.

399
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,360
Father.

400
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,060
It has been years since
the whole family got together to eat.

401
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,730
We should celebrate...

402
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,330
so we have more love to share.

403
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,100
Raise your glasses.

404
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,510
Come on. Let's have a drink.

405
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:29,110
This is the 1920 vintage wine
from Val d'Or in France.

406
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,480
I opened one of my precious bottles
to mark a great day.

407
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,790
I told you to eat in silence.

408
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,350
What should I toast to? Mingang's future?

409
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,090
No, that's boring.

410
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,660
Yes.

411
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,800
Let the Min Family last forever!

412
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,400
Don't go too far!

413
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,830
Did something amazing happen?

414
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,270
What are you so excited about?

415
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,870
Why don't you dance too?

416
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,770
Darn you.

417
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,250
Eat a bit more.

418
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,120
My mouth is too dry.

419
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,290
Shall I make you kimchi fried rice?

420
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,690
With lots of cheese topping.

421
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,090
You love that.

422
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,560
Next time.

423
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,040
Is there nothing we can do
about the news broadcast?

424
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,410
We have to prove
the interviews were a lie,

425
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,180
but I can't reach either of them.

426
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,780
I hate Mingang Distribution,
but I hate those two...

427
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,020
even more than them.

428
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,520
If I feel this way, how would Mi So feel?

429
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,690
She trusted them both.

430
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,710
Live quietly.

431
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,090
- Okay.
- It's a warning, not a request.

432
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,760
It might be your last warning.

433
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,590
I know that.

434
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,770
Hang in there until you're 20.

435
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,770
If you stay out of trouble until then,
I'll find it out for you.

436
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,180
The one thing you want to know.

437
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,450
The one thing I want to know?

438
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,220
Will you really? Do you promise?

439
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,750
Yes. I promise.

440
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,590
Will you really find out
who my birth mom is?

441
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,990
Yes.

442
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,610
I see why Se Ri is such a mess.

443
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,510
She doesn't know who her mom is.

444
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,280
Is it you, Manager Gong?

445
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,260
Other than us kids,
you're with the chairman the most.

446
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,260
Isn't it a likely scenario?

447
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,000
What weird hypothesis is this?

448
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,960
Is it a conspiracy theory?

449
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,400
You said before...

450
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,300
that Se Ri looked a lot like Manager Gong.

451
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,310
Why won't you respond?

452
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,910
Because it's not worth it.

453
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,220
When will she ever open up?

454
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,230
Manager Gong is really tough.

455
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,300
She didn't bat an eyelid...

456
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,870
when she was insulted to her face.

457
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,170
(Mingang Distribution)

458
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,160
Are you Chairman Min Doo Sik?

459
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,890
Who are you?

460
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,640
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

461
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,380
Please reveal the truth.

462
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,980
Trust me and go home.

463
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,520
I'll take care of it.

464
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,650
I won't be bad-mouthed online
if the truth comes out.

465
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,650
No one will blame me when I'm the victim.

466
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,660
People with nothing
lose control when they get angry.

467
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,020
Don't you get that yet?

468
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,890
What I did to get this far?

469
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,930
I don't like people who make secrets.

470
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,660
Secrets are never pleasant.

471
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,800
It's either fishy stuff
or a weakness that must be hidden.

472
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,340
You must steel your mind
if you want to be Kyung Chae's man.

473
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,570
Whatever it is you imagine,
she'll dish up something worse.
