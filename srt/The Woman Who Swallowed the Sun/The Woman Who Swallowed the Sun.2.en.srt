00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,040
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,410
Oh, no.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,750
What's going on? Not again, Cutie.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,790
Don't do this, Cutie.

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,360
Stop!

6
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,150
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,220
Oh, no. Goodness.

8
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Oh, dear.

9
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,890
Are you all right?

10
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,060
Yes.

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,460
Are you... Where did he go?

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,760
Hey, are you okay? I should...

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,470
Hey.

14
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,170
Let's see your license.

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,240
Shall I call for an ambulance?

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,340
Forget that.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,610
Don't you know you need a license
and safety training to ride a scooter?

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,780
What if you broke a bone or something?

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,750
Your head. Is your head okay?

20
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,510
I hope you didn't hurt that.

21
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,880
My head is fine.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,550
Don't you dare think scooters...

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,620
are safer than cars or motorcycles.

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,560
It could be extra dangerous
because the top speed is actually slower.

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,490
Slower vehicles need more time
and distance to make a safety maneuver.

26
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,490
Look. Your scooter
isn't even well maintained.

27
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,260
Okay, point taken!

28
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,700
I'll trade in the scooter
or sell it for scrap metal.

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,470
I'll write a letter of apology too
if you want.

30
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,600
Or you can...

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,970
just send me to prison.

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,940
Well, no. I'm fine.

33
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,780
You don't seem fine.

34
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,980
You hit your head so hard
it made a huge sound.

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,580
I know myself well and I'm okay.

36
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,820
How well could you know
if you're not a doctor?

37
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,620
Why don't we call your family first?

38
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,860
Let's at least do that.

39
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,460
I'm the guardian.

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,430
What does that mean?

41
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,700
I'm my own guardian.

42
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
What?

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,600
Well,

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,100
it means I don't have a family to call.

45
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,400
I think I'm fine.

46
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,540
Oh, dear.

47
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,280
Just a moment.

48
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,980
Come somewhere with me.

49
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,580
Where to?

50
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,250
You'll see. Come along.

51
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,490
Hurry up.

52
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,960
- Walk slowly.
- Sorry.

53
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,830
See? Even the doctor said
you should rest well.

54
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,200
Getting admitted over this is a bit much.

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,270
Don't get any ideas
and stay here for just a week.

56
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,210
I'm really glad
you weren't seriously hurt.

57
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,510
But...

58
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,980
why are you doing this
when I said I was fine?

59
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,650
Because I'm not fine with it.

60
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,950
What if I let you go
because you said you were okay,

61
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,890
only for you to stab me in the back...

62
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,430
and sue me for a hit-and-run?

63
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,400
Do you think
that's the kind of person I am?

64
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,830
No, I didn't say that, did I?

65
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,200
Then is this how you show pity?

66
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,710
Because I have no family?

67
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,540
That's even further from it.

68
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,080
I don't care about stuff like that.

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,710
Someone told me it would be fine...

70
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,620
as long as I was blameless.

71
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,520
It's not your fault
that you don't have a family.

72
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,820
If it's not that...

73
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,390
Do you have a good girl complex?

74
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,630
I do look like a good girl,

75
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,030
but I wouldn't say I'm all good and nice.

76
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,570
Lie in bed.

77
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,870
I'll get you some food from home, okay?

78
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,820
Are we behind on deliveries?

79
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,290
No. I called another rider
because you didn't show up.

80
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,750
Oh, my gosh.

81
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,260
I'm done for the day.

82
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,690
It hurts so bad.

83
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,090
Oh, dear. Were you in an accident?

84
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,760
- A small accident.
- You'll be the death of me.

85
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,470
What did I tell you?

86
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,800
I told you to scrap the scooter.

87
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,370
You bought beef bones?

88
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,940
For Mi So?

89
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,580
Yes. For Mi So and some others too.

90
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,510
Oh, no. It must sting.

91
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,050
- Goodness.
- Be gentle.

92
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,420
It stings. Hey, that hurt.

93
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,250
Good for you.

94
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,990
You went to the airport
and still lost him?

95
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,220
You two couldn't find just one man?

96
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,990
I confirmed he entered the country,
so I could track him down.

97
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,090
Forget about him.

98
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,230
Will the business fail without him?

99
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,430
We have skills and know-how,
so we can manage without him.

100
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,300
But we're experts on the domestic market.

101
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,940
"We can't stick to serving one country."

102
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,140
"We must serve the world to survive."

103
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,510
That's what you said.

104
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,180
Every single distribution company
copied New Buy's US model.

105
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,980
They're a global company
with a well-established online platform.

106
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,050
Moon handled their sales,
PR, and marketing.

107
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,150
I know how competent he is.

108
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,160
That's why we offered a fortune
to scout him.

109
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,090
But how dare he play hard to get?

110
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,630
He kept his Korean name
and still made it big...

111
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,960
in an industry
run predominantly by white men.

112
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,900
That's how strongly he feels
about his identity.

113
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,870
He must have a plan.

114
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,200
He just doesn't have what he wants
to set it in motion.

115
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,500
Are you sure about that?

116
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,670
Yes.

117
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,380
So, what will you do now?

118
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,980
Don't worry. I'm your daughter.

119
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,450
I won't lose him.

120
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,120
Not bad.

121
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,020
You got better
at talking yourself out of trouble.

122
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,330
You put Father at ease by acting like
the man is in the palm of your hand...

123
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,200
when you have no clue where he is.

124
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,100
You should pick up that skill at least.

125
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,800
You have nothing else.

126
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,180
I'll search hotels
starting with ones closer to the airport.

127
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,420
He'd have taken a taxi...

128
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,590
and asked the driver where he should stay.

129
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,020
Taxi drivers recommend certain hotels.

130
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,530
I'll check them,
then all the major ones in Seoul...

131
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,060
How do you think Soo Jung knew?

132
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,600
Who told her to be at the airport?

133
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,300
She must have a source too.

134
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,100
Sure. She must have sources of her own.

135
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,670
I'll do whatever it takes...

136
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,610
to get the hotels' client lists
and find Moon Tae Kyung.

137
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,710
You do that.

138
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,810
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

139
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,650
I'll be on the rooftop.

140
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,490
Lawyer Kim.
Do you have anything to say to me?

141
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,530
I wondered if you did.

142
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,460
I don't.

143
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,210
Did I tell you that you earned my respect?

144
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,780
Lawyer Kim, you have many talents.

145
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,050
Even the National Intelligence Service
would envy your skills.

146
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,050
Pretty soon, you'll have a guest list...

147
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,350
from every major hotel, right?

148
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,650
What if I do?

149
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,290
Share it with me too.

150
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,790
You want me to be a double agent?

151
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,860
You did it once. You can do it twice.

152
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,730
I'd like to think we got a bit closer.

153
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,510
I'm envious of you, Mi So.

154
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,350
No one cares what you do in class,

155
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,680
and you earn money too.

156
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,950
I told you I'm working to save up
to get my mom a birthday present.

157
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,790
Your mom must be proud
to have a daughter like you.

158
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,390
You should be mine in our next lifetime.

159
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,130
No, thank you.

160
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,700
If I'm born again,

161
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,470
I want to be my mom's mom.

162
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,670
So I can love her as much as she loved me.

163
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,040
Sir. Can you hire me too during my break?

164
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,710
Not you, Bo Ram.

165
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,140
You'll break all the cups.

166
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,810
You hate just me.

167
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,250
You favor Mi So.

168
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,050
That's because Mi So is sweet, polite,

169
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,480
and gets things done so fast.

170
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,520
She's not just a smart student.

171
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,320
She's a smart worker too.

172
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,890
You like her too much.

173
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,860
- Don't you have another lesson?
- Darn you.

174
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,700
Oh, shoot.

175
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,930
Sorry.

176
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,970
When did you get here?

177
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,640
Why are you doing this?
Leave it to the staff.

178
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,340
Who cares if I do?

179
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,110
Go to the head office when you're free
and earn brownie points.

180
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,980
With whom? My father?

181
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,980
As if that would work.

182
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,850
There's no place for me
in the head office.

183
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,160
Make up whatever excuse to drop by.

184
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,360
You'll never end up there
if you wait to be summoned.

185
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,390
Tricks like that don't work on my father.

186
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,260
Then what? Will you work at this store
for the rest of your life?

187
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,900
Your younger sisters are flying high.

188
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,970
Can't you at least run to keep up?

189
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,540
I have a plan of my own, so quit nagging.

190
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,470
That's your problem.
You think and do nothing!

191
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,610
Money's rolling in, rolling in like crazy.

192
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,780
It's rolling in endlessly
from all directions.

193
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,450
I'm attracting cash like a magnet.

194
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm absorbing cash like a black hole.

195
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Anything and everything in the world
that looks like cash...

196
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,960
is rolling into my lap.

197
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,090
Cash... Money...

198
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,330
Cash, money.

199
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,800
Dad.

200
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,760
Hello, welcome.

201
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,630
So what is Ji Seop up to?

202
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,370
He's all shriveled up.

203
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,170
I saw him at the store
working like a bottom-rung employee.

204
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,610
What if his sisters swallow the company...

205
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,680
and he's left with nothing at all?

206
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,950
I get it if he were
to lose out to Kyung Chae,

207
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,580
but he can't lose out to Soo Jung too.

208
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,750
Soo Jung's birth mother
worked at a sleazy bar in Gangnam, right?

209
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,790
Yes. She was a legend in her day.

210
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,120
She targeted and seduced the chairman,

211
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,690
got pregnant, confirmed the paternity,
and got Soo Jung legally adopted.

212
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,860
If you think about it,
your father-in-law has a weird streak.

213
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,660
His youngest daughter's illegitimate too.

214
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,000
That's not just one but two.

215
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,040
Tell Ji Seop to act crazy for once
and challenge his father.

216
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,410
Who knows? It might jolt him awake.

217
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,540
That idea would make a centipede
trip up and roll down a hill.

218
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,010
Why should he challenge the chairman?
He'll only get crushed.

219
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,110
It looks like I should pay him a visit.

220
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,550
As if he'd fear you.

221
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,920
He should fear my money, not me.

222
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,650
Don't you know how much...

223
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,360
I lent him interest-free
when he was in a bind?

224
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,660
You said it was a hairline fracture.

225
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,260
You must eat well
after any kind of accident to recover.

226
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,930
A week's stay will cost a lot
even at a small clinic.

227
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,900
It can't be helped.

228
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,040
I was afraid he might
hold me responsible later on.

229
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,340
I know you better than that.

230
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,980
You wanted to look after him
because he had no family.

231
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,220
You break out in hives
if you don't help those in need, right?

232
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,050
That's right. So what?

233
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,920
I guess that's why
you treated me like a real sister.

234
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,590
I don't know what would've happened to me
if it hadn't been for you.

235
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,360
You'd be doing just fine somewhere else.

236
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,200
"Just fine?" I doubt that.

237
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,500
If I hadn't met you when I felt lost
after leaving the orphanage...

238
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,770
You saved my life.

239
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,740
Don't be silly.

240
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,440
- Call if you need help cooking.
- Okay.

241
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,410
You're the kindest person there is.

242
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,450
You're just too kind.

243
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,790
You're going to just stare at it?

244
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,560
So...

245
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,390
You want me to drink this?

246
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,960
It cooled just enough,
so down it in one go.

247
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,100
I'm not a fan of anything
made with bones or offal.

248
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,070
You don't drink this for taste.

249
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,600
You drink it
because it's a medicine of sorts.

250
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,770
That's it. I'd rather take medicine.

251
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,410
Aftereffects can be worse
than the actual accident.

252
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,410
You might feel fine now, but in time,

253
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,510
you might ache all over and feel...

254
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,520
Wait.

255
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,250
I'll be careful
to avoid aftereffects... No.

256
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,020
If I do suffer any aftereffects,

257
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,090
I won't blame you. Will that do?

258
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,960
You have way too many excuses.

259
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,260
- Shall I feed it to you?
- No, thanks.

260
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,860
I'll drink it myself.

261
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,030
Go ahead.

262
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,970
Drink it all up.
Don't leave a single drop.

263
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,040
I stood by the pot for hours to cook this.

264
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,650
- All of it?
- All of it.

265
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,360
Happy now?

266
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,130
It's nice to be in the sun,
and the fresh air will do you good too.

267
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,500
I do that.

268
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,930
Exercise as well.

269
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,130
I exercise every day.

270
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,030
I know what to do. I'm not a kid.

271
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,140
Men are like kids
even if they turn 100 years old.

272
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,810
I'm enjoying this break thanks to you.

273
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,110
I'd needed an excuse.

274
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,050
I got straight to work
as soon as I came to Korea.

275
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,620
Did you fly in from another country?

276
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,550
Yes. I'd been away for 25 years.

277
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,290
For 25 years?

278
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,520
My word.

279
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,690
Korea has changed a lot, hasn't it?

280
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,660
It has changed a lot
now that I think about it.

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,140
I was busy looking for someone
as soon as I landed.

282
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,940
Who are you looking for?

283
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,540
Why? Will you look for me?

284
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,440
You don't even know my story.

285
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,080
It must be someone important
if you flew in...

286
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,610
after 25 years to look for them.

287
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,110
Someone you must find.

288
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,490
We all have a few secrets hidden away...

289
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,950
that we don't tell anyone.

290
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,290
But there are also things
that should never be buried.

291
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,960
"There are things
that shouldn't be buried?"

292
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,940
You're the first person to say that to me.

293
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,670
Everyone else told me to forget.

294
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,810
It is easiest to forget if you can.

295
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,610
But some things are worth remembering.

296
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,780
You can't tell someone
to forget what they can't.

297
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,390
Hi, Yeon Ah.

298
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,130
Okay, I'll be right there.

299
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,560
I have to go. I'll be back.

300
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,730
Wait.

301
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,900
You seem to be busy.
You don't have to come back.

302
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,600
I should. I can't leave you here alone.

303
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,170
You'll be lonely in your hospital room.

304
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,310
- See you.
- Bye.

305
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,580
Stay outside for just ten more minutes.

306
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,680
Okay.

307
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,640
I'm so nervous.

308
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,340
Isn't it nice to adjust your plans
so we can eat together?

309
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,010
Battles are for the battlefield.

310
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,380
A house should feel like a home.

311
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,780
Eat together and make eye contact.

312
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,890
That's family.

313
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,420
That's right, Father.

314
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,320
I respect you for the great vision
you have for your family.

315
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,230
- Right?
- What?

316
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,160
That's right. My father
puts family before anything else.

317
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,100
Stay away from meat, sir.

318
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,970
Don't serve something
I'm not allowed to touch.

319
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,740
You'll consume too many calories.

320
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,780
Eat this instead.

321
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,880
Laying out a feast only to say...

322
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,680
you can't eat this or that...

323
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,590
is torture, you know that?

324
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,590
You torture me whenever I eat at home.

325
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,390
It's all for your own good, sir.

326
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,890
I'm your employer. I pay you.

327
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,960
Exactly.

328
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,430
I want to work for you
for as long as possible.

329
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,270
So I need you to be healthy.

330
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,670
Our household is like a train
that goes backward.

331
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,800
You're above me, Manager Gong.

332
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,510
But then, you're the only one
who looks out for me.

333
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,610
What use is having kids...

334
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,350
when you're only an ATM to them?

335
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,320
Goodness.

336
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,350
Eat all you can, Mi So.

337
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,890
Studying is hard work.

338
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,290
I don't like this.

339
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,500
How come? Beef bone soup is good for you.

340
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,670
You have it, then.

341
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm not the student here.

342
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,110
You studied hard to get into high school.

343
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,710
It wasn't too hard. I chose to study.

344
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,320
Shall we save it for Auntie, then?

345
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,690
There's a lot left for her.

346
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,090
I'll heat it up later.

347
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,490
This is all I can do for you.

348
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,230
Your friends' moms
must do other stuff on top of this.

349
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,130
Don't say that. You did everything.

350
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,970
I didn't and don't lack a thing.

351
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,880
I feel like a tiger.

352
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,680
My sweet darling.

353
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,690
Have some more.

354
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,390
Eat lots and stay strong.

355
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,660
Do you feel tired?

356
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,800
A little bit.

357
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,330
Let me see.

358
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,740
Your shoulders are so stiff.

359
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,110
Your health comes first.

360
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,440
Don't overdo it.

361
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,810
The company needs you
to be strong and well.

362
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,580
I hear the sound...

363
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,750
of someone brown-nosing.

364
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,460
"I'm here to serve you."

365
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,090
Did you want me to hear that?

366
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,760
- Did you think so?
- Watch what you say.

367
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,230
You have no right
to talk to Manager Gong like that.

368
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,470
It was just a figure of speech.
Don't take it too seriously.

369
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,370
Don't we see each other enough at work?

370
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,740
We don't have to
drink tea at home together too.

371
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,540
Didn't you hear what our father said?

372
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,540
"Fight on the battlefield.
At home, we heal."

373
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,980
"Family should be close."

374
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,620
Okay, fine. I'll go to my room.

375
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,520
Manager Gong.

376
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,990
It's fine to show how loyal you are,

377
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,360
but isn't it weird to say
"your shoulders are stiff?"

378
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,070
Next time, try saying,
"Madam, your shoulders are stiff."

379
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,310
Don't mind her.

380
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,710
She's incapable of respecting others.

381
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,680
It's better for your mental health
to ignore her.

382
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,600
It's so frosty outside.
They're just the same.

383
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,330
Are your sisters like that at work too?

384
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,670
What are you on about?

385
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,330
Whose side are you on?

386
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,440
You're on Kyung Chae's side, right?

387
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,970
She's your full sister.

388
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,810
We're not fighting. There are no sides.

389
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,450
I quit watching horror movies
since I married you.

390
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,310
I have no use for them...

391
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,280
because life itself is so chilling.

392
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,650
Look at you.

393
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,620
You're so cute.

394
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,320
(Dabitnuri Hospital)

395
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,860
I asked you last time about Jo Pil Doo...

396
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,390
Yes, that's right.

397
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,570
Yes, I know it's best to forget.

398
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,440
But I can't do that.

399
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,240
I can't forget. It's impossible.

400
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,280
Could you ignore your parents' death,
Detective?

401
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,510
I came back after 25 years.

402
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,880
So that I can do a son's duty,

403
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,020
please help me out.

404
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,890
Thank you very much. Keep me in the loop.

405
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,990
Yes, sure. Bye.

406
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,800
Didn't you say
you'd search every hotel to find him?

407
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,670
I'm looking for him and I will find him.

408
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,110
When? After Soo Jung finds him?

409
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,670
That will never happen.

410
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,180
You used to be a prosecutor.

411
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,650
I heard lots of law firms
tried to scout you when you quit.

412
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,620
You must have had a purpose
when you turned them down to join us.

413
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,790
I won't ask what it is.

414
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,620
But whatever it is,
you'll have to do much better.

415
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,130
Can you get what you want this way?

416
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,060
Don't worry. It won't take long to...

417
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,300
Why would I worry?
Shouldn't you be the one to worry?

418
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,870
There are lots of people like you.

419
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,540
If you don't prove
you're better than them, at any time...

420
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,610
Soo Jung must've told you...

421
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,710
what I'm like.

422
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,330
What's going on?

423
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,260
Why haven't you found him yet?

424
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,630
Why do you think I pay you?

425
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,100
Drag this on any longer
and you'll pay too.

426
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,800
I used to be a prosecutor.

427
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,370
Why would I worry? You should worry.

428
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,910
There are lots of people like you.

429
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,580
Remember that.

430
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,490
I never missed out on my goal. Not once.

431
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,690
I'm so darn bored.

432
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,430
This place is just as boring as the US.

433
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,970
Where should I go to have fun?

434
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,170
Should I fly into space?

435
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,280
This is the kind of person
I'd like you to be.

436
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,980
I'd like you to be loyal,
and fight when you see an injustice.

437
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,490
Getting good grades
and going to a good university?

438
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,050
That's great too.

439
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,760
But ignoring others who need help...

440
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,690
so you can do better?

441
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,790
I wouldn't like that.

442
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,500
Are you off to study?

443
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes.

444
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,470
Take care.

445
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,840
- See you later.
- Bye.

446
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,340
Mi So.

447
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,570
Just a moment.

448
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,210
I love you. You love me. Only you.

449
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,350
Me too.

450
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,780
I love you. You love me. Only you.

451
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,790
- See you.
- Goodbye.

452
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,200
- Did you find him?
- I did find someone.

453
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Which hotel is it?

454
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,170
There's a slight problem.

455
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,610
I found someone else, not Moon Tae Kyung.

456
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,510
Someone else? Who?

457
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,910
The chairman's youngest daughter.

458
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,010
Who?

459
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,920
I have bad news.

460
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,350
Ms. Se Ri is in Korea.

461
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,860
What are you talking about?
She should be in the US.

462
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,030
She was involved in an assault
and got expelled.

463
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,890
I think she flew in secretly.

464
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,830
What?

465
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,200
Her tutor didn't know about it either.

466
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,970
She stowed away.

467
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,870
So where is she now?

468
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,040
Darn it! Who is it?

469
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,630
Kyung Chae.

470
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,970
You got into trouble again in the US.

471
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,400
They got racist on me
and I couldn't stand it.

472
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,840
How much longer...

473
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,040
How much more must I put up with you?

474
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,680
Did I ask you for something huge?

475
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,410
I just asked you to lie low
and stay out of trouble.

476
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,050
You couldn't even do that?

477
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,220
You just got deported from Canada.

478
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,120
I'm not proud of what I did,

479
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,790
but we met after a long while.
Shouldn't the first thing you say be...

480
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,090
"how are you, I missed you?"

481
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,830
You don't deserve such a greeting.

482
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,460
I'm struggling too, okay?

483
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,600
You're struggling?

484
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,870
How exactly?

485
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,800
Is it a struggle to spend money?

486
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,570
How about causing trouble?

487
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,780
Don't say that.

488
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,280
I've never seen Mom in my lifetime.

489
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,920
Soo Jung at least knows who her mom is.

490
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,550
I don't even know what Mom looks like.

491
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,890
All I know is that Dad
had me out of wedlock.

492
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,990
- Who my mom is...
- You and your darn mom!

493
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,630
Aren't you a bit too old to cry for Mom?

494
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,230
You don't know anything.

495
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,430
Do you know how lonely that makes me feel?

496
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,170
Do you call that an excuse?

497
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,230
You cause trouble because you're lonely?

498
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,370
Pack up and fly back.

499
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,710
Sort your life out over there!

500
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,190
Here we go.

501
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,600
How dare you talk down to someone
twice your age?

502
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,670
You rude brat.

503
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,770
I said I'd pay you, didn't I?

504
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,800
Hey! Mister!

505
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,940
Darn you!

506
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,130
Hey. Take my order.

507
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,270
What?

508
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,170
I don't work here. My friend...

509
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,310
The part-timer went to pick up a cake.

510
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,580
- If you wait...
- This place blows.

511
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,310
You can't treat a customer like this.

512
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,350
- But...
- Take my order.

513
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,020
Didn't you hear me?

514
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,220
You can't do that.

515
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm crazy angry already.

516
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,870
What are you staring at?

517
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,640
Do you want to get beaten up?

518
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,410
What are you doing?

519
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,140
Mi So...

520
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,810
Apologize right now.

521
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,850
Darn it.

522
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,620
You can't talk to me like that.

523
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,750
Whoever you are,

524
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,120
you're the one in the wrong, so apologize.

525
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,420
What a joke.

526
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,820
You're just a part-timer
at a tiny coffee shop.

527
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,060
Stop right where you are.

528
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,570
My Madam Baek told me to fight injustice.

529
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
"Madam Baek?"

530
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,870
Who's that?

531
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,740
Do you want to know?

532
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,350
It's the person I like and respect
the most in the whole world.

533
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,750
My mom told me
not to put up with people like you!

534
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,700
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

535
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,680
Darn it. Wait and see.

536
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,080
I won't let you get away with this.

537
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,150
She's a psycho.

538
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,690
Let's sue her.

539
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,290
Is this your mom's birthday present?

540
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,420
Yes. Tomorrow is her birthday.

541
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,320
You do anything for money, right?

542
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,330
What on earth is Ms. Se Ri to you?

543
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,200
You crossed the line.

544
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,770
To a mom,
a child means more than her life.

545
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,770
What?

546
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,330
You can't escape this place.

547
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,940
If you run, you'll get brought back.

548
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,310
If you run again,
you'll get brought back again.
