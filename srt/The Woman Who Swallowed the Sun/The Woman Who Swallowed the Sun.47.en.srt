1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,640
It doesn't suit you at all.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,950
You must wear what suits you,
and that goes for dates too.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,250
I suit you better.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,350
Like that dress.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,520
You are...

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,990
my girlfriend now.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,860
Tell me.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,330
As a man, how do you feel about Lucia?

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,740
I have a crush on her.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,910
I like her a great deal.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,850
She doesn't know how I feel yet.

12
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,850
You barely know anything about her.

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,820
You don't need to know everything
to like someone.

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,190
Goodbye, then.

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,270
This is bad.

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,440
What do we do
if Moon Tae Kyung gets involved too?

17
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,880
- I'm back.
- Hi.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,580
What's that?

19
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,420
A dress Chairman Min got me
as a thank-you.

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,490
I wasn't sure.

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,330
Was it actually he who snatched you up?

22
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,230
Min Soo Jung had set it up.

23
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,970
She must really want you
to be her stepmom.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
It's for the better.

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,540
It's easier to work
if we have another person in our corner.

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,810
Min Ji Seop brought you a fake contract?

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,640
He's so transparent.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,680
He did exactly what we expected him to.

29
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,510
The problem is
what Min Kyung Chae is up to.

30
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,180
Yes. How do we find out what that is?

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,420
Could Min Soo Jung know?

32
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,320
She's smart and calculative.

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,490
See if you can find out.

34
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,490
Okay.

35
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,930
What do we do?
The Helena Louise deal is taking up...

36
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,870
so much of our time
that I can't do anything else.

37
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,170
I know. We can't decide
whether to take more pre-orders or not...

38
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,440
until we know how big the shipment is.

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,610
Now that the deal is signed,
shouldn't we stock up...

40
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,480
and schedule the deliveries?

41
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,250
Vice Director Min is working on that,
so let's see how things go.

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,690
I think we should check the products
that were delivered to storage.

43
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,150
What for?

44
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,890
Vice Director Min's contract
is likely a forgery,

45
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,200
and the products he secured
are also likely knock-offs.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,060
CEO Min and Lawyer Kim
said nothing of the sort.

47
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,100
I have no material proof,
but that's what I think.

48
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,740
It makes no sense.

49
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,810
You're the one who wanted
to give the troublemaker a job.

50
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,110
Why are you complaining about it now?

51
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,810
I'll explain my reasoning later.

52
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,610
First, we must prevent
stocking up on fake...

53
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,620
No. Explain it now if you want to.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,150
If you can't do it now,
never bring it up again.

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,420
I trust CEO Min and Lawyer Kim
more than I trust you.

56
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,300
If neither of them brought the issue
to me, there's no problem.

57
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,900
You can leave.

58
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,140
I had dinner...

59
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,540
with Lucia a few days ago.
I wonder if she liked the food.

60
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,780
It took me a while to thank her
for saving my life and my daughter's.

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,720
We have a connection,
she's easy to talk to,

62
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,650
and she's immensely considerate.

63
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,990
The scarf she was wearing
didn't suit her at all.

64
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,160
So I threw it away.

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,030
Something else suits her better.

66
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,840
You're saying...

67
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,810
Ji Seop brought you a fake contract?

68
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,480
The problem is CEO Min,
who knows that but won't do anything.

69
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,180
There's no going back
if you're caught selling knock-offs,

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,280
and that means your team will scatter.

71
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,990
If she's prepared to fire
the director she hired herself,

72
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,820
she stands to gain something bigger.

73
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,130
That's a reasonable thought.

74
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,590
Can you look into it for me?

75
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,630
We need to know so we can be prepared.

76
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,870
I don't mind looking into it,

77
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,240
but that means
we actually get into the same boat.

78
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,770
Are you sure you can keep
your side of the deal?

79
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,610
The dress I'm wearing...

80
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,880
was Chairman Min's gift.

81
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,480
Does that answer your question?

82
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,450
Okay. I'll see what I can find out.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,870
The scarf she was wearing
didn't suit her at all.

84
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,040
So I threw it away.

85
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,110
Something else suits her better.

86
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,650
What's the matter?

87
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,490
No, it's nothing at all.

88
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
Why did you ask to see me?

89
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,240
Do you still want to date Kyung Chae?

90
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,410
Can't I?

91
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,710
I never said that.

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,550
I like how openly ambitious you are.

93
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,580
Moon Tae Kyung is the sly one.

94
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,290
That's surprising. I didn't know
that was how you felt about him.

95
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,860
I don't care
whether Moon Tae Kyung stays or goes,

96
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,660
but I do believe he should be
held responsible for what he did.

97
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
If the board is summoned to vote on...

98
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,600
what to do with Director Moon,

99
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,340
I'll be willing to vote in your favor.

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,810
Does that mean you'll vote
to get rid of Moon Tae Kyung?

101
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,840
That's possible.

102
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,010
There must be a catch.

103
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,320
Why is Kyung Chae ignoring the fact
that Ji Seop's contract is a fake?

104
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,290
Tell me the truth.

105
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,120
What did you have for dinner?

106
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,860
I'm like a robot.

107
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,390
I eat whatever the housekeeper prepares.

108
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,630
You can't say that.
There must be foods that you prefer.

109
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,800
My family stopped caring about
my preference a long time ago.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,470
That's sad.
It's upsetting to hear things like that.

111
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,540
It sounds like
you can't do anything you want...

112
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,980
when you have a strong,
unique personality.

113
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,150
It's upsetting?

114
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,550
Yes.

115
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm sure your housekeeper
knows what to do, but I care.

116
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,690
That means you think of me.

117
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,320
Did you think I didn't?

118
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,690
What kind of food do you like?

119
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,800
I'm not that picky.

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,460
Why? Will you cook me something?

121
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
I've wanted to for a long time.

122
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,940
Why would you even bother?

123
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,870
You just have to sit quietly
at the table like a pretty flower and eat.

124
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,250
What does that mean?

125
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,880
Come over one day.

126
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,180
To your place?

127
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
Yes. Come and visit.

128
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,230
I'm inviting you.

129
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,430
I'll send a car this weekend.

130
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,930
Okay, bye.

131
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,600
Did you invite someone, sir?

132
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,470
It's this weekend, so be prepared.

133
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,740
May I ask who it is?

134
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,080
You'll see when I introduce you.

135
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,580
You'll meet often from now on,
so pay extra attention.

136
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,950
I came to give you a report.

137
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,620
We checked the products
and stored them in our warehouse.

138
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,460
Good. Did your CEO sister
say anything about the contract?

139
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,730
No, she didn't.

140
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,900
See? Kyung Chae acts like she's smart,

141
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,630
but she isn't actually.

142
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,240
Then there's no problem.

143
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,770
Who would complain
if the CEO is okay with it?

144
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,570
That's right.

145
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,410
Is your tenant in today?

146
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,280
He came home a while ago.

147
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,350
How about I introduce myself?

148
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,520
He lives with you,
so I need to know what he's like...

149
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,020
if we're to relax.

150
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,390
Do you think so? Say hello, then.

151
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,460
Hey, you.

152
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,330
If you're not too busy,
come and meet my son-in-law.

153
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,940
Your son-in-law is here?

154
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
Yes.

155
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,870
Here's a heads-up. Don't feel intimidated.

156
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,010
He works at Mingang Distribution.

157
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,240
At Mingang Distribution?

158
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,810
You're surprised? You would be.

159
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,980
He's the vice director
of the Online Business Team.

160
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,250
I bet he's way better than the director...

161
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,490
and his CEO.

162
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,160
Skip the introduction.

163
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,130
- Why?
- I told him who you were,

164
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,830
and he shrank right away.

165
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,800
I said,
"He works at Mingang Distribution,"

166
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,610
and he said, "Oh, really?
I work at a tiny company."

167
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,310
Leave him alone, then.

168
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,010
He would feel intimidated.

169
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,380
How shabby is his job
that he's too scared to even say hi?

170
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,320
(Mingang Distribution)

171
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,150
I asked Lawyer Kim.

172
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,220
My father implemented
a special company rule.

173
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,190
If a member of the owner's family...

174
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,660
harms the business, they must cough up
their stake in the company.

175
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,430
If this fake contract
were to threaten the business...

176
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,700
Ji Seop would lose his shares.

177
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,470
And Kyung Chae will gobble them up.

178
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,870
That's why she's ignoring
the obvious threat.

179
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,310
There's nothing we can do
if Ji Seop's shares go to Kyung Chae.

180
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,920
Right now, we can fend her off
if we stick together,

181
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,420
but in the future...

182
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,490
She's after the shares.

183
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,790
CEO Min cares more about increasing
her stake than the company...

184
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,390
because that's how
she'll cement her position as successor.

185
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,160
She's helpless.

186
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,200
I know she wants to succeed her father,

187
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,070
but at the expense of ruining her brother?

188
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,800
What should we do?

189
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,210
I'll take it from here.

190
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,110
You just do as I say.

191
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,350
Hello, it's Stella Jang.

192
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,420
Yes. Long time no see.

193
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,720
Seoul life kept me so busy,
I didn't have the time to call.

194
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,990
I'm so sorry.

195
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,690
I need to ask you a favor.

196
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,430
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

197
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,840
Hello, Min Doo Sik speaking.

198
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,970
To what do I owe the call,
Chairman Myeong?

199
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,180
I hope you're well.

200
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,250
I don't think this is the time
to be nice to each other.

201
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,880
Did you see the news online?

202
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,150
Why? Is something the matter again?

203
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,950
It looks like your company scored big.

204
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,360
There are newsflashes everywhere.

205
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,790

208
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,870
Hey.

209
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,780
What's this?

210
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,580
Director, you need to check the portals.

211
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,880
Why? Is something wrong?

212
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,920
There's a newsflash.

213
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,520
It says our Helena Louise
sales promotion is fraudulent.

214
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,860
They confirmed it with the US office.

215
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,860
My gosh. You're right.

216
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,200
The comments...

217
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,300
It's getting crazy.

218
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,530
People are flocking to our site...

219
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,540
asking about the pre-orders.

220
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,840
What do we do?
We should confirm the facts...

221
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,180
and either explain or apologize fast.

222
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,390
Where are you going?

223
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Did you read the news?

224
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,220
What news?

225
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,690
Darn it.

226
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,060
What's going on?
What was the newsflash about?

227
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,290
What's this
about our fraudulent promotion?

228
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,400
We haven't been able to confirm it yet.

229
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,700
You should ask the vice director.

230
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,070
Did you know about this?

231
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,200
How could I know?

232
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,770
We got the products.

233
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,470
We can send out the pre-ordered...

234
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,550
Why are you here, Father?

235
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,820
I won't ask twice.
Answer honestly the first time.

236
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,520
The contract you showed me.
Was that a fake?

237
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,920
And the products too?

238
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,060
Well... I didn't mean to...

239
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,690
What happened was...

240
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,200
You fool.

241
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,140
Calm down, Fath... Chairman.

242
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll explain everything.

243
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,450
Why didn't you do your job as director
and let this incompetent fool act out?

244
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,580
You should've put a stop to it!

245
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,650
I told you what I thought.

246
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,250
You were the one who ignored my concerns.

247
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,590
That was...

248
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,790
What now, CEO Min?

249
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,430
How did you allow this to happen?

250
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,900
You should've reported to me sooner!

251
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,630
I'll explain the situation in your office.

252
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,470
Darn it all.

253
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Goodness.

254
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,590
Tell me what happened.

255
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,120
I think Ji Seop went too far because...

256
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,460
he couldn't handle the pressure
of planning a promotion.

257
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,460
You didn't know about this either?

258
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,430
He managed to dupe you too?

259
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,730
Would I have allowed this if I'd known?

260
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,010
Vice Director Min says...

261
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,210
CEO Min didn't take
the necessary precautions...

262
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,710
to confirm the contract's authenticity.

263
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,920
Is this how you shift the blame onto me?

264
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,090
I told you not to give
the task to him in the first place.

265
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,460
Why didn't you check
the contract's authenticity?

266
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,460
Because I didn't have to.

267
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,400
This is a letter of indemnity he signed.

268
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,260
He vouched for the contract.

269
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,030
Hey. You told me to sign it.

270
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,970
That you'd let me keep my job
even if the team got broken up.

271
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,370
You can't make things up
because you're cornered, Ji Seop.

272
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,680
I want to disband the team I put together?

273
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,740
You useless moron.

274
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,080
We didn't circulate the fake products,
so we avoided the worst.

275
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,320
We'll issue an apology
and fully refund the pre-orders...

276
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,820
That's like putting a Band-Aid
on a gaping wound!

277
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,290
It's what incompetent fools do.

278
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,930
Pack your things.

279
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,300
You're fired.

280
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,130
Father.

281
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,670
Don't call me that!

282
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,700
Don't think of going anywhere else
and go straight home.

283
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,640
Scrap the Online Business Team.

284
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,940
Why keep a team that does no good
and always causes problems?

285
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,020
Director.

286
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,890
How did it go?

287
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,290
Our team might get broken up.

288
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,930
What happens to you, then?

289
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,660
My time at Mingang is over.

290
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,930
I didn't come here to leave like this.

291
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,300
(Mingang Distribution)

292
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,750
What will you do now?
Everyone is calling us a fraud.

293
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,790
We didn't circulate the fake products,

294
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,450
but to them, we as good as did.

295
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,260
It can't be helped.

296
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,060
What happened has happened,
and we must do damage control.

297
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,730
Yes, sir.

298
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,400
And Director Moon must be penalized.

299
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,670
Who is it?

300
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,810
Hello, Chairman Min.

301
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,410
Why are you here, Madam?

302
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,940
It's been a while, Ms. Min.

303
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,280
What are you doing?
How dare you come here?

304
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,850
I heard about
the so-called Helena Louise fraud...

305
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,450
you got embroiled in
and came to offer my condolences.

306
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,890
Is something wrong with that?

307
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,720
I don't know how you know CEO Min,

308
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,020
but we've never met,
so you're way out of line.

309
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,530
It hurts to hear that...

310
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,490
when I came to give you some advice.

311
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,860
I called my contacts in the US,

312
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,000
and Helena Louise's team
is preparing to sue.

313
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,870
You know that the US laws are unlike ours.

314
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,600
They can sue for punitive damages as well.

315
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,840
What?

316
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,180
It looks like whoever came up...

317
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,450
with this idea didn't think it through.

318
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,210
Lawyer Kim, go and look into it.

319
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,590
The person who brings
the real exclusive contract...

320
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,130
would save you and Mingang both.

321
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,500
Does that make them your savior?

322
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,670
I'm in no mood to talk. Please leave.

323
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,600
Get her out of here.

324
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
We're leaving.

325
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,280
This is why I'm here.

326
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,740
It's the real contract.

327
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,890
How do you have this?

328
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,190
I'm Stella Jang.
I'm pretty good at what I do.

329
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,530
You must have something in mind
if you brought this to me.

330
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,500
Of course there's a condition.

331
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,830
Make me a non-executive director.

332
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,770
That's not too hard to do.

333
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,180
I must say, though,
someone else made the deal possible.

334
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,720
She's the one
who got that contract signed.

335
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,100
I'll take it from here.

336
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,630
Are you sure?

337
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,330
We're acquaintances,
and she asked me to get the deal,

338
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,000
but it wasn't easy.

339
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,570
Lucia pleaded with me
for Mingang's sake...

340
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,880
Madam.

341
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,510
Okay, fine.

342
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,480
You're too humble for your own good.

343
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,750
I'll see you again soon. Goodbye.

344
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,510
How did you think to get the deal?

345
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,540
I did it to save myself.

346
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,650
If I didn't, Ms. Min's plan would work,
my team would get broken up,

347
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,810
and I would lose my job here.

348
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,150
This was my plan? Why would you say that?

349
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,890
Why would I ignore the fact
if I knew the contract was fake?

350
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,660
What about not taking active measures
when you expected it to be fake?

351
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,460
Are you saying
I chose to ignore all this...

352
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
when I knew it would harm the company?

353
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,130
Did you really know and still ignore it?

354
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,540
Of course not. Why would I?

355
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,010
Did you really believe
the vice director could get the deal?

356
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,910
Isn't that an even bigger problem?

357
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,210
You're a dreadful judge of character.

358
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,710
That was because...

359
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,480
Ji Seop asked me for an opportunity.

360
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
We'll discuss that later. Leave for now.

361
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,050
I need to talk to Lucia.

362
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,290
- I'll stay and listen.
- Do as you're told and leave.

363
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,490
Father!

364
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,690
Get out!

365
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,410
There's no way this contract
will do us any good.

366
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,410
We'll do all the work...

367
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,750
while someone else will reap the benefits.

368
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,990
The pre-order promotion
could get you sued for fraud.

369
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,260
That's for Lawyer Kim to find out.

370
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,190
I don't fear the court's ruling.
I fear the public sentiment.

371
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,430
We can't buy our customers' trust.

372
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,600
You worked so hard
to make Mingang what it is now.

373
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,710
I don't see why Ms. Min
put the company in such peril.

374
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,050
She wouldn't do that.

375
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,620
There's no way she'd ignore
what would harm Mingang.

376
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,190
It's possible if she stood to gain
something bigger.

377
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,120
What are you talking about?

378
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,900
I'm reluctant to bring this up.

379
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,770
Speak freely. What can't you say to me?

380
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,840
Couldn't it be a plan to gain more shares?

381
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,540
If CEO Min desperately needs
her brother's shares...

382
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,650
Company shares?

383
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,660
My word.

384
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,700
You got the deal signed?

385
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,130
You're pretty awesome.

386
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,670
You keep crossing the line.

387
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,370
I might have to take action.

388
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,880
Why would you say something so upsetting
when I worked so hard to get the deal?

389
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,950
I saved the company
you care so much about.

390
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,450
Shouldn't you bow at my feet?

391
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm saying I could tell everyone
that you're Baek Sul Hee,

392
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,420
even if it means
our shared past comes out.

393
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,660
I'm sure the CEO will accept that much...

394
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,830
for taking out a time bomb like you.

395
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,460
Would the chairman
accept your trashy past?

396
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,030
I don't think the CEO
cares about you enough...

397
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,640
to go for you
at the expense of disobeying her father.

398
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,380
If my past comes out,
I'll just lose my job,

399
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,010
but you'll lose your lifelong dream.

400
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,780
The ambitious dream...

401
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,250
of marrying Min Kyung Chae
and joining the Min family.

402
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,690
You're actually blackmailing me now.

403
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,260
Is that how it felt?

404
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,030
Then you know what to do.

405
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,320
What's going on?
What was that deal thing about?

406
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,450
I just explained the situation
to the chairman.

407
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,120
What about when
the Helena Louise people said...

408
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,360
they didn't and wouldn't sign
an exclusive deal with anyone in Korea?

409
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,460
Madam Jang had asked
the Helena Louise team to lie.

410
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,800
Only then would our CEO...

411
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,530
let her guard down
and allow her brother to mess up.

412
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,070
Is our team safe, then?

413
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,310
I'd hope so.

414
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,980
You can't afford to leave the company.

415
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,680
You have work to do here.

416
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,880
Did you do this for me?

417
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,520
I did it for us.

418
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,990
That's why I want to say this in advance.

419
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,460
Whatever I do in the future,

420
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,890
don't be shocked or disappointed.

421
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,000
What are you planning to do
that got you so serious?

422
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,600
You said you'd support me.

423
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,140
I did, and I do.

424
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,410
But don't try to ruin someone
at the expense of hurting yourself.

425
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,410
Nothing can be more foolish than that.

426
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,150
I won't support that.
Do you know what I mean?

427
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,190
Wouldn't it be best to come clean...

428
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,090
and work with Moon Tae Kyung
to take down Min Doo Sik?

429
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,830
No. He must do what he wants
in his own way.

430
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,470
I don't want to influence him.

431
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,140
Then we'll stick to our plan.

432
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,870
About Min Kyung Chae.

433
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,240
Would she let me...

434
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,610
become a non-executive director
and look into every detail of Mingang?

435
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,980
She has no choice, even if she hates it.

436
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,620
Chairman Min will force her this time.

437
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,420
Even someone like her...

438
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,220
still fears her father?

439
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,430
I bet he's yelling at her right now.

440
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,730
Call Taemin Daily News,
show them the real contract,

441
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,230
and tell them to print a correction.

442
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,870
And make Madam Jang
a non-executive director.

443
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,840
Why won't you answer?

444
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Okay.

445
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,580
She'll visit this weekend.

446
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,050
You'll bring that woman to our house?

447
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,890
Watch how you address her!

448
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,890
Do you want me to say she's my stepmother?

449
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,060
Why are you doing this?

450
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,160
What about you?

451
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,130
I know how much you want my title,

452
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,800
but how dare
you harm the company to get it?

453
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,300
What are you talking about?

454
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,000
Your brother, Ji Seop.

455
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,410
If he lost his shares
for sabotaging the business,

456
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,640
you were going to take it all.
Do you think I wouldn't catch on?

457
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,710
That's why you egged on that moron!

458
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,310
So you could take his shares
and then take me on!

459
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,150
Who told you that? Was it that woman?

460
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,920
Are you yelling at me
because of what she said?

461
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,260
Get a hold of yourself.

462
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,620
Don't fall for a vixen...

463
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,030
who's trying to get between us!

464
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,700
How dare you?

465
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,800
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

466
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,810
How could the chairman do this to you?

467
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,380
What wouldn't he do
if he's crazy about a woman?

468
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,980
Take it up with our father.

469
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,420
You wait and see.

470
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,250
At the crucial moment,

471
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,920
see which sister I side with.

472
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,960
I'm worried about how close
you're getting with the chairman.

473
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,830
I know what you're worried about,
Director.

474
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,360
I'm not talking as your director.

475
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,930
I'm talking as Moon Tae Kyung, the man.

476
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,600
Don't be like this already.

477
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,170
Pretty soon, your sister
will play dead if I tell her to.

478
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,300
