00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,710
(Episode 44)

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,280
I'll jump from up here.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,980
Come up and save me
with the heart of a mom.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,600
It's not fair.

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,400
I'm so angry, and it's driving me crazy!

6
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,200
Mom.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,970
Mom.

8
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,280
I'm sorry, Mom.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,910
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,470
Get down from there!

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,250
How dare you go up there?

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,990
We'll talk in the evening.

13
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,020
Mr. Kim is waiting downstairs.
He'll drive you home.

14
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,570
Are you insane?

15
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,200
Why did you bring her up here?

16
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,640
What's wrong with this place?

17
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,840
Did something happen up here?

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,780
You're going a bit too far.

19
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,250
Why are you so arrogant?
Does someone have your back?

20
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,850
Oh, the chairman?

21
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,090
Do you think you can win over my sister?

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,060
You don't know what she's like.

23
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,600
You can change anyone
if you show them love.

24
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,900
"Love?"

25
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,570
Isn't math involved?

26
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,770
Or should I say you have a plan?

27
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,370
Go to the chairman right now
and say you won't do as he asks.

28
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,610
No.

29
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,740
I'll do as he asks.

30
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,750
I'll try to put some sense
into your sister.

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,320
Like a mom would.

32
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,080
How dare you say you'll be her mom?

33
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,720
Don't use that word in this situation.
It's disgusting.

34
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,360
Have you carried a baby to term?

35
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,390
Have you had nausea so bad...

36
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,300
you couldn't even drink water
and had to rely on a drip?

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,630
Have you been in labor for 12 hours...

38
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,600
before getting ripped open to give birth?

39
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,970
If you haven't been through any of that,
shut your mouth.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,570
Don't cross the line
saying you can be a mom.

41
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,940
Take it up with the chairman.

42
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,440
If he changes his mind,

43
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,280
I will too.

44
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,890
How a mom feels?

45
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,890
I know just as much as you.

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,010
Was your secret weapon...

47
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,350
to use the vice director
to shield yourself?

48
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,320
What are you talking about?

49
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,650
You know it well.

50
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,450
I heard you put the vice director
in charge of the promotions.

51
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,420
I haven't even brought it up
to the CEO yet.

52
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,060
Rumors travel fast.

53
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,600
I just gave him an opportunity.

54
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,060
Director Moon.

55
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,530
You're sacrificing your team
to keep your position.

56
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,230
Aren't you ashamed?

57
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,200
Since we're here talking,
let me ask you something.

58
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,540
It's still illegal to break the law
even if you don't get caught.

59
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,180
What do you think about that?

60
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,680
What's your point?

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,080
You must know.

62
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,320
If this is about how the partners
refused to renew their contracts...

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,750
Is this when I get to say
you have a guilty conscience?

64
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,850
You brought it up yourself.

65
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,690
Here's another thing.

66
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,030
The chairman knows the partners...

67
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,130
refused to renew their deals
because someone muddied the waters.

68
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,140
He has a pretty good guess
who's responsible,

69
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,710
but he's letting it go
because he doesn't have physical proof.

70
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,380
I'm guessing he'll have a hard time
finding any proof.

71
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,710
Whoever is guilty would've...

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,450
covered his tracks
as a professional would.

73
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,450
And you think that's me?

74
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,090
I hope it's not you.

75
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,360
It shouldn't be you.

76
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,800
I hate that punk.

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,800
I won't say much.

78
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,310
Planning the promotions.
Give the job to someone else.

79
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,110
Why should I do that?

80
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,440
Will the skies fall if I handle a project?

81
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,080
Mingang will fall.

82
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,080
What can you even do?

83
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,450
What? How dare you talk to me like that?

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,690
You just cut a huge hole in my ego.

85
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,120
- Ji Seop.
- Darn you!

86
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,630
Stop calling me a brother
or stop telling me to quit!

87
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,430
You beat me at everything,

88
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,530
won Father's approval,
and had a successful career.

89
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,100
I grit my teeth
just to put up with it all.

90
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,240
If this is what you say,
I have other plans.

91
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,110
- What plans?
- Fine.

92
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,910
Se Ri is out of the picture.

93
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,310
But there's me, Soo Jung, and my wife,

94
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,780
not to mention the shares my in-laws own!

95
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,980
You won't be CEO forever, okay?

96
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,220
Are you threatening me?

97
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,520
No. I'm talking about reality.

98
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,460
I'm also giving you a warning.

99
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,890
You're not the lead character
in a sea of supporting actors.

100
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,730
My gosh.

101
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,930
He's helpless.

102
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
How can he not know how incompetent he is?

103
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,400
It's for the better.

104
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,440
What does that mean?

105
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,800
Let him get into trouble.

106
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,110
We both know Kyung Chae doesn't like you.

107
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm not sure if it's a good idea
when she's so strongly against it.

108
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,790
She thinks you set things up
so you could swoop in to save me.

109
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,790
You said with a tear in your eye...

110
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,530
that Se Ri...

111
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,230
would change if she had
a mother figure to hold her.

112
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,970
I saw the heart of a mom inside of you.

113
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,070
"The heart of a mom?"

114
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,440
Do you think I've gone soft
and that I'm talking nonsense?

115
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,740
I suspected you at first,

116
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,980
but you're the first person I trusted
when I'm a known skeptic.

117
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,410
It was understandable.

118
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,150
No one can accept
an onslaught of coincidences.

119
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,450
You said it was meant to be,
not a coincidence.

120
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,320
Didn't you?

121
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,260
Se Ri is lashing out
because she's upset...

122
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,830
with her sister.

123
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,930
Console her.

124
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,500
Show her what you showed me,
that we were meant to be.

125
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,340
Don't smile like that.

126
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,410
For other men, I mean.

127
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,580
You can smile for me, though.

128
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,450
If that's what he said to your face,

129
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,890
he has opened up to you completely.

130
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,460
His son Ji Seop
will get into trouble on his own.

131
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,130
Now you just need to win over Se Ri.

132
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,130
Min Kyung Chae will freak out.

133
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,570
Thinking of how that brat...

134
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,300
will end up trusting you
more than her own sister...

135
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,840
makes me want to get a tub of popcorn.

136
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,680
Did you talk to Tae Joo?

137
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,480
You bet. Don't worry about that.

138
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,810
It's strange, though.

139
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,810
They're both her half-sisters.

140
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,380
How come she hates one
and adores the other?

141
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,850
Why is Min Kyung Chae like that?

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Give me a glass.

143
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,830
This is hard liquor.

144
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,300
I know it is.

145
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
That's why I want some.

146
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,060
What's wrong with you?

147
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,260
If you need someone to talk to,
go to a shrink. I'll find you one.

148
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,560
You're not talking to Lucia.

149
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,000
Why not?

150
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,800
Do you know
what she said to me in the water?

151
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,340
She told me to do anything to live.
She pleaded with me.

152
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,610
Did you ever say that to me?

153
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,380
I don't know why you hate her so much,

154
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,940
but I'll do the opposite of what you say.

155
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,560
Se Ri is right.

156
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,790
Let her be. Who knows?

157
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,700
Lucia might actually change her.

158
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,870
Did Kyung Chae really say
you can't do anything?

159
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,570
The brat is arrogant beyond belief.

160
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,710
You need to ace this promotion.

161
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,110
Get the exclusive deal
and put Kyung Chae in her place.

162
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,550
I'll do just that.

163
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,850
I'll show her what I can do.

164
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,090
She might try to push Father aside
if I don't do something.

165
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,560
You said you lost out.

166
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,590
They're not interested in signing a deal.

167
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,030
Oh, right.

168
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,700
I forgot.

169
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,630
Put someone else in charge.

170
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,030
Why would you trust the vice director
with the promotions?

171
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,900
I've already finished
allocating the tasks.

172
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,110
Don't you know what Ji Seop is like?

173
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,040
If you trust him and give him a chance,
I'm sure he'll do well.

174
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,680
Is this insubordination?

175
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,410
You're disobeying your CEO?

176
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,250
I apologize.

177
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,220
But this is my team's business,

178
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,350
and for you to get involved
in what tasks I allocate...

179
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,020
Did you forget that you gave me
full authority to run the team?

180
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,660
Fine.

181
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,060
You're in charge,
so report your decision to the chairman.

182
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,370
You can go.

183
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,700
Why would you say that?

184
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,400
You asked me for a chance.

185
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
Go ahead.

186
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,320
Ji Seop will come back...

187
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,120
with a forged contract or something.

188
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,160
Moon Tae Kyung and Lucia
know that Ji Seop will mess up,

189
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,460
but they don't seem to care,
which means they have a plan.

190
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,960
They'll secure the exclusive deal?

191
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,230
As if they can.

192
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,700
They'll talk to Ji Seop
and make him confess what he did,

193
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,640
then implement
the other promotion they prepared.

194
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,340
Then Ji Seop will be held responsible,

195
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,540
and business will go on as usual.

196
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,340
They might even earn praise...

197
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,810
for doing damage control.

198
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,380
What's our plan?

199
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,550
Do you remember...

200
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,920
the special company rule
the chairman implemented a few years ago?

201
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,350
If someone within the owner's family
causes harm to the business,

202
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,590
they are forced to hand over their stake.

203
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,990
Yes.

204
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,130
If Ji Seop forges a contract,
that could be deemed harmful to Mingang,

205
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,500
and he'll have to return his shares.

206
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,970
You must claim it.

207
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,370
If you do,

208
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,470
you'll own more of Mingang...

209
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,770
than anyone, second only to the chairman.

210
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,410
What if the board
wants to hold me responsible too?

211
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,180
Let's make it so they don't.

212
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,430
What will you do with that woman?

213
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,360
We'll just talk and...

214
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,300
Dad wants me to.

215
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,400
CEO Min is against the idea.

216
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,840
Dad is her superior.

217
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,010
Your sister cares about you
more than he does.

218
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,740
I thought so too.

219
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
I was wrong.

220
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,950
Who cleaned up all your messes?

221
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,480
If it hadn't been for her, that...

222
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,590
I know Kyung Chae was good to me.

223
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,660
But she freaks out
whenever I mention my mom.

224
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,230
What did you say the woman's name was?

225
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,030
Lucia.

226
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,840
Who knows?
She might treat me like a mom would.

227
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,410
What is it?

228
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,310
I did some thinking.

229
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,780
You'll become the laughing stock
if you don't succeed.

230
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,580
Yes, I would.

231
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,890
How about you type up a fake contract?

232
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
What?

233
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,860
A fake contract?

234
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,360
What else can you do?

235
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,330
I think that's going a bit too far.

236
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,260
There's no cleaning up that bad of a mess.

237
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,570
Things are already in motion,
and you can't turn back now.

238
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,740
You've already gone too far.

239
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,240
Yes, but still...

240
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,980
Stay seated.

241
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,720
Your vice director will handle
the promotion for the upcoming sale.

242
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,960
It looks to be the best we've ever had,
so give him the support he needs.

243
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,000
We have high hopes,

244
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,100
and we trust that he'll do great.

245
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,340
How about we give him some applause?

246
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,510
Good luck.

247
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,210
When do you think the Helena Louise team
will sign the contract?

248
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,410
What?

249
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,520
Tomorrow...

250
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,250
No. This week?

251
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,320
No. Next week.

252
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,120
Okay. Get the deal signed
as soon as possible.

253
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,190
- Next week?
- Is it even possible?

254
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,730
Is it?

255
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,360
Since we're pretty sure
we'll get the deal,

256
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,300
how about we accept pre-orders?

257
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,440
It's weird how she came up
with the idea to take pre-orders.

258
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,070
She did that to set up
the vice director to fail badly.

259
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,280
What does she get out of doing that?

260
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,580
She gains nothing, and it would
only ruin the company's image.

261
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,450
She must stand to gain something
much bigger that is worth the risk.

262
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,550
I'm positive that Mr. Kim is coaching her.

263
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,190
What are they thinking?

264
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,100
Hey, Yeon Ah.

265
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,700
- Yeon Ah.
- Sul Hee.

266
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,270
What is it?

267
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,170
I made a delivery to the chairman's house,

268
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,170
where I heard something weird.

269
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,240
Did you agree to tutor
that Se Ri kid or something?

270
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,550
They said something about being a mom.

271
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,450
- Yes.
- What are you thinking?

272
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,860
I get that you're working there
under an alias to get revenge,

273
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,230
but this isn't right.

274
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,460
- I had no choice.
- How so?

275
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,160
I need to get something on Sun Jae...

276
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,600
before he exposes who I am.

277
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,770
Which is why
I need you to do something for me.

278
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,540
(First Death Anniversary Rite!
It's not hard to set the table.)

279
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Hello?

280
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,890
Yes, it's fine.

281
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,460
(First Death Anniversary Rite!
It's not hard to set the table.)

282
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,700
(Row 1, Row 2, Row 3, Row 4)

283
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,340
Did you talk to your sister?

284
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,810
Yes.

285
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,950
Director. Can you drive me after work?

286
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,520
What's the occasion?

287
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,460
I like your company, but still.

288
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,890
I need to stop by the supermarket.

289
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,700
The supermarket? You need something?

290
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,670
You won't have the right tableware.

291
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,840
You need incense.

292
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,370
Do supermarkets stock them?

293
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
What?

294
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,850
It's your parents' death anniversary.

295
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,080
How do you know that?

296
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,250
I saw what you'd looked up.

297
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,050
It's still hard
if you've never done it before.

298
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,360
I'll help you.

299
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
(Black Goat Extract)

300
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,390
I bet we're the only homeowners
in the whole of Asia...

301
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,430
that leave the home so a tenant
can remember their dead parents.

302
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,770
Let's think positively.

303
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,700
We get to meet up
with Ji Seop and Ja Kyung.

304
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,240
And eat black goat soup.

305
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,870
We do.

306
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Here comes the winner
of the 2021 Miss Korea pageant...

307
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,110
- with her ant-like husband.
- Miss Korea.

308
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,810
- Father, Mother.
- Hi.

309
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,750
- We're here.
- Hello.

310
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,920
Why are we eating
at a black goat restaurant?

311
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,050
- Yes.
- Your dad...

312
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,120
has fallen in love with black goat soup.

313
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,830
He applied for a consultation
about opening his own restaurant.

314
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,990
Black goat soup made me realize...

315
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,760
that health is what brings in money.

316
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,500
People prefer to eat
what's good for them these days.

317
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,540
Gosh, does that mean you'll become a CEO?

318
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,440
Your sister-in-law won't be the only CEO.

319
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,970
I will be one too.

320
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,810
I probably have enough money
to be a chairman, though.

321
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,010
It's nice and spacious.

322
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,250
Perfect for family gatherings.

323
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,880
Let's see.

324
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,120
What should we eat
that would make people jealous?

325
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,390
Pick whatever you want.

326
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,360
It's pretty clean for a place
that sells something health-conscious.

327
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,960
I really don't like invigorating dishes.

328
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,100
Are you a penguin from the Antarctic
trying to ski in the Sahara Desert?

329
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,500
This place beats all those stereotypes.

330
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,340
Not only is the food good for you,
but I like how it tastes good too.

331
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,200
There are lots of sides.

332
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,710
Let's try them all.

333
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,280
The side dishes are so light and clean.

334
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,250
Here.

335
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,390
Dig in.

336
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,420
Eat it for Ja Kyung, like her dad said.

337
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,990
Okay.

338
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,260
That's it.

339
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,430
Mother.

340
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,640
This is just what I like.

341
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,940
You should try it.

342
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,640
Really?

343
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,550
It's good.

344
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,180
There are many kinds that you can...

345
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,420
come in a group to pick and choose from.

346
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,690
I knew it.

347
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,250
Kids and adults all like this place.

348
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,760
In other words, "Watanka!"

349
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,090
- Let's test how much we can eat today.
- Yes.

350
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,200
Eat up.

351
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,540
Last time,

352
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,240
you said you'd listen if I wanted to talk.

353
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,610
I think you need someone to talk to today.

354
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,680
Go on. I'll listen.

355
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,450
It's not a fun story.

356
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,220
Everyone has a few sad stories.

357
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,760
We keep them to ourselves.

358
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,130
But some things shouldn't be buried.

359
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,070
Why are you smiling?

360
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,230
It's nothing.

361
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,400
Someone said that to me a long time ago.

362
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,510
What?

363
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,380
My parents...

364
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,850
met with a wrongful death.

365
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,450
They lost their company...

366
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,150
and a new technology
they'd worked hard to develop.

367
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,290
Why did you let that man go
when you found him again?

368
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,290
He was the only witness.

369
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,260
I wasn't sure...

370
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,100
if it was right
to force him to be a witness...

371
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,930
when he was scared out of his mind.

372
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,640
What about proof? Is there nothing else?

373
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,170
- There is.
- You must find it, then.

374
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,570
I found it already.

375
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,010
It's right here, in this house.

376
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,650
I found a crucial piece of evidence,

377
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,020
but I can't do anything about it.

378
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,820
It's in this house?

379
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,750
Is there a problem with that?

380
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,460
The room
where the homeowner keeps his safe...

381
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,690
has a security camera.

382
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,130
I couldn't steal it if there weren't one,

383
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,000
because stolen evidence
can't be used in court.

384
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,130
What if you ask your landlord
to give it to you?

385
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,600
That didn't work, and he's not the type
to give it over easily.

386
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,510
That's why I'm wondering what to do.

387
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,640
The person...

388
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,710
who did that to your parents.

389
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,350
Is it Chairman Min Doo Sik?

390
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,330
My parents were victims,

391
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,370
but Min Doo Sik played the media
and made them look guilty.

392
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,310
Just like my Mi So.

393
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,680
I was a boy,
and there was nothing I could do.

394
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,610
No.

395
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,720
It would've been the same
even if I were older.

396
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,420
Min Doo Sik is just too big of a man
for me to take down,

397
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,620
both then and now.

398
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,230
Nothing I say
will offer you enough comfort.

399
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,340
You said...

400
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,810
you'd cheer for me whatever I do.

401
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,350
I feel the same.

402
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,820
I'll root for you too.

403
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,820
That's why, even though I want to know,

404
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,890
I'm not asking questions.

405
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,590
They say everyone wears a mask...

406
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,530
for their own reasons.

407
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,330
It could be
out of consideration for others...

408
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,670
or to disguise themselves.

409
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm okay if you happen to be married...

410
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,810
or if you have a child.

411
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,180
I'm okay if you're a loan shark...

412
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,620
or if you're a man... No, maybe not that.

413
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,860
I mean it.

414
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,130
Even if you happen to be wearing a mask,

415
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,360
I don't care.

416
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,400
Because I know the face behind the mask.

417
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,510
Oh, gosh.

418
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,320
Don't smile like that.

419
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,520
For other men, I mean.

420
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,830
You can smile for me, though.

421
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,380
Hello, it's me.

422
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,420
You didn't delete my number.

423
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,620
I was afraid you'd ask who it was.

424
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,660
Why would I?

425
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,060
I like that.

426
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,160
Most people delete numbers
they don't use after a while.

427
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,470
Why did you call?

428
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,530
The way you asked that...

429
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,670
kind of hurts because it feels like
you're not happy to hear from me.

430
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,140
Do you...

431
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,740
Do you want iced coffee?

432
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,910
Hot, please.

433
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,580
Okay.

434
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,550
Who's that with you?

435
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,190
Is it a man?

436
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,020
It sounded like a man's voice.

437
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,120
That was my director.

438
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,090
You're with him this late?

439
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,590
It so happened.

440
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,130
Why would you be with him this late?

441
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Gosh, that's hot.

442
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,270
Are you okay?

443
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,870
Sorry, sir. I have to go.

444
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,110
Hello?

445
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,280
What was that about?

446
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,590
It's fine now.

447
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,160
Keep still if you don't want to
end up with a blister.

448
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,230
See a doctor tomorrow, just in case.

449
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,030
Is this funny?

450
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,540
You could be badly burned.

451
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
I like it.

452
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,310
What?

453
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,280
What would I have done
without you tonight?

454
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,750
You helped me with the ancestral rite,

455
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,450
and then with this.

456
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,860
Oh, dear.

457
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,510
My gosh.

458
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,850
Thanks for your help yesterday.

459
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,120
This is me thanking you.

460
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,320
Director.

461
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,890
It's nothing at all.

462
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,930
I wanted to get you something.

463
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,800
You didn't have to.

464
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,830
My parents said...

465
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,930
it was their first decent meal.

466
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,040
They told me so in my dream.

467
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,870
They say you should open gifts right away.

468
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,390
My mom always wore one.

469
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,690
I thought of her as I picked that out.

470
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,690
I hope you like it.

471
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,830
She looked beautiful in the photo.

472
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,000
Thanks. I'll wear it often.

473
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,300
- Can I try it on now?
- Of course you can.

474
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,180
What do you think?

475
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,850
You look great.

476
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,990
Does it suit me?

477
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,360
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

478
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,680
