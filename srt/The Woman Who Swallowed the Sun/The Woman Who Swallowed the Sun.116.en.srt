1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,110
Tae Kyung!

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,080
Tae Kyung, wake up!

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,880
Tae Kyung...

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,160
Tae Kyung, stay with me.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,500
Please wake up!

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,970
Tae Kyung...

7
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,410
Mi So.

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,980
Mi So.

9
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,550
Mi So!

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,430
- Mom.
- Yes, Mom's here.

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,590
I'm right here.

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,830
Do you recognize me?

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,530
It's you, Mom.

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,110
Mi So.

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,550
Mi So.

16
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,390
Tae Kyung, please wake up.

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,890
Tae Kyung!

18
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,130
Is this 911?
Please send an ambulance. Hurry!

19
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,810
(Episode 116)

20
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,840
Welcome, Chairman.

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,180
Are you feeling any better?

22
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,480
Father, are you sure you should be leaving
the hospital so suddenly?

23
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,050
Who gets discharged
in the middle of the night?

24
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,320
I know.

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,160
If you'd called ahead,
we would have come to get you.

26
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,590
Why did you suddenly leave the hospital?
You still look like you're in pain.

27
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,000
Why? Am I not welcome in my own home?

28
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,760
Why? Is something wrong?

29
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,070
Still, you'd be better off
at the hospital.

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,900
So you're fully discharged?

31
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,270
You won't be
returning to the hospital, right?

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,340
You still seem to have trouble walking.

33
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,110
Maybe we should check you
in rehabilitation...

34
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,110
Enough!

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,040
Where is Lucia?

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,080
She hasn't come home yet.

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,350
What could she be doing out this late?

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Take me to my room.

39
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,040
How could he do this to him?

40
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,680
He's not even human.

41
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,680
I will never forgive you for this,
Min Doo Sik.

42
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,560
Seriously, where is she?
What could she be doing at this hour?

43
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,260
Good grief.

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,870
Hey, where are you?

45
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,410
Why are you calling me?

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
What's that supposed to mean?

47
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,910
What's with the attitude?
Can't I call you?

48
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,650
Come home right now. I'm already here.

49
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,150
I can't right now.

50
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,490
Why not?
Where are you, and what are you doing?

51
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm in a foul mood because we lost
that jerk Moon Tae Kyung today.

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,360
I don't need this from you too.

53
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,600
You're in a foul mood...

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
because you couldn't catch him?

55
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,830
So no matter what,

56
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,300
you're going to find him, aren't you?

57
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,710
Of course I am.

58
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,040
That little rat.
Does he think he can hide from me?

59
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,510
I'll spend whatever it takes
and hire people and find him.

60
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,150
And what will you do when you find him?

61
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,450
Are you seriously asking me that?

62
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,760
Before that jerk comes for my head
to avenge his father,

63
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,390
I need to finish him first.

64
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,900
I don't care where and what you're doing,
but come home now.

65
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,760
I need you here with me.

66
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,100
Fine.

67
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,510
You're all monsters!

68
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,580
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

69
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,150
Do you have any idea
how much this stuff costs?

70
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,760
A living national treasure made that vase!

71
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,390
- Hey!
- Come on, stop it already!

72
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,660
At this rate, you'll destroy everything.

73
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,560
They were all imported!

74
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,830
They're worth more than
what an average person makes in a year!

75
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,740
That vase over there
is worth 100,000 dollars!

76
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,700
Money!

77
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,470
Is money the only thing you care about?

78
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,580
You don't care if people live or die.

79
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,680
As long as you save your own skin
and have more than everyone else.

80
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,380
Then you can just live like kings,
and that's all that matters.

81
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,450
If you're drunk, go sleep it off!
Why are you being so disgraceful?

82
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,550
I'm not the disgraceful one, you are!

83
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,660
You think your money lets you do anything.

84
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,520
You're not even human!

85
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,000
What in the world has gotten into you?
Are you insane?

86
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,870
I've never been more sane in my life.

87
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,400
You're the one
who's lost his mind, Chairman.

88
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,210
What?

89
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,610
I can't believe you!

90
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,210
Why do you live like this?

91
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,710
How can you live
like you're not even human?

92
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,120
You know, a real human being
should feel a pang of guilt...

93
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,950
when they kill an insect.

94
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,690
They feel guilty even for a tiny creature.

95
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,260
So how could you do that
to another human being?

96
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,860
How could you have someone beaten
to within an inch of their life?

97
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,740
All for your disgusting greed
and your filthy selfishness!

98
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,910
Do you have any idea...

99
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,570
how many innocent lives you've ruined?

100
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,580
All because of you, Min Doo Sik!

101
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,110
She's gone completely insane.

102
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,750
She absolutely lost her mind!

103
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,720
What are you all standing around for?
Call the police now!

104
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,420
Go on, call them
if you've done nothing wrong.

105
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,520
If you can tell your children
what you did...

106
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,960
to Tae Kyung's parents 30 years ago,

107
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,790
then by all means, call the police.

108
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,800
Why would you destroy
an honest, hardworking family?

109
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,670
Why?
He could've had a happy life with them.

110
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,970
Why did you turn him into an orphan?
Just why?

111
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,850
Was destroying his parents not enough?
Did you have to go after him too?

112
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,680
You...

113
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,850
are a monster.

114
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Tae Kyung has been
taking it easy on you until now.

115
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,620
But from now on, just you watch what I do.

116
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,830
I'll drag all of you down to rock bottom
and crush you completely.

117
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,630
I'll make you experience
a living nightmare.

118
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,950
What was that?

119
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,190
What on earth was that?

120
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,450
Seriously, what's with her?

121
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,030
I know, right? Can she just
wreck the place and walk out?

122
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,060
Father! What's wrong with her?

123
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,130
You have to know
why she's acting like this!

(Han Kyung Soo)

127
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,480
You have to wake up,

128
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,790
like none of this ever happened.

129
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,920
You can do that, can't you?

130
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,360
You'll wake up perfectly fine...

131
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,860
with a smile on your face, right?

132
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,200
I have faith in you, Tae Kyung.

133
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,750
What happened? This place is a wreck.

134
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,950
What took you so long?
Chaos erupted here.

135
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,320
What happened?

136
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,290
That woman smashed the place up
and stormed out.

137
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,960
Lucia did?

138
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,930
She seemed completely out of her mind.

139
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,270
She'd completely snapped.

140
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,270
She looked absolutely murderous.

141
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,270
The chairman is in shock too.
He's just sitting there, stunned.

142
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,410
Father is home?

143
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,280
Yes. He got home from the hospital.

144
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,750
And he walked right into this mess.

145
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,230
What are you doing here?

146
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,570
You just left the hospital
and came home without saying a word.

147
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,410
What in the world happened?

148
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,380
I heard Lucia tore the house apart
and left.

149
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,650
You must know why, Father.

150
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,680
Get out.

151
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,420
- Father!
- I said, get out.

I was just on my way
to the chairman's office.

158
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
What was all that about yesterday,
trashing the house before you left?

159
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,440
So, does this mean you're gone for good?

160
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,140
Then again,

161
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,040
after the scene you made,
how can you possibly return?

162
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,880
My father was in such shock
that he didn't sleep a wink all night.

163
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,750
What will you do if something
happens to him because of you?

164
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,580
He's just lying in bed,
refusing to eat or drink.

165
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,150
Don't you feel the least bit sorry?

166
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,290
Hey.

167
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,460

You have some nerve,
acting like this after what you did.

171
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,980
Tell me what happened!

172
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,450
Why did you cause my family harm
like a thug?

173
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,790
Why is everyone in the Min family
such a bunch of hypocrites?

174
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,790
Why are you all so selfish?

175

What are you talking about?

how other people see you, do you?

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
No, I've got plenty more to say...

180
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,540
about how disgusting and vile you all are.

181
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,380
If I were to list everything,
it would probably take days.

182
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,850
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

183
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,550
The father is a monster,
and so is every child of his.

184
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,920
You're nothing but greedy,

185
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,920
and you'd stab your siblings in the back
just to get a little more.

186
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,420
If you despise him this much,
why did you marry my father?

187
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,360
You really haven't figured that out yet?

188
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,260
Because it was the only way
I could get what I wanted.

189
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,860
You mean Mingang Distribution?

190
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,030
- Do you finally get it?
- Get out right now!

191
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,610
Mingang was built by the Min family,
the people you claim to despise so much.

192
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,640
My father built this company
from the ground up.

193
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,750
This company is Father's life's work!

194
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,280
Don't be delusional!

195
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,280
Mingang doesn't belong to you.

196
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,020
It has a rightful owner,
and until it's returned to them,

197
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,520
I'm not going anywhere.

198
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,760
No.

199
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,530
I refuse to leave!

200
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,680
Where am I?

201
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,190
It looks like a hospital.

202
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,190
Why am I here?

203
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,730
How did I get here?

204
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,570
Tae Kyung!

205
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,540
Tae Kyung, wake up.

206
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
So, she's the one who brought me here.

207
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,610
(Han Kyung Soo)

208
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,850
(New Technology Transfer
and Usage Rights Security Agreement)

209
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,950
(Party A: Oh Pan Sool,
Party B: Han Kyung Soo)

210
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,420
Why is this here?

211
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,930
Is Director Moon not here again?

212
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,100
Beats me.
Does he think the company's a playground?

213
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,010
He shows up when he feels like it
and skips it when he doesn't.

214
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,770
Do you have any idea
what's going on with him?

215
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,210
We're not exactly friends.

216
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,910
Besides, things at my house were a mess,

217
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,980
so I'm in no mood to worry about him.

218
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,320
Is that woman and Director Moon...

219
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
Never mind. It's nothing.

220
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,360
Don't stop there.
What about her and Director Moon?

221
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,360
He always does this.

222
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,870
Is it true my stepmother did this?

223
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,500
Why would we lie about it?

224
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,040
That makes no sense.

225
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,240
Why would she trash the house and leave?

226
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,780
I know, right?

227
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,280
She must have completely lost her mind.

228
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,950
She must hold a serious grudge
against this family.

229
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,980
That's ridiculous.
What grudge would Mom possibly have?

230
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,520
You didn't see what happened yesterday,
so you have no room to talk.

231
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,390
My gosh. I'm kicking myself
for not recording the whole thing.

232
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,490
I'm going to go ask Dad.

233
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,130
Please don't.

234
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,560
The chairman is a total wreck right now.

235
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,970
He hasn't even been able
to drink a sip of water.

236
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,070
This is so frustrating.

237
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,100
I have no idea what's going on.

238
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,780
You...

239
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,950
are a monster.

240
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,850
Tae Kyung has been
taking it easy on you until now.

241
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,660
But from now on, just you watch what I do.

242
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,860
I'll drag all of you down to rock bottom
and crush you completely.

243
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,630
I'll make you experience
a living nightmare.

244
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,510
Anyway, it looks like Tae Kyung
isn't coming home tonight either.

245
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,550
Do you think he ran away
like the young stepmom?

246
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,320
Wait a minute.
You don't think the two of them...

247
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,620
This is getting to be just like one
of those crazy soaps I write.

248
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,250
- What?
- No, wait.

249
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,290
Then does that mean Ja Kyung
isn't my real daughter?

250
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,290
Who's the real dad?

251
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,360
Who's the real mom?

252
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,660
- Oh, my.
- Or maybe...

253
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,560
I'm starting to see
the whole world as a crazy soap opera.

254
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,160
My gosh! I love all the crazy drama!

255
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,000
For crying out loud.

256
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,350
I was starting to worry
you wouldn't wake up today.

257
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,390
Good thing I woke up, then.

258
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,990
Us being like this
reminds me of that one time.

259
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,360
You know, when I was hospitalized
after I bumped into your scooter,

260
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,970
you kept saying a patient has to eat well,
and you kept bringing me beef bone broth.

261
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,970
I'd never had it in the US,
so I didn't care for the taste back then,

262
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,240
but it really started to grow on me.

263
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,880
Are you craving some beef bone soup?

264
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,080
And if I am?
Are you going to make some for me?

265
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,850
No.

266
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,620
I can't right now.

267
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,420
Some other time.

268
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,730
I left that house.

269
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,940
Because of this?

270
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,540
That, and other things.

271
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,250
I was bound to leave
that house eventually.

272
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,150
If anything,
I stayed there for far too long.

273
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,520
This is all my fault.

274
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,690
I...

275
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,960
don't need this anymore.

276
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,530
I don't want you risking yourself
just to get this for me.

277
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,860
I wasn't in any danger.
I didn't steal it. I took what's mine.

278
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,030
If any problems arise,
I'll take full responsibility.

279
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,340
That's exactly my point.

280
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,670
I don't want you taking
responsibility for everything.

281
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,740
I'm doing this because I want to.

282
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,650
Because if our roles were reversed,
I know you'd do the same for me.

283
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,980
Wouldn't you?

284
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,320
Of course I would.

285
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,390
See?

286
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,050
We feel the same way, Tae Kyung.

287
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,260
So let's not feel sorry for each other.

288
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,330
I should check out of here tomorrow.

289
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,500
I can't bear leaving you
at the company alone.

290
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,850
I had a bad feeling about her
from the start.

291
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,190
A nobody who deliberately got close
to Father,

292
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,120
became his new wife,
then the CEO of Mingang Distribution,

293
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,490
and now, she's even the acting chairman.

294
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,760
Talk about a rags-to-riches story.

295
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,870
Now that she's got what she wanted,
she's showing her true colors.

296
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,330
It sounds more like a story of betrayal.

297
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,870
I can't forgive her.

298
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,270
All the horrible things she said to me,

299
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,240
the contempt she showed my family,

300
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,080
and her greed, daring to covet Mingang.

301
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,780
I will never forgive her for any of it.

302
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,050
What are you going to do now?

303
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,020
I'll make her divorce Father...

304
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,320
and kick her
out of the company immediately.

305
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,470
How's Father?

306
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,000
He's the same.
He refused to eat again today,

307
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,810
and he's just holed up in his bedroom.

308
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,390
How long are you going to keep this up?

309
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,790
Do you know what that woman
said to me today?

310
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,800
She said she married you
just to steal Mingang Distribution.

311
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,270
The Min family business that you built
with your own blood, sweat, and tears.

312
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,110
She deliberately got close to you
just to gobble it all up!

313
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,280
That's enough! Darn it!

314
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,610
Please snap out of it!

315
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,950
Father, you were completely fooled by her!

316
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,160
Are there still no signs
of Moon Tae Kyung?

317
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,760
Then go to the police.

318
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,200
Why do you keep coming here?

319
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,330
He's in the hospital right now.

320
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,300
Is he that seriously hurt
that he had to be hospitalized?

321
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,470
It's a miracle he didn't get
emergency surgery.

322
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,140
And let me guess,
Min Doo Sik was behind it?

323
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,710
Yes.

324
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,180
So I declared war on the family
and walked out.

325
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,950
When I saw Tae Kyung lying on the street,
beaten to a pulp,

326
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,050
I was about to lose my mind.

327
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,060
Madam Jang, I'm going to make them pay.

328
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,120
Please help me.

329
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,200
Then what about Se Ri?
Are you just going to leave her there?

330
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,860
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail...

331
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,830
What is this, seriously?

332
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,900
Why isn't Mom picking up?

333
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,640
My goodness. What are you doing back here?

334
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,070
Did you forget to break something
on your way out?

335
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,290
After today, I am never seeing you again
for the rest of my life.

336
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,560
What are you doing here?

337
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,660
Are you here to say your final goodbye?

338
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,490
I don't need it.

339
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,500
I'm not here to say goodbye.
I'm here to settle the score.

340
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,370
Settle the score?

341
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,600
Settle what score?

342
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,710
You're like a nine-tailed fox
who seduced a chairman your father's age.

343
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,080
Being called the chairman's wife
and treated as such should've been enough.

344
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,650
You shameless vixen.

345
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,050
You're one to talk about
being shameless, Chairman.

346
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,520
You think I'm going to
let you get away with this?

347
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,350
Not a chance.

348
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,560
I'll expose you for who you really are,

349
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,160
have you thrown in jail
for marriage fraud,

350
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,990
and I'll make sure the world never forgets
what a gold digger you are.

351
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,330
You're laughing?

352
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,800
How dare you laugh at me?

353
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,470
You little...

354
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,250
Darn you.

355
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,740
Because you've always been surrounded
by people who let you walk all over them,

356
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,240
you've lived your life worshipped
like a king or even the Almighty,

357
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,310
but that's not how the world really works.

358
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,450
You reap what you sow.
It's a fundamental principle.

359
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,050
If you didn't want to end up like this,
you shouldn't have treated them that way.

360
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,920
Did you come here to teach me a lesson?

361
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,920
Are you here to lecture me
about "real-world experience?"

362
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,630
No. I still have a lot more to say...

363
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,100
if you and your family are going
to truly learn your lesson.

364
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,770
So, for starters, how about this?

365
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,180
This is a memorandum stating
you'll transfer all of your shares to me.

366
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,920
Sign it.

367
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,490
Are you insane?
You think I'd give you all my shares?

368
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,920
Wasn't it enough you played me for a fool?

369
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,260
And what now?
You want me to hand everything over?

370
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,500
The death of CEO Han Kyung Soo
of Doeun Industries.

371
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,300
I suppose you don't mind
if the truth about that gets out?

372
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,440
Do you have proof?

373
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,240
However much you cry and make a scene
about how you've been wronged,

374
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,340
your words alone won't beat me in court!

375
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,350
I'll hire the best lawyers
from the top firm in Korea,

376
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,150
and they will bury you.

377
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,120
I'm calling the police right now
to have you arrested.

378
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,590
A thing like you deserves to rot in jail!

379
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,160
I suppose
this is more than enough proof, then?

(New Technology Transfer
and Usage Rights Security Agreement)

381
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,940
You think this flimsy,
old piece of agreement is a threat?

382
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,510
You really don't know how the world works,
do you?

383
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,310
With enough money,
I can make something like this disappear.

384
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,020
Is this the police?

385
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,360
There's an intruder in my house...

386
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,260
What about your handkerchief
with Jo Pil Doo's blood on it?

387
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,560
That would change things, wouldn't it?
