00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,210
(Episode 46)

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,810
Someone, help!

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,610
Is anyone there?

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,350
Help me!

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,220
It's just us.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,020
There's no point in screaming.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,790
You can't leave this place.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,500
Do you know why?

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,970
If you run, you'll get brought back.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,370
If you run again,
you'll get brought back again.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,570
Don't you dare touch her!

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,150
If you so much as touch a hair on her,
I will kill you.

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,960
Who do you think you are?

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,420
Me?

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,360
I'm her mom.

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,900
If you're her mom, can you die for her?

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,470
Willingly. Kill me if you can.

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,110
Don't you come after my daughter again.

19
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,910
Se Ri. Get out of here. Go, now!

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,040
Run!

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,450
I told you to leave my daughter alone!

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,490
Se Ri! Run away!

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,990
Get out of here!

24
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,320
Run!

25
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,490
Go! Get away from here!

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,060
Connecting to the police hotline.

27
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,700
Is that the police?

28
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,900
You look dreadful.

29
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,670
Did something happen while you were out?

30
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,510
Pay the taxi driver outside.

31
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,910
Why are you home so late?

32
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,150
What's up with her?

33
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,650
I don't know.

34
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,000
Sit up.

35
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,700
You met someone.
At least tell me how it went.

36
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,440
Don't you hear me?

37
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,840
Sit up!

38
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,950
What happened?

39
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,690
Did you cry?

40
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,490
- No.
- You did.

41
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,490
Did Lucia say something?

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,130
Did she hit you?

43
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,000
I won't know if you won't tell me!

44
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,370
Did she hit you?

45
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,610
She did. That's why you cried.

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,410
How dare she hit you in the face?

47
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,580
This is why I was against the idea.

48
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,150
The chairman favors her,
so she forgets her place.

49
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,090
How can she teach you anything?

50
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,390
She lost all sense of reason!

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,090
I'll talk to her.

52
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,360
Will you stop it?

53
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,600
What do you know? She's not like that.

54
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,200
What?

55
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,570
Don't badmouth or frame others.
What right do you think you have?

56
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,870
Don't talk about her place
and teaching her a lesson...

57
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,880
when you should bow to her in gratitude.

58
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,250
Get out!

59
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,020
I want to be alone!

60
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,790
Are you all right?

61
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm fine. What about you, Tae Joo?

62
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,960
Don't mind me.

63
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,670
I was afraid I'd hurt you.

64
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,740
I tried to be gentle, but still.

65
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,270
That's why they say pretend fighting
is harder than actual fighting.

66
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,170
How did Se Ri react?

67
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,480
She will be in shock.

68
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,180
She brought it upon herself.
This is what she did to others.

69
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,680
She should know how it feels.

70
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,420
She can't trust her sister
to cover for her forever.

71
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,690
She's an adult now.

72
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,330
What happened?

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,730
She won't say.

74
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,840
Bring her a hot cup of tea.

75
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Okay.

76
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,910
Manager Gong.

77
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,210
Is Se Ri home?

78
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,310
Yes.

79
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,830
Did you meet with Lucia?

80
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,700
Something happened to me today.

81
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,700
Something happened,
and you didn't cause it?

82
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,900
What happened?

83
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,600
Because of me, Lucia...

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,340
Because of you, what?

85
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,450
Never mind. Forget about it.

86
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,890
I feel so weird.

87
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,720
How so? How do you feel?

88
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,730
I don't know.

89
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,830
My heart pounds, and I can't stop crying.

90
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,670
I feel upset and...

91
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,500
I don't know, my heart aches.

92
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,580
Hey. What's wrong?

93
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,980
Why can't I log onto our site?

94
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,650
Because we had too much traffic,
the server crashed.

95
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Why?

96
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
It's all thanks to you.

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,860
People flocked as soon as we announced
pre-orders for the Helena Louise line.

98
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,160
That wasn't that long ago.

99
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,730
Customer Service is busy taking calls.

100
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,460
Shipping is really expensive
if you buy it overseas.

101
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,430
If we get exclusive rights to sell,
we ship anywhere...

102
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,770
within the country at a low shipping cost,
so it's a great deal.

103
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,400
It's not just about shipping.

104
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,870
We guarantee
that the products are authentic.

105
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,440
When can you get the contract signed?

106
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,880
To manage supply, we need to know
how big the first shipment will be.

107
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,310
I'll accompany you to the signing
if you're unsure of going on your own.

108
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,920
Just tell me the date.

109
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,720
You don't have to get on the case too.
I said I could handle it on my own.

110
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,120
Don't you trust me?

111
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,090
Well, it wouldn't be right
for me to swoop in...

112
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,830
at the signing when you did all the work.

113
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,760
You can handle everything.

114
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,770
You bet I will.
I always handle everything on my own.

115
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,480
Don't you dare touch her!

116
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,190
If you so much as touch a hair on her,
I will kill you.

117
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,960
Who do you think you are?

118
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,960
Me? I'm her mom.

119
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,830
If you're her mom, can you die for her?

120
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,090
Willingly.

121
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,130
Kill me if you can.

122
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,230
Don't you come after my daughter again.

123
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,470
Se Ri. Get out of here.

124
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,070
Go, now! Run!

125
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,010
She wasn't badly hurt, was she?

126
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,680
Why should I care?

127
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,510
Did I ask for her help?

128
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,580
She got involved.

129
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,060
Where are you going? Ms. Se Ri.

130
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,340
The chairman expects a great deal,
so prove yourself to him.

131
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,810
What? The chairman?

132
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,350
I just left his office after a chat.

133
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,520
He told me to back you up so you do well.

134
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,150
He wouldn't say that...

135
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,990
I believe you'll get the deal signed.

136
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,590
I have high hopes too.

137
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,260
Your team's future depends on this sale.

138
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,230
I'm sure you'll do well.

139
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,430
Good luck.

140
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,030
What are you doing here?

141
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,060
(Mingang Distribution)

142
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,300
I came to see someone.

143
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,070
Who? Kyung Chae?

144
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,170
Is it Lucia?

145
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,870
Shall I call her for you?

146
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,280
You have a guest in the lobby.

147
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,890
Bye.

148
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,060
I hope you have a nice chat.

149
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,360
I'll keep it from Kyung Chae.

150
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,070
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

151
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,940
Se Ri was in the lobby.

152
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,710
To do what?

153
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,310
To see Lucia.

154
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,910
Maybe they formed a connection
over the weekend.

155
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,780
Did they?

156
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,880
But then, Lucia has a way
of getting people to open up.

157
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,290
Even I think she's charming.

158
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,860
Why wouldn't Director Moon fall for her?

159
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,760
Are the two that close?

160
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,790
From what I saw?

161
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,660
To be honest, they are a handsome couple.

162
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,370
"A handsome couple?" Don't be silly.

163
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,400
They say a woman's heart
sways like a reed for a reason.

164
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,170
Who wouldn't fall for a kind man?

165
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,770
It's such a shame.

166
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,570
What does that mean?

167
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,010
You know what it means.

168
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,080
You'll regret losing someone like her.

169
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,650
You must win over the woman you want.

170
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,050
Why would someone like you hesitate?

171
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,170
You came here to see me?

172
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,470
Well...

173
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,740
Did anything bad happen that night?

174
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,610
I didn't just run away.
I called the police.

175
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,010
I know you did.

176
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,980
Were you worried...

177
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,950
I'd have been hurt?

178
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,190
I didn't say that.

179
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,690
I came over because I had time to kill.

180
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,590
What's that?

181
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,970
(Band-Aids)

182
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,910
Don't get any ideas.

183
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,080
I had extra money to waste.

184
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,270
Even I think she's charming.

185
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,740
Why wouldn't Director Moon fall for her?

186
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,010
To be honest, they are a handsome couple.

187
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,020
Who wouldn't fall for a kind man?

188
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,730
What do you think?

189
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,960
About what?

190
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,630
You told me...

191
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,640
to find someone nice and live happily.

192
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,440
You said you'd serve her
as the lady of the house.

193
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,370
That was just...

194
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,780
I'll do whatever you ask.

195
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,050
That's done, then.

196
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,520
The CEO won't accept it
if she finds out...

197
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,590
we were planning
a separate promotion in secret.

198
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,230
Right.

199
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,600
She's looking forward
to her brother messing up...

200
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,030
and turning the company upside down.

201
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,530
We can't let her have her way.

202
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,600
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect you and our team.

203
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,610
That's so reassuring.

204
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,340
I'm glad we're on the same side.

205
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
We are on the same side, aren't we?

206
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,950
Of course we are.

207
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,480
We always were, from the very start.

208
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,080
And we always will.

209
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,330
Everyone else went home.

210
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,460
What are you working on
without anyone else?

211
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,570
Yes. It looks like
you're plotting something in secret.

212
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,070
The regular sale is coming up,

213
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,010
so we were discussing
what our team could do...

214
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,570
to make an incredible profit.

215
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,780
What could you two
possibly have to discuss in private?

216
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,650
The vice director's signed contract
would be the best promotion ever.

217
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,250
We still have to discuss the details.

218
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,850
I have a feeling
you're working on something...

219
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,690
to offer up in case
the vice director messes up.

220
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,460
Are you saying I set up
the vice director to fail...

221
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,170
so I could save the day?

222
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
- No?
- Of course not.

223
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,370
You should watch
who you choose to keep close.

224
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,040
People rub off on each other.

225
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,080
It looks like
you've influenced Director Moon.

226
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,750
If that's the case, Ms. Min,
you shouldn't keep Mr. Kim close.

227
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,650
As someone just said,
it matters who you keep close.

228
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,020
- What?
- The bottom line is,

229
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,990
watch how you speak of others.

230
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,830
You shouldn't trust someone so blindly.

231
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,430
Do you never stop to think...

232
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,930
that what you think is real could be fake?

233
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,600
Is what you let Ms. Min see
the real you, then?

234
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,610
Nothing in the world
is completely real or completely fake.

235
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,010
If someone must wear a mask,
they would have a good enough reason.

236
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,160
Ms. Lucia.

237
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,830
You can go home.

238
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,660
What about you?

239
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,300
I'll leave soon too. For tomorrow's sake.

240
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,570
What did you mean when you said...

241
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,210
nothing is completely real
or completely fake?

242
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,340
Oh, that?

243
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,610
I was talking about myself.

244
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,410
No one knows...

245
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,780
why I joined this company.

246
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,150
Why did you tell me
the secret about your parents?

247
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,690
Because I trust you.

248
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,460
And I want to trust you.

249
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,360
I know I can show you my wound...

250
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,700
without having to worry about salt
getting rubbed into it.

251
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,540
What if you end up
getting stabbed in the back...

252
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,370
by someone you believed you could trust,
just like what Mr. Kim said?

253
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,940
Who cares about a little stabbing?

254
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,980
I will trust whoever I want until the end.

255
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,290
Hey, what does that look mean?

256
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,520
That's dangerous.
Men easily misunderstand that look.

257
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,760
"This woman has fallen
head over heels for me."

258
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,960
Don't you think...

259
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,500
you should discuss this plan
with Stella Jang?

260
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,740
She asked to see me.

261
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,180
The idea makes me feel like
I didn't wipe my behind after a poop.

262
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,080
You'll only get turned away
if you bring a fake contract.

263
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,650
Do what he asks, Dad.

264
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,220
Who knows?

265
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,490
Kyung Chae can't know
everything about anything.

266
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,790
Yes, Father.

267
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,290
I don't think this is a good idea.

268
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,090
If you're caught,
Mingang's image will tumble,

269
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,930
and we know what your father would do
with that temper of his.

270
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:08,430
Even so, it's even worse to give up
when I dragged it on for this long.

271
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,130
I don't want him to quit either.

272
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,440
If he were to go to Kyung Chae
and kneel and come clean,

273
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,670
how would that make him look?

274
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,980
Do you think Kyung Chae
ever treated me like a sister-in-law?

275
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,280
She never addresses me properly.

276
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,010
That's her problem.

277
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,680
You married her older brother.

278
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,120
Exactly.

279
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,290
I got the point, so quit the choir.

280
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,860
Here's the contract.

281
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,330
I commissioned the best in the field,
so no one will see through it.

282
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,200
I have some fake products in storage,
so come and get them when you want.

283
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,840
You're my one true mentor.

284
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,140
Father!

285
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,770
I do not want to hug you.

286
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
Thank you, Dad.

287
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,740
A parent will do anything
for their children.

288
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,950
Why won't your tenant show his face?

289
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,580
He's not home yet.

290
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,550
He said he worked at a small company.
He must be overworked.

291
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,390
Oh, he works at
one of those smaller places?

292
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,960
Get him a job at Mingang
if there's an opening.

293
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,530
It's better to work at a bigger company.

294
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,600
Mom. Do you think
Mingang hires just anyone?

295
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,330
He's not just anyone.

296
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,770
He's pretty good-looking,
and he has a great personality.

297
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,740
It would be more believable if you said
Count Dracula offered to give blood.

298
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,210
How do you know his personality?
We barely met.

299
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,010
Some things, you can tell in a day.

300
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,110
He's a really good person.

301
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,580
I'd have married him
to my daughter if I had one more.

302
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,280
(Mingang Distribution)

303
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Here.

304
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,690
The exclusive sales deal
for Helena Louise's products.

305
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,430
Wait.

306
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,770
You actually got it signed?

307
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,200
Did you think I didn't mean what I said?

308
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,510
Take a good look at the bottom.

309
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,680
It has the executive's signature.

310
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,780
Vice Director. You did something,
and this time, it's not a bad thing.

311
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,320
Yes. I didn't believe it at first,

312
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,880
but you got the deal?

313
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,590
I heard it was almost impossible.

314
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,420
Our competitors all had a go,

315
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
but none of them succeeded.

316
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,760
What's wrong with you?

317
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,230
Did you all think I wouldn't manage?

318
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,800
That's not what we mean.

319
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,130
We're surprised
that you did something so impossible.

320
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,930
It's the same thing.

321
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,470
Did you think
I always slacked off and failed?

322
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,000
I understand.

323
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,710
- Let's inform the CEO.
- Give me that.

324
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,980
(Mingang Distribution)

325
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,290
Good for you.

326
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,920
Well done.

327
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,790
You do well when given a chance.

328
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,960
Yes.

329
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,000
Forget how I used to belittle you.
You know what I'm like.

330
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,770
You should stop doing that.

331
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,630
How do you live like that?

332
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,770
You have no friends. That means something.

333
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,010
To be honest, Sun Jae sticks around
because he's after something else.

334
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,580
Who else do you have?

335
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,710
Okay. I'll try to change.

336
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,180
What's up with you?

337
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,520
Are you ill or something?

338
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,160
I do trust you,

339
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,790
but just to be on the safe side,
I need you to sign something.

340
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,860
What's that?

341
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,860
A letter of indemnity.

342
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,440
The CEO and Legal
won't make an issue of it even though...

343
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,870
they know the contract is a forgery.

344
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
They'll think it works in their favor.

345
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,310
What did Ms. Jang say?

346
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,280
I'll meet her today after work.

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,780
Okay.

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,190
I can drive you there.

Yes.

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,030
We never ate together.

362
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,940
I missed lunch.

363
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,670
Do you want me to pass out?

364
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,410
Get ready to leave.

365
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,510
You ready my car.

366
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,460
Hello, Director.

367
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,530
Something came up. I can't make it.

368
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,540
Bye.

369
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,070
Did you have plans with Director Moon?

370
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,280
Why would you do that
when you already spend all day together?

371
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,530
Soo Jung can be
a better daughter sometimes.

372
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,730
I'd wanted to speak with you in private.

373
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,800
You didn't have to worry.

374
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,340
I want to, so let me.

375
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,110
Who are you to tell me how to feel?

376
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Something else came up urgently?
She's not that type of person.

377
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,790
What's your story with Chairman Min?

378
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,590
Are your families sworn enemies?

379
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,660
No.

380
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,290
You don't have to lie to me.

381
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,860
I have a massive grudge myself.

382
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,730
Do you want to know my story?

383
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,210
I'm dead curious about you,
Moon Tae Kyung.

384
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,140
Back when we were both younger,
I hurt Kyung Chae immeasurably.

385
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,320
You must've had a good enough reason.

386
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,680
You wouldn't do anything without a reason.

387
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,720
You defend me
without hearing the full story?

388
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,320
Yes. I'm always on your side.

389
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,800
Even if I were to go back in time,

390
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,030
I'd do the same thing.

391
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,170
I'll do anything for my company.

392
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,070
I know...

393
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,680
what your company means to you.

394
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,650
You took my daughter, who was my life.

395
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,880
It's only fair if you lose
what you consider your life too.

396
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,460
I'm grateful to you for many things.

397
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,590
I didn't do much.

398
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,500
Se Ri is Kyung Chae's life.

399
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,170
And you saved her.

400
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,900
It hurts to think just how much the CEO...

401
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,240
dislikes me.

402
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,880
It's because of me, not you.

403
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,810
I forced her
to break up with the love of her life,

404
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,010
so she can't stand to see me like anyone.

405
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,650
You like me?

406
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,250
Didn't you know?

407
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,120
You came into my heart.

408
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,770
I like this. It will suit you well.

409
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,340
I don't need new clothes.

410
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,610
Accept the gift.

411
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,810
I'm rich and want to flex.

412
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,050
If I need a reason,
it's to thank you for saving Se Ri.

413
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,850
- Can she try it on?
- Of course.

414
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,260
We have other options inside.
Come with me.

415
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,900
How about we say our goodbyes?

416
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,140
This isn't a place for an in-depth chat.

417
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,870
Okay, then.

418
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,780
Mr. Moon.

419
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,920
I have a question.
Would you mind if I asked?

420
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,760
How do you feel about Lucia?

421
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,830
Don't say anything boring...

422
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,860
like she's a good employee
or a competent colleague.

423
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,070
How do you actually feel about her?

424
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,660
You look amazing.

425
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,900
I like everything about the look but this.

426
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,400
That's...

427
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,940
It doesn't suit you at all.

428
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,510
You must wear what suits you,
and that goes for dates too.

429
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,880
I suit you better.

430
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,950
Like that dress.

431
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
You are...

432
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,860
my girlfriend now.

433
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,330
Tell me.

434
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,070
As a man, how do you feel about Lucia?

435
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,280
I have a crush on her.

436
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,490
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

437
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,840
This is bad.

438
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,940
What do we do
if Moon Tae Kyung gets involved too?

439
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,680
I had dinner with Lucia a few days ago.
I wonder if she liked the food.

440
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,580
The scarf she was wearing
didn't suit her at all.

441
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,590
There's nothing we can do
if Ji Seop's shares go to Kyung Chae.

442
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,820
Why did you ask to see me?

443
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,790
Do you still want to date Kyung Chae?

444
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,790
Can't I?

445
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,990
You're actually blackmailing me now.

446
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,160
Is that how it felt?

447
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,230
What's going on?
What was the newsflash about?

448
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,930
Our team might get broken up.

449
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,470
What happens to you, then?

450
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,370
