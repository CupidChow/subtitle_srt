00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,910
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,550
Mr. Ji Seop and his wife are
at a gathering.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,520
Call Se Ri, then.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,420
She snacked a lot earlier today
and isn't hungry.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,160
Then you join us.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,660
You know I eat just one meal a day.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,930
Let's just eat.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,970
Do you think I want to eat with you?

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,370
It will make me sick.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,010
I know it ruins your appetite,
but eat anyway.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,310
Do you know you ruin people's appetites?

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,310
I shudder to think people out there
might think we're full siblings.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,720
We can't go around with a sign saying,
"We're half-sisters,"

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,790
"and we hate each other," can we?

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,760
You want him to stay unconscious,
don't you?

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,630
Even if that were to happen,
you won't get promoted.

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,260
You think you'll become chairwoman soon.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,730
As if I would let that happen.

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,470
Keep climbing as if you deserve more.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,700
I'll crush you to pieces.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,510
Kyung Chae won't let it show,

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,680
but I bet she doesn't care
whether Father wakes up or not.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,580
You're right.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,090
She'll be celebrating to herself
that she's next in line to take over.

25
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,660
If Soo Jung is ambitious,

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,860
Kyung Chae is even more so in every way.

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,760
They'll fight tooth and nail
to become chairwoman.

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,800
Do you think I'll let them?
I'm no pushover.

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,870
I won't let either of them
take over Mingang.

30
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,240
You should've done better sooner.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,340
Who knows?
You could even be chairman by now.

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,610
The war has just begun.

33
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,180
That's why I need you here
to watch how he does.

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,280
Okay, I get the plan.
But can we go home now?

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,820
He won't wake up any time soon.

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,060
You're right about that.

37
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,720
Let's go.

38
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,050
(Mingang Distribution)

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,320
Hi, everyone.

40
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,790
Ms. Lucia and I will go to sign
a new contract with a supplier.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Rumor has it that Judo and Hangeon...

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,230
are contacting them too.

43
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,970
I heard that too.

44
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,100
Can they poach a company
that does business with us already?

45
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,170
They haven't poached them yet.

46
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,910
It's a matter of time.

47
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,310
The rumor is pretty old.

48
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,150
Will they switch to Judo or Hangeon?

49
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,520
Nothing is final yet,

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,580
so stop getting too excited
and get back to work.

51
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,720
Ms. Lucia. Get ready to head out.

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
Okay.

53
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,330
I guess the chairman's condition
is worse than I thought.

54
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,460
He's not back at work yet.

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,430
We can't tell
because his family won't talk.

56
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,400
They're worried about the stock index
and the overall company image.

57
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,840
He'll come back, won't he? He's strong.

58
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,580
What does the chairman mean to you?

59
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,450
He's my boss. The writer of my paycheck?

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,090
Why do you ask?

61
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,720
I sometimes wonder
if you think of him differently.

62
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,430
He's not that different from anyone else,

63
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,560
but I personally want him...

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,700
to remain chairman for a long time.

65
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,340
Only then can I make him pay
for what he did to my parents.

66
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,240
What about you?

67
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,710
I feel the same.

68
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,780
That's why I helped him when I found him.

69
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,350
He must fall from the highest peak...

70
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,490
because that will hurt the most.

71
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,890
Kyung Chae won't let it show,

72
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,100
but I bet she doesn't care
whether Father wakes up or not.

73
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,100
If Soo Jung is ambitious,

74
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,300
Kyung Chae is even more so in every way.

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,600
They'll fight tooth and nail
to become chairwoman.

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,310
Do you think I'll let them?
I'm no pushover.

77
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,610
I won't let either of them
take over Mingang.

78
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,650
My kids are all so disappointing.

79
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
Whether I live or die,
all they care about is taking over.

80
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,720
Should I be relieved
they're not praying...

81
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,190
that I die sooner?

82
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,400
The person you called is unavailable.

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,600
- Connecting to voicemail.
- What the heck?

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,970
You will be charged after the beep.

85
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,890
Hello?

86
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,020
What took so long to pick up?
What were you doing?

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,520
Were you still asleep?

88
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,760
I wasn't still asleep.

89
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,760
I was thinking
because I had something to think about.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,760
Quit thinking
and get to the hospital right away.

91
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,400
Do I have to be there?

92
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
You can call the nurse,
who will fill you in.

93
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,570
I called to ask already.
He's just the same.

94
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,870
All is well, then.

95
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,140
I said it's important
who's there when Father wakes up.

96
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,980
If you were him, wouldn't you...

97
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,480
appreciate the person
who stayed to look after you?

98
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,120
Fine. I'll get over there.

99
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,690
Darn it.

100
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,860
Why did you call me over
during a meeting? Is it urgent?

101
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,430
You got my father's will notarized,
didn't you?

102
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,840
Why do you ask?

103
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,970
Did you or did you not? Answer that first.

104
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,310
What if I did?

105
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,540
I knew it.

106
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,750
What did it say?

107
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,120
That violates the Attorney-at-Law Act.
It could ruin my career.

108
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
I won't ruin anything for you.

109
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,790
Who would know if I took a peek in secret?

110
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,720
Let me take a look
while my father is in the hospital.

111
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,460
He might have been lucky enough
to get rushed into surgery this time.

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,460
Who's to say
he'll be that lucky next time?

113
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,000
So you'll take a look at the will...

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,030
in case the chairman dies?

115
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,470
If he dies...

116
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,070
That's a distant future.

117
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,510
From what I heard,

118
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,610
a possible aftereffect
of the brain surgery is dementia.

119
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,350
If Father is ruled...

120
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,150
legally incompetent,
that will mean the worst for our family.

121
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,020
He wants to see the will?

122
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,530
He seems to consider
the possibility of the chairman's death.

123
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,000
What will he do once he reads the will?

124
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,460
Will he fake it
if he doesn't like what it says?

125
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,030
Doesn't he realize that asking me
would mean I would tell you,

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,270
or doesn't he even care?

127
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,110
His simple mind
is what makes him charming.

128
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,240
Is the chairman that poorly?

129
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,880
It's not that bad.

130
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,350
But he did get brain surgery,

131
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,020
so I put him on a drip to rest.

132
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,390
Ji Seop and Soo Jung don't know.

133
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,220
That's good to know.

134
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,760
Is it really a good thing?

135
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Pardon?

136
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,790
Never mind.

137
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,260
If Ji Seop is that antsy,
Soo Jung will do something as well.

138
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,630
You handle her for me.

139
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,540
Our existing contract hasn't yet expired,

140
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,180
but I don't see why we shouldn't
sign a new one in advance.

141
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,880
As you can see,
the conditions haven't changed...

142
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,180
from our previous deal.

143
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,950
You never know what will happen.

144
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,020
Aren't you being a bit too hasty?

145
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,590
You've done business
with Mingang for many years.

146
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,070
Read through the contract
and call if you have any requests.

147
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,700
We'll try to incorporate them
as best we can.

148
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,240
(Shipping Consignment Agreement, Renewal)

149
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,840
Let's negotiate
once the existing contract expires.

150
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,710
Are you...

151
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,010
not interested...

152
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,180
in renewing the contract?

153
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,820
I can't say until our deal expires.
How can I be sure right now?

154
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,090
Who would know if not you?

155
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,960
Aren't you in charge
of the contract renewal?

156
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,400
I can't give you an answer just yet.

157
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,160
Please leave.

158
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,170
I don't know...

159
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,340
why you're saying that,
but would you reconsider...

160
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,270
No. It's fine.

161
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,680
I hope to hear your decision
once our contract expires.

162
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,480
Goodbye.

163
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,520
We can go.

164
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,230
I don't think we should leave like this.

165
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,860
What else can we do?

166
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,200
What can we do
when he's not interested in signing?

167
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,840
Mingang assumes he'll renew the deal.

168
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,040
I can't force him to.

169
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,870
You saw him.

170
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,380
I don't know what he knows,
but he was dead confident.

171
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,120
Do you think the rumors
were true and he signed...

172
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,920
with Judo or Hangeon already?

173
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,720
I don't know if he did or is waiting to,

174
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,060
but it's pretty clear he's not interested
in doing business with us anymore.

175
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,160
What do we do, then?

176
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,430
We don't do anything.

177
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,400
We shouldn't beg someone who doesn't care.

178
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,850
Why didn't you call? I was dead curious.

179
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,950
How was my father?

180
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,450
He was just the same.

181
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,190
Something is really wrong with him
if he's still unconscious.

182
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,960
Did you go to the hospital or not?

183
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,100
Sorry. I was too tired.

184
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,200
Why didn't you go?

185
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,300
I have lots of other stuff to do.

186
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,070
I had to go to Pilates and get a manicure.

187
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,440
Oh Ja Kyung!

188
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,810
You'll never be a chairman's wife
if you're this uncooperative!

189
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,910
Nothing will happen to him overnight.

190
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,620
Don't worry. I'll visit tomorrow.

191
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,350
Darn you.

192
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,890
The vice director asked me to tell him
what the chairman's will said.

193
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,960
What do you want?

194
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,900
Ji Seop will think
Father's condition is his opportunity.

195
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,030
Are you any different?

196
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,530
Will you believe me if I say so?

197
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,840
I know exactly what you think of me.

198
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,780
My father won't go down this easily.

199
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,550
His will is a matter
for the distant future.

200
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,620
He will come back to work.

201
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,190
But he won't be the same as before.

202
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,660
A near-death experience
is bound to make you...

203
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,960
much more cautious.

204
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,560
I know anything I tell you
will reach Kyung Chae on the same day.

205
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,400
Why talk to me, then?

206
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,300
Because I don't care if she knows.

207
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,640
If the chairman returns to work...

208
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,470
and has a new attitude or mindset...

209
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,180
and tells you
he wants to amend his written will,

210
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,840
tell me in advance.

211
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,350
Can you do that much?

212
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,250
I made some milk tea.

213
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,020
What paintings are these?

214
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,230
You haven't seen them, have you?

215
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,230
I rarely get them out
because they're too precious to look at.

216
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,800
I don't know about art,

217
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,100
but these look great.

218
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,400
Who painted them?

219
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,770
My son.

220
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,310
I didn't tell you,

221
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,010
but he was an artist.

222
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,010
He had a promising future.

223
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,220
Quite a few art galleries
wanted to exhibit his works.

224
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,160
It's a shame to keep them hidden.

225
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,260
You should put on an exhibition
and let people appreciate them.

226
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,760
Later.

227
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,730
When the time is right.

228
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,950
I wonder what you'd have become...

229
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,790
if you got to grow up.

230
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,460
(Baek Mi So)

231
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,800
Mi So.

232
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,730
You liked learning languages.
Would you have become a diplomat?

233
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,040
You were a talented writer.
Would you have written novels?

234
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,480
Whatever job you chose,

235
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,250
you'd have been great.

236
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,560
I miss you,

237
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,230
darling daughter.

238
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,650
"If you do not read or write,
do not eat either."

239
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Calligraphy isn't like you at all.

240
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,650
You're not a nobleman.

241
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,760
I can't stand not reading or writing.

242
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,430
I'm a noble through and through.

243
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,660
I was born into
a whole different class from you.

244
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh, were you?

245
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,030
They say a changed man is a dead man.

246
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Why don't you go back
to reciting your mantra?

247
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,200
Money's rolling in.

248
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,240
Anything and everything in the world
that looks like cash...

249
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,140
is rolling into Pan Sool's lap.

250
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,840
- Cash... Money...
- Cash... That's enough.

251
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,250
I'm trying to better myself
by practicing calligraphy,

252
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,450
so quit souring the mood
and grind the ink brick.

253
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,120
It's a stick, not a brick.

254
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,620
It used to be a brick.

255
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,690
Let's see...

256
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,690
I'm just not allowed to start my art.

257
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,060
Hello?

258
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,130
It's Bulgwang-dong's Mandarin Fish.

259
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,630
Yes, fishy boy. What's up?

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You know Jogeon Logistics' CEO Jo, right?

261
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,410
He borrowed from you once.

262
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,040
I know the man. Does he need more money?

263
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
Oh, really? We can meet up.

264
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,450
Okay, bye.

265
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,610
Someone needs to spend?

266
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,150
Everyone has a thousand reasons to spend.

267
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,950
I need to go out. Get things ready.

268
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,150
Iron my pants...

269
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,520
and shine my shoes
so a fly would slip if it landed.

270
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,860
I'm waiting for someone
to view the empty room.

271
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,230
A pretty woman shouldn't want
to make money.

272
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,960
I'll earn for us both.
Meanwhile, you should work on your beauty.

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
- Cash and money.
- And beauty.

274
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,370
- Cash and beauty.
- Cash and beauty.

275
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,640
He'll be here soon.

276
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,140
He'll loan you the money right away,

277
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,410
but the interest rate is a killer.
Are you sure about this?

278
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,450
I don't have a choice.

279
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,550
I made contact, at least.

280
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,220
Oh Pan Sool is here.

281
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,490
Cash and money...

282
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,530
Hello, sir. You remember me, right?

283
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,400
Let's skip the greetings
since we're all busy people.

284
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,470
Is this the guy?

285
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,830
Hello.

286
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,240
Let's sit down.

287
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,770
Two handsome men get to do business.

288
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,180
How much do you need?

289
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,650
I take some from the top,
and the monthly interest is 28 percent.

290
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,280
Yes. I heard about that already.

291
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,450
What I love the most is collateral.

292
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,790
What I hate the most is zero collateral.

293
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,260
If you have nothing to put up,
I'm getting up to leave.

294
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,520
Wait. Come on, sir.

295
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,370
It's the deed to some property in the US.

296
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,640
I haven't seen a deed
in English in a while.

297
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,010
Just a moment.

298
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Sorry.

299
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,250
What is it, Your Highness?

300
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,550
The tenant wants us to reduce
the monthly rent. What should I say?

301
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,190
Are you that crazy about the rent?

302
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,120
Your Highness, the rent isn't the issue.

303
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,990
Your King is busy with business.
Let's talk later.

304
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,400
Bye.

305
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,430
What's the matter?

306
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,900
We have a spare room
since our daughter got married,

307
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,800
and my wife wants to rent it out.

308
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,410
She's so thoughtless.

309
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,510
- I see.
- Well.

310
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,140
- Let's continue with our dialogue.
- Sure.

311
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,210
So this is a property deed.

312
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,780
"This, the, of, on,"

313
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,650
"today, the, many..."

314
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,120
I recognize a lot of the words.

315
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,960
Director Moon.

316
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,600
Why haven't I heard
about the renewed contract?

317
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,070
Don't you know you must
hand it over to us once it's signed?

318
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,040
It's not yet signed.

319
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,640
Why do you keep going out, then?

320
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,940
They always renewed the contract
before the previous one expired...

321
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
Wait.

322
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,610
Did they refuse to sign it?

323
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,280
Our current contract still stands.

324
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,920
I know that, okay?

325
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,850
I'm asking why
they haven't renewed it this time,

326
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,460
when they always did
around this time of year.

327
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,720
I can handle it.

328
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,590
Don't you think
you don't have to be this involved?

329
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,760
It's my job to review every contract...

330
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,830
and legal issue that arises in business.

331
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,540
No contract can exist
without going through my team,

332
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,110
and business is carried out
based on contracts.

333
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,470
Does that answer your question?

334
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,780
Even so, this job is mine, not yours.

335
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,780
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

336
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,620
You'd say that.

337
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,620
If it so happens...

338
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,950
that the deal isn't renewed...

339
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,490
or we lose that business partner
to a competitor,

340
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,630
be prepared to pay.

341
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,460
The chairman must be so pleased...

342
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,300
to have a loyal servant like you.

343
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,000
If you get that,

344
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,040
you should start trying harder.

345
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,940
To put it simply,
you need to be worth your pay.

346
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,930
Goodness.

347
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,250
Oh, dear.

348
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,020
My gosh.

349
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,920
Why do I feel so dizzy?

350
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,090
Chairman. Wake up.

351
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,930
Chairman! Wake up!

352
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,670
Chairman. Wake up.

353
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,600
We'll reach the hospital soon.
Don't worry.

354
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,970
Chairman. Do you hear me?

355
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,820
I remember everything now.

356
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,880
At last.

357
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,930
(Mingang Distribution)

358
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,830
Is the CEO not in?

359
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,030
As you can see.

360
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,100
I'll come back another time.

361
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,140
Too bad.

362
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,640
You saved the chairman's life,

363
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,510
and no one knows.

364
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,980
I never considered that,

365
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,720
but thank you for reminding me.

366
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,520
You must have a lot to think about.

367
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,590
Or should I say a lot to calculate?

368
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,730
I don't know what your point is,

369
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,660
but are you aware
this is workplace bullying?

370
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,830
How dare you say that?

371
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,570
I have zero intention of bullying you.

372
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,670
I'm the one who feels uncomfortable.

373
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,870
You feel uncomfortable because of me?

374
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,880
Think about it.

375
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,950
You look exactly like the woman...

376
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,820
I used to love,
and you're always within my sight.

377
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,550
Wouldn't I feel uncomfortable?

378
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,760
You look so much like her,
you'd pass for her.

379
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,890
"The woman you used to love?"

380
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,300
Yes. The woman I used to love.

381
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,070
She thinks I used her
and then ditched her,

382
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
but not at all.

383
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,870
I did what any ordinary man...

384
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,940
with a bright future
and ambition would do.

385
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,580
I did nothing so bad
that I should be labeled...

386
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,010
with crass words like "betrayal."

387
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,520
Though, of course,
that means nothing to you.

388
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,720
You're right.

389
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,420
I don't know why I should stand here...

390
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,530
listening to your third-rate love story
that's so old it's withered.

391
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,860
If there must be a reason,
let's say it's because you look like her.

392
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,500
I don't care where she is
and what she's doing now,

393
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,140
but I feel a bit differently
about you, Ms. Lucia.

394
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,610
Are you interested in me or something?

395
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,950
It's an interest of a different kind.

396
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,110
Whatever kind it is, it's not welcome.

397
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,650
I'm interested in other things.

398
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,890
Watch it, Kim Sun Jae.

399
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,920
Do you think I came back to take you on?

400
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,460
Baek Sul Hee. Do you enjoy wearing a mask?

401
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,830
You think you rule the world
because no one recognizes you?

402
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,670
That world won't last much longer.

403
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,300
I can't exactly get plastic surgery.

404
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,010
Hearing you tell me
I look like someone is pretty displeasing.

405
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,010
I wish my memory would fade,

406
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,010
but every single detail
is burned clearly in my mind.

407
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,380
Having too clear a memory can be tiring.

408
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,830
I made this and that,

409
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,000
but I'm not sure
if the chairman will like it.

410
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,170
I'm sorry to be in your debt.

411
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,410
How much does this cost? I'll pay for it.

412
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,810
Don't say that.

413
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,180
It hurts to hear you say you want to pay.

414
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,720
Thank you very much.

415
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,520
Is the chairman awake?

416
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,130
Not yet. That's why I'm worried.

417
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,930
Oh, dear.

418
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,460
What's wrong with Dad?

419
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,900
He should've woken up long ago.
Why is he still unconscious?

420
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,310
Not everything in life makes sense.

421
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,270
You went to see him.

422
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,980
Can't you tell from what you saw?

423
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,580
How could I tell? I'm not a doctor.

424
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,180
I should visit him, then.

425
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,020
Why did you want to meet here?

426
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,020
You could've come to my office.

427
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,590
You're so you.

428
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,360
There's a reason we should meet here.

429
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,800
What are you doing here?

430
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,800
I called her.

431
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,540
It's an emergency meeting.

432
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,910
The chairman position will be vacant
if Father doesn't wake up.

433
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,710
We need an acting chairman.

434
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,310
Why wouldn't Father wake up?

435
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,080
Do you hear yourself?

436
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,610
When was his surgery?

437
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,550
It's serious if he's still unconscious.

438
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,850
Ja Kyung and I went to see him,
and it looked like he'd be there a while.

439
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,460
If there should be an acting chairman,

440
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,460
shouldn't it be someone from my department
since we're the same legal entity?

441
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,990
So you'll be acting chairman?

442
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,000
The acting chairman should be
from the same corporate body.

443
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,430
That's a basic rule.

444
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,300
Let's forget that for now...

445
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,030
and get our story straight.

446
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,400
I found Father, who had passed out,

447
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,940
and I took him to the hospital.

448
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,840
Let's say I came to his rescue
like a superhero...

449
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,310
in his time of need.

450
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,840
Have you become a novelist now?

451
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,980
That is so childish.

452
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,680
I don't know much about you,
but you are consistent, Ji Seop.

453
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,020
You're consistently immature.

454
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,990
Dad!

455
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,290
Did he go somewhere?

456
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,900
I don't know. He was unconscious.

457
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,400
Did he wake up?

458
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,900
Where did the patient go?

459
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,140
He was discharged,
so he went home, I guess?

460
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,510
He didn't come home.

461
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,180
What is going on?

462
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,710
Where did he go, then?

463
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,990
I need to earn brownie points,
and that will benefit you too.

464
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,750
Think about it.

465
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,160
If I become chairman,
you two can sit on either side of me.

466
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,760
We can take over Mingang Distribution,

467
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,400
get rid of the board,
and do everything ourselves.

468
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,130
What does that look mean?

469
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,040
What do you mean Father is missing?

470
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,890
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

471
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,640
He didn't say where he was going?

472
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,810
No.

473
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,040
It might be for the better.
Why don't you make plans...

474
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,210
for when the chairman returns?

475
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,380
Do you have any biological children?

476
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,320
My blood boils whenever I see her face.

477
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,350
He's persistent and cunning.

478
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,650
Once he latches on, he never lets go.

479
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,090
He will find out who I am.

480
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,460
If you mistreat any of my people again,

481
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,990
I will take action.

482
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,030
It sounds like you're saying she's yours.

483
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,500
Lucia. How are you tied to Lawyer Kim?
