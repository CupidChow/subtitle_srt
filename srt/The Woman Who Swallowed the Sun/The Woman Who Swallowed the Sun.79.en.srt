00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,840
(Episode 79)

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,710
(Mingang Distribution)

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,150
Have you made a decision?

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,450
I plan to schedule the broadcast
as soon as the products are selected.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,920
The online products are mostly fine,

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,520
but among the products
from the chain store team,

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,360
let's remove
the spicy seafood stew meal kit.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,860
Why?

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,060
Director Min Soo Jung
specifically requested that product.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,970
No matter how I look at it,
I don't think it's right for broadcast.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,100
Unsuitable for the broadcast?

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,910
Retail's first rule. Sell what you get,
no matter how odd it seems.

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,810
To just say you can't or won't do it
without a convincing reason...

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,550
That's just not acceptable.

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,080
Wouldn't you agree?

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,520
Of course, if you really can't do it,
we can take it off the list.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,750
But then again,

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,420
this isn't just any project.
The CEO position is on the line.

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,030
It just looks petty.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,560
Trying to play it safe like this.

21
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,700
No. We'll do it.

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,970
Don't take it out.
We'll proceed as planned.

23
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,200
Come to think of it,
there's no reason not to.

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,340
Especially since the CEO position
is on the line.

25
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,180
I like that fighting spirit.

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,380
I have a feeling this broadcast
is going to be a huge success.

27
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,020
Alright, let's each choose our products.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,450
- I'll take...
- Hold on.

29
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,920
How about we choose the products
for each other?

30
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,390
What, so you can pick a product
that won't sell?

31
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,330
Oh, is that what you were planning to do?

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,470
At least I don't let my personal feelings
get in the way of business, unlike you.

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,570
And since you get to pick my product
just like I pick yours,

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,470
what could possibly be fairer than that?

35
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,980
I don't know what you're up to,
but I won't let you get your way.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,090
Alright, let's do this instead.

37
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,390
Neither of us will be involved
in the product selection.

38
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,130
We'll select our products strictly
through a random drawing.

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,230
- How about it?
- What?

40
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,030
Every single one of the products
on this list...

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,900
was from a supplier with a sales contract
in good faith with Mingang.

42
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,380
To label them as hits or misses
before we've even tried...

43
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,140
is a betrayal of that trust,
don't you think?

44
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,250
Let's not score them or rank them.

45
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,960
How about we leave it up to fate
to decide which products we sell?

46
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,630
Which product will be the star
of our first broadcast?

47
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,970
She completely outmaneuvered me.

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,680
If the products are chosen by a drawing,
my hands will be tied.

49
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,680
I see that.
She's smarter than I gave her credit for.

50
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,980
What do we do now?

51
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,850
I shouldn't have said anything.
Now it's going to cost me.

52
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,560
I can't just refuse to sell
whatever product I draw.

53
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,360
If she's going to play smart,
then we have to be smarter.

54
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,430
I'll make sure she has no choice
but to draw the spicy seafood stew kit.

55
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,470
- Is that even possible?
- Don't worry.

56
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,070
I'll stop at nothing to make it happen.

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,310
But...

58
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,710
How did you know
she was allergic to seafood?

59
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Oh...

60
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,680
I think I overheard her
mention it in passing once.

61
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,720
Kim Sun Jae knows, doesn't he?

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,960
Then he's going to make you
choose that on purpose...

63
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,190
to cause a disaster during the broadcast.

64
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,260
He knows that if things go wrong,
I could end up in the hospital.

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,400
They're such terrible people.

66
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,540
To think they'd stoop so low to be CEO
by playing with someone's life.

67
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,470
If we do a random draw for the products,
that won't happen.

68
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,040
Still, you never know.

69
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Make sure you book a host for that day.

70
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,180
And if you do draw the spicy seafood stew,

71
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,350
have the host taste it on the broadcast
while you don't take a single bite.

72
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,350
I will.

73
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,690
The products
for our first live broadcast...

74
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,930
will be selected randomly for fairness,
so please keep that in mind.

75
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,260
Vice Director,
please make the preparations.

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
A random drawing? What's the big deal?
We should just sell whatever we want.

77
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,540
This way it is fair.

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,210
Jung Won and Yun Seo
will be supporting Min Kyung Chae.

79
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,010
And Tae Gon and I will be
supporting Lucia.

80
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,910
Also, book a host for the broadcast
well in advance.

81
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,150
Double-check to make sure
they won't back out on the day.

82
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,350
Since this is Mingang Distribution's
first live commerce event,

83
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,190
let's nail this and show
some serious results.

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
- Yes!
- Yes.

85
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,670
Where are you headed?

86
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,510
What's it to you?

87
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,240
So what if he's the director?

88
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,080
Am I his personal errand boy or what?
Who does he think I am to boss around?

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,480
What did Director Moon ask you to do?

90
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,220
None of your business.

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,340
Darn it. Do I really have to do
this menial work as the deputy director?

92
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,410
This is something for an intern,
or he should just do it himself.

93
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,120
Anyway, I really can't stand
Moon Tae Kyung.

94
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,190
Darn it!

95
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,900
Does it feel strange, being back
at the company after all this time?

96
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,640
Not at all. This is the company you built.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,810
Your passion and hard work are all around,
so it feels just like home to me.

98
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,980
If only my kids were half
as considerate as you.

99
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,580
So, how are preparations
for the broadcast coming along?

100
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm doing my best, but I'm not so sure.

101
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,150
Kyung Chae is an expert in this field,

102
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,890
so, of course, she'll do an amazing job.

103
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,220
And you're not?

104
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,790
Everyone knows what you're capable of...

105
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,960
with your experience in the US
and what you've shown here.

106
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,800
Well, I appreciate you thinking so.

107
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,270
I'm not trying to be greedy.

108
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you talking about?
If you're going to compete, you must win.

109
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,310
You know the saying,
"The position chooses the person."

110
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,740
It's not that Kyung Chae and I
are competing for the CEO spot.

111
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,850
I believe
the position itself will go to...

112
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,120
whichever one of us is the better fit.

113
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,860
So, what's your take on it?

114
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,800
Between Ms. Kyung Chae and Madam Jung,
who do you think is a better fit for CEO?

115
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,130
Well...

116
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,970
To be honest,
neither of them is right for the job.

117
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,180
I mean, if anyone should be CEO,
it's my husband.

118
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,680
That's a bit of a stretch,
don't you think?

119
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,280
Excuse me? Why is that a stretch?

120
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,020
What's wrong with my husband?

121
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,880
He just hasn't had the right opportunity.

122
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,020
My husband would do a fantastic job
if he were just given the chance.

123
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,590
Well, if you put it that way,
I suppose so.

124
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,300
Manager Gong, the way you say that
sounds a bit off.

125
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,900
What, are you saying my husband
gets no respect at work?

126
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,600
You have no idea how important his job is.

127
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,380
Oh, darling, what's up?

128
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,380
I was just wondering what you were doing.

129
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,010
So what are you up to? Aren't you busy?

130
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,720
Aren't you getting ready
for the broadcast?

131
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,120
Preparation, my foot!
It's not like I'm the main event here.

132
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,960
What are you talking about?

133
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,560
If this broadcast is a huge success,

134
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,360
it's your chance to completely
win back your father's favor.

135
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,600
I know that! But an opportunity has to
actually come my way.

136
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,130
You have to seize it.
Who's going to hand you an opportunity?

137
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,940
I have to be able to seize it first.
I'm over here folding paper.

138
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,010
Why are you folding paper?

139
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,080
Never mind. It's complicated.

140
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,210
Darling, what's gotten into you?

141
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,050
You went all the way to work
just to sit there folding paper?

142
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,990
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

(Mingang Distribution)

144
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,070
Why are you here again?

145
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,370
I told you not to come without a reason.

146
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
I'm not here for you,
so mind your own business.

147
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,840
You're not here for that again, are you?

148
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,280
Go home now.

149
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,080
Stop it.
Anyone would think you're my mother.

150
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,590
Why are you always meddling
in my business?

151
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,750
Are you done talking back?

152
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,720
If I don't look out for you, who will?

153
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,430
- Go on, get out of here.
- Let go of her.

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,940
- You let go.
- I said, let go of her!

155
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,710
- I told you to let go.
- What is this spectacle?

156
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,040
- Se Ri, let's go.
- I know, right?

157
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,510
- Go home now.
- Doesn't this look familiar?

158
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,580
- What's wrong with you?
- The Judgment of Solomon?

159
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,550
Solomon was a judge?

160
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,790
It's moments like these
when I feel like we're worlds apart.

161
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,490
I told you to go home.

162
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,490
- You're hurting her!
- Seriously, what's your problem?

163
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,630
Se Ri, hurry!

164
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,830
- Go home.
- Come here.

165
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,970
Get over here!

166
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,800
Stop it!

167
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,270
Let's go.

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,520
So, is this your office now?

170
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,090
Not yet. It's just a temporary setup.

171
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,460
Next thing you know,
you'll be the real CEO, right?

172
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,870
Aren't you upset
that I took Kyung Chae's position?

173
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,310
I don't know.

174
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,540
You can be honest with me.

175
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,610
If you're not okay with this,
I won't fight for this position.

176
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,310
I'll give it right back to Kyung Chae.

177
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,120
That's ridiculous.

178
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,920
Don't do that.
It's not like she would thank you for it.

179
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,590
You should compete fair and square.
The most capable person should get it.

180
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,060
Thank you for saying that.
That's my daughter.

181
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,330
I'm so lucky to have you as a daughter.

182
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,560
That woman is meeting Se Ri in my office.
In my office, of all places.

183
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,200
I'm sure she took her there on purpose.

184
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,730
She knows what that office means to me,
so she's rubbing it in my face.

185
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,730
Even if that's true,
there's nothing you can do.

186
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,140
If you go bursting in there now,

187
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,070
you'll only push Se Ri further away.

188
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,340
The truth is, she trusts that woman
more than you right now.

189
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,280
That's what scares me.

190
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,480
I'm afraid this isn't just a phase.

191
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,350
What do you mean by that?

192
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,290
At first, I wasn't worried
about Se Ri changing because of her.

193
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,190
In fact, I thought it was a good thing.

194
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,920
I thought she'd be a train wreck for life,
but then she started to change.

195
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,190
So what are you so worried about now?

196
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
That I'm going to lose her.

197
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,820
We're all set on our end.

198
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,520
We've booked a host,

199
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,660
and I'll be handling the filming myself,
so there won't be any issues there.

200
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,700
The drawing is tomorrow.
When is the first broadcast set for?

201
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,530
This weekend.
We figured weekends get more traffic.

202
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,000
That's the schedule for now.

203
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,370
Why?

204
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,410
Is that too soon?
We can push it back a few days.

205
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,510
No, let's stick to the schedule.

206
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,310
We just need to meet
our host beforehand...

207
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,650
to get on the same page.

208
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,520
Okay.
Once we know which product we're selling,

209
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,350
we'll have a meeting right away
and start on the script.

210
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,520
Sounds good.

211
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,520
Sleep well.

212
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,830
Sweet dreams.

213
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,790
Hope you draw a good product.

214
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,160
The CEO position is on the line,

215
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,600
so this has to go well.

216
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,400
I don't care what product I get,

217
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,740
I just hope I don't draw something
I'm allergic to.

218
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,270
Statistically, the chances
of that happening are low.

219
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,910
And even on the off chance you do get it,

220
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,280
the host can do the taste test,
so don't worry about it.

221
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,060
- Who is it at this hour?
- Oh, someone from work.

222
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,960
We were just discussing
tomorrow's schedule.

223
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,160
Oh, that reminds me.

224
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,330
I heard you were choosing the product
for the broadcast in a random draw.

225
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,400
Yes.

226
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,170
Inside this raffle box are...

227
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,240
products from
Mingang Distribution's online platform,

228
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,650
including many of our most popular items,

229
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,080
and top-sellers from our very own
offline store, Home and Mart.

230
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,050
We've placed the names of these products
into the box at random.

231
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,820
Our live commerce event
kicks off this weekend.

232
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,520
We're all eager to see...

233
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,660
what products will be featured
on our historic premiere...

234
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,900
and which will lead to explosive sales.

235
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,430
I'm so excited to find out.

236
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,400
Now, to ensure a fair
and transparent selection process,

237
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,710
our two friendly competitors will draw
for their products themselves.

238
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,640
All right, first up, Min Kyung Chae
from our Online Business Team.

239
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,350
Go ahead and draw!

240
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,060
It's the new Giadio Fall, Winter Duck Down
Puffer Jacket.

241
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,370
Just keep it hidden in your hand
and pretend you just picked it.

242
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,060
All right, what product will it be?
I'm on the edge of my seat.

243
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,400
Goodness!

244
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,860
It's the new Giadio Fall, Winter Duck Down
Puffer Jacket!

245
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,840
This product needs no introduction.
It's one of our company's million-sellers.

246
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,640
Last year, it sold out in a flash
and just couldn't keep up with the demand.

247
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,420
All right, next up, we have Jung Lucia.

248
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,830
Oh, and I'm not using her full title yet
since her appointment isn't final.

249
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,190
Lucia.

250
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,600
Go ahead and pick!

251
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,380
All right.

252
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,080
All right, what product
will it be this time?

253
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,160
Oh! It's a product from Home and Mart!

254
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,130
A spicy seafood stew meal kit!

255
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,410
Wait a minute.

256
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,340
How is this possible?

257
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,880
I know, right?

258
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,840
With so many products to choose from,

259
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,910
what are the odds of picking that one?

260
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,720
Something's not right.

261
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,720
Kim Sun Jae...

262
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,690
might have pulled some strings.

263
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,290
Those two...

264
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,530
looked like they already knew the outcome.

265
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,700
Didn't they seem a little too calm?

266
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,000
Enjoy your meal!

267
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,710
- Excuse me.
- Oh, yes.

268
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,940
- One goat stew, please.
- You got it.

269
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,950
Gosh, there are so many customers.
This is killing me.

270
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,480
So you're complaining?

271
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,220
That's what they call
not knowing how good you have it.

272
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,560
Everyone else is crying about
how bad business is these days.

273
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,530
What in the world are you talking about?

274
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,790
I wasn't complaining.
Can't I say anything?

275
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,170
Wait a second.
Isn't our in-laws' broadcast today?

276
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,570
It's not time yet.

277
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,640
Ja Kyung said
she'd call us when it started.

278
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,940
They'll do anything to make a buck.

279
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,740
Now they're even doing broadcasts
to rake in the dough.

280
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,940
If you ask me,
our in-laws are shameless money-grubbers.

281
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,510
Oh, not this again!
That's the pot calling the kettle black.

282
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,780
And what about you?
You're the one who's obsessed with money.

283
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,590
You sweet thing.

284
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,190
How about I make you get implants
for your teeth?

285
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,390
- Paper!
- Again...

286
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,390
Scissors!

287
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,690
- Rock!
- Paper!

288
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,860
- Scissors!
- That's...

289
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,860
- Paper.
- enough.

291
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,760
The show host isn't here yet?

292
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,530
I know. There's no way she'd be this late.

293
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,340
The phone you are calling is turned off.
You will be connected to voicemail.

294
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,840
Her phone is off.

295
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,040
Do you have any other contact information?

296
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,750
No.

297
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,490
Wait, excuse me, Ms. Show Host.

298
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,800
Hello.
I'm Kim Sun Jae from Mingang's Legal Team.

299
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,630
Oh, okay.

300
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,270
What's your fee for the live broadcast?

301
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,940
Why are you asking?

302
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,480
Whatever your fee is,
this is probably five times that.

303
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,550
Wait, why are you giving this to me?

304
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,120
You don't need to know why.

305
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,350
Instead, you're going to do
exactly as I say.

306
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,190
Get back in the driver's seat.

307
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,690
Turn it around and drive home.

308
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,530
Then turn off your phone and go dark.

309
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,060
And that's it!

310
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,600
Simple, right?

311
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,100
So you want me to skip the broadcast?

312
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,570
Bingo!

313
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,470
Don't worry,
I'll take care of any legal issues.

314
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,240

323
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,180
Thank you for joining us for
Mingang Distribution's first broadcast.

324
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,650
For our first broadcast, we have
a very special product for you today.

325
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,190
It's the new Fall Winter item from Giadio,

326
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,960
a duck down puffer jacket.

327
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,990
Ta-da!

328
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,800

It's the jacket you all know and love!

is a brand you can always count on."

"I couldn't get one last year
because it sold out."

333

with this year's new model.

perfectly prepped ingredients.

and start cooking right away.

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,610
It's been ten minutes,
and the viewer count is...

340
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,950
Hold on.

341
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,480
Ten thousand?

342
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,890
Is this for real?

343
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,890
It is! This is amazing!
And the chat is flying by!

344
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,800
Wait, at this rate, will we sell out
before the broadcast is over?

345
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,760
It's definitely looking that way.

346
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,570
Director.

347
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,440
We can't compete with their viewers,
and our chat is dead.

348
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,540
What should we do?

349
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,410
That's right. In this day and age,
nothing's more precious than time.

350
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,210
You have to wash the vegetables
and prep all the ingredients.

351
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,750
But you can take care of all the prep work
in just a few minutes...

352
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,050
with our easy spicy seafood stew meal kit!

353
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,060
For our first broadcast,
we're offering a very special deal.

354
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,330
- The first order just came in!
- What?

355
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,760
The orders keep coming.

356
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,600
At this rate, we'll sell out in no time.

357
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,140
What in the world is happening?

358
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,900
Are people that desperate for this jacket?

359
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,870
What on earth is happening?

360
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,440
I'm told the orders just keep pouring in.

361
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,210
So place your order before it's too late
if you want to snag one!

362
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,520
Master Homemaker asks,

363
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,390
"Does it make sense to sell
a meal kit without tasting it?"

364
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,930
From Kitchen Ghost,
"It must taste awful..."

365
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,460
"since she won't even try a bite."

366
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,200
From Mukbangjoa,

367
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,640
"It's pretty obvious
if the host won't take a single bite."

368
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,110
"Don't buy it."

369
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,410
How many people do you have?

370
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,580
The office is packed.

371
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,420
They're a professional comment farm,
right?

372
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,820
Of course. It's how they make a living.

373
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,750
I'm only going to say this once.

374
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,920
For the puffer, post positive comments
and make sure they actually buy one.

375
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,690
I'll reimburse you.

376
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,800
For the seafood stew,
only post negative comments, right?

377
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,100
Of course.

378
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,230
And you must pressure her
to try the seafood stew.

379
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,330
I don't care if you have to
insult her or scare her.

380
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,040
Use any means necessary...

381
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,270
so the host has no other choice
but to eat it.

382
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,710
- You got that?
- Understood.

383
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,330
Ms. Jung looks much better on screen.

384
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,140
So demure and feminine.

385
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,840
What are you talking about?
Kyung Chae is way prettier.

386
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,340
Kyung Chae is great,
but she's too intense.

387
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,810
Men don't like aggressive women.

388
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,510
That's why she's still single.

389
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,310
Oh, give me a break. What nonsense.

390
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,280
She's single
because she's on another level.

391
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,180
What kind of ridiculousness is that?

392
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,420
What good are her qualifications
when she's past her prime?

393
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,190
Oh, please. A woman's age doesn't matter.
You're so old-fashioned.

394
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,430
I suppose some women stay alluring
and beautiful as they age.

395
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,660
Someone...

396
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,300
- not like you.
- Oh, you're just messing with me.

397
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,300
- Just kidding
- Very funny. Pan Sool, the comedian.

398
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,070
- Just messing with you
- Goodness.

(Daomeal Spicy Seafood Stew Meal Kit)

400
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,080
I really should've tasted this first,
shouldn't I?

401
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,920
And here I was, selling a meal kit
without even trying it.

402
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,890
Well, then,

403
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,690
how about I taste it for all of you?

(Daomeal Spicy Seafood Stew Meal Kit)

405
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,840
(She should've tasted it earlier.
What's the point now?)

406
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,450
(At least she is tasting it now.)

407
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,150
Oh, no.

408
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,080
She's not supposed to eat that.

409
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,690
All right, time for a taste test.

410
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,410
Okay.

411
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,010
This is delicious. Gosh!

412
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,650
This spicy seafood broth is invigorating
and has a nice kick to it.

413
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,980
It has this clean, savory finish.

414
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,850
How do we get it so fresh?

415
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,390
Seeing me enjoy it this much,

416
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,460
I'm sure you all feel confident buying it,
right?

You won't last long, Baek Sul Hee.

I know you better than anyone.

420
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,980
Soon enough, you're going to collapse.

421
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,990
If you want to live, get off the air now.

422
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,790
You, the CEO of Mingang Distribution?
That's a joke.

423
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,930
I would rather die right here...

424
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,300
than give you the satisfaction
of seeing me fail.

425
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,440
Just you watch. I'll see this through
to the very end.

You still think I'm not qualified?

428
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,680
Will you still drag me down
from my CEO position?

429
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,780
Open your eyes
and see who's the right one for Mingang!

430
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,850
I always side with whoever has power.
And right now, that's you.

431

And that's why you're on my side?

432
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,220
Something about this doesn't feel right.
I need to go and confirm it myself.

433

How could you let it get taken from you?

434

and that woman found it.
