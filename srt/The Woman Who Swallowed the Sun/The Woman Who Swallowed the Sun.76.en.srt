1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,440
Resign as CEO.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,710
Step down and start over from the bottom.
That's your punishment.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,180
An entry-level position?

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,050
You're joking, right?

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,990
How could you do this
without even discussing it with me?

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,590
When did you ask about the nursing home?

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,830
- I won't repeat myself!
- Even so, this is going too far.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,500
Who else could possibly take my place?
Did you forget your philosophy, Father?

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,270
That the executive team
must be members of the Min family.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,300
You're not seriously considering
putting Soo Jung in my position, are you?

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,370
It can't be Ji Seop.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,680
So who on earth
could possibly take my place?

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,880
Who says there's no one?
There is a perfect candidate.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,550
A perfect candidate? Who?

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,180
Don't tell me...

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,020
Is it Lucia?

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,450
That's right. Lucia!

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,660
I'm putting her in your seat.

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,360
Who did you say
you're giving the position to?

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,260
Why are you making me repeat myself?

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,760
- I'm making your stepmother the CEO.
- What do you think you're doing?

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,970
This is going too far,
even if you're mad at me.

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,170
You think just anyone can be the CEO?

24
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,040
Are you calling your stepmother
just anyone?

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,840
She is more than qualified.
She has both education and experience.

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,940
On top of that,

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,980
no one's more dedicated to Mingang and me
than her. So what's the problem?

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,950
Punish me until you calm down, Father.

29
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,520
I'll accept anything.
A pay cut, a suspension, whatever.

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,120
You still don't get it.

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,560
Do you really think I'm doing this
out of some personal grudge?

32
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,790
Then what is it?

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,660
Who keeps a dementia patient at home?
I was only thinking of you.

34
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,200
How dare you say that?

35
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,200
You did it for my own good?

36
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,140
You wanted your sick father out of the way
to swallow Mingang Distribution whole.

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,510
Did you think I wouldn't figure it out?

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,780
If we're to start blaming,
then this is your fault.

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,510
Why did you lie to us?

40
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,350
You were fine, but you faked the dementia.
Why would you lie to your own children?

41
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,550
Because I wanted to see your true colors,
that's why!

42
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,020
You were all scheming over the company
and crunching the numbers.

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,020
Was I ever even a father to any of you?

44
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,430
(Mingang Distribution)

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,170
(Episode 76)

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,240
Is something wrong?

47
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,500
The old man's gone senile.

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,910
There's no other explanation
for his behavior.

49
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,910
What do you mean? What did he do?

50
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,140
Did he say something
about the nursing home?

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,510
He told me to step down as CEO.

52
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,050
As CEO?

53
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,480
Wait, then who's going to take your place?

54
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,620
It's unbelievable.

55
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,690
Don't tell me he's giving it to her.

56
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,490
He's completely lost it.

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,260
He's a perfect example of someone
who's gone completely off the rails.

58
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,700
So he's really going
to make Lucia the CEO?

59
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,640
At this rate, he looks ready
to hand her the entire chairmanship.

60
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,040
That ungrateful child.

61
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,210
What? She did it for my sake?

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,610
If she became the chairwoman,
there'd be no stopping her.

63
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,980
She'd run roughshod
over the company and its employees.

64
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,720
My goodness.

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,820
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

66
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,930
How are you feeling?
You're all right, aren't you?

67
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,230
Do I look like a helpless child?

68
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,160
Why are you so anxious?

69
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,830
How can I not be?

70
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,040
You're surrounded
by enemies out to get you.

71
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,070
Don't worry.
I won't fall for the same trick twice.

72
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,110
If I'd known this would happen,
I would've come to work with you.

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,410
I'm regretting it now.

74
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,410
I told you not to worry.
Don't you think I can take care of myself?

75
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,220
Still, please come home early today.

76
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,120
All right, I'll be home early.

77
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,720
Actually, we need to talk.

78
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,360
Go and gather the kids.

79
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,630
What are you going to say?
If it's not something good, please don't.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,600
I shouldn't say it because it's bad news?
What needs to be said must be said.

81
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,840
There you go again.
After I specifically asked you not to.

82
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,210
Don't bring up things that upset you
and make the kids uncomfortable.

83
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,240
You're right. It's meant to be upsetting.

84
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,880
And I want them to be uncomfortable.

85
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,350
- Chairman.
- I get it.

86
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,620
I'll make sure there's no yelling.

87
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,860
So, you spent the entire day at work
avoiding your father?

88
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
What else could I have done?

89
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,590
I caused a scene,
thinking he had dementia.

90
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,560
I know what you mean.
I've hidden in our room since he got home.

91
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,400
It's not like some hidden camera prank!

92
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,770
What was he thinking?
He is perfectly fine.

93
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,770
Does he really get a kick out of
messing with his own kids like that?

94
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,310
Tell me about it!

95
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,140
That's basically fraud, you know?

96
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,180
What else do you call
conning his own kids?

97
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,050
Your father's a very strange man.

98
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,980
Anyway, until Father cools down,
just lie low and stay out of his way.

99
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,020
Your father wants to see you all.

100
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,460
Come on down. Your father's waiting.

101
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Where's Kyung Chae?

102
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,870
She's not home yet.

103
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,150
I had quite an enlightening experience.

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
I've finally seen my children
for who they really are.

105
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,530
Now I finally know who's genuine
and who's just an empty husk.

106
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,100
One of you said your father with dementia
was getting what he deserved.

107
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,700
Another said it was divine retribution.

108
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,570
One of you even cursed me,
hoping I'd get dementia when I got old.

109
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,980
One of you, in your hearts,

110
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,750
was eager to dump your sick father
in a nursing home.

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,480
And you call yourselves my children?

112
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,150
You live in my house, stuffing your faces,
and live off my company,

113
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,390
yet you defy me?

114
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,930
If not for her, I would've been hauled off
without being able to say a word.

115
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,430
It would've been worse than that.

116
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,230
I would've died in that nursing home,
and no one would have ever known.

117
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,370
Do you know what this is?

118
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,070
It's a pledge she wrote.

119
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,210
It's a legally binding promise
not to get greedy with the company shares.

120
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,680
"What do shares matter between family?"

121
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,150
"This shouldn't happen between family."
She insisted on writing it herself.

122
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,320
That's what your stepmother is like.
You inhuman monsters!

123
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,130
But now, this is useless.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,770
Because I'm transferring
all my shares to her.

125
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,720
- Why did you do that?
- It's the least I can do for you.

126
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,460
I'm starting the paperwork immediately,
so accept it.

127
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,660
And there's one more thing.

128
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,830
Sorry?

129
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,630
Come to the office tomorrow
if you're curious.

130
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,140
What are you going to do now?

131
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,040
The Chairman isn't one
to go back on his word.

132
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,670
Neither am I.

133
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,510
Not the Chairman, not even the Almighty
can force me out of the CEO position.

134
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,210
Not after everything
I've done to get here.

135
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,750
I've got a bad feeling
about this whole thing.

136
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,990
What's that supposed to mean?

137
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,160
I can't shake the feeling
that she played us.

138
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,830
I doubt that.

139
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,130
Lucia was more panicked than anyone
when we thought my father was sick.

140
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,130
Maybe at first,

141
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,570
but it's obvious
she caught on at some point.

142
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,270
Otherwise, she would've
never returned home at that time.

143
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,140
Before I called the staff
from the nursing home,

144
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,510
I had already taken steps
to get her out of the picture.

145
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,180
I've been meaning to ask about that.

146
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,310
How exactly did you lure her away?

147
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,250
That's not the point.

148
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,380
My perfect plan should've forced her out,
no questions asked.

149
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,420
But then she suddenly turned around
and went home?

150
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,450
You think that was a coincidence?

151
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,790
She either found out the Chairman
was faking it,

152
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,560
or she knew you were planning
to have him committed that day.

153
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,200
So you're saying she knew my father
was faking his dementia...

154
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,070
and deliberately used it
to get on his good side?

155
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,470
Plus, she knew I was trying to commit him?

156
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,270
That's a very plausible theory.

157
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,410
This incident may have pushed you and me
to the brink,

158
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,780
but just look at who it's been
a golden opportunity for.

159
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,350
How on earth did that woman know?

160
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,650
She's clearly not working alone.

161
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,360
She has a liaison and the muscle.

162
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,430
It's obvious they've each taken a role
and are moving quickly and strategically.

163
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,100
Once Lucia is back at the company,
we'll proceed with the plan, right?

164
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,800
Is she coming back
to the Online Business Team?

165
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,930
I assume so.

166
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,370
That's her home department.
No reason to transfer her somewhere else.

167
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,740
Then I guess the real battle for shares
is about to begin.

168
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,110
As long as Min Kyung Chae is the CEO,
our plan won't be easy to pull off.

169
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,980
The friendly shares and supporters...

170
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,020
that will gather around Min Kyung Chae
are formidable.

171
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,090
Then once Lucia is reinstated,

172
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,860
let's start gathering our own shares.

173
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,730
Even if we gather all the shares we can,
if the Min family unites, we'll lose.

174
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,600
But there's still a wild card.

175
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,900
Chairman Min Doo Sik's 35 percent stake.

176
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,740
The key is who he'll transfer it to.

177
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,610
Because of this incident,

178
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,410
he'll probably transfer some of it
to Lucia.

179
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,950
(Mingang Distribution)

180
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,230
At least come home to sleep.

181
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,270
Look at the state of you.
You're supposed to be the CEO.

182
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,740
The CEO of Mingang Distribution
isn't some hall monitor.

183
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,810
How can anyone take you seriously
like that?

184
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,180
I brought you a change of clothes.
Go get changed.

185
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,420
Seriously, what are you doing?

186
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,420
I'm just being a mother.
Don't take it the wrong way.

187
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,490
A mother?

188
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,690
Says who?

189
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,500
Did you come here just to upset me
early in the morning?

190
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,600
Or are you doing this on purpose?

191
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,300
I don't need this, so take it back.

192
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,140
People are watching.
Are you going to keep this up?

193
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,010
- Are they fighting again?
- Seriously, what's wrong with her?

194
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
(Mingang Distribution)

195
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,720
What's the special gift
you called me here for?

196
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,550
After all, surprise gifts are the best,
aren't they?

197
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,590
Just getting to see you is a gift
in itself, Chairman.

198
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,620
How can I not give you a gift
when you say things like that?

199
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,660
- You only say what I want to hear.
- I'm being sincere.

200
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,500
I know you're sincere.

201
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,560
I told you I understand you now.

202
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,370
I'm going to make you the CEO.

203
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,500
Didn't you say you had to be at work
to keep an eye on things?

204
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,440
I just meant I wanted to be by your side.

205
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,650
If you're going to be by my side,
you might as well have a suitable title.

206
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,320
It's more than I deserve.
How can I possibly be the CEO?

207
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,450
Too much modesty is a vice.

208
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,460
On second thought, letting talent like you
go to waste at home is a terrible waste.

209
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,660
Once Kyung Chae steps down,

210
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,360
you can take her place and get to work.

211
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,700
Are you serious?

212
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,480
Lucia, congratulations!

213
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,210
Should I start calling you
the CEO of Mingang Distribution?

214
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,950
There are still a lot of hurdles
to overcome.

215
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,690
I still need the board's approval,
and there's the shareholders' meeting.

216
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,750
More importantly, Min Kyung Chae
won't go down without a fight.

217
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,160
Of course, she won't.

218
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,460
It's not in her nature
to let someone take her position.

219
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,300
But there's no way Min Doo Sik
didn't think of that.

220
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,900
He knows his own daughter
better than anyone.

221
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,570
Since he's pushing for the share transfer
and the CEO position,

222
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,810
it seems like he's trying to build
a proper justification for it.

223
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,170
Exactly.

224
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,080
What kind of CEO has no stake
in their own company?

225
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,410
He'll transfer shares to you first,

226
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,380
and then naturally install you as the CEO.

227
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,820
Here, this is for the Chairman.

228
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,530
You said you can't go to
the Chairman's office for a while, right?

229
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,370
- I'll go, then.
- Here, let me take it.

230
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,540
Things are already a total mess anyway.

231
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,140
I got chewed out enough last night.

232
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,440
So what more could possibly happen?

233
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,810
I'll go.

234
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,340
Move. Gosh.

235
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,050
Hey.

236
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,760
Were you with Kyung Chae last night?

237
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,520
What's it to you?

238
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,460
I'm wondering if you two crossed a line.
If you did, you might as well set a date.

239
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,960
That's so old-fashioned.

240
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,100
Even if we did sleep together,
who gets married over that these days?

241
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,510
You're right. Marriage is unthinkable
even if you'd crossed the 38th Parallel.

242
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,970
My family's in a complete uproar.

243
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,310
Yesterday, my father tore up
Lucia's Share Waiver Agreement himself.

244
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,810
What do you think that means?

245
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,180
Doesn't that mean he's going to
transfer his stake to her now?

246
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,590
Are you serious?

247
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,220
As if the CEO position wasn't enough,
now his stake too?

248
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
The CEO position?
What are you talking about?

249
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,360
So Father is kicking Kyung Chae out
to put that woman in charge?

250
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,870
(Mingang Distribution)

251
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,410
So you didn't know the Chairman tore up
that woman's Share Waiver Agreement.

252
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,040
He tore up the agreement?

253
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,510
That's what I heard.
Last night, in front of the entire family.

254
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,380
Then that means he plans to transfer
his stake to her soon.

255
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,490
He can't justify making her CEO
if she doesn't have a stake.

256
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,960
That old man is really about to cause
a huge mess.

257
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,420
So, what will it be?

258
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,100
- Will you resign?
- Are you crazy?

259
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,770
Give her the CEO spot, of all people?
Does that make any sense?

260
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,740
(Director Min Soo Jung)

261
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,070
Hey, it looks like Kyung Chae is about
to get kicked out of the CEO spot.

262
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,980
Kyung Chae?

263
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,410
Why, all of a sudden?

264
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,450
She really got on Father's bad side
with that whole nursing home fiasco.

265
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,850
So he's kicking her out as CEO
because of that?

266
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,520
If you think that's shocking,
wait until you hear the rest.

267
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,390
The rest? What is it now?

268
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,660
When Kyung Chae steps down as CEO,
he'll supposedly put Lucia in her place.

269
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,830
What?

270
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,530
A sudden replacement of the CEO
is bound to cause a huge backlash.

271
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,900
I didn't realize things would move
this fast either.

272
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,640
It just goes to show how disappointed
he is in his children.

273
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,380
And it shows he trusts Lucia completely.

274
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,310
If Lucia takes over as CEO,

275
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,520
Chairman Min Doo Sik's stake
will be transferred to her,

276
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,050
So what happens then?

277
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,690
You said Min Doo Sik's personal stake
is 35 percent, right?

278
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,390
Yes. CEO Min has 15 percent,

279
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,160
Director Min and Vice Director Min
have seven percent each.

280
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,930
On top of that, Vice Director Min's wife
holds five percent.

281
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,670
No matter how many shares
Min Doo Sik gives to Lucia,

282
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,940
it'll be tough
if the Min family all sticks together.

283
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,680
Oh, the youngest daughter
has three percent.

284
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,880
We've already secured her shares.

285
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,850
The ten percent in nominee shares
held by Kim Sun Jae.

286
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,990
Let's just assume those will go over
to CEO Min's side.

287
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,020
With him in the mix,
things got complicated.

288
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,390
Right, there's also Oh Pan Sool.

289
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,960
Yes. It's only two percent,
which isn't much,

290
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,860
but it's very likely to be the swing vote.

291
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,070
Don't worry about that.

292
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,940
I'll handle that old man myself.
You keep fanning the flames from the side.

293
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,540
I just can't figure him out.
First, it's dementia, then it's not.

294
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,850
He's so wishy-washy.
He's such a troublemaker.

295
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,020
Didn't you hear what Ja Kyung said?
Apparently, he did it on purpose.

296
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,490
To test his kids.

297
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,590
Why even bother testing them
with the fortune he's leaving them anyway?

298
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,060
Not all kids are the same.
You have to find the worthy ones.

299
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,330
Not when the Chairman's seat
at Mingang Distribution is on the line.

300
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,630
You're telling me he caused all this chaos
just for that position?

301
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,900
Someone ought to have
the Chairman's head examined.

302
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,270
I bet his brain is full of
twists and turns, right?

303
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,970
- Welcome back.
- I'm home.

304
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
Welcome home.

305
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,780
Right.

306
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,910
I wonder if you've heard the news.

307
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,420
About your chairman, as in our in-law.

308
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,080
I heard he's faking dementia.

309
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,490
Yes. I heard that as well.

310
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,220
Anyway, it's a good thing
he became a businessman.

311
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,430
He'd have made a terrifying con man.

312
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,130
What kind of crazy talk is that now?

313
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,530
No, think about it.
If he can lie so brazenly to his own kids,

314
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,270
so fooling others would be child's play.

315
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,040
You're right.
The way he treats his own kids.

316
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,710
A reasonable man like myself
just can't wrap my head around it.

317
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,910
Hey, go get dinner on the table.

318
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,550
It's always food.
What am I, your personal chef?

319
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,150
It won't kill you to skip one meal.
We already stuffed ourselves at lunch.

320
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,620
Just because I stuffed myself,
I'm supposed to skip the next meal?

321
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,890
By that logic, I should eat a bag of rice
and starve for a month.

322
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,620
For crying out loud. Fine.

323
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,170
I'll handle that old man myself.
You keep fanning the flames from the side.

324
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,570
Sir.

325
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,880
You know Madam Jang, don't you?

326
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,650
It seems she's found
a promising investment opportunity.

327
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,950
Really? She found something good?

328
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,120
You said she's an investment mogul, right?

329
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,260
Yes.
Pretty much everyone in the US knows her.

330
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,020
Everyone in the US knows her?

331
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,430
Yes, absolutely.
She said she'd like to meet you, sir.

332
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,470
- A good pretense would be an investment.
- That's true.

333
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,340
Every meeting needs a purpose.
Tell her I can meet as early as tomorrow.

334
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,640
Actually, I'm looking to invest.

335
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,640
I aim to make a killing
in this hot market.

336
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,610
That's perfect.

337
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,780
Then I'm sure she'll be happy to help you.

338
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,350
I'll let her know you'd like
to arrange a meeting.

339
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,620
Good.
You know, I liked you the moment we met.

340
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,020
But you impress me more every day.

341
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,840
Don't be shy, and just eat up.

342
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,050
Manager Gong.

343
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,750
Manager Gong!

344
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,450
Goodness. Why are you so drunk?

345
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,860
- Where's my father?
- He's in the middle of dinner.

346
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,900
Was it fun for you?

347
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,970
Tricking your own kids,
judging every move?

348
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,870
This isn't a hotel.

349
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,780
If you want to stay out all night,
then get out.

350
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,810
You think this is just your house?

351
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,380
This was our late mother's house too.

352
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,950
Speaking of which, your own children
are standing right here,

353
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,720
watching you hand over your shares
to that woman, a complete stranger,

354
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,420
and making her CEO on top of it.
Does that make you happy?

355
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,460
How dare you call her that woman?

356
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,730
Can't you call her your stepmother?

357
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,830
I'm afraid I can't...

358
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,530
because all I see is
a wicked nine-tailed fox.

359
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,500
You're drunk.
Go to your room and sleep it off.

360
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,710
I asked you. Are you happy?

361
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,940
After tricking all of your children,

362
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,140
and being wrapped around
some young woman's little finger?

363
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,080
- Ms. Kyung Chae.
- Who gave you the right...

364
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,080
to kick me out of the CEO position?

365
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,180
Who said you could do that?

366
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,350
Do you think the board
will approve the new CEO?

367
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,190
Do you think the shareholders will ever
accept that woman as the new CEO?

368
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,620
She's only dear to you, Father.

369
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,190
But she's just a nobody
without a background!

370
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,390
- Ms. Kyung Chae.
- Let me go!

371
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,100
- I said, let go!
- Just come upstairs.

372
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,910
For goodness' sake.

373
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,240
- Hey, let go!
- Goodness.

374
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,810
Why are you doing this?

375
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,580
This isn't the time for this.

376
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,150
If not now, then when?

377
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,320
I'm about to lose it all because of her.

378
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,890
So what do you expect me to do?

379
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,890
Do you still not get it, Kyung Chae?

380
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,500
Don't you see why Dad faked his dementia?

381
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
What?

382
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,900
Even I can see it. How can you not?

383
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,800
Do you really not understand why Dad wants
to give her his shares and make her CEO?

384
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,210
What did you just say?

385
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,510
Try being sincere, like Mom was.

386
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,350
If you were honest,
this wouldn't have happened.

387
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,350
Whether Dad had dementia or not,

388
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,720
you just had to treat him
like Ms. Jung did.

389
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,580
Whose side are you on right now?

390
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,090
Anyone else can take her side,

391
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,590
you, of all people, shouldn't.

392
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,860
What kind of daughter sides with
another woman over her own mother?

393
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,660
What are you talking about?

394
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,860
I'm your mother.

395
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,470
Hey, what's wrong with you?

396
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,780
Gosh, you're really drunk.

397
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,980
- Gosh.
- I'm your mother.

398
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,480
This is annoying.

399
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,590
Knock it off.

400
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,190
This is why I don't want to talk to you.

401
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,030
Are you crazy?

402
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,500
Gosh, seriously.

403
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,900
What's gotten into you?

404
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,910
(Notice board)

405
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,680
(Personnel appointment,
Dismissal, transfer)

406
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,920
(Personnel appointment,
Dismissal, transfer)

407
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,010
- Did you see the notice in the lobby?
- What notice?

408
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,910
The one about the CEO's dismissal.

409
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,210
What did you say?

410
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,380
Who would post that without a report?

411
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,250
I heard it was directly from the Chairman.

412
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,320
Get the directors in here now.

413
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,960
A notice just went up about CEO Min.

414
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,090
She was dismissed as CEO
and demoted to a staff member...

415
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,560
on the Online Business Team.

416
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,200
A staff member?

417
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,030
That's unexpected.

418
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,130
To the Online Business Team,
of all places.

419
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,770
She'll be a rookie
on the team she created.

420
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,570
That's about the size of it.

421
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,210
A few of the directors just went
into the CEO's Office.

422
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,550
Of course.
She'll call her allies to defend her post.

423
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,050
Hey, Se Ri.

424
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,690
What's wrong?

425
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,260
Did something bad happen?

426
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,190
I just feel a little off.

427
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,360
Kyung Chae said the weirdest thing
last night.

428
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,800
What did she say?

429
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,440
That she's my birth mother.

430
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,680
She did?

431
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,750
She drank too much last night,
so she must've made a mistake.

432
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,450
That doesn't make any sense.

433
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,420
No matter what anyone says,
you're my daughter.

434
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,100
Now, let's see you lose both your position
and your daughter.

435
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,570
Why are you all just sitting around?
Go mob the Chairman's office!

436
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,710
Even if it's the Chairman,
can she just fire the CEO on a whim?

437
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,280
We're just all a bit stunned right now.

438
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,510
Don't just be flustered, do something!

439
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,950
We have to change his mind,
no matter what.

440
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,550
Yes, but we need to know
the full story first before acting.

441
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,290
He's right.

442
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,020
This isn't some game.
It's about a dismissal and a transfer.

443
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,130
Shouldn't you first explain to us
why the Chairman would suddenly do this?

444
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:29,270
Since the Chairman is directly involved,
we're hesitant to make any rash moves.

445
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,900
If I can't keep my position,
I'm done with all of you.

446
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,600
You know what that means, don't you?

447
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,410
Is there anyone here I haven't helped?

448
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,380
Director Jeong, Director Park,
Director Kim!

449
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,680
You know who to thank for your fortunes
and sending your kids abroad,

450
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,150
and the lavish lives you lead, right?

451
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,020
What are you all doing?
I said, go and stop the Chairman!

452
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,800
- What is the meaning of this?
- You've gone too far this time.

453
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,000
Mingang isn't some corner store.

454
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,340
To unilaterally dismiss the CEO
without a board meeting is just...

455
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,110
Besides, doing this
before we've even found...

456
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,380
a suitable replacement...

457
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,850
- will leave the CEO position vacant.
- There's a successor.

458
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,420
There is? And who might that be?

459
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,080
You'll find that out in due course.

460
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,420
Is that why you're here? To question me?

461
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,660
Who put you up to this?

462
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,390
Did CEO Min tell you to storm my office
and cause a scene?

463
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,860
That's not it. We just...

464
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,200
Is there anyone who doesn't know
you're all publicly part of Min's faction?

465
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,100
It's just that doing this without
procedure or approval is problematic.

466
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,840
My word is the procedure,
and my will is the approval.

467
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,710
He wouldn't be so bold if he knew
whose side the directors were on.

468
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,650
Who gave you the right
to take my position?

469
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,990
How little must you think of your father
to sic these directors on me?

470
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,860
This requires a resolution
from the board anyway.

471
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,930
I suppose they don't know you planned
to put me in a home to die, do they?

472
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,600
How ungrateful of you.
This is exactly why you must step down.

473
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,010
Step down while I'm still asking nicely.

474
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,640
Give up your seat,

475
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,610
and start over as a staff member.

476
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,610
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

477
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,180
I'm afraid I can't do that.

478
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,050
You can't?

479
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,950
You really can't, can you?

480
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,890
Absolutely not.

481
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,420
Get in here!

482
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,620
Drag her out!

483
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,560
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

484
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,040
She'll work as a staff member
on the Online Business Team from today?

485
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,140
She reports to you, so train her properly.

486
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,780
Ms. Min, were you such an amateur,
with no sense of hierarchy or structure?

487
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,580
Amateur? Watch your mouth.

488
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,620
I'll do anything
to get your position back,

489
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,980
so please, just endure this for now.

490
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,020
If it comes down to it,
we can sue the Chairman.

491
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,190
What are you talking about?

492
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,330
