1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,010
Enjoy your meal, Mother.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,510
You must have been tired
from all that shopping, right?

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,380
If anyone was tired,
it must have been you.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,920
Seriously, how much does one have to shop
to become a Black Sapphire member?

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,190
It's nothing, really.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,890
For me, spending money is
the easiest thing in the world.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,840
Oh, come on.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,670
You should let your grandmother eat first.

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,450
It's all right.
It just means she's enjoying the food.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,420
Eat up, Se Ri.

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,120
Here, Se Ri.

12
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,390
Try a bite of this.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,430
Goodness. You eat so well.

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,000
Say "thank you" to your grandma.

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,900
Seriously, cut it out!

16
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,050
Wait, who's that?

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,690
Isn't that Kyung Chae and Se Ri?

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,060
But the woman with them is...

19
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,100
Why is Madam Jang...

20
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,940
meeting with Min Kyung Chae and Min Se Ri?

21
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,780
Should we go over and say hi?

22
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,880
No.

23
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,550
- Don't.
- Okay.

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,700
Maybe it's because
she's my son's flesh and blood,

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,740
but I feel completely different
about her now.

26
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,240
I'm sure you do. I feel the same way.

27
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,080
Before, you were just a business contact.

28
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,350
But now, as the mother of the man I loved,

29
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,920
you're especially dear to me.

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,590
- Am I really that dear to you?
- Of course.

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,260
Don't you feel the same?
Se Ri and I are your family now.

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,660
Family...

33
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,800
Kyung Chae!

34
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,640
Can we go now?
We ate. Why did we have to come here?

35
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,470
Is that all there is to a meal?
We're having tea.

36
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,380
You're having some too.

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,880
Tea? No thanks. Maybe some alcohol...

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,050
You drink?

39
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,450
I'm not a minor, you know.

40
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,330
Is this man your son?

41
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,200
Yes, he is. Why do you ask?

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Just wondering.

43
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,800
He seems familiar for some reason.

44
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,570
He seems familiar?

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,510
Blood recognizes its own.

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,850
How do you feel, looking at him?

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,280
What kind of person do you think he is?

48
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,420
He's just a guy, I guess.

49
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,850
But he looks really kind.

50
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,220
He seems like a good person.

51
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,090
My sweet girl.

52
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,630
- My sweet girl!
- Come on, Grandma!

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,100
My sweet girl.

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,790
For Madam Jang to be
meeting them in private...

55
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,490
What could be going on?

56
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,940
So? What did our stepmother say?

57
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,770
Is she going to make me the CEO?

58
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,510
Just be patient.
I really buttered her up for you today.

59
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,980
She didn't get angry, did she,
when you asked her to make me CEO?

60
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,620
No, she just said okay,
and that she'd think about it.

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,020
That's a good start.

62
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,350
If she thinks about it, I'm obviously
the right person for the job.

63
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,830
You can't put ambitious types like
Soo Jung or Kyung Chae in high positions.

64
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,730
They'll do anything to climb even higher.

65
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,430
And before you know it,
they'll run the company into the ground.

66
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,210
Madam Jang met with Min Kyung Chae
and Min Se Ri?

67
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,710
Yes.

68
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,810
What could that have been about?

69
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,680
Something about it felt off.

70
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,420
The atmosphere was so strange.

71
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,850
They seemed just like a real family.

72
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,150
A family?

73
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,660
The way Madam Jang
treated that girl, Se Ri,

74
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,260
wasn't normal.

75
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,460
It was like she was her granddaughter.

76
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,430
Her own granddaughter? That's a stretch.

77
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,570
Madam Jang can't stand her.

78
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,340
I know, but yesterday,
it was totally different.

79
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,410
To find out what's really going on,

80
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,610
we'll just have to ask her directly.

81
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,480
You should go see Madam Jang.

82
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,110
If there's something going on,
I'm sure she'll tell you the truth.

83
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,930
This is a surprise. What brings you here?

84
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,230
I was still worried about you
since you were sick the other day.

85
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,160
That was ages ago.

86
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,100
I shouldn't have made you worry.
You're so busy.

87
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,300
I'm alright, so don't worry about me.

88
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,840
By any chance, did you go out yesterday?

89
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,850
No. I was at the hotel all day.

90
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,510
Oh, really?

91
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,980
Why?

92
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,450
It's nothing. Never mind.

93
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,330
So she's hiding the fact
that she went out?

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,600
And she even lied,
saying she was at the hotel all day.

95
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,940
But why would she hide that?

96
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,240
She's free to meet with anyone she wants,
whether it's Min Kyung Chae or not, right?

97
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,740
Madam Jang has never acted
like this before.

98
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,580
I'm just so thrown off
by her sudden change.

99
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,480
I know.
Doesn't she hate those two the most?

100
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,390
Come to think of it, something strange
did happen a few days ago.

101
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,020
The night of the online team dinner,

102
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,920
Tae Joo came to my place
to meet with Min Kyung Chae.

103
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,030
Wait, why would he...

104
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,930
Maybe all of this
isn't a coincidence after all.

105
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,950
So, this is all Se Ri?

106
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,950
Look...

107
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,890
how much she looks like Ho Se?

108
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Well...

109
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,190
Maybe it's because she's a newborn,

110
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,030
I don't really see the resemblance.

111
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,200
But my Se Ri...

112
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,400
is Ho Se's only flesh and blood.

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,070
She is your one and only granddaughter.

114
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,970
But that very child is calling
Lucia "Mom."

115
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,340
Do you really think it's right that she's
bonding with Lucia instead of me?

116
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,750
You know what kind of person Lucia is
better than I do.

117
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,720
How long are you going to
just stand by and watch?

118
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,590
When I get back to the company
and reclaim the CEO position,

119
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,230
I'll kick Lucia right out of the company
and the house.

120
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,930
Once I own Mingang Distribution,
I'm going to pass it down to my Se Ri.

121
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,930
That's why you have to help me.

122
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,000
Please, help me, Mother.

123
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,370
Whatever our relationship has been,
the important thing is...

124
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,040
that your bloodline
runs through Se Ri, not Lucia.

125
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,810
Are you really going to stand by
and watch Se Ri's life be ruined?

126
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,450
If you promise...

127
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,890
to leave Mingang to Se Ri,

128
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,590
then, as her grandmother,
I might consider it.

129
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,360
But if not...

130
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,660
What do you mean by that?

131
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,160
You're marrying Kim Sun Jae soon,
aren't you?

132
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,560
You're already engaged.
Marriage is the next logical step.

133
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,700
Then you'll have children with him, too.

134
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,300
I told you this last time.

135
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,870
I have no intention of marrying him.
In fact, I won't.

136
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,810
I'm just keeping him around for now
because he's useful.

137
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,010
I'll drop him the second
I don't need him anymore.

138
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,920
So what you want is to be CEO again?

139
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,480
Yes.

140
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,860
What is it?

141
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,760
Speaking as the head of Legal,

142
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,700
how long do you plan to leave
the CEO position vacant?

143
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,340
A prolonged vacancy creates
a leadership vacuum,

144
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,140
operational disruptions,
a weaker strategic direction,

145
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,670
and a whole host of other problems.
You're aware of that, right?

146
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,380
I'm aware.

147
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,080
If you knew that,
why have you been sitting on it?

148
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,720
I believe I made it clear I'm speaking
as the head of Legal.

149
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,990
I was just about to name a successor,
actually.

150
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,890
And just a friendly tip,

151
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,260
according to our company the Articles
of Incorporation, the CEO position...

152
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,730
can only be filled by a member
of the owner family, as you well know.

153
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,370
I'm well aware. You don't need to worry.

154
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,800
If this drags on any longer,
the shareholders will be notified.

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,140
They'll be told that the acting chairman
is delaying the appointment of a new CEO,

156
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,240
leaving the position vacant
and causing massive business disruptions.

157
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,550
Then I guess I should also let
Min Ji Seop and Min Soo Jung know.

158
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,150
After all, they both need to know.

159
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
Well then...

160
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,870
There's going to be
a CEO appointment ceremony soon.

161
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,440
Of course, it's not a permanent position,
just a temporary one.

162
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,380
Is this the acting chairman's decision?

163
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,180
What, you think I'm just making this up?

164
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
When is she making the appointment?

165
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,950
That's up to the person
holding all the cards.

166
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,520
But it'll be in the next day or two.

167
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,620
Any further delay will cause problems.

168
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,620
So you're saying my fate will be decided
in the next day or two.

169
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
You could say that.

170
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,600
Dear deity, Buddha, and ancestors,
please, help me.

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,400
Please make sure I become CEO.

172
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,570
Make me the CEO. Please...

173
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm begging you, please...

174
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,610
So we'll know the result right away?

175
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,050
I'd imagine so.

176
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,690
It seems like you're in a hurry
to get this done, Lawyer Kim.

177
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,990
Why is that?

178
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,460
Kyung Chae isn't even part of the company,

179
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,930
so wouldn't it be better for her
if this appointment was delayed?

180
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,430
The position must be filled quickly.
We can't leave it vacant indefinitely.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,900
Let's just say it's a decision
for the greater good of the company.

182
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,440
A decision for the "greater good."

183
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,070
All right.

184
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,180
Tell the acting chairman that I'll support
whatever she decides.

185
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,890
Goodness...

186
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,800
For my Se Ri's sake,

187
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,300
Min Kyung Chae has to become
the head of Mingang,

188
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,710
which means I have to get her
reinstated as CEO this time.

189
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,010
But then that puts
Lucia's position in jeopardy.

190
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,520
Does this mean they're fated
for a showdown?

191
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,450
Who is the one...

192
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,650
I need to help to survive,
and who needs to be forced out?

193
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Hello?

194
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,300
Is this Stella's phone?

195
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,600
Of course it is, Pan Sool.

196
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Yes. This is Oh Pan Sool.

197
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,440
Have you been well and happy?

198
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,670
Of course! Couldn't be better.

199
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,180
So, what's this about?

200
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,680
Well...

201
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,920
Today, I'm going to entrust
my everything to you, Stella.

202
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,820
I'm giving you all my shares in Mingang.
Do whatever you want with them.

203
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,560
That is an excellent idea.
Should we meet right now?

204
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,490
At the same cafe as last time.

205
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,260
Yes. I'll get there faster
than Usain Bolt can run.

206
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,470
Okay.

207
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,570
Who were you on the phone with?
Your cheeks are all flushed.

208
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,440
What about my cheeks?

209
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,380
If I had no wrinkles,
the world would've gone crazy.

210
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,740
Anyway, it was just a business call.

211
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,210
- So stop talking nonsense.
- Don't lie. It wasn't a client.

212
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,780
What are you plotting now?
Who are you meeting that needs an excuse?

213
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,790
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've heard.

214
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,790
Your jealousy is pathological. Get it?

215
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,720
I know I'm so handsome, charming,
and charismatic that it's risky to go out,

216
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,930
but you make yourself look cheap
when you act like this.

217
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,560
Handsome, charming, charismatic?
They must've frozen to death last year.

218
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,630
I was worried you were meeting some bimbo
to waste time spouting nonsense.

219
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,000
This meeting is productive, so not a word.
You'll get jinxed.

220
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,010
Not only is my life on the line here,
but your life is riding on it too.

221
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,750
Stella, is something wrong?

222
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,980
You don't look as well
as you did last time we met.

223
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,650
Do I?

224
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,990
Maybe I'm just lovesick from missing you.

225
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,920
Because you missed me?

226
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,360
Why would you miss
a plain old guy like me?

227
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,160
What are you talking about?

228
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,870
If I look closely at you,

229
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,640
I can see such exotic features.

230
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
Exotic?

231
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,340
You mean like some kind of
European heartthrob?

232
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,710
You didn't know?

233
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,880
You're an unexpected charmer.

234
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,380
An unexpected charmer?

235
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,050
What's that?

236
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,620
It means...

237
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,520
you're more charming the more I see you.

238
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,460
Stella.

239
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,460
You're my goddess.

240
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
The goddess who's captured my heart.

241
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,530
And on that note...

242
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Here.

243
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,070
And this is?

244
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,810
My full stake in Mingang Distribution.
I brought every single share I own.

245
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,480
It's all yours, Stella.

246
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,750
So you're entrusting all of this...

247
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,690
to me?

248
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,490
Yes, all of it.

249
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,820
Sell it all off before it tanks.

250
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,360
Then pick a hot new stock,

251
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,030
and then make it pop,
just like popcorn! Boom!

252
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,960
And from now on,

253
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,500
it's cappuccino time.

254
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,250
Is it on its way?

255
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
You're coming in, right?

256
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,690
Knock, knock!

257
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,860
- What are you staring at?
- It's nothing, sir.

258
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,100
But what brings you here this late?

259
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,340
I did something drastic today,
and I felt you should be the one to know.

260
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,200
What did you do?

261
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,170
I took my entire stake in Mingang...

262
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,180
and handed it all over to Ms. Stella.

263
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,750
You gave her all of it?

264
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,650
Yes. I trust her with everything.

265
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,690
Goodness. What are you doing in here?

266
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,520
I said not to bother him so he could rest.

267
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,790
You're the one being a nuisance!
Now get out!

268
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,660
- Goodness, you get out.
- No, you get out first!

269
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,930
- Hey, you go first.
- No, you... Fine, let's play for it.

270
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,060
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

271
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,630
- Get out!
- I won! Why should I have to leave?

272
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,030
- The winner leaves!
- You leave!

273
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,070
- I said to get out first!
- You leave.

274
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,100
You, step out for one minute!

275
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,400
- Go on, get out!
- Leave!

276
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,640
- I said, get out!
- Go on, step out!

277
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,140
- Get out.
- Get out.

278
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,140
- Come on! Out!
- Gosh, I'm burning up in here.

279
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,310
Seriously...

280
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,990
It's me.

281
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,420
Yes. Is something wrong? It's late.

282
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,590
I just heard some news from Oh Pan Sool.

283
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,930
Apparently, all the Mingang Distribution
shares he owns...

284
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,000
have been handed over to Madam Jang.

285
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,230
Did she not tell you?

286
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,300
No.

287
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,300
This is the first time I'm hearing it.

288
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
That's strange.

289
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,270
She would've told you right away.

290
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,440
Yes, that is strange.

291
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,610
I'll call her and find out.
See you at the office tomorrow.

292
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,820
Hi, it's me.

293
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
I just wanted to ask,

294
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,560
did Oh Pan Sool hand over
his stake to you today?

295
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,630
Tae Kyung just told me.
It seems he heard it directly from him.

296
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,930
That old man, Oh Pan Sool,
just can't keep his mouth shut.

297
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,170
I was going to tell you later.

298
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,010
That's great news.

299
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,540
So how big is our stake now?

300
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,780
Well that's not clear yet.

301
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,810
Compared to them,
it's still just a drop in the bucket.

302
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,150
Still, it's better than nothing.

303
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,220
It's all thanks to you.

304
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,990
Just like how you got your hands
on Se Ri's stake.

305
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,290
I suppose I did.

306
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,630
I guess I did skim some of Se Ri's shares.
Now that you mention it.

307
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,700
By the way, can we meet
at the office tomorrow?

308
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,470
I'll come to you.
There's something I need to say.

309
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,200
All right. See you tomorrow.

310
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,310
Lucia.

311
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
You and I...

312
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,380
are in such a cruel twist of fate.

313
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,550
So if your stepmother
just gives you the nod,

314
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,760
you'll instantly be the CEO
of Mingang Distribution, right?

315
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Exactly.

316
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,430
I have a good feeling about it this time.

317
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,460
I'm a better choice than
Soo Jung, obviously.

318
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,230
Honestly, she's just as much of a brat
as Kyung Chae.

319
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,470
Kyung Chae is in a league of her own,
but Soo Jung is a real piece of work, too.

320
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,570
You're right. Sometimes I think
Soo Jung is even worse.

321
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,240
That's what I'm saying.

322
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,950
My stepmother can't stand her either.

323
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,450
You know what they say,
a woman's worst enemy is another woman.

324
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,220
Soo Jung had a fit trying
to stop Stepmother from moving in.

325
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,520
It disgusted even me,

326
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,890
so can you imagine how she must have felt?

327
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,530
There's definitely still
some bad blood there.

328
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,560
I really hope she asks you to be the CEO.

329
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,400
As long as nothing crazy happens,
it's a shoo-in for me.

330
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,370
Didn't you say you really laid it on thick
at the restaurant and department store?

331
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,800
Laid it on thick? Please.

332
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,340
All that sucking up and catering to her.
You have no idea how hard I worked.

333
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,510
Then we're golden.

334
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,110
It's 100 percent going to be me.

335
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,680
Is the era of CEO Min Ji Seop
about to begin?

336
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,090
She knows better than anyone that
Kyung Chae and I are like oil and water,

337
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,730
and since I even offered
to give her my stake last time,

338
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,500
the CEO should be a given, right?

339
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,700
Besides, can she really keep Kyung Chae
in check without my help?

340
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,470
Even though she's been kicked out
of the company for now,

341
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,840
she's not the type to take it lying down.

342
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,250
Looks like they'll be having
sweet dreams tonight.

343
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,450
Both Ji Seop and Soo Jung are counting
their chickens before they've hatched.

344
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,760
When you make your comeback as CEO,
what's the first thing you want to do?

345
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,390
If I could,

346
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,260
I'd like to rewrite the Articles
of Incorporation my father created.

347
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,500
So that some incompetent legitimate heir
or a wicked illegitimate child...

348
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,640
can never even dream of
owning Mingang Distribution.

349
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,710
And I'll ensure the chairman's trophy wife
can never set foot in the company.

350
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,910
I will create a perfect kingdom
with me, Min Kyung Chae, as its ruler.

351
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,850
That's a nice thought,

352
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,020
but it doesn't sound like
there's a place for me in it.

353
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,390
Right.

354
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,150
I have to save a spot for you, Lawyer Kim.

355
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,890
Don't you worry.

356
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,890
Do you think I'd betray you?

357
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,630
No, I know you wouldn't,

358
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,800
but still, I'm not one
to be trifled with, either.

359
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,270
Right.

360
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,840
You're not an easy opponent.

361
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,410
On that note, shall we have a toast?

362
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,250
Kim Sun Jae, you're just my tool.

363
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,190
One I use when I need you,
and get rid of when I don't.

364
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,630
(Client 1, Min Se Ri,
and Client 2, Stella Jang,)

365
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,430
(do not have
a grandparent–grandchild relationship.)

366
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,870
But this time, I'm going to save you.

367
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,580
I'll carry your secret with me,
whatever it may be.

368
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,350
Because that's how I survive, too.

369
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,990
It's me. I need you to forge a document.

370
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,930
It's urgent.

371
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,460
Don't use an amateur.

372
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,800
Get a professional,

373
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,530
and forge it so perfectly
that no one will ever notice.

374
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,940
Scheme all you want,

375
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,540
but you're nothing without me.

376
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,080
(Mingang Distribution)

377
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,430
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

378
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,560
Welcome.

379
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,370
I hope I'm not interrupting.

380
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,700
Not at all.

381
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,540
I came because there was
something urgent I needed to say.

382
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,340
I just felt this couldn't wait.

383
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,780
I'm glad you came.

384
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,280
Is it something important?

385
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,120
It looks like you're heading
somewhere important.

386
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,390
- I am.
- Where to?

387
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,760
To take back my kingdom.

388
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,110
My little good luck charm.

389
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,010
I'll be back.

390
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,520
What's with her?

391
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,390
Manager Gong, what's gotten into her?

392
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,460
Right.

393
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,060
So, how are things
between you and Se Ri these days?

394
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,370
Se Ri? Why the sudden question?

395
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,900
Just curious.

396
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,100
To be honest, whatever you end up doing...

397
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,610
to get revenge on Min Kyung Chae
and Min Doo Sik,

398
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,440
I don't really care.

399
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,850
But when it comes to Se Ri,
I'm a little curious.

400
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,350
How are you going to handle her?

401
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,260
I believe I've told you this before.

402
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,090
You said you'd punish her.

403
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,500
Right, but I mean,
besides just punishing her,

404
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,230
be more specific.

405
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,700
Well...

406
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,040
What you say is extremely important.

407
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,640
Because I'm dead serious right now.

408
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,480
What do you mean by that?

409
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Come on in.

410
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,860
This is who I'm recommending
for the CEO position.

411
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,530
Say hello.

412
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,200
Hello.

413
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,470
I'm Min Kyung Chae. I'm here
on Jang Yeon Sook's recommendation.

414
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,850
She's perfect for the CEO position
at Mingang Distribution, don't you agree?

415
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,290
Madam Jang, why are you doing this?

416
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,760
What in the world is going on?

417
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,130
Madam Jang, how could you do this to me?

418
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,400
What's the problem?

419
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,740
She's part of
Mingang Distribution's owner family.

420
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,470
She has the skills and the resume...

421
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,770
to be the perfect fit, right?

422
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,810
Madam Jang!

423
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,510
Could you give us a minute?

424
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,750
Of course.

425
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,690
After all we did to get rid of her,
you're bringing her back?

426
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,230
And as the CEO!

427
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,260
Why not?
Is it such a disaster if she comes back?

428
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,160
Why are you doing this, Madam Jang?

429
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,500
Because no one is as capable as her.

430
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,100
Or would you prefer
I appoint Min Soo Jung?

431
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,470
What about Min Ji Seop?

432
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,240
No, I can't let that happen.

433
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,880
If Min Kyung Chae returns,
she'll stop at nothing to get me fired.

434
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,850
After everything I've been through
to get here!

435
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,820
Sit down.

436
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,020
Sit down!

437
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,720
Jung Lucia.

438
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,360
Listen to me.

439
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,740
Am I...

440
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,670
misunderstanding something?

441
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,510
Why do I feel like you've changed
all of a sudden?

442
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,410
I haven't changed.

443
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,250
The circumstances have.

444
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,880
What do you mean? What's changed?

445
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,420
It would take all day to explain.

446
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,020
Anyway...

447
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,930
Just make Min Kyung Chae the CEO.

448
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,790
And that's that.

449
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,770
No, I can't do that.

450
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,530
That would put us back at square one.

451
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,100
Then what have we been fighting for?

452
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,140
"We?" Who said you and I are a "we?"

453
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Excuse me?

454
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,680
What makes you think you and I are a "we?"

455
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,590
What has gotten into you?

456
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,430
As of today, Min Kyung Chae is
the CEO of Mingang Distribution again.

457
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,000
And if you so much as lay a finger
on CEO Min without my permission,

458
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,810
I'll expose you for who you really are,
Baek Sul Hee.

459
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,200
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

460
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,840
You know what the most satisfying part is?

461
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,780
Watching Lucia get stabbed in the back
by the one she trusted most.

462
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,980
What's that supposed to mean?

463
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,390
Someone will be coming
as the CEO tomorrow?

464
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,420
There was no other choice.
We're going our separate ways.

465
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,720
But what if Lucia gets hurt?

466
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,860
Why am I here?

467
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,120
Where am I?

468
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,230
How interesting.
But when should I expose that...

469
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,130
Min Se Ri isn't
Madam Jang's granddaughter?

470
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
