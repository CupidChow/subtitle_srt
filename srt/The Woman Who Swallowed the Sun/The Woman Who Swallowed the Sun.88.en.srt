00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,810
(Episode 88)

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,760
Allow me to introduce myself.

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,060
My name is Kim Sun Jae,
and I'm going to marry Min Kyung Chae.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,230
I'm sure I need no further introduction.

5
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,240
I look forward to getting
to know you, Brother-in-law.

6
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,840
And to my new sisters-in-law,
I hope we get along.

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,280
And you as well, Mother.

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,420
I've always heard that a good son-in-law
is a treasure to his mother-in-law.

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,590
I hope you'll grow very fond of me.

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,960
Mother.

11
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,530
If you're done, let's go
to the dining room. Dinner is ready.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,010
What a spread, Manager Gong!

13
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,480
Where should I start?

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,750
I don't know when you two got so close,

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,080
but do you have to do this now
when the chairman is missing?

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,050
That's why we're only having
an engagement party.

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,120
Without knowing where my father is
or how he's doing,

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,420
I don't exactly feel like
prancing around in a wedding dress.

19
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,690
I'm just really curious.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,600
How did your relationship
get this serious?

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,500
Is this an arranged marriage or something?

22
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,040
That's a hurtful thing to say,
Brother-in-law.

23
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,710
Wasn't it your marriage that was arranged?

24
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,840
That's not true, Sun Jae!

25
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,910
Wait.
Is he my sister-in-law's husband now?

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,550
We were in love.

27
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,150
Don't assume all arranged marriages
are the same.

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,160
You're sorely mistaken!

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,760
So even with the chairman missing,

30
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,460
you're still going through with it?

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,130
Why shouldn't we?

32
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,170
You're unbelievable.

33
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,070
I'm starting to feel sorry
for the chairman.

34
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,440
How could you all be like this?

35
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,110
You'd be more upset if a pet dog ran away.

36
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,040
This is the chairman we're talking about!

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,250
My father-in-law is a lucky man
to have someone worry about him so much.

38
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,850
I'm quite envious.

39
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,050
Please share some of that love
with me too, Mother.

40
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,820
As I said, a son-in-law is
a mother-in-law's favorite.

41
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,190
- Isn't that right, Mother?
- Stop calling me that!

42
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,730
Can't you stop calling me that?

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,700
How else should I address you...

44
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,570
when you'll be my mother-in-law, Mother?

45
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,460
She seemed to flinch every time you call
her "mother-in-law."

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,660
I'm doing it on purpose.

47
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,300
That way, she'll get sick of it and leave.

48
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,670
I didn't know you thought that far ahead.

49
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,140
I told you before.

50
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,140
When it comes to you officially
becoming the chairman...

51
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,070
and the new owner of Mingang,
there's nothing I wouldn't do.

52
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,310
That's very reassuring to hear.

53
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,780
So, when and where
is the engagement party?

54
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,180
I'll take care of it.

55
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,020
I'll let you know when it's decided,
so just wait.

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,850
I'm a little tired today.

57
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,990
Why don't you head home now?

58
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,830
Of course.

59
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,490
You don't want to be tired
for work tomorrow.

60
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,270
Don't see me out.

61
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,870
I can see myself out.

62
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,440
All right, then.

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,340
See you at work tomorrow.

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,680
She really just left like that?

65
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,630
Stop right there!

66
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,770
You're marrying Min Kyung Chae?

67
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,500
Are you out of your mind?

68
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,870
Actually, I've never been more sane.

69
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,280
Do you really think this makes any sense?

70
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,050
If you have any decency,
there are lines you shouldn't cross.

71
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,550
You and I lived together
and even had a child together.

72
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,620
So how could you even think
of becoming my son-in-law?

73
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,120
How can you so shamelessly
call me your mother-in-law?

74
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,830
If it bothers you, stop being
the mother-in-law. Problem solved.

75
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,730
Baek Sul Hee, you'll never
get your revenge. You know why?

76
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,800
Because I'm right here by your side,

77
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,470
and I know you and your plans too well.

78
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,810
So just give it up
and go back to where you belong.

79
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,310
Frankly, now that the old chairman
is out of the picture,

80
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,110
what are you going to do
hanging around here?

81
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,920
I'm only saying this for old times' sake,

82
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,050
so you'd better listen.

83
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,550
Well then...

84
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,490
Your future son-in-law
will take his leave now.

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,960
Dear mother...

86
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
in-law!

87
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,040
Darn.

88
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,470
That crazy little...

89
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,280
(CEO Jung Lucia)

90
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,220
It's me.

91
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,390
It seems Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae...

92
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,900
- are getting married.
- What?

93
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,570
Who's getting married to whom?

94
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,440
What kind of nonsense is this?
Is it really true?

95
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,170
It's true. He came to our house yesterday
to introduce himself.

96
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,580
I've seen everything now.

97
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,180
It's not entirely unexpected.

98
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,750
Kim Sun Jae always wanted
to marry Min Kyung Chae...

99
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,150
to become part of the owner's family.

100
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,890
That's not what I meant.
I'm just worried about you.

101
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,090
You're about to become mother-in-law
to that awful ex-boyfriend of yours.

102
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,530
Will you be okay?
Can you stand the sight of him?

103
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,070
- He's going to be even more insufferable.
- What can I do?

104
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,600
Right now, finding Chairman Min
is more important.

105
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,310
That's true.
Let them do whatever they want.

106
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,580
We need to find Min Doo Sik first.

107
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,850
Min Kyung Chae,
so you've forgotten my Ho Se...

108
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,090
and moved on to another man?

109
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,120
The only reason
I've put up with you until now...

110
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,890
was because you couldn't forget my son
and remained single for all those years.

111
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,830
But this changes everything.

112
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,210
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

113
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,380
I see you're wearing a ring
I haven't seen before.

114
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,280
I didn't know you were so observant,
Director Moon.

115
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,550
It's an engagement ring.

116
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,150
From Lawyer Kim.

117
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,260
- Lawyer Kim Sun Jae?
- Is there another Lawyer Kim?

118
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,020
Then...

119
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,290
Did you accept his proposal?

120
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,530
Is there a reason I shouldn't?

121
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,100
Do you not know what kind of person he is?

122
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,800
Why would you make that decision...

123
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,700
Since when were you so concerned about me?

124
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,640
When I was removed as CEO...

125
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,810
and demoted to a regular employee
of the Online Business Team,

126
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,940
- I'll never forget how you treated me.
- That was...

127
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,550
I had no other choice.

128
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,320
Even if I could go back,
I would do the same thing.

129
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,260
I still believe that I was doing
what was best for my team.

130
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,160
True.

131
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,790
That stubbornness is part of your charm.

132
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,660
You should've been this nice to me
a long time ago.

133
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,670
I believe I gave you several chances.

134
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,300
What do you mean...

135
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,670
Not as your CEO,

136
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,640
but as a woman to a man,

137
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,740
I gave you several chances.

138
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,710
But every single time,
the one who rejected me...

139
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,950
was you, Moon Tae Kyung.

140
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,530
I hear you're marrying Ms. Min.

141
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,840
She's been the acting chairman
for a while now.

142
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Why are you still calling her "Ms. Min?"

143
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,570
Can't you use the proper title?

144
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,540
- So you've finally achieved your dream?
- What's wrong?

145
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,750
Am I not allowed to achieve my dream?

146
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,720
Even a dragon can come
from the humblest beginnings.

147
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,790
A person's environment is important,

148
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,020
but it's not everything.

149
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,790
It's a shame that your strong will
wasn't put to better use.

150
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,530
What are you talking about?

151
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,370
If you're jealous, just say so.
It's more human.

152
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,440
If this were the old days,
it'd be like I'm becoming the king's man.

153
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
Of course, you'd be jealous.

154
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm not sure
there's a reason to be jealous.

155
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,310
And with the chairman gone,

156
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,110
must you rush such a major event?

157
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,950
There you go again with that lecturing.

158
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,650
Such a typical boomer.

159
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,990
Anyway, with a happy event ahead of me,

160
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,320
I'll be generous and tolerate it.

161
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,760
What exactly are you tolerating?

162
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,560
Haven't we had our share of arguments?

163
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,960
But they all happened
while we were each working hard...

164
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,630
doing our jobs, so...

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,570
I'm saying I forgive everything.

166
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,870
You forgive me?

167
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,340
Yes, I do.

168
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,240
Not knowing I was about to level up
and join the owner's family,

169
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,940
you acted high and mighty in front of me,

170
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,450
but I'll forgive everything.

171
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,160
Your sins...

172
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,090
are forgiven.

173
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,550
Do you know that Kim Sun Jae
and Min Kyung Chae are getting married?

174
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,550
It looks like they are about to start
working as a team in earnest.

175
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,860
Once they marry, Kim Sun Jae's shares
will go directly to Min Kyung Chae.

176
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,590
I suppose so. That's the only way...

177
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,560
to defend their management rights
against any variables.

178
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,000
You said one month, right?

179
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,660
That we have to find
Chairman Min Doo Sik within a month?

180
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,770
- Yes.
- Then to take back...

181
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,570
their management rights,

182
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,940
we must rescue Chairman Min Doo Sik...

183
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,910
and get his shares.

184
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,080
I would give whoever gets me
out of here...

185
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,880
all of Mingang Distribution
without a second thought.

186
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,750
I don't care who it is.

187
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,120
Please, someone, find me.

188
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,060
Please.

189
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,500
Or this will be
where I, Min Doo Sik, lie to rest.

190
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,780
Why is there so much stuff?

191
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,480
She just collects it
and never throws anything away.

192
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,850
Ms. Se Ri,
bring anything you want to throw away.

193
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,790
We'll toss it all
when we clean the storage.

194
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,520
Manager Gong, how can you be
in the right mind to do this now?

195
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,560
Aren't you worried about Dad?

196
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,260
You're acting like you know where he is.

197
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,030
What would I know?

198
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,000
As for the chairman...

199
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,370
Ms. Kyung Chae said
she hired people to look for him.

200
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,710
I should gather more
and do it all at once later.

201
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,980
I should hurry and prepare
for Ms. Kyung Chae's engagement.

202
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,880
But I don't like Lawyer Kim.

203
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,480
This is Ms. Kyung Chae's decision.

204
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,990
I don't know about anyone else,
but at least you should support her.

205
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,660
What? That brat Sun Jae
is getting married?

206
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,400
And to your eldest sister-in-law?

207
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm telling you, he is.
He came to greet us all, and it was chaos.

208
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,910
My goodness. How can he get married...

209
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,040
without a single word to his only aunt?

210
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,580
I'm his only living blood relative.

211
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,510
Is that anything new?

212
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,480
That brat Sun Jae lost all his manners
a long time ago.

213
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,120
Still, this is too much.

214
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,830
What will I tell my sister
when I meet her in the afterlife?

215
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,600
What nonsense are you spouting?

216
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,940
How would you meet her? She'll be
in a place of honor for being good,

217
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,940
while you'll be barely hanging on
at the edge of ruin.

218
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,170
What? Are you finished?
You handsome old geezer!

219
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,780
Why are you two like this?
He was just trying to cheer you up, Mom.

220
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,480
Dad was only joking.

221
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,950
I have to go see Sun Jae.
He can ignore everyone else, but not me.

222
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,790
How can he be all alone at the wedding?

223
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,150
Is he trying to show off he's an orphan?

224
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,190
- Stop it.
- Mom, don't.

225
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,260
He won't see you just because you show up.

226
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,930
Do you not know what Sun Jae is like?

227
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,730
Yes, Ja Kyung is right about that.
He's a heartless, cold, and cruel guy.

228
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,940
Even if you visit him a thousand times,
he'll ignore you and refuse to see you.

229
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,070
So I can't even go to
my only nephew's wedding?

230
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,770
This is all messed up!

231
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,190
We need to talk. Come to my office.

232
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,030
(Mingang Distribution)

233
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,130
What is it now?

234
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,900
Give up on marrying Min Kyung Chae.

235
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,770
Please, let's not get tangled up together.

236
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,810
I'm already part of the Min family,
but you can still get away.

237
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,580
You've got some nerve.

238
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,650
Why is it okay for you but not for me?

239
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,250
Frankly, I'm in a better position.

240
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,220
You married an old man 20 years older
and became his fourth wife.

241
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,860
I'm marrying a woman with no children
who has never been married.

242
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,490
What did you say?

243
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,960
Min Kyung Chae
is fundamentally different...

244
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,770
from a shameless woman like you,
who lies to everyone around her...

245
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,640
and had a child the father didn't want.

246
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Do you hear me?

247
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,470
If I'm shameless,
Min Kyung Chae is even worse.

248
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,410
At least I registered my daughter as mine,
not someone else's.

249
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,450
What are you talking about?

250
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,380
Min Kyung Chae, the woman you worship?

251
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,050
She secretly had another man's child
and registered the baby as her father's.

252
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,020
She's pretending to be
the child's half-sister.

253
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,460
Hard to believe, isn't it?

254
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,730
But what can you do...

255
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,100
when it's the truth?

256
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,370
That's ridiculous.
Are you making up a cheap soap opera plot?

257
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,170
Min Se Ri...

258
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,040
is Min Kyung Chae's real daughter.

259
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,770
She had her in secret 20 years ago...

260
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,510
and passed her off
as Chairman Min Doo Sik's own child!

261
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,780
You must be desperate.

262
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,120
If you don't want to be my mother-in-law,
then leave.

263
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,420
Why are you making up lies?

264
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,920
Don't believe me if you don't want to.

265
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,960
Go ahead and be a fool,
trusting a woman who has deceived you.

266
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,060
Just think about how overprotective
Kyung Chae has been...

267
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,230
with her so-called sister, Se Ri.

268
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,560
See if it all adds up.

269
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,940
So call off the wedding.

270
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,710
Min Kyung Chae?
She doesn't intend to give you her heart.

271
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,180
Would she genuinely care about you
when she already has a biological child?

272
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,750
And she'll leave her company and fortune
to Se Ri.

273
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,950
There won't be a single penny for you.

274
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,620
That's motherly love.

275
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,090
I know that feeling...

276
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,620
better than anyone.

277
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,540
Baek Sul Hee, you think I'd believe you?

278
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
What kind of cheap, made-up drama is that?

279
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,780
Let's say Min Kyung Chae
had an intense first love...

280
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,650
and that she had a thing with the guy
who drew her portrait.

281
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,750
But how can she spout such nonsense
that Se Ri is Kyung Chae's daughter?

282
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,620
What on earth...

283
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,420
is Ms. Se Ri to you?

284
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,430
Both your younger sisters.

285
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,060
Aren't they the same to the chairman?

286
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,130
They're both illegitimate,
yet you treat them differently.

287
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,000
Se Ri is changing day by day.

288
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,340
She's becoming too dependent
on that woman.

289
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,770
Well, Se Ri is the bigger problem,
not my father.

290
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,980
Right now, I want her gone more
for Se Ri's sake than for my father's.

291
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,080
So what are you so worried about now?

292
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,680
That I'm going to lose her.

293
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,020
What's the use? She has it all.

294
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,460
The CEO position, the company shares,
and the chairman's favor.

295
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,530
And even Se Ri.

296
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,700
No way.

297
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
Yes.

298
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,610
Right now?

299
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,090
Let's just have a meal with our families
instead of a formal engagement ceremony.

300
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,630
This weekend at two o'clock,
at the Sereno Hotel.

301
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,560
Can I ask you one thing?

302
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,430
What is it?

303
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,870
Ms. Se Ri...

304
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,070
What does she mean to you?

305
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,770
Didn't I tell you?

306
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,970
She's special to me.

307
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,540
I've told you more than once.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

308
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,680
Then what would you do
if something were to happen to Se Ri?

309
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,320
I don't even want to think about it,

310
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,050
but if something happened to her,
I wouldn't be able to live.

311
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,590
And I'd never forgive the one responsible.

312
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,990
Isn't that a bit of an overreaction?

313
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,360
Anyone would think you're her mother,
not her sister.

314
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,600
She's like a daughter to me.

315
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,270
She's as precious to me as Mingang.

316
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,240
She's as precious as Mingang?

317
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,240
So...

318
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,940
You should be good to Se Ri too, Mr. Kim.

319
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,550
Treat her even better than you treat me.

320
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,010
Think of yourself...

321
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,750
not as her brother-in-law,
but as her father.

322
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,560
Is that so?

323
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,630
That's actually for the best.

324
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,370
You needed to have at least one flaw.

325
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,100
That way, you can't go back
on your word later.

326
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,940
You were always so perfect
and untouchable.

327
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,840
But now I've finally found your weakness.

328
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,520
This weekend?

329
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,520
It seems a little sudden,

330
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,390
but if it's what you wish,
Ms. Kyung Chae, so be it.

331
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,430
I'll make the arrangements.

332
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,930
Saturday, the Sereno Hotel.

333
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,870
It moves me deeply to be able...

334
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,340
to see your engagement ceremony,
Ms. Kyung Chae.

335
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,140
Kyung Chae's engagement party?

336
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Vice Director Min.

337
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,080
No, wait. This is personal,
so I'll call you my brother-in-law.

338
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,620
Ji Seop, just so you know,
Kyung Chae and I...

339
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,920
are getting engaged this weekend
at the Sereno Hotel.

340
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,060
Did you call her Kyung Chae?

341
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,430
And what? You're getting engaged?

342
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,330
This isn't something
that can be whipped up.

343
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,700
What's the big rush?

344
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,970
We should take care of it
while we're on the topic.

345
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,000
She may be the acting chairman,

346
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,300
but she still has a lot on her plate.

347
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,270
And Director Moon,

348
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,470
if you have time,
you should come and congratulate us...

349
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,110
and enjoy a meal with us.

350
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,360
(Mingang Distribution)

351
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,360
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

352
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,780
You don't seem very happy to see me.

353
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,480
Well, did you expect me
to welcome you with open arms?

354
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,150
We're not exactly on those terms, are we?

355
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,160
That's true.

356
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,490
But regardless of anyone else,

357
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,660
I felt I had to come
and tell you, Ms. Jang.

358
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,330
This weekend,

359
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,430
Kyung Chae and I are getting engaged
at the Sereno Hotel.

360
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,470
I'd like you to come and grace the event
with your presence if you have time.

361
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,240
Why would you invite me
when we're not even close?

362
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,240
Don't you know what it means
better than anyone?

363
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,080
It means that Min Kyung Chae
is my woman now.

364
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,950
And that I have no intention
of letting another man have her.

365
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,250
Lingering feelings...

366
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,750
are only for when the person
is still alive.

367
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Isn't that right?

368
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Well then, I'll see you there.

369
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,500
Is he trying to rub salt in my wounds?

370
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,490
What's the point of having kids...

371
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,160
when none of them are
even trying to find out...

372
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,920
whether their father is dead or alive.

373
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,330
Lucia.

374
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,730
You have to find me.

375
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,140
At this rate, I'm going to die.

376
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,070
Lucia.

377
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,510
Lucia.

378
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,780
Lucia...

379
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,010
You have one month.

380
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,420
If my father doesn't return in a month,

381
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,120
don't forget you promised
to leave on your own.

382
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,330
Kim Sun Jae invited me himself.

383
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,640
The nerve of him.

384
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,240
He was probably concerned
about Min Kyung Chae's ex-boyfriend.

385
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,150
He may not have proof, but he must suspect
Jung Ho Se is your son.

386
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,420
He was probably trying to brag.

387
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,850
He told me Min Kyung Chae is
his woman now. Unbelievable.

388
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,390
Who knew I'd see the day
when I'd be invited...

389
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,960
to my son's ex-girlfriend's
engagement party?

390
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,130
How messed up is that?

391
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,060
I know. It's so childish of him
to invite you.

392
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,640
The traffic department just checked
the traffic cameras from that day.

393
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,310
We've confirmed the route
Chairman Min's sedan took.

394
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
You did?

395
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,610
Where is it? Let's go together.

396
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,280
I'm going too.

397
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,960
The engagement party is soon.
You should go home and rest today.

398
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,890
I have too many urgent documents
to review right now.

399
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,130
Don't worry.
The engagement will happen no matter what.

400
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,830
I'm not worried about the party
being canceled.

401
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,870
I'm worried about my woman.
You look tired.

402
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,500
Your woman?

403
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,440
I can take care of myself,
so you can go home.

404
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,680
All right. I'll head out first.

405
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,450
Don't overwork yourself.

406
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,160
She must be having second thoughts
about the engagement.

407
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,830
Min Kyung Chae.

408
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,600
I can never let you go. Not after
I worked so hard for this chance.

409
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,880
Can I see you for a moment?

410
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,350
No.

411
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,290
Your eldest sister asked me
to take good care of you.

412
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,490
To treat you even better than I treat her.

413
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,360
She said I should treat you...

414
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,960
like a daughter
rather than my sister-in-law.

415
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,130
- Did she really say that?
- Of course.

416
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,800
That's why I'm trying my best,
so come meet me.

417
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,150
Why do you insist on meeting
when I said no?

418
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,480
Since you're here, just eat.

419
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,120
You ordered without even asking.

420
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,190
- Why are you speaking to me casually?
- Can't I?

421
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,990
I'm about to be your brother-in-law.

422
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,490
Actually, your father.

423
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,590
Since I'm your mother's man.

424
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,000
Brother-in-law? Please.

425
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,270
You never know with a couple
until they're at the altar.

426
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,140
You must be hungry. Go ahead and eat.

427
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,810
If you don't eat,

428
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,480
I'll call your big sister over.

429
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,290
You need to listen to me
and we have to get along...

430
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,560
so I can tame Min Kyung Chae.

431
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,030
After all, you're now my trophy.

432
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,280
Are you left-handed?

433
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,550
Why do you ask?

434
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Is there a problem?

435
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,150
No, not at all.

436
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,990
It’s just that I am, too.

437
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,570
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

438
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,520
Meeting Se Ri today made me determined
to proceed with the marriage.

439
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,720
Oddly enough,
she doesn't feel like a stranger.

440
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,960
What did you just say?

441
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,660
What makes you any different?

442
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,360
Once they're engaged, the world is theirs.
What could possibly stop them?

443
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,970
I can't be pushed aside like this.

444
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,270
Has anyone else contacted you?

445
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,700
Chairman Min must be trying to escape
using any means he can.

446
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,140
I heard you took Se Ri out.

447
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,980
Even if Se Ri is your secret daughter,
I'm okay with it.

448
