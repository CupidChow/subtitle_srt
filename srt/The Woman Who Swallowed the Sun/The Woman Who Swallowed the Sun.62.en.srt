1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,170
This...

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,640
(Episode 62)

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,710
It belongs to Chairman Min Doo Sik.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,750
Really?

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,620
Are you sure?

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,990
Absolutely sure it's
Chairman Min Doo Sik's?

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,160
If I don't recognize it, who would?

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,290
I'm certain.

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,330
So it was him after all...

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,870
And do what? Go and confront him?

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Let go of me.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,470
So I'm just supposed to do nothing?

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,010
How can I?
Not after what Min Doo Sik did to Pil Doo.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,710
Are you going to go in and punch him?
Or grab him by the collar?

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,720
If that would help, I wouldn't stop you.
In fact, I'd even help you.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,120
But you know it's not that simple.

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,690
That's not going to solve anything.

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,680
This bloody handkerchief...

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,580
It can't be used to punish Min Doo Sik.

20
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,620
You know that.

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,490
You know how he'll retaliate.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,290
How could anyone...

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,290
do something this cruel?

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,310
Right now, this isn't just
about punishing Min Doo Sik.

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,310
We have to take away Mingang Distribution,
which he built on others' suffering.

26
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,010
To Chairman Min Doo Sik,
Mingang is his entire life.

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,990
If Mingang collapses, he'll self-destruct.

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,060
And then the whole truth will be revealed
to the world.

29
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,930
The shares in this company
that belonged to your parents...

30
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,400
you have to get them back.

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,270
My parents...

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
had shares?

33
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,580
That's right.

34
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,480
So just be patient
for a little while longer.

35
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,420
It's what your parents would've wanted.

36
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,530
That Min Doo Sik... What a monster.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,900
Tae Kyung must be devastated.

38
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,370
He's been holding on all this time,
just for that one person's testimony.

39
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,470
Now that our only witness is gone,

40
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,240
things just got a lot harder.

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,280
What if there's no way
to prove his parents' innocence now?

42
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,750
We may not have a witness,
but we still have one piece of evidence.

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,590
His parents' contract is in
Tae Kyung's landlord's safe.

44
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,820
That's why you said he moved
into that house on purpose, right?

45
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,090
Then he should have stolen it by now.

46
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,260
You know Tae Kyung isn't
that kind of person.

47
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,570
You're right. Tae Kyung wouldn't do
something like that.

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,100
Then I guess someone
who's capable has to do it.

49
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,040
What are you planning on doing?

50
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,580
I want to see Min Doo Sik's downfall...

51
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,440
just as much as you do.

52
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,110
I can't just stand idly by, can I?

53
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,090
My arms, legs, shoulders, knees...
Everything aches.

54
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,190
Honey, can you give me a massage
right here?

55
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,530
Forget it.
I feel like I'm dying too. Seriously.

56
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,760
Here, this should help with the fatigue.

57
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,100
Thank you.

58
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,700
This is absolute hell.
It's not like we're the housekeepers.

59
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,940
She's so arrogant
because she has Father backing her up.

60
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,810
This is exactly why you have to be careful
who you let into the family.

61
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,880
That nobody who just waltzed in here.

62
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,750
Well, if you're going to point fingers,
your father is the one to blame.

63
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,880
It's absurd for him to remarry
at his age. Seriously!

64
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,950
What's this little get-together about?

65
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,690
Talking about me, were you?

66
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,760
If you have something to say,
say it to my face.

67
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,000
Did I do something wrong?

68
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,170
Well, since you brought it up,
I'll say it.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,600
You just got here. Who do you think
you are, acting like you own the place?

70
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,710
Making us do housework
was crossing a line.

71
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,580
And your tone of voice.

72
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,940
I'm still older than you, you know.

73
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,880
You have no right to talk to me
like I'm a child.

74
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,250
Manager Gong,
do you have something to add?

75
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,350
Oh, no, I just...

76
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,090
Go on. You have plenty of complaints.

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,490
It'd be weird if you didn't
in this situation.

78
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,100
I would just ask that you respect the way
things are done in this house.

79
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,530
Alright, now it's my turn.

80
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,940
I heard from the agency,

81
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,710
this family is seen
as a bunch of pushovers.

82
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,940
They say we're clueless when they are lazy
and we'll pay them whatever they ask.

83
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,950
I was so humiliated when I heard that.

84
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,950
How can an employer be treated
like a fool...

85
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,220
by the very people they're paying?

86
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,120
Like I said,
you have to know the work to assign it.

87
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,460
I'm not saying
we shouldn't hire a housekeeper.

88
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,200
Is it so much to ask that we learn
the ropes so we can manage them properly?

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,200
And it's ridiculous for a parent and child
to bicker about who's older.

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,600
Besides, the chairman said
I could be informal.

91
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,540
"This family's way of doing things?"

92
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,880
If being pushovers is this family's style,
don't you think it's time for a change?

93
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,020
Here's the information
on the male employees you asked for.

94
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,750
But why do you need this all of a sudden?

95
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,990
These have all been vetted, right?

96
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,230
There's no way one of them could be using
a fake identity, right?

97
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,830
No, that's impossible.

98
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,760
We verify their information upon hiring
and collect all relevant documentation.

99
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,100
But is there some kind of problem?

100
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,880
Ever since I started drinking this,
I've been sleeping like a baby.

101
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,710
You fall asleep, and before you know it,
it's morning.

102
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,720
They say a good night's sleep is the key
to good health.

103
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,150
You have no idea how much healthier
you look these days.

104
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,860
It's like you're getting younger
every day.

105
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,760
In spirit, maybe.

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,390
But because I'm out like a light
every night,

107
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,730
I don't get to spend any time with you.

108
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,760
Don't you worry about me.

109
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,470
I'm happy just watching over you
while you sleep.

110
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,140
Oh boy. Is that drink kicking in already?

111
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,240
Gosh, my eyelids feel like lead.
I think I'd better go lie down.

112
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,080
Oh, dear. Oh, boy.

113
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,280
Gosh, I'm so tired.

114
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,650
You cruel man.

115
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,290
How could you just crush
Tae Kyung's last hope like that?

116
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Just you wait.

117
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,090
Before long,
your sins will come back to choke you.

118
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,540
Dad sure is a lucky man.

119
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,480
To have someone who dotes on him
so devotedly.

120
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,010
Of course.
I have to take good care of him.

121
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,410
Isn't that right, dear?

122
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,950
"Dear?"

123
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,950
You haven't forgotten our deal, have you?

124
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,120
You're supposed to get Father's shares
and give them to me, no matter what.

125
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,690
I only just got married.
Stop being so impatient.

126
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,660
The more you want something,
the more you need to learn to be patient.

127
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,600
I know.

128
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,440
That's why I'm being so patient, see?

129
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,070
Stepmother.

130
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,530
You and Soo Jung still seem quite close.

131
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,330
You two were so tight before the wedding.

132
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,630
Is there something wrong
with getting along?

133
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,140
I just worry that such a good relationship
won't last.

134
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,970
- Worried about what?
- Just a general concern.

135
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,910
You never know what might happen.

136
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,940
That's just how relationships are.

137
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,390
Has she been doing anything suspicious
around the house?

138
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
No.

139
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,330
But, Ms. Kyung Chae...

140
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,060
Now that they're married,

141
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,130
what if the chairman gives her some stock?

142
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,400
That's not going to happen,
so don't worry.

143
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,670
She's the type to give up any shares...

144
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,140
just to marry my father.

145
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,010
Really? So she's all bark and no bite.

146
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,780
So if we all stick together
and refuse to accept her as the lady here,

147
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,880
she'll be just his woman in this house,

148
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,420
and leave with nothing when she gives up.

149
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,190
That's exactly right.

150
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,090
Whew. I feel like a huge weight
has been lifted off my chest.

151
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,490
Good grief. The nerve of her.

152
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,600
(Mingang Distribution)

153
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,580
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

154
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,810
Yes, Secretary Kim.

155
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,750
Go to my home and get an outfit
from Manager Gong.

156
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,350
Tell her it's for the leaders' meeting.

157
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,090
What do you think you're doing?

158
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,760
Didn't you hear me?

159
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,970
What does it look like I'm doing?

160
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,240
Why did you enter our room without asking
and go through the chairman's clothes?

161
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,370
I'm following the chairman's orders.
He told me to get his meeting outfit.

162
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,040
Step aside. I'll do it.

163
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,350
Sir, I got the call from your driver
and was preparing your outfit,

164
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,320
but your wife insists on doing it herself.

165
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,960
I'm not sure she understands the event,

166
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,760
or knows what attire is right,

167
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,230
but since she insists,
should I let her do it?

168
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,470
I'll just step aside, then.

169
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,840
Yes, sir. One moment.

170
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
It's for you.

171
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Yes, dear.

172
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,580
Let Manager Gong handle it.
That's her specialty.

173
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Okay.

174
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,560
She just lives off his empty flattery,

175
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,760
liable to be kicked out broke at any time.

176
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,730
The nerve of her, trying to steal my job.

177
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Manager Gong?

178
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
I need to use the restroom.

179
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,580
The first-floor bathroom isn't clean.
Use the one on the second floor.

180
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,610
Follow me.

181
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,570
What in the world?
What's gotten into Manager Gong?

182
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,140
What?
Is this some kind of joke or something?

183
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,270
(Mingang Distribution)

184
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,570
Unbelievable.

185
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,750
I was in such a rush getting here.
I'm not too late, am I?

186
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,420
What are you doing here?
You didn't even call.

187
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,520
When your driver left, I went to the room,

188
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,760
and your outfit was still there.

189
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,290
I think Manager Gong
must've gotten confused.

190
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,430
You know how it is with women her age.

191
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,870
That's not something to be confused about.
What does she even do all day?

192
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,770
I keep telling her she's doing a good job,
and now she's gotten complacent.

193
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,340
Gosh, what would I have done without you?

194
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,450
I don't care how busy you were.
What were you thinking, sending this?

195
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,260
I sent that?

196
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,560
If not you, who else?

197
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,330
Did you want me to show up in my pajamas?

198
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,860
Why would I do that?

199
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,500
That's not true, sir.

200
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,670
Would I ever do something like that?

201
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,670
It can happen. Anyone can make a mistake.

202
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,810
Excuse me?

203
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,740
I'm telling you, it wasn't me!

204
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,550
Don't be too hard on her.
It was an honest mistake.

205
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm sure she didn't do it on purpose.

206
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,880
Please, calm down and head inside.

207
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,120
Honestly.

208
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,020
But it wasn't me.

209
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,230
I didn't do it. You believe me, don't you?

210
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,170
- I'm not that kind of person.
- I know.

211
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,670
There's no way you'd make
that kind of mistake.

212
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,240
That woman...
She must have switched them on purpose.

213
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,580
What am I going to do?

214
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,310
The chairman is going to think
I'm losing it.

215
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,920
Surely he wouldn't think that.

216
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,350
Father will probably just chalk it up
to a simple mistake.

217
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,820
Surprised to hear from me out of the blue?

218
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,330
Not at all.

219
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,600
Lucia and I used to live together,
but now I'm all alone.

220
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,730
You must be heartbroken
that Lucia married Chairman Min Doo Sik.

221
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,940
But not as much as she is.

222
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,210
She had no other choice.

223
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,850
What's important is,

224
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,850
that depending on our next move,

225
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,820
we can speed up Lucia's return to you.

226
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,660
What is this?

227
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,000
Chairman Min Doo Sik's secret files.

228
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,270
The witness who was about to testify
was murdered over this,

229
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,510
so Lucia decided to hand it over.

230
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,810
She struggled to get it from Kim Sun Jae,

231
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,640
but she did it willingly, for you.

232
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,210
Do you see how she feels about you now?

233
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,100
Now, you need to trace the illegal funds
inside Mingang Distribution...

234
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,410
and find a way to put Min Doo Sik away
for white-collar crime.

235
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,740
A penny for your thoughts?

236
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,550
Kim Sun Jae and Min Kyung Chae.

237
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,720
First, drive a wedge between them.

238
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,580
Why are you staring at me like that?

239
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,450
Oh, it's nothing.

240
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,190
Ma'am, if you have a moment...

241
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,430
would you like to have a cup of tea?

242
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,560
This is unexpected from you.

243
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,860
All right.

244
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,330
Come to my office.

245
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,650
I must say, this is a surprise.

246
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,320
You asking me for tea.

247
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,290
To be honest,

248
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,660
it's just that Lawyer Kim
is always attached to your hip.

249
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,390
I've wanted to have a moment like this
for a while now.

250
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,030
And also because I have some concerns.

251
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,600
What kind of concerns?

252
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,040
It's about Lawyer Kim Sun Jae.

253
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,570
Of course, he's very capable,

254
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,410
and he has your trust and the chairman's.

255
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,440
So I'm a little hesitant to bring this up.

256
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,280
When I was in the States,

257
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,990
there was an incident where someone
on the legal team...

258
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,720
embezzled the owner's slush fund
that he was managing.

259
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,760
To the owner, it was dirty money,
so he couldn't even report it.

260
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,360
Losing everything and keeping it quiet,

261
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,230
it was enough to drive the owner crazy.

262
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,340
So, you're suggesting Lawyer Kim
is deceiving the chairman and me...

263
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,700
and lining his own pockets?

264
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,270
Of course not. That can't be happening.

265
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,680
But there's no harm in making sure.

266
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,950
Especially if it means
you can trust him more fully.

267
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,260
Why are you suddenly so close
with Ms. Min?

268
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,030
We've had our ups and downs
over the years.

269
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,100
We have quite a history.

270
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,240
- "We?"
- You of all people should know.

271
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,840
She's the one who brought me
into this company,

272
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,750
and she has been waiting for me.

273
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,780
Are you saying...

274
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,020
that the two of you have some kind
of special relationship?

275
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,750
Well, I don't know
if I'd call it "special,"

276
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
but our closeness didn't happen overnight.

277
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,690
That's not how it looks to me.

278
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,960
It looks more like you have
an ulterior motive.

279
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,330
If one of us has an ulterior motive,

280
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,570
wouldn't it be you, Mr. Kim?

281
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,070
If you say not, then fine.

282
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,070
But when someone changes overnight,

283
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,010
it's rarely a good sign.

284
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,780
Nothing about me has changed.

285
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,980
If it looks that way to you...

286
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,480
it must be because
the situation has changed.

287
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,960
Lawyer Kim is certainly capable,

288
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,070
and I hesitate to bring this up,

289
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,270
but there's no harm in making sure.

290
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,340
Especially if it allows you
to trust him more.

291
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,040
A man like Director Moon...

292
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,250
wouldn't say something like that
for no reason.

293
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,990
Hey, the weather's so nice.
Should we go do something fun?

294
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,860
Just the two of us?

295
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,660
Yep, just the two of us.

296
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,790
Okay.

297
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,330
Where to?

298
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Hold on.

299
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,300
No. They're talking
in Ms. Se Ri's room now.

300
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,640
Keep a close watch on her.

301
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,940
Especially what she might try
to pull with Se Ri.

302
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,040
Don't worry. I'm listening to everything.

303
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,150
If she misbehaves, I'll record it
and send the evidence to Chairman Min.

304
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,450
Yes, ma'am.

305
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,890
Who were you reporting to?

306
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,420
Was it Ms. Min?

307
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,160
I thought I told you to stop that.

308
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,530
As lady of this house, I'm warning you,
do this again and I won't let it slide.

309
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,870
Why aren't you answering me?

310
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,840
It's me.

311
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,110
I got the ledger from Ms. Jang.

312
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,340
That should be admissible as evidence...

313
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,680
if this goes to trial.

314
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,880
Would that really be enough?

315
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,720
You've seen what Min Doo Sik can do.

316
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,320
Living in the same house as that man...

317
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,750
Don't worry about me.

318
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,120
- I knew what I was getting into.
- I'm worried about you.

319
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,560
The man has blood on his hands.
Who knows what he's capable of?

320
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,070
Besides, you don't have anyone
on your side in that house.

321
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,500
Stop worrying about me
and just focus on your work, Tae Kyung.

322
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,070
And ask Ms. Jang for help if you need it.

323
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,670
Baek Sul Hee.

324
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,880
You know...

325
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,110
you're the only person
who knows who I really am.

326
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,450
About my parents' story...

327
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,650
and my pain.

328
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,020
You're the only one.

329
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,790
You're the only one for me too, Tae Kyung.

330
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,700
The one I'll love until the very end.

331
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,470
I have to go. Talk to you later.

332
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,070
- Who was that at this hour?
- Oh, just a friend.

333
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,940
Doo Sik, it's time for your medicine.

334
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,380
Oh, right.

335
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,160
Don't be so rude to Manager Gong.

336
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,300
What did you just say?

337
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,210
I said she's not someone
you can disrespect.

338
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,870
Say that again.

339
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,410
"You?"

340
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,480
Manager Gong is like family to us.

341
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,450
I said, say it again.

342
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,480
Did you really just address me like that?

343
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,820
Then what should I call you?

344
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,360
- Should I call you Stepmother?
- Go on! Let's hear you say it.

345
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,930
What's wrong?
Can't bring yourself to say it?

346
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,530
Are you crazy?

347
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,900
So you'd have to be crazy
to call me "Stepmother," is that it?

348
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,970
Eavesdropping like a little rat,
getting secret reports...

349
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,970
The one giving the orders
and the one following them...

350
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,510
Why are you so curious about
what I do in this house?

351
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,050
What do you hope to accomplish
by having Manager Gong spy on me?

352
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,950
So you can't pull another stunt
like switching the chairman's outfit.

353
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,220
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

354
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,630
You're only getting away with this...

355
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,730
because the chairman thinks
you're an angel.

356
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,000
You're one to talk,

357
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,500
making accusations
without a shred of proof.

358
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,510
You're lucky the chairman is asleep,
or this would be a lot worse.

359
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,280
- Or else I would've slapped you.
- You'd hit me?

360
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,510
You hit me, remember?

361
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,180
Don't you remember?

362
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,820
So what?
You're going to get your revenge now?

363
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,190
Not revenge. A lesson.
A lesson in manners.

364
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,190
You need to be taught
not to raise your hand to people.

365
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,490
On second thought,
the problem in this house isn't Se Ri.

366
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,530
It's you, the eldest daughter.

367
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,770
Well, you're certainly playing
the stepmother role to a T.

368
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,400
Sinking your claws into an old chairman,

369
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,770
it looks like you're enjoying
bossing around his grown children.

370
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,010
But I'm warning you.

371
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,180
If you ever disrespect Manager Gong again,

372
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,610
I won't let it slide.

373
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,530
Talk about being on pins and needles.
It was unbearable.

374
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,530
Seriously,
how can those two be exactly alike?

375
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,530
Well, Kyung Chae's always been like that,

376
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,800
but I never thought she would be too.

377
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,740
That's because someone is backing her.

378
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,440
When people get some power behind them,

379
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,210
they start to think they own the world.

380
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,610
So, do you call her "Stepmother?"

381
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,750
Ja Kyung, do you call her "Mother?"

382
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,750
What kind of slow-witted nonsense is that?

383
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,650
Stop talking such rot.
"Mother?" Don't make me laugh.

384
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,260
You could put a knife to my throat,
and I'd never call her "Mother."

385
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,560
Don't you dare.
It's bad enough she's freeloading here.

386
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,630
"Mother?" As if.

387
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,430
Goodness, what will you two do
if you get on the chairman's bad side?

388
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,940
Dad, just give him his job back already.

389
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,410
He needs to have some pull at work
so he can get some respect at home.

390
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,510
She's right, honey.
If you'll do it anyway, get it over with.

391
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,810
Yeah, come on, Dad!

392
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,450
- Father-in-law...
- Honey...

393
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,810
- Father-in-law...
- Dad!

394
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,920
All right, all right! Enough already!
What, did you all rehearse this?

395
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,150
Don't you worry.

396
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,760
I'll settle this once and for all
before the day is out.

397
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,600
Well, my fellow in-law, newlywed life
at your age must be sweet as honey.

398
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,970
You're glowing like a flower blooming
on a manure pile.

399
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,440
So what is this urgent business
you called me about?

400
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,480
Well now, someone's in a hurry.
Let's take our time.

401
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,780
Here, take this first.

402
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,650
It's bush clover. They say it can make
a sleeping elephant stand at attention.

403
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,950
I thought you might have some use
for it these days.

404
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,420
I have a meeting scheduled,
so if you'll excuse me.

405
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,660
But this is more vital than any meeting.

406
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,860
I'd be disappointed if you left now.

407
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,500
Now see here, my fellow in-law.

408
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:34,200
Isn't it about time
you gave our Ji Seop his job back?

409
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,080
And if you make me an outside director
at Mingang Distribution,

410
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,640
that would be just ducky.

411
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,350
No matter how busy you are,
you're going to want to see this.

412
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,760
President Hwang Kyung Soo
of Dowon Industries.

413
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,400
A while back, the man told me
he needed funds for his business,

414
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,170
so he came looking for me.

415
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,270
The collateral he put up at the time...

416
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,040
is this.

417
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,240
Not long after he put this up
and borrowed my hard-earned money,

418
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,080
CEO Han and his wife died
in a mysterious accident,

419
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,780
on the very same day,
at the very same time. So I heard.

420
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,550
But strangely enough, at some point,

421
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,920
this new technology ended up with Mingang.

422
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,430
Doesn't that strike you as a bit fishy?

423
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,090
The original owner is dead,

424
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,170
and the totally unrelated Chairman Min
gets his hands on the new technology,

425
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,900
and then Dowon Industries
gets taken over by Mingang.

426
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,810
Are you using this to blackmail me?

427
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,010
Blackmail?

428
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,740
Why would I do such a thing?

429
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,810
We're practically family.

430
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,920
Our children are married to each other.

431
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,500
Go ahead, tear it up.
Rip it! Rip it to shreds!

432
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,930
Rip it to shreds!
That'll solve everything, won't it?

433
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,870
If that were the original, yes.

434
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,340
But what a shame, it's just a copy.

435
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,440
Chairman Min.

436
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,240
Think about it carefully.

437
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,150
It's not that big of an ask, is it? Right?

438
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,220
Well?

439
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,060
Give me a call soon.
But be warned, I'm an impatient man.

440
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,030
Darn it all, I can't wait for long.

441
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,870
I'll be on my way.

442
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,340
I've fallen for Mingang.

443
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,240
Darn it!

444
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,460
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

445
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,740
Then go to your father-in-law tomorrow.

446
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,010
Tell him the Mingang director job is his.

447
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,580
But on one condition.

448
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,550
To Kim Sun Jae, I'm just
a stepping stone to move up in the world,

449
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,320
nothing more and nothing less.

450
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,920
If you bring up that secret ledger again
to rattle Ms. Min,

451
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,290
I won't let you get away with it.

452
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,560
I'm saying getting rid of you
would be nothing to me.

453
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,630
What do you think you're doing?
