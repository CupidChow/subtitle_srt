00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,910
Thinking about that girl gives me
a boost of dopamine, though.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,980
It was hilarious watching her
get beaten up.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,880
Tears and snot dripped everywhere...

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,790
and she even begged on her knees.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,150
It was awesome.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,230
Have you lost your mind?

7
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,840
You're not even human.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,810
How could you say that?

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,040
It's not fair that she died,

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,050
but to hear you say that about her?

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,680
Who the heck are you?

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,450
How dare you slap me?
Do you know who I am?

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,220
You must be punished for this.

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,120
I swear to take you down for what you did.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,590
Let go of me, you psycho!

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,660
Come with me. Beg and apologize to Mi So.

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,900
Kneel before her and ask for forgiveness.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,700
Let go of me!

to follow you just in case.

00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,470
Kyung Chae.

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,410
What happened to you?

24
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,970
Did someone slap you?

25
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,740
Don't even ask.

26
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,850
Some crazy woman attacked me in the lobby.

27
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,780
A crazy woman? Who?

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,320
How would I know who she is?

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,320
She could've killed me.

30
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,890
Why did you come here?

31
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,350
Why do you think?

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,090
You said you'd hire me
an assistant but haven't yet.

33
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,930
We can talk about that at home.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,030
You really don't know the woman?

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,230
A complete stranger
slapped you out of the blue?

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,070
I don't know anything.
How many times must I tell you?

37
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,640
It wouldn't have happened
if you'd made an appointment.

38
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,310
Why do you care if I come here or not?

39
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,040
You're just my sister's minion.

40
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,810
Se Ri.

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,950
What? I stated a fact.

42
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,050
Go home.

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
I don't want to. I'm scared.

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,520
What if I meet the crazy woman again?

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,120
Take my car home.

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,720
I'll call my driver.

47
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,790
Go.

48
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,370
The lobby CCTV must've captured it.
Let's check the footage first.

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,610
It's her.

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,680
Why did she come back here?

51
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,580
It works for us.

52
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,050
Use this to charge her
with assault and kidnapping of a minor.

53
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,550
Assault and kidnapping of a minor
means she could get a prison sentence.

54
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,990
She should.

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Report her immediately.

56
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,990
That's easy to do.

57
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,060
But then Ms. Se Ri's assault...

58
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,300
will come up during the trial.

59
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,500
I don't care.

60
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,030
You really don't care?

61
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,370
Her past will come to light.

62
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,040
We might lose more than we gain.

63
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,340
What should I do, then?
I can't let this woman get away with this!

64
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,750
What should we do about this now?

65
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,520
Things just got way out of hand.

66
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,190
She'll retaliate
now that you hurt her sister.

67
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,360
The law is the least of your worries.

68
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,400
What matters is that
you just infuriated Min Kyung Chae.

69
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,340
The law works on a certain kind of people.

70
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,050
Think about it.

71
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,280
What does she have to lose
by going to trial?

72
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,680
Let's say we get lucky and she goes away.
Would you be happy then?

73
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,050
It won't be a life sentence.

74
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,160
What's the point of a short one?

75
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
She'll get a record, at least.

76
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,230
Is that what you really want?
For her to have a record?

77
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,960
What should I do, then?

78
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,570
The law has its limits.

79
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,670
To be more exact,
the law won't provide you...

80
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,040
with what you want because it's too weak.

81
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,810
What do you want me to do, then?

82
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,640
Tell the bodyguards to stand down.

83
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,510
I'll sort it out with something
more effective than the law.

84
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,780
Something more effective than the law?

85
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,120
Very well. Give it a go.

86
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,510
To what do I owe this call, Mr. Kim?

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,480
I need someone taken care of.

88
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,010
I don't know what it's about,

89
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,680
but do you need a case opened?

90
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,080
No, it's not that kind of job.

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,750
I see.

92
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,850
Find her and detain her.

93
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,990
Stay here a few more days if you want.

94
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,670
You'll think of today every now and then.

95
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,840
You will even if you don't want to.

96
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,380
You'll feel angry and disappointed.

97
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,280
Right now,
you just sleepwalk and can't talk.

98
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,510
But later,
you could get a terminal illness.

99
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,750
When my son Ho Se died,

100
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,320
I wanted to punish the assailants
with the law as you did.

101
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,730
I believed that was the best way.

102
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,860
But the law was powerless.

103
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,770
That's why I decided
to take it into my own hands.

104
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,540
Come to me whenever you change your mind.

105
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,160

get beaten up.

106

Tears and snot dripped everywhere...

107
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,930
and she even begged on her knees.

108
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,770
It was awesome.

They left?

115
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,080
What a relief.

116
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,710
I should tell Sul Hee.

117
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,350
What?

118
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,730
Hello?

119
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,970
Are you with my sister right now? It's me.

Oh, I have something to tell you.

121

I'm taking your sister somewhere.

122
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,610
- Where to?
- Come on.

123
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,180
Can you put on my sister?

She wants to talk to you.

Baek Sul Hee. Come home right now
unless you want your sister to get hurt.

Don't think of calling the police.

127

You want him to pull over?

128
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,740
- Pull over on a shoulder.
- Okay.

129
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,420
I have to go to my sister.

130
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,220

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,100
You have to go now?

133
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,140
I'll get you a taxi, then.

134

Come to the airport when you're done.

How did it go? Did you find her?

145
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,710
Yes, of course. She came back voluntarily.

146
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,740
Okay. I'll be right there.

147
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,850
Where were you hiding until now?

148
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,420
My boss is really angry because of you.

149
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,130
Why act out like you're someone special?

150
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,300
Tell me why you keep making things worse.

151
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,830
She can't speak.

152
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,040
She has aphasia because of the shock.

153
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,700

154
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,770
Come with me.

155
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,150
Get up before I turn really nasty.

Where will you take her?

157
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,980
You can stay here with me.

158
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,700

159
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,630
You keep quiet.

160
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,270
Then nothing bad will happen.

161
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,100
I'll call the police.

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,340
Sorry.

I am an officer.

164
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,920
There's no point in asking now,

165
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,590
but your daughter wasn't mine, was she?

166
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,760
Just tell me...

167
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,100
You can't talk.

168
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,640
You're the same as you were 16 years ago.
You haven't changed at all.

169
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,410
You're still rash,
thoughtless, and irrational.

She's with me.

174
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,650
Put her on. I have something to tell her.

175
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,860
She's unable to speak, apparently.

176
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,230
She has aphasia.

177
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,060
Then put her on speaker.

178
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,060
She can hear me at least.

Listen up, Baek Sul Hee.

180
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,240
You blame us
for what happened to your daughter.

Blaming others
for their misfortune and misery.

182
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,080
That's what losers do.

183
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,210
Your daughter died
because she was a weakling.

184
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,650
You want to blame us for that,
but I won't have it.

185
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,390
Why must we be responsible
for the mess you people made?

186
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,720
Stop blaming us
and look back at what you did.

187
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,730
And show some remorse.

188
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,960
Think about whether...

189
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,700
you were a good mom
that your dead daughter could be proud of.

190
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,270
I don't care about what happened
to your daughter.

191
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,140
But I can't forgive you for ruining
an important Mingang event.

192
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,040
If you do wrong, you must pay the price.

193
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,680
Take her to the Yangpyeong holiday home.

194
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,380
Yes, Ms. Min.

195
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,220
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,790
(Meeting Point, West)

197
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,970
It's almost time.

198
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,500
Let's wait just a little longer.

199
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,910
I don't think she'll come.

200
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,880
No. She will come.

201
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,550
Why did you come back and cause a scene?

202
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,120
Wasn't ruining the launch enough?
Why did you attack the youngest?

203
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,890
You seem to think that's revenge.

204
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,430
Revenge isn't for anyone.

205
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
It takes a certain person to get revenge.

206
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,770
You'll never manage,
especially against these people.

207
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,640
Mingang is the biggest
distribution company in the country.

208
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,370
Do you even know how much it's worth?

209
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,710
It's worth...

210
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,780
Whatever.

211
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,650
You can never beat them,
so forget about your daughter.

212
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,050
What happened has happened,

213
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,590
and you can't turn back time.

214
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,090
How could you say that?

215
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,200
Even if the whole world does,

216
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,870
you of all people
shouldn't talk like that about Mi So.

217
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,470
Did you say last time
that I'd become their hound?

218
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,640
A dog that eats the scraps
they throw from the table?

219
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,550
You know what?

220
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,550
Lots of people
would love to be in my shoes.

221
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,620
They're all fighting for my spot.

222
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,330
Was her name "Mi So?"

223
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,060
If your smart daughter were alive,

224
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,670
she'd have worked hard for a fancy degree
and a job in a large company,

225
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,600
and you'd have jumped for joy
that she became successful.

226
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,540
I'm saying...

227
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,040
there's not much difference
between you and me, okay?

228
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,780
Don't do anything ever again.

229
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,220
You can never beat them in this life.

230
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,160
Kneel and beg my CEO
when she comes to the holiday home.

231
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,390
Say you'll live as quietly as the dead
if she'll be merciful and drop everything.

232
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,930
Who knows?

233
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,960
She might bless you out of pity.

234
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,320
What are you doing? Let go of the wheel!

235
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,920
Are you serious?

236
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,550
What are you doing?

237
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,360
Are you out of your mind?

238
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,490
Do you have a death wish?

239
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,540
Wait!

240
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,770
Let go!

241
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,570
Let go!

242
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,340
Darn it.

243
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,310
Stop it!

244
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,120
My gosh...

245
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,390
What the heck?

246
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,760
Hey. Where are you going?

247
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,900
Hey, Baek... Baek Sul Hee!

248
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,430
Wait!

249
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,100
Collision at our patrol location.

250
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,640
Darn it.

251
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,850
We really have to head in now.

252
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,790
Okay. Let's go.

253
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,570
Returning the pain...

254
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,610
you suffered is harder
and more dangerous than you think.

255
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,980
Hurting others...

256
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,450
sometimes requires hurting yourself.

257
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,050
You have to throw yourself
into the fight without thinking...

258
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,790
like a moth...

259
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,190
heading toward a flame,
knowing it will burn.

260
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,730
Can you still...

261
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,100
do it?

262
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
Okay, then.

263
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,310
Do you have your ID?

264
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,120
Do we have the time to get her photo taken
and apply for an emergency passport?

265
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,120
I think so, if we move fast.

266
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,060
Good.

267
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,900
And she got away?

268
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,800
Are you sure you didn't let her go?

269
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,300
- What on earth...
- It's something you'd do.

270
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,540
Am I wrong?

271
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,980
You're wrong.

272
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,240
I don't know where you got that idea,

273
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,310
but you can check my dashcam video,

274
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,850
or I'll arrange for you to meet
the officer who made the accident report.

275
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,250
Forget it. Why bother
when the damage is done?

276
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,890
I did mess up,
but I don't deserve the suspicion.

277
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,420
Don't feel wronged.

278
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,930
If I think a certain way, it means
you provided the cause for it.

279
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,630
What does that mean?

280
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,070
- You don't need to know.
- I need to know!

281
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,240
I once witnessed something odd.

282
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,380
Your attitude when she came to see me
about her daughter's incident.

283
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,910
Let me go so I can talk to her.

284
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,550
You two already knew each other.

285
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,790
No. You're mistaken.

286
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,090
Am I?

287
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,430
Why not ask for forgiveness instead?

288
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,130
That would be less of a disgrace.

289
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,860
You're wrong. Whatever it is you saw...

290
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,730
I'm innocent.

291
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,380
Director Moon.
Are you free tomorrow? It's a Saturday.

292
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,280
If you are, why not come over
for a meal with my family?

293
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,780
Father told me to invite you,
and I took my sweet time.

294
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,790
You're on my team now,
and I should look out for you.

295
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,790
Okay. See you tomorrow.

296
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,260
Fine.

297
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,970
If you doubt and suspect me
because I lost that woman,

298
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,400
the day Baek Sul Hee
appears before you again,

299
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,870
if that day ever comes,

300
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,510
I'll notice her first and deal with her.

301
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,540
Will that do?

302
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,200
You're on my team now,
and I should look out for you.

303
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,870
I'm just a hound...

304
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,500
who gets eaten up
after I've done my purpose?

305
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,980
It's all your fault, Sul Hee.

306
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,080
Don't ever let me see you again.

307
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,320
The moment I do, you're done for.

308
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,400
Are you ready to serve the guest tomorrow?

309
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,640
Yes, of course.

310
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,440
It would be easier
to decide what to cook...

311
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,370
if I knew what the guest liked.

312
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,940
He lived a long time in the US,
so how about Korean cuisine?

313
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,310
Okay. Since it's lunch,
I'll prepare something light.

314
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Okay.

315
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,320
It's Director Moon, isn't it?

316
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,560
I have a feeling
he'll be a good match for you.

317
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,660
I've never found someone
I like as much as you.

318
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,400
I'll prepare well
so you can make a good impression.

319
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,130
- Do that, please.
- Sure.

320
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,670
Do you know we're having a guest tomorrow?

321
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,410
What guest?

322
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,750
See? You're the only one
who doesn't know again.

323
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,680
They invited Director Moon.

324
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,720
Take tomorrow off.

325
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,320
You should be here to see what he's like.

326
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,490
I can't take leave on the day itself.

327
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,560
I need to apply in advance.

328
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,960
Then go to work in the morning
and leave early.

329
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Hi, Dad.

330
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,470
Is everything okay?

331
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,040
The new director is coming over tomorrow.

332
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,270
Father seems to
care about him a lot already.

333
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,680
Make sure Ji Seop doesn't feel intimidated
and gets the upper hand.

334
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,610
"The upper hand?"

335
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,780
Yes. "This company will be mine,
and so will this house."

336
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,220
He must make himself known.

337
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,550
Let's talk again soon.

338
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,720
That punk is my son-in-law's sworn enemy.

339
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,190
He took the spot
that should've been Ji Seop's.

340
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,430
Chairman Min is pretty thorough.
If he put the guy in charge,

341
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,460
he must be pretty competent.

342
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,030
You speak as if you just ate
a poisonous burger.

343
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,870
However competent the guy is,

344
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,700
my son-in-law is the rightful heir.

345
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,610
You can't compare the only son
in a pool of daughters to him.

346
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,840
Do you really think
we should pay for a rite?

347
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,680
We need the new director
to get on the chairman's bad side...

348
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,580
if Ji Seop is to get a shot.

349
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,150
A rite?

350
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,850
That's it. Good.

351
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,850
How much do shamans charge?

352
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,860
An effective rite will cost
a few tens of thousands of dollars.

353
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,360
Standing on the blade is the highlight,
but they only do it if you pay enough.

354
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,800
It's that expensive?

355
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,060
Is there anyone offering a discount?

356
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,970
Or will they charge less if I help out?

357
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,900
I'm sorry to tell you about it now.

358
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,840
It can't be helped,
and if she ran off like that,

359
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,110
she'd be in hiding,
which is just as stressful.

360
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,650
I'll do whatever it takes...

361
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,550
to find her and sort it out
so nothing you worry about will happen.

362
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,520
Keep your eyes wide open
and be on the lookout.

363
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,390
So you can recognize her first
even if she reappears in a disguise.

364
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,890
That's what I'm doing as well.

365
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,290
Are you talking about
the incident from 25 years ago?

366
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,860
If the son is foolish enough
to reappear to avenge his father,

367
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,470
I'll take him down first.

368
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,240
You be sure to keep your hands
on the blessing that rolled into your lap.

369
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,410
- What blessing?
- Moon Tae Kyung.

370
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,340
I'm a good judge of character.

371
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,810
He seems like a decent guy.
Make him yours as soon as possible.

372
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,480
You really think so?

373
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,010
He's not like Sun Jae.

374
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,380
Sun Jae will side
with anyone he can benefit from.

375
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,890
Welcome.

376
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,330
- Hello.
- Welcome, Director Moon.

377
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,030
This is my sister-in-law.

378
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,430
I see.

379
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,500
My gosh. You're lovely to look at.

380
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,710
Hey. You know me, don't you?

381
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
Yes, I do.

382
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,680
Why are you here, Mr. Pauper?

383
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,850
"Mr. Pauper?" Why do you call him that?

384
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,390
Because he's so poor...

385
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,020
that he has to use his miles
to upgrade to business class.

386
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,230
He's a boring lecturer
with high moral standards, too.

387
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,800
- You're here.
- Hello.

388
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,530
Welcome.

389
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,570
Thank you for the invitation.

390
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,540
It's even nicer to see you at home.

391
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,540
It's like welcoming back a long-lost son.

392
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,640
Your son's right here.

393
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,450
It's a figure of speech.

394
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,850
That's how happy I am to see him.

395
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,720
He's Kyung Chae's brother,
the general manager of the store.

396
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,890
I see. It's a pleasure to meet you.

397
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,130
Let's all go to the kitchen.

398
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,400
I took out a special bottle of liquor
to share with you.

399
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,400
We're like one big, happy family.

400
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,130
(4 years later)

401
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,310
Excuse me?

402
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Hello?

403
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,720
Ms. Jung Lucia?

404
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,850
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

405
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,760
If you don't think you can do it,
quit now.

406
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,330
You might threaten the whole of Mingang.

407
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,630
This is why Father brought me in!

408
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,060
You don't know what's what!

409
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,970
The new business must succeed,
whatever the cost.

410
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,400
That's how I can prove
I made the right choice to bring you in.

411
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,370
Every one of my kids
only cares for their own self.

412
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,910
How much do you trust Director Moon?

413
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,340
Did you join Mingang with another motive?

414
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,810
You did well over the past four years.

415
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,210
Are you sure you can do well
here in Korea, too?
