00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,240
(Episode 57)

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,410
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,820
Why? Am I here when I shouldn't be?

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,760
You look like you saw a ghost.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,790
How did you get here?

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,990
This can't be.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,930
I'm sorry to show up here
when I should be...

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,000
kidnapped and locked up somewhere else.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,740
What do you mean, "kidnapped?"

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,140
You don't know?

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,840
Who do you think
wanted me abducted and locked up?

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,150
Don't you dare frame me!

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,950
Why would I do that?

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,350
Then why did you lie to the chairman?

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,990
Why say I flew to the US?

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,290
That was...

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,090
I'll explain everything.

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,890
I didn't plan this.
I was worried about you.

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,030
Lots of rich businessmen
date the wrong women and lose everything.

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,430
I was afraid you would...

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,200
You dare lie to me?

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,370
And you call yourself my daughter?

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,470
I'm sorry, Father.

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,940
But I don't know anything
about the kidnapping or detention.

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,650
How could I plan
something as horrible as that?

26
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,120
This woman...

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,450
She went into hiding
to show up and frame me like this.

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,590
Is there proof that I was behind it?

29
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,960
The proof is right here.

30
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,430
Let's watch it together.

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,010
Explain that.

32
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,010
Lucia said the men mentioned Sun Jae.

33
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,680
Everyone knows he works for you.

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,890
That means it was your idea!

35
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,590
No, Father.
I don't know anything about it.

36
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,660
Lawyer Kim did it on his own.
It had nothing to do with me.

37
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,890
Get out.

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,160
- Father.
- Get out!

39
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,680
(Mingang Distribution)

40
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,790
How did she get here?

41
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,690
He told me she was locked up.

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,100
Come to my office immediately.

43
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,310
Lucia is in the chairman's office
right now.

44
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,980
She gave the chairman
a video showing her kidnapping.

45
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,180
Explain what happened.

46
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,350
Actually...

47
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,590
If what you told me was true,
she should be locked up...

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,760
and halfway to death's door.

49
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,360
Did you lie to me?

50
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,530
Answer me.

51
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,700
Did you lie to me?

52
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,940
Things went badly wrong.

53
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,710
You kept your mouth shut
instead of telling me?

55
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,720
- Do you think that little of me too?
- I don't.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,120
No?

57
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,820
The truth is out because of you.

58
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,160
My father knows everything.

59
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,590
Everything goes wrong because I allow
a moron like you to work for me.

60
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,330
This happened before, didn't it?

61
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,840
Four years ago, you tried
and failed to kidnap another woman.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,240
You have a track record.

63
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,010
Why did I forget that?

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,950
You always mess up and lose things.
That's the only thing you can do.

65
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,580
Ms. Min.

66
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,090
Get out.

67
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,720
I don't want to see you again.

68
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,840
Baek Sul Hee.

69
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,040
I didn't think
you'd become such a big hindrance.

70
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,950
Just you wait.

71
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,950
Forget the Mingang people.
I'm coming after you myself.

72
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,190
I was pleased to hear from you again,
but I was more shocked.

73
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,730
You said you had proof
Kyung Chae had organized it,

74
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,030
and I felt lost as to what to do.

75
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,600
I know how you must've felt.

76
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,940
Water can never flow upward.

77
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,640
Even if a child harms a parent,
the parent can't punish their own child.

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,180
How do you know the feeling
when you don't have a child?

79
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,890
That's why I thought hard about
whether I should show you...

80
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,120
the video of what happened.

81
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,060
Still, I thought you should know.

82
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,360
I should.

83
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,360
A father must know
what bad things his children have done.

84
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,230
I'm too ashamed to face you.

85
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,300
I'm the reason you got into trouble.

86
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,110
Don't say that. You mean so much to me.

87
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,870
I don't mind if I get hurt.

88
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,480
I was more afraid
that I'd never see you again.

89
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,150
That was the only thing I feared.
Nothing else mattered.

90
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,380
You're more of a man than most.

91
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,250
You say that
when you escaped a kidnapping?

92
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,790
Seeing you again...

93
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,860
made the fear and sorrow melt away.

94
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,320
Are you all right? Were you hurt?

95
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,990
I'm more worried about you.

96
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,390
Me?

97
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,820
I have a fist of steel.

98
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,330
This isn't the time to joke.

99
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,830
From now on, for my sake at least,
don't let Kim Sun Jae bother you.

100
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,270
How am I to put up with it?

101
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,540
I know...

102
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,240
what you'll choose in the end.

103
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,510
I see that ring so many times a day.

104
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,680
I wish to talk you out of it,
and I will keep trying to.

105
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,190
But then, part of me feels torn
because I wonder...

106
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,060
if that really is the best option.

107
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,630
Whatever it is, I don't care.
It's not completely over yet.

108
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,900
Whatever decision you make,

109
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,510
know that I'll do my best to stop you.

110
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,180
And most importantly,

111
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,080
I won't let anyone hurt you.

112
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,290
You're going to seduce the old man...

113
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,620
and become his wife?

114
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,230
You have no time to threaten me.
The chairman is out to get you.

115
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,400
You dared to try
to kidnap me and lock me up.

116
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,630
You don't see the whole picture.

117
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,770
Min Doo Sik can't fire me.

118
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,840
He will be furious,

119
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,440
but I hold all his secrets.

120
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,170
His slush fund, window-dressed ledgers,
and shell companies. He needs me.

121
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,910
Without my help,
prosecutors can come after him tomorrow.

122
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,350
And who do you think has that ledger?

123
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,350
If you release that,
I'll go public that you're Baek Sul Hee.

124
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,860
Then we both go down.

125
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,760
I might not be able to get you fired,
but I can harass you a bit.

126
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,860
So you'll harass me?

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,530
Do you think I can't?

128
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,270
You'll kneel before me very soon.

129
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,780
This is such simple fare.

130
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,710
I know it's just us, but still.

131
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,710
Why doesn't the side dish lady come by?

132
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,520
She quit.

133
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,720
Who will bring us food, then?

134
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,120
You and I will have to cook for everyone.

135
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,060
Are you insane? Why would I do that?

136
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,560
Manager Gong.
Why are you bossing me about?

137
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,860
You're acting like a mother-in-law.

138
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,300
Can't I ask for some help with cooking?

139
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,870
How long has it been
since you moved in here?

140
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,770
I've been here for around 30 years.

141
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,340
My gosh.

142
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,810
Do you want to pull rank on me?

143
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,510
The chairman hates having strangers over
more than anything,

144
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,650
so I'm asking for help because I can't
cook for such a big family on my own.

145
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,320
Does that bother you that much?

146
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,320
It does bother me that much.

147
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,690
I'd try to cooperate
if you were my mother-in-law,

148
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,330
but you aren't, so I won't.

149
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,800
If you want to put me to work,
marry my father-in-law first.

150
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,680
I wondered why I hadn't heard from you.
You'd been in a car accident.

151
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,250
Are you all right now?

152
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,610
Yes.

153
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,180
Gosh, you own a restaurant now?

154
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,620
Stuff happened.

155
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,790
What will you do
now that you quit selling side dishes?

156
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,760
I don't know. I should find a job.

157
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,400
If I can't do that, I'll just get married.

(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

159
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,200
Why don't you work here for us?

160
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,470
Here? I wouldn't know what to do.

161
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,880
You just have to man the cash register.

162
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,810
We'd like to have someone
we can trust around.

(Mingang Distribution)

164
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,390
Father.

165
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,430
Why do you want to see me here?

166
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,160
What's wrong with that?

167
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,560
That's your problem.

168
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,970
A man should get up
right where he fell down.

169
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,170
You got fired here,
so you must start over here.

170
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,840
I want to,
but my father won't hire me back.

171
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,570
Don't worry. You have me.

172
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,080
You will get your job back.

173
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,680
What? I can work here again?

174
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,880
Once I become a non-executive director,
I can get you rehired easily.

175
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,950
You'll be a non-executive director?
What for?

176
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,490
I have my reasons.

177
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,060
I'd love to see Ms. Stella again.

178
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,130
Trust me.

179
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,830
Will my father appoint you?

180
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,870
Pull back those worries
and step all over them.

181
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,740
I have leverage on your father...

182
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,370
that no one else in the world knows.

183
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,520
Se Ri?

184
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,360
Ms. Jung?

185
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,520
How are you?

186
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,190
What happened?

187
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,660
Why couldn't I get through to you?

188
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,460
I'm sorry. Something had come up.

189
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,130
Do you know how frustrated I felt?

190
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,670
Did you really end it with my dad?

191
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,640
Is that why you ignored my calls?

192
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,480
No, it's not like that.

193
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,050
You're the two people
I care the most about.

194
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,820
Why didn't you pick up, then? Tell me.

195
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,860
I don't know if I should tell you.

196
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,130
Someone tried to kidnap me.

197
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,530
Luckily, I managed to get away.

198
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,400
I'd be locked up
somewhere right now if I hadn't.

199
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,340
You were kidnapped?

200
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,810
How can something like that
happen in this day and age?

201
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,210
Who was it?

202
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,040
Do you know who was behind it?

203
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,280
You need to know to report them.

204
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,850
I can't report them anyway.

205
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,120
It's someone you know.

206
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,090
It's someone I know?

207
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,590
Who is it?

208
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,160
Who do you think...

209
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,360
it could be?

210
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,730
Tell me. If you can't punish them, I will.

211
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,940
Was it...

212
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,480
my big sister?

213
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,510
How could she do...

214
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,120
I'll talk to her right away.

215
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,620
No. Don't get involved
and get on her wrong side.

216
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,160
Pretend you don't know.

217
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,420
How can I pretend I don't know...

218
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,930
when my own sister did that to you?

219
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,530
Se Ri. Hello?

220
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,380
(Mingang Distribution)

221
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,380
The proof is right here.

222
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,880
Let's watch it together.

223
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,850
Lucia said the men mentioned Sun Jae.

224
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,750
Everyone knows he works for you.

225
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,990
That means it was your idea!

226
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,330
She'll ruin me one day.

227
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,200
I must do something before she does.

228
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,930
(Mingang Distribution)

229
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,670
Why are you here?

230
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,670
What is it?

231
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,510
Didn't you hear me ask a question?

232
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,710
You kidnapper.

233
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,910
What?

234
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,980
What were you going to do to Ms. Jung?

235
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,390
Did you do it to force her to leave Dad?

236
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,890
Who do you think you are?
Why try to break them up?

237
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,160
Who told you that?

238
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,390
Did she tell you?

239
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,460
Did she tattle to you?

240
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,830
That's just what she'd do.

241
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,240
Stay out of the adults' business.

242
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,470
I'm an adult now too.
Don't treat me like I'm a kid.

243
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,180
Go home. I'm stressed out as it is,
so don't add to it.

244
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,450
Kyung Chae!

245
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,080
Leave before I turn nasty.

246
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
Or I'll get really angry.

247
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,990
What did you do that for?

248
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,560
Because I wasn't getting through to you.

249
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,660
I had to do that
to show you how angry I was!

250
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,840
I'll come back another time.

251
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,750
Director Moon.

252
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,550
Are you free?

253
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,120
Is it all done?

254
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,050
Min Doo Sik knows
his daughter ordered your kidnapping,

255
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,990
so he'll treat her
like she's scum of the earth for a while.

256
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,490
And since Se Ri threw a tantrum
in her sister's presence,

257
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,030
Min Kyung Chae
will feel like she's cornered.

258
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,030
Yes.

259
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,570
She even lost her loyal hound, Sun Jae.

260
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,840
You haven't heard from the chairman yet?

261
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,540
You're not legally his wife...

262
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,810
until he proposes and you tie the knot.

263
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,320
Min Soo Jung will be egging him on.

264
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,980
I told her to.

265
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,990
She's our hidden ally.

266
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,590
Once you marry the chairman
and take over the house,

267
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,890
win her over first.

268
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,490
Don't worry.

269
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,330
Once she finds out her half-sister
is the reason her birth mom died,

270
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:01,000
she'll wage war against Min Kyung Chae
without me having to do anything.

271
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,340
If that happens,
can you get rid of both sisters together?

272
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,110
That's getting two birds with one stone.

273
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,310
You even saw a video.

274
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,120
I wouldn't see Kyung Chae again
if I could have my way.

275
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,250
How could she do that
to someone who means so much to you?

276
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,820
I'm almost heartbroken
that she planned a kidnapping.

277
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,860
Marry Lucia as soon as possible.

278
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,560
There's no other solution.

279
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,400
That's the plan.

280
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,300
Are you free tomorrow?

281
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Why?

282
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,870
Are you going to scope out
places to propose at?

283
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,580
If so,
I'll willingly accompany you to help.

284
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,240
Schedule something for tomorrow.

285
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,010
Is Kyung Chae not home yet?

286
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,390
She'd be too ashamed
to come home after that.

287
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,520
I bet she's having a drink somewhere.

288
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,490
I just needed company.

289
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,760
You don't want to drink with me, do you?

290
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,470
No one does.

291
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,740
Everyone either fears me
or feels uncomfortable around me.

292
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,810
Then live differently.

293
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,750
Do you like scaring people
and making them feel uncomfortable?

294
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,480
Do you think that's in my power?

295
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,650
You shouldn't harm others, at least.

296
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,090
How could you think of kidnapping someone?

297
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,730
You look like
you have something to say but won't.

298
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,600
I'll say it much later on.

299
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,000
I hope you work it out with your sister.

300
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,140
Family is all one has,
if you think about it.

301
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,070
I don't need a family.

302
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,880
You shouldn't say that.

303
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,180
Others leave if they have no use for you,

304
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,480
but family remains.

305
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,880
Family is something no money can buy.

306
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,490
You're so unusual.

307
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,790
I hate that you lecture me,

308
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,930
but I don't hate you.

309
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,030
You've had enough to drink.

310
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,400
What?

311
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,770
Are you worried?

312
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,110
Go home and talk to your sister.

313
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,710
Next time, if you need a drinking buddy,
call someone else.

314
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
I don't think I'm right for you.

315
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,550
He went out for a short while.

316
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,120
You treat this place
like it's your playground.

317
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,690
It's not a playground,
but I don't mind being here.

318
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,060
A lowly employee shouldn't feel
too much at home in the chairman's office.

319
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,600
What's right or wrong for us
is none of your business.

320
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,740
The chairman wouldn't want to see you.

321
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,340
You should lie low
and avoid coming here for a while.

322
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
What?

323
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,610
Are you giving me orders now?

324
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,980
Be grateful I didn't report you
for kidnapping me.

325
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,390
Is that why you went and told Se Ri?

326
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,990
You shouldn't have done something
that would embarrass you if she found out.

327
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,860
You're speaking casually to me now?

328
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,630
So what if I do?

329
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,300
I'm dating your father.

330
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,040
Isn't this acceptable?

331
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,640
You're insane.

332
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,370
You've lost your mind.

333
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,040
Watch your tongue.

334
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,040
How dare you say that?

335
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,480
If I were to set my mind to it,

336
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,750
I could have you arrested
for soliciting a kidnapping.

337
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,180
Do you know why I won't when I have proof?

338
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,720
It's to save your father's face,
so know your place.

339
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,760
I'm sick and tired
of the way you lash out.

340
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,640
You went somewhere?

341
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,950
It's a secret.

342
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,980
Are you free tomorrow?

343
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,450
I'll make myself free if you want me to.

344
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,250
I'll text you a time and place.
See you then.

345
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,160
He'll propose to you tomorrow.

346
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,160
Then you two...

347
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,570
Yes. We just reserved a place.

348
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,570
How do you feel?

349
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,470
Why do I feel so excited?

350
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,840
It's just the beginning.

351
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,920
That's it? I thought she'd jump for joy.

352
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,360
She's so calm.

353
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,560
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

354
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,900
I was about to leave
when I had to rush to the toilet.

355
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,670
- It's fine. Here you go.
- Thanks.

356
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,400
- You should handle urgent stuff first.
- Right.

357
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,710
I told you all about
me and Chairman Min Doo Sik.

358
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,080
Do you need more details?

359
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,810
No, forget about that.

360
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,180
You want to reveal
the actual person behind the car crash...

361
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,850
to get a retrial for yourself.

362
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,520
That's right.

363
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,820
That's the whole reason I'm doing this.

364
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,260
If that were to happen,
Min Doo Sik would have to stand trial.

365
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,990
He should.

366
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,530
The world might be a messed-up place,

367
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,300
but he killed two others,
stole their new technology,

368
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,470
and even took their company.

369
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,500
A jerk like that
shouldn't get away with it.

370
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,310
I guess so?

371
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,180
I knew you'd say that.

372
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,950
You're the best detective
in the whole country.

373
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,380
Will you please help me
get Min Doo Sik to stand trial?

374
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Sure.

375
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,950
Cheers.

376
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,490
Manager Gong. Is this it?

377
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,930
I couldn't cook anything else
because my wrists ached.

378
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,100
That's all you have for now.

379
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,900
Manager Gong. Will you stop it?

380
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,240
Is something wrong?

381
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,610
I can't do all the cooking on my own.

382
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,750
I told you so last time.

383
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,350
We can't order from that lady,

384
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,980
and everyone knows how picky you all are.

385
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,390
I won't eat!

386
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,240
Did you and Manager Gong fight?

387
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,110
She looks down on us
because you have no job.

388
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,540
You met my dad. Why is there no update?

389
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,710
You said he promised to get you rehired.

390
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,680
He needs time to make it happen.
He's not in control.

391
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,150
Whatever. Manager Gong is weird.

392
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,750
She thinks she's in charge
while the chairman is away.

393
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,990
She was so worried
that Lucia would marry your father,

394
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,090
move in, and become the lady of the house.

395
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,630
Now she thinks the worst is over.

396
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,930
My gosh.

397
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,700
I got your text.

398
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,600
I called, just in case.

399
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,500
I got the time and place, so don't worry.

400
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,880
It's no big deal.
I just want to eat out with you.

401
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,210
I know.

402
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,750
It's what we usually do.

403
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,880
Good night.

404
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,660
The old man is playing coy.

405
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,860
Is it a surprise proposal?

406
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,630
I guess so.

407
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,560
Tomorrow is the day.

408
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,570
You've waited for it for so long.

409
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,970
Well done, Lucia.

410
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,240
I owe it to you.

411
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,040
Shouldn't we celebrate?

412
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,650
To Mingang Distribution's
chairman's future wife.

413
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,870
You really won't speak to me?

414
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,430
You won't look at me again?

415
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Ms. Min.

416
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,560
You had a lot to drink last night.
Did you have a hangover?

417
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,090
No, I'm fine.

418
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,990
We should do that more often.

419
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,600
It's nice to find
another good drinking buddy.

420
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,510
You two have decided to torment me,
haven't you?

421
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,350
Go wait in your office.
I'll see you there soon.

422
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,150
I offered to help.

423
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,090
What if someone sees?

424
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,160
Who cares? What can they say
if I want to help you?

425
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,690
What the heck is that now?

426
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,030
I'm being boxed in
by two disgusting couples.

427
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,230
Don't they look good together?

428
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,040
Love that overcame age and class.

429
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,840
True love needs a wedding
to make it official.

430
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,240
What does that mean?

431
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,180
They will get married soon.

432
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,520
My father is going to
propose to her today.

433
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,680
Says who?

434
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,350
Do you have a crush on her?

435
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,290
Are you insane?
Why would I have a crush on her?

436
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,130
Why are you so worked up, then?
It's really weird.

437
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,970
Baek Sul Hee, you really...

438
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,910
will marry Min Doo Sik?

439
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,110
You'll really marry Mingang's chairman?

440
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,450
Over my dead body.
As if I'd let that happen.

441
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,620
Lucia. Marry me.

442
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,090
Goodness.

443
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,930
Take shelter under my wings, darling.

444
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,840
No.

445
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,870
Let's...

446
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,280
live happily together under one roof.

447
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,780
My gosh.

448
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,550
I can't believe I'm doing this at my age.

449
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,620
Goodness.

450
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,920
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

451
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,280
I think Kim Sun Jae did something.

452
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,910
He's doing all sorts of things now.

453
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,080
Detective Park. He's a good guy.

454
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,080
If you happen to have other plans...

455
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,990
I didn't think
Kim Sun Jae would go that far.

456
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,850
Did you think I'd let...

457
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,220
the likes of you marry Mingang's chairman?

458
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,130
What if the marriage gets called off?

459
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,790
Don't worry. It won't get called off.

460
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
