(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,240
Is something wrong?

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,540
Is CEO Jo in trouble or something?

6
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,380
No. It's a personal issue.

7
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,350
Then I'll pretend I didn't notice.

8
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,810
Bye.

9
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,250
Someone I trusted betrayed me.

10
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,550
I did what I could.

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,500
Is it...

12
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,730
the man at the hospital?

13
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,370
Yes.

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,670
He disappeared without a word.

15
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,440
As if he vanished into thin air.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,650
We looked into each other's eyes
and talked just yesterday,

17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,710
but today...

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,780
He's missing.

19
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,660
I'm sure he had reasons of his own.

20
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,590
When someone disappears voluntarily,

21
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,360
there's always a reason.

22
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,570
I don't know what to do.

23
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,200
I want to look for him,
but I don't know where to start.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,110
Then trust him and wait.

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,980
If you wait, he will come back.

26
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,580
If he vanished just like that,

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,620
he must be feeling guilty and tortured.

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,990
If I trust him and wait,
he will come back, right?

29
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,590
Yes.

30
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,830
How could he not when he knows...

31
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,400
someone is waiting for him?

32
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,100
Okay.

33
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,570
Jo Pil Doo is alive.

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,770
This wouldn't have happened
if you'd taken care of it then.

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,540
Find him and deal with him.

36
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,110
Remember.

37
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,320
I won't accept the same mistake twice.

38
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,850
Who do you think
looked after him for four years?

39
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,460
It's the fool
who wants to avenge his father.

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,360
Find Han Kyung Soo's son
and bring him to me.

Doctor Yoon.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,430
Why did you rush off
without hearing your results?

45
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,660
Something urgent came up.

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,230
Then come back today.

47
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,360
Or I will come to you.

48
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,670
What is it? Tell me over the phone.

49
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,100
It's not something to relay during a call.

The brain scan you took last time.

53
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,150
It doesn't look good.

54
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,820
How bad is it?

55
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,720
You have a cerebral aneurysm.

56
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,620
A cerebral aneurysm...

57
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,960
is a serious diagnosis.

58
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,430
Yes. You have
a ticking time bomb in your head.

59
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,410
Why won't he call?

60
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,410
CEO Jo hasn't called yet?

(Mingang Distribution)

62
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,650
I don't know why he's stalling.

63
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,220
He didn't seem calculating enough
to string both you...

64
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,390
and Director Min along.

65
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,760
Why would he delay
signing the contract, then?

66
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,890
He owes a loan shark a fortune already.

67
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,860
Is Soo Jung still in the way?

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,970
She can't make a move
in the open now that...

69
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,500
we know what she did.

70
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,740
I don't think
he found another option either.

71
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,870
He doesn't know anyone rich enough...

72
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,740
to cover his debt and acquire the company.

73
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,810
You and Director Min
shouldn't have approached him separately.

74
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,320
It's not surprising that CEO Jo thinks
we have an ulterior motive.

75
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,780
Are you saying I must work...

76
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,850
with Soo Jung instead?

77
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,490
The chairman gave me this task.

78
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,790
She was arrogant enough to get in the way.

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,760
The chairman will scold Director Min
if he were to find out.

80
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,830
But it's the result that counts.

81
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,900
He's a staunch consequentialist.

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
He'll be more disappointed in you...

83
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,470
for leaking a secret deal.

84
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,150
What is he thinking?

85
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,120

sign the deal or not?

88
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,910
Ignore it.

89
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,270
CEO Min will call soon as well.

90
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,980
Should I ignore that call too?

91
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,650
I don't have proof,

92
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,520
but CEO Min will have
prepared a dual agreement,

93
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,690
and Director Min will have set a trap
in some of the clauses.

94
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,420
Her offer may seem much more enticing,

95
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,220
but it's just as bad in the end.

96
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,060
What should I do now, then?

97
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,260
Stall for as long as you can,

98
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,160
then do as I say.

99
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,440
Will you really repay my company's debt?

100
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,510
I'm not repaying anything for you.
It's a loan.

101
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,680
And it's not for free.
I expect regular interest payments.

102
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,240
That's the same thing.

103
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,550
It's as good as a free ride
when I'm cornered and stuck.

104

Thank you so much.

105

There's a surgery for that.
I have enough money to afford it.

111

You can operate.

112
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
An operation isn't the solution,

113
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,510
and we can't operate anyway
when there are no symptoms.

114
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,310
What do you want me to do, then?

115
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,340

with a time bomb in here?

116

Forget it. I'll look after myself.

118
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,690
You must be extra careful,
or you could die.

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,820
If you were to pass out
when no one is about,

120

Everything is a headache

Excuse me, nurse.

133
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,930
Of course I do.
Who doesn't know you, Chairman?

134
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,570
I'll ask you something, then.

135

Wasn't there a Jo Pil Doo here?

136
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,940
I believe he was discharged.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,210
I know that.

138
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,140
What I want to know is,
while he was here half-dead in a coma,

139
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,850
who looked after him?

140
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,210
His guardian, I mean.

141
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,620
Can you get me his number?

142
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,080
Hello, Nurse.

143
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,140
Chairman Min
just asked me about Jo Pil Doo.

144
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,550
Really? What did he ask?

145
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,620
He asked who looked after Mr. Jo,
and if he could get his guardian's number.

146
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,250
Don't worry. I made up an excuse.

147
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,220
Okay. Thank you.

148
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,220
How do you think he found out...

149
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,630
Mr. Jo was there?

150
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
Oh, wait.

151
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,760
The chairman had an appointment
on the day Mr. Jo was discharged.

152
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,170
They must have met.

153
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,670
I see.

154
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,170
I understand. Thank you.

155
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,010
He saw Min Doo Sik
while he was getting discharged...

156
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,180

Oh, Se Ri...

(C'est Si Bon Music Bar)

167
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,830
Did my dear Se Ri call
because she misses her mom?

168
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,100
Can we meet up right now?

169
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,660
Of course we can.

170
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,300
I'm always ready to see you.

171
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,640
Where shall we meet?

172
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,900
I'll text you a place. See you there.

173
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,410
We enjoyed the food last time.
I'm sure we will again.

174
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,920
The vegetables aren't as salty.

175
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,820
It tastes better with extra seasoning,

176
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,120
but I think I heard
the chairman's blood pressure was high.

177
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,890
I'm glad you did that.

178
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,330
I've been worried
about the chairman's health.

179
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,690
What about his health?

180
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,400
Doctor Yoon said he had some issues.

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,970
I'm sure it was a sales pitch.

182
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,170
A doctor like him
needs to keep a patient around.

183
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,610
Let's be honest.
My father-in-law is healthy for his age.

184
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,310
I think something is going on
at your parents'.

185
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,450
At my parents'? Like what?

186
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,880
Are they up to something?

187
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,960
I sensed something frigid in the air.

188
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,520
"Something frigid?"

189
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,430
Did they fight?

190
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,260
You should pay them a visit.

191
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,430
They'd love to see you.

192
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,130
Manager Gong. I'm off to class.

193
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,810
You wanted to have lunch with me?

194
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,380
Sorry, but I've already eaten.

195
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,950
Call it an early dinner, then.

196
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,760
I can do that.
If that's what my daughter wants.

197
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,060
I never thought...

198
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,000
I'd get to eat with you.

199
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,570
Eat up.

200
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,070
Okay. I will.

201
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,910
Since it's your treat.

202
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,610
Let's eat.

203
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,880
If she's really my mom,
she'll have the same allergy.

204
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,950
What's wrong?

205
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,820
You can't eat it?

206
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,590
Why can't I eat this?
I can't get enough of it.

207
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,930
I just flip out
when I see shrimp and crab.

208
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,560
Let's eat.

209
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,530
Eat up.

210
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,980
She really is my mom.

211
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,560
I'm sorry, Se Ri. I just can't eat it.

212
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,960
I know you can't.

213
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,130
People like us can't stand it.

214
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,400
I'll get you some antihistamine pills.

215
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,610
What?

216
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,010
What did that mean?

217
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,920
Hey, it's me.

218
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,090
How did it go? Why did she call?

219
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,660
Does she suspect you?

220
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,800
No. More like she's convinced I'm her mom.

221
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,570
What did you do?

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,070
I just...

223
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,470
dry-heaved a few times
because I was hungover.

224
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,710
Ms. Lucia.

225
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,550
I'd like to speak with you for a bit.

226
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,620
You were right.

227
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,020
When someone disappears voluntarily,

228
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,890
there is a reason.

229
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,590
The man from the hospital?

230
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,500
I hated and resented him
for disappearing when I didn't know why,

231
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,670
but it looks like there was a reason
why he had to hide.

232
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,700
Yes.

233
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,810
When you must go into hiding
without a word to the people...

234
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,370
who trust and care about you,

235
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,140
it breaks your heart.

236
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,780
If I do as you say...

237
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,680
and trust him and wait, will he come back?

238
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,520
He will.

239
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,170
What were you two doing in there?

240
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,140
We had a short chat.

241
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,810
In the stairwell?

242
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,720
When you could go
to the staff lounge or the rooftop?

243
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,120
Ms. Lucia has a trauma regarding rooftops.

244
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,820
Is there such a thing?

245
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,220
Apparently so.

246
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,260
I'd been meaning to ask this.

247
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,700
If Jogeon Logistics' CEO
has signed the deal,

248
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,070
can Ms. Lucia join the team
and start her actual job?

249
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Let's discuss that in my office.

250
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,180
You and Director Moon are extremely close.

251
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,350
We're on the same team.
This kind of relationship isn't new.

252
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,130
It's not bad to start off as colleagues
and become something more.

253
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,960
You look good together. I wish you well.

254
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,100
Do we look good together?
I should make a move, then.

255
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,570
You and CEO Min, on the other hand...

256
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,710
The relationship is excessively one-sided.

257
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,480
It looks almost exhausting.

258
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,250
I should just...

259
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,350
Does she think I'm stupid
because I'm keeping her identity a secret?

260
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,090
Wait and see.

261
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,030
I'll find proof
and make sure you crash and burn.

262
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,670
We haven't yet acquired Jogeon Logistics.

263
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,900
I'm waiting to hear from the CEO.

264
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,940
Then you've done all you could.

265
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,770
It seems so.

266
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,610
That means there's nothing more
Ms. Lucia can do for you.

267
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,350
She can join the team now.

268
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,250
You look out for her.

269
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,780
Are you two closer than I think you are?

270
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,120
I don't know how you view us,
but our relationship isn't too bad.

271
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,390
I've never seen you like this
for as long as I've known you.

272
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,730
Is she that competent, or is she charming?

273
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,470
If you insist I choose,
I'll say she's both.

274
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,940
I'm kidding.

275
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,880
It was some light-hearted banter
to help you relax because...

276
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,580
you seemed tense about the Jogeon deal.

277
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,150
I thought it would be an easy job,

278
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,660
but too many variables are annoying me.

279
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,430
I'm sure we'll get what we want.

280
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,340
Why isn't it done yet? It's a simple deal.

281
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,370
CEO Jo is like that.

282
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,210
He's indecisive and thinks too much.

283
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,310
Push him harder, then.

284
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,680
What's taking so long
to take over a tiny company?

285
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,920
We'll hear from him soon. Don't worry.

286
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,520
You don't look well.

287
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,760
I've been stressed out.

288
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,230
I'll feel fine once you acquire Jogeon,
so don't mind me.

289
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,440
Father is asking about the acquisition.

290
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,370
If he were to know what you did...

291
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,510
Tell him about it, then.

292
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,040
Soo Jung.

293
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,910
Do you know how hard
I'm trying to control myself?

294
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,820
Hey, my dear sisters. Here you are.

295
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,720
You should've invited me too
if you were meeting for a drink.

296
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,690
Do you want a shot?

297
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,860
What's up with you?

298
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,160
Do you know Chairman Do of Hanpoong,
the company that makes paper?

299
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,000
He's old enough to croak,

300
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
and he's dating a girl young enough...

301
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,240
to be his granddaughter.

302
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,670
The whole family is in uproar.

303
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,810
The old man
registered the girl as his spouse,

304
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,710
which messes up
the succession and inheritance.

305
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,080
Aren't we in
a much better place than they are?

306
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,880
I prefer our father,
who is crazy about money.

307
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,420
There's nothing we can do
if he were to go crazy for a woman.

308
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,260
(Mingang Distribution)

309
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,620
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

310
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,270
Hello, CEO Jo. Did you make up your mind?

311
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,370
Okay. I'll leave right away.

312
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,820
Welcome. Take a seat.

313
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,970
I asked you both to meet me here...

314
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,630
because I wanted to...

315
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,600
thank you for thinking
so highly of my company...

316
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,370
Cut out the useless chit-chat.

317
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,340
Wait. You're not the only one
who's anxious.

318
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,280
I'm sorry it ended up like this.

319
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,620
I thought it would be best
to speak with you at the same time.

320
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,750
I got it. Get to the point.

321
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,020
The thing is...

322
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,890
I considered both of your offers,

323
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,930
and...

324
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,090
I won't accept either.

325
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,000
Why is that?

326
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,770
Did someone else...

327
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,870
Do you have cash?

328
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,400
You took out a huge loan
to develop the technology.

329
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,570
Can you repay the private loan?

330
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,370
The interest alone will be huge.

331
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,170
Someone offered to help.

332
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,540
Who's that?

333
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,680
I can't tell you.

334
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,610
Did you toy with us, then?

335
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,820
Of course not.
I wouldn't dare toy with you.

336
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,390
To be honest, I'd have accepted
if just one of you had made an offer.

337
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,730
You ended up competing with each other.

338
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,180
Didn't you hear what he said?

339
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,650
I wasn't the problem.
There was someone else.

340
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,090
Do you know why I kept this a secret?

341
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,890
Because I was afraid
you'd get involved and ruin things.

342
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,260
Is that all you can say?

343
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,230
Do you think I wanted to sabotage you?

344
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,460
I did what I thought was best.

345
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,500
As if you did.

346
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,470
You don't care about family or Mingang.

347
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,900
You only care about yourself.

348
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,070
That's the level you're at,
and that's your limit.

349
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,840
Yes. I got involved on purpose.
What's wrong with that?

350
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,110
So it's true.

351
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,780
Have you lost your mind?

352
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,320
Father wanted to make me CEO,
and you talked him out of it.

353
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,490
You have no right to berate me!

354
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,450
So you sabotaged the deal on purpose?

355
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,790
What about you?

356
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,420
What are you two doing here?

357
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,000
The CEO and director
screaming at each other in public?

358
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,570
What a sight that was.

359
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,540
We lost Jogeon Logistics.

360
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,270
How come? You said it was a done deal.

361
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,880
Ask Soo Jung.

362
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,410
I contacted Jogeon's CEO
behind Kyung Chae's back.

363
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,850
I happened to hear about the deal...

364
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,820
and wanted to steal it from her
to gain your approval.

365
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,490
I didn't back down in the end
because I didn't want her to get the deal.

366
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,960
What nonsense is that?

367
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,230
She wouldn't let you make me CEO.

368
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,130
So you ruined something we almost had?

369
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,860
What's wrong with you?

370
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,800
See? This is what she's like.

371
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,970
She doesn't care
what happens to the company.

372
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,070
She's selfish and self-righteous.

373
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,210
You should've...

374
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,780
promoted me when you had the chance.

375
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,880
You're not cut out to be CEO.

376
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,720
My business is doing way better
than yours in sales and profits.

377
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,980
That's enough!
Neither of you is in the right...

378
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,750
Get out. I'm sick of you both.

379
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,800
(Mingang Distribution)

380
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,640
Let's have a drink tonight.

381
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,140
I'm not interested.

382
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,640
You don't drink because you're interested.
You drink because you need to.

383
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,880
I should've done something
about Soo Jung long ago.

384
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,880
Then do something about her now.

385
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,020
Let's talk over a drink.

386
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,890
I could give you some tips.

387
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,230
I'm so annoyed.

388
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,270
Why did it end up like this?

389
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,340
(Director Min Soo Jung)

390
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,180
Hi, Mi Ju.

391
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,110
Today?

392
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,350
Yes, let's.

393
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,850
I'm in a rotten mood.
I'll drink all night.

394
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,620
Cash... Money...

395
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,620
- Father, Mother. We're here.
- Cash, money.

396
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,030
What are you both doing here
without even calling ahead?

397
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,500
The side dish girl told me to visit.
She sensed something frigid.

398
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,430
We're the same as always. Gloomy and dull.

399
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,140
Why don't you repeat it
before your daughter and son-in-law?

400
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,640
Do you know how weird your dad has been?

401
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,910
He talked about money all his life,
and now he's talking about love.

402
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,210
Love? The kind of love between couples?

403
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,710
Father. Are you having an affair?

404
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,520
Have you heard of a mayfly
planning a week-long trip?

405
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,490
How can I cheat with a woman
whom I don't know?

406
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,690
I want to but can't.

407
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,260
That means there is someone. Who is it?

408
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
There's no one!

409
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,890
My life may be full of miscalculations,
but not love.

410
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,900
Your eyes have been half-closed,
and your pupils out of focus.

411
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,030
I know you've been thinking
about another wench.

412
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,900
You're more likely
to find a squid with a sprained ankle.

413
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,810
If I'd had a kid out of wedlock
like someone we know,

414
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,140
you'd have had me murdered.

415
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,210
Don't you dare do that.
I'll make you pay for it.

416
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,910
I'll get you both and just...

417
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,650
Look at this. You're witnessing
the actions of a vulgar woman.

418
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,150
Ja Kyung.
Don't you treat Ji Seop like this.

419
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,690
Stop arguing.

420
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,790
Mom, we'll stay the night.

421
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,560
Will you? I'm glad you dropped by
before we found a tenant.

422
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,760
Are you going to rent out my bedroom?

423
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,360
Why keep it empty...

424
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,500
when we could get
some extra income out of it?

425
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,030
You're always talking about money.

426
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,800
- Cash, money...
- Cash, money...

427
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,500
- Stop. That's my line.
- Cash, money...

428
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,810
- You'll jinx it. Stop!
- Cash, money...

429
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,340
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

430
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,940
My kids are all useless.

431
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,550
They have no idea about my health.

432
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,950
Darn it.

433
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,390
Was I under too much stress?

434
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,110
Do light exercise.

435
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Take the stairs instead of the elevator.

436
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,140
Everyone has such a spot.

437
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,170
A place they just can't stand.

438
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,440
If you climb up step by step,

439
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,180
you'll reach the rooftop.

440
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,780
When the day comes,

441
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,120
being there won't hurt
as much as it does now.

442
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,020
If I go up step by step,

443
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,260
I can reach the rooftop one day.

444
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,730
I won't run away.

445
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,830
Watch me and see how I do, Mi So.

446
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,090
What's wrong with me?

447
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,490
This can't be good.

448
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,860
Let me see.

449
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,230
Secretary Kim's number.

450
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,300
No.

451
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,460
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

452
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,670
Min Kyung Chae will become chairwoman?

453
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,680
Says who?

454
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,510
I can't let her go on like this.

455
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,280
She'll become a bigger obstacle later on.

456
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,180
He said out of the blue...

457
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,750
that he'd written a will.

458
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,220
He said that?

459
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,920
Did he mention the contents?

460
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,250
Why are you looking for Oh Pan Sool?

461
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,660
I must find him
in order to correct what went wrong.

462
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,790
Wait and see.
This will become an opportunity.
