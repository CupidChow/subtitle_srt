00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,580
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,450
Sul Hee!

3
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,160
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,660
Yeon Ah...

5
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,800
My Mi So is in the morgue.

6
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,310
That's weird.

7
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,510
Why isn't it a dream?

8
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,550
This has to be a dream.

9
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,160
- Sul Hee!
- Why isn't it a dream?

10
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,690
It makes no sense.

11
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,760
Why would Mi So die?

12
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,230
She can't die. Not my daughter...

13
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,070
- No!
- Sul Hee...

14
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,710
No!

15
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,310
No. It has to be a dream.

16
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,180
This can't be true. It's not.

17
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,390
Sul Hee.

18
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,190
Don't worry. Things are under control.

19
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,200
What measures did you take?

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,430
The employees who saw what happened
were told to sign an NDA...

21
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,930
and sworn to secrecy.

22
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,410
What did she have against us
that she'd cause us such trouble?

23
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,980
She should've taken the money
when we offered it.

24
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,880
The poor have too much pride
for their own good.

25
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,850
They jinxed our new business.

26
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,850
The launch is just around the corner.

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,690
This is why I told you
to crush them properly.

28
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,630
How dare she even come here?

29
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,260
She could've died somewhere else.

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,660
Don't worry too much.

31
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,030
Why would I even care about that?

32
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,370
There's nothing I haven't seen
in my career.

33
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,600
I started in a tiny room of an office...

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,070
and established
a great distribution company.

35
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,070
I got tears and blood on my hands.

36
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,340
Who cares about one dead girl?

37
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,180
Focus on the new business.

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,780
Ignore the distractions.

39
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,480
Okay.

40
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,020
Goodness.

41
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,660
How was Moon Tae Kyung's first impression?

42
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,990
I'm sure he was a pretty face.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,430
And he'd be dressed
in luxury brands from head to toe.

44
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,260
Do you think he's like you?

45
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,500
Mr. Moon was humble and sweet.

46
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,970
Look at you.

47
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,040
You're acting like you're besties already.

48
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,240
I'm giving him the respect he deserves.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,340
Did you expect me to call him,
"Hey, Moon?"

50
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,150
No one deserves a title.

51
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,450
The title makes the person,
and I could do just as well.

52
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,050
Plus, you could've overestimated him.

53
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,950
His success in the US was all luck.

54
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,960
He has to prove himself here.

55
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,630
I heard there was
an incident at work today.

56
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,660
Keep your mouth shut.

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,370
Do you want me to look into
Dongseo Daily's Park Gyeong Bae?

58
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,900
Who told him about Se Ri's assault?

59
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,670
And who was behind that source?

60
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,110
Shall I start digging?

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,770
I could tell Father too.

62
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,480
What is she talking about?

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,280
Did something happen at work?
And why would you dig?

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,750
- You don't need to know!
- You don't need to know!

65
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,620
They yell at me at the same time now?

66
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,590
I'm their older brother.
They can't look down on me.

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,960
They're spoiled, aren't they?

68
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,150
Do you really not know,
or are you pretending not to know?

69
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,710
What do you mean?

70
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,850
Don't you know why they're like that?

71
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,590
A stranger flew in...

72
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,250
and took over the new e-commerce business,

73
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,920
and their older brother
slacks off in a supermarket.

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,890
Even I'd look down on that brother.

75
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,190
Why would you say I'm slacking off?

76
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,770
I'm charging my battery on the sidelines
while waiting for an opening.

77
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,470
You're not charging anything.

78
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,900
Despite the way Father treats you,
I thought he would bring you...

79
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,440
into the new business
once everything was in place.

80
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,610
Don't worry. I have a plan.

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,280
Father will call me sooner or later.

82
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,980
When will that be?

83
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,780
What rabbits grow horns?

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,820
When a newt becomes a dragon?

85
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,830
(Hankuk Hospital)

86
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,940
(Baek Mi So)

87
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,240
Mi So.

88
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,610
I wish you happiness over there.

89
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,950
I'll look after your mom. Don't worry.

90
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,720
Your mom and I...

91
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,550
will come and see you later on.

92
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,990
See you then.

93
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Sul Hee.

94
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,900
Say goodbye to Mi So.

95
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,770
Do you want to lie down?

96
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,570
You haven't slept.

97
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,240
Hello?

98
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,580
Right now?

99
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,620
It's not a good time.
We're going through something.

100
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,050
Did I say we wouldn't leave?

101
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,120
We will, even if you tell us not to.

102
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,960
Darn it.

103
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,930
Sul Hee. The landlady
wants us to empty the store.

104
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,900
I'll finish up the packing.
You stay home and rest.

105
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,500
We rented a car. You can stay here
until we find a permanent residence.

106
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,100
I don't mind where I stay. Take your time.

107
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,810
When you're my age,
whether it's the US or Korea,

108
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,310
a home or a hotel...

109
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,580
It all feels the same.

110
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,350
It's your 1st time back
in 40 years, isn't it?

111
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,850
It has been exactly 45 years.

112
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,290
I left at the sweet age of 20...

113
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,360
and came back an old granny.

114
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,790
I spent my youth in a foreign country.

115
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,590
What would you like to eat?
I'll get it for you.

116
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,800
Like someone who came back...

117
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,530
after decades abroad,
craving ox blood soup and pork rinds?

118
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,970
Thank you, but no thanks.

119
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,770
I still miss Ms. Marah's hotcakes...

120
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,280
and a lovely cup of rich coffee
from Nostrand Avenue.

121
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,210
It'll take a while
to lose the American in me, right?

122
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,850
You had a long flight. Get some rest.

123
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,620
Tae Joo.

124
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,650
Yes?

125
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,790
Do you think we can manage in Korea too?

126
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,130
Of course, we can. You did well so far.

127
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,470
Oh, right.
Is he staying in this hotel too?

128
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,170
He's in Suite 1705.

129
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,850
Mr. Moon Tae Kyung?

130
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,750
Who are you?

131
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,190
We haven't met. Do you know me?

132
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,290
Of course, I do.

133
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,630
I'm a naturalized US citizen.

134
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,630
Everyone in the US knows of you.

135
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,840
You're pretty famous among the expats.

136
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,540
I didn't know I was that well-known.

137
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,010
You're too humble for someone who received
a commendation at the White House.

138
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,350
I'm David Yong's wife.

139
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,850
Oh, that should be past tense.

140
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,290
You must know my ex.
He was a New Buy investor.

141
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,130
Oh, then are you...

142
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,760
Yes. Stella Jang.
The queen of high society.

143
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,770
Nice to meet you.

144
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,840
Why are you in Korea?

145
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,240
To do this and that.

146
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,080
Rumors say Mingang Distribution
hired you to run their new business.

147
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,180
Congratulations.

148
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,010
I don't know if that's a good thing.

149
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,420
It is a good thing.
Not anyone gets scouted.

150
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,250
I hope to see much more of you
from now on.

151
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,940
Sul Hee.

152
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,980
Sul Hee.

153
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,490
Sul Hee.

154
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,890
What are you doing in the dark?

155
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,760
The landlady found
a new tenant for the store.

156
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,630
Be quiet.

157
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,030
Don't wake Mi So.

158
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,070
She just fell asleep.

159
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,070
She must be tired from studying.

160
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,110
She's so fast asleep.

161
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,190
Yeon Ah.

162
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,390
Aren't you proud of Mi So?

163
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,290
She studies hard
even though no one tells her to,

164
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,190
and she's kind and warmhearted.

165
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,530
Sometimes, I think
she's even more mature than you.

166
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,210
And she's pretty too.

167
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,510
Her features are strong but cute.

168
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,850
She'll grow to be
a great person, won't she?

169
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,320
What got into you?

170
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,990
Mi So is dead.

171
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,130
You're crazy.

172
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,130
Why is she dead?

173
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,070
She's right here, fast asleep.

174
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,940
Are you praying for her to die?

175
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,940
Because she's not related to you?

176
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,510
You said you were her auntie.

177
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,380
You want Mi So to be dead, don't you?

178
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,150
Get a grip, Sul Hee.
Why are you like this?

179
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,420
Look at you.

180
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,350
You get a grip, okay?

181
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,720
Why would Mi So be dead?

182
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,160
Sul Hee.

183
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,660
If that's all you can say,
get out of my house.

184
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,700
Get out right now! Leave! Get out!

185
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
- Sul Hee!
- Get out!

186
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,770
I took you in
and looked after you out of pity.

187
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,510
And what did you say?

188
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,140
My Mi So is dead?

189
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,910
- Sul Hee.
- This is why...

190
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,550
they say we shouldn't take in a stranger.

191
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,250
Look at you now!

192
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,990
Don't be like this, Sul Hee. Come on.

193
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,560
I bet you wanted Mi So to die
all the while you were with us.

194
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,290
You hid how you really felt...

195
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,560
and acted like you were her aunt.

196
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,730
How dare you say Mi So is dead?

197
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,130
How dare you?

198
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,840
Don't do this.

199
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,340
Mi So isn't dead.

200
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,510
My Mi So isn't dead.

201
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,940
My daughter isn't dead!

202
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,710
Sul Hee. Will you get a hold of yourself?

203
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,180
Who do you think you are?
How dare you say she's dead?

204
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,990
My daughter's fine.

205
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,020
She's perfectly fine, alive, and well!

206
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,860
Why do you say she's dead?

207
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,360
What gives you the right to say that?

208
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,830
Sul Hee. Wake up!

209
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,770
Sul Hee!

210
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,840
Yeon Ah.

211
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,710
What should we do about Mi So?

212
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,720
She left me all alone.
What am I to do now?

213
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,260
I feel so sorry for Mi So.

214
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,550
Are you asleep?

215
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,190
It's suffocating
being indoors all day long, isn't it?

216
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,700
It is.

217
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm glad and grateful
that you're before me.

218
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,200
You called me a troublemaker.

219
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,710
You are a troublemaker,

220
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,170
but I'm glad you're alive.

221
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,380
You could've done something drastic
so many times.

222
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,180
What's wrong?

223
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,180
You're a bit weird today.

224
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,750
Is someone dead?

225
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,860
I'll be too busy to look out for you
once the new business launches.

226
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,460
I'll hire someone you can use
as an assistant and go out with.

227
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,300
I can go out now?

228
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,830
Only when you need to.

229
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,370
Father still wants you to stay grounded,

230
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,040
but I'm letting you relieve some stress.

231
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,210
Just don't get into more trouble.

232
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,510
Kyung Chae.

233
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,680
Sul Hee.

234
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,680
Sul Hee.

235
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,020
Sul Hee.

236
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,660
Sul Hee.

237
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,340
Where did she go
in the middle of the night?

238
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,440
Sul Hee.

239
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,100
Sul Hee!

240
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,040
Sul Hee. What are you doing here?

241
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,280
Your feet are bare.

242
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,580
Why am I out here?

243
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,290
You don't remember?

244
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,190
Oh, no. You have no memory.

245
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,190
Let's go home.

246
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,090
Stand up.

247
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,160
Get on my back.

248
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,430
Come on.

249
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,690
Lie down.

250
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,910
It's because you haven't slept in days.

251
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,980
You'll be fine.

252
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,830
(Mingang Distribution)

253
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,930
The building is really fancy.

254
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,300
Is there a cafeteria?

255
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,800
Yes, in the basement.

256
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,970
- Is the food any good?
- It is.

257
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,340
You should try it.

258
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,510
- I should. Thank you.
- What are you doing out here?

259
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,140
Hello.

260
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,310
I was just...

261
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,520
looking around and asking about the place.

262
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,750
I should get familiar
with my new workplace.

263
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,620
I'm sorry for the late introduction.
I'm Kim Sun Jae.

264
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,490
Hello.

265
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,330
You head the Legal Team.

266
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,100
And you're also CEO Min's right-hand man.

267
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,200
Is that what people say?

268
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,670
I heard you were a competent expert.

269
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,040
You handle all of Mingang's legal woes...

270
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,240
like a troubleshooter.

271
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,140
Handling Mingang Distribution's
legal woes is part of my job.

272
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,450
I'm not CEO Min's right-hand man.

273
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,280
I just accompany her on important deals.

274
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,190
What do you think
about Mingang Distribution?

275
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,760
Do you think the place is worth
your youth and ambition?

276
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,860
I'm asking...

277
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,360
what criteria you have
that don't involve figures.

278
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,900
Distribution is about selling goods,

279
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,870
and that requires winning people over.

280
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,140
I wonder if this place can do that.

281
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,680
Shouldn't you find that out for yourself?

282
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,380
It's not fair to fish for information.

283
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,920
And I could look bad for tipping you off.

284
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,790
Is that so?

285
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,360
Whether it becomes your paradise
or purgatory depends on you.

286
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,330
Are you saying this place...

287
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,960
is your paradise?

288
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,830
Let's say I'm somewhere in between.

289
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,400
You have the correct answer
for everything.

290
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,440
You're a lot like the CEO.

291
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,740
I guess it's because I've served her
for a long time.

292
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,850
Anyway, please do your best
and make our new business a success.

293
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,580
You speak as if...

294
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,550
you're a member of the owner's family.

295
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,360
The chairman is
a strong believer of familism.

296
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,190
Who's to say
I'm not a member of the owner's family?

297
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,390
Who knows?

298
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,660
I could become family.

299
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,810
I don't know
what Chairman Min is thinking.

300
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,710
His son should come before a stranger,
however talented.

301
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,180
Why would he trust a complete stranger...

302
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,180
with such a hefty role?

303
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,550
My point, exactly.

304
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,820
It's as if he wants
his only son to rot away in a store.

305
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,290
Tell Ji Seop to lie low.

306
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,860
He might even lose that store
if he gets on someone's nerves.

307
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,460
That makes as much sense
as an octopus going bald.

308
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,500
Apples don't fall far from the tree.

309
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,200
We must pump
until the spring yields water.

310
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,770
A chick survives
when it breaks its own shell.

311
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,270
If someone else breaks it,
it becomes a fried egg.

312
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,410
When is the launch of the new business?

313
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,240
We don't know yet, but soon, I guess?

314
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,640
I should get an invitation,
considering how...

315
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
I'm a VVVIP.

316
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,320
(Female Entrepreneur of the Year,
Min Kyung Chae)

317
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,310
Don't smile. You look silly.

318
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,610
Everyone else is so calculating.

319
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,510
You were a naive romantic.

320
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,150
So helplessly caring.

321
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,660
Are you pleased
you trusted others to the end?

322
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,900
I miss you, son.

323
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,500
I miss you...

324
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,670
every moment of every day.

325
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,880
I can't do this.

326
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,080
I need some air.

327
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,520
(Tae Joo)

328
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,570
(Tae Joo)

329
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,460
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

330
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,910
I can't go on if something
were to happen to you too!

331
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,210
You never dated?

332
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,080
Were you a workaholic
like someone else I know?

333
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,380
You're a lot like each other.

334
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,550
I'm sure you'll get along.

335
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,580
How about dinner tonight?

336
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,810
What do you really want?

337
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,320
I need someone on my side.

338
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,920
Not a half-baked family,
but someone truly loyal.

339
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,290
If they want to look out
for their siblings,

340
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,990
they should put Ji Seop first.

341
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,120
I used to be the heir and successor
to Mingang Distribution, okay?

342
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,290
What's your problem?

343
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,360
Don't stop me.
I'll cause some trouble today!
