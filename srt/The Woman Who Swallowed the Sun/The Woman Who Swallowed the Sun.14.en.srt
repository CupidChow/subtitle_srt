00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,080
Hey.

2
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,250
Are you all right?

3
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,240
Can you get up?

4
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,650
Come on.

5
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,190
Oh, no. I'll call an ambulance.

6
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,260
Are you crazy?

7
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,800
Why did you walk into the road
when the light was red?

8
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,740
Were you trying to ruin someone's life?

9
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,940
If you walk out in front of a car
in the middle of the night,

10
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,780
who wouldn't hit you or panic?

11
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,920
Are you listening to me?
Why are you in such a haze?

12
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,720
If I hadn't braked in time,

13
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,050
both our lives would've ended!

14
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,320
We'd be dead!

15
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,360
Do you want to die?

16
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,560
I wish you'd killed me.

17
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,080
Hey, lady.

18
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,780
You'll go in bare feet?

19
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,190
Get in.

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
I'll drive you home.

They say it's better to live even though
you think your life is the worst.

23
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,680
Why did you want to die?

24
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,980
You must've said that for a reason.

25
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,090
Don't answer if you don't want to.

26
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,290
I don't know what happened,

27
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,760
but it must be serious
if you're sleepwalking.

28
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,030
It might be better...

29
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,270
to grit your teeth and get on with life.

30
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,870
The people who gave you a hard time,
the things that went wrong.

31
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,610
Swear to yourself
that you'll make things even one day.

32
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,830
Where on earth did you go?

33
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,230
Are you her younger sister?

34
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,500
Who are you?

35
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,620
We met in the street.

36
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,390
Take your sister to see a doctor.

37
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,690
It could get really bad
if you don't get her help.

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,960
Get her treated,
or you'll regret it later.

39
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,760
Okay.

40
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
Excuse me.

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,770
Can I ask you something?

42
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,940
Your sister seems to suffer
from a bad case of shock.

43
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,280
What happened?

44
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,650
Well...

45
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,220
Her daughter died in an accident recently.

46
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,740
It's true we're not related at all,

47
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,050
and we met each other by chance.

48
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,350
But I believed...

49
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,350
that water could become
thicker than blood if people cared.

50
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,890
I considered you my blood.

51
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,860
My heart breaks too...

52
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,000
because Mi So's dead and gone.

53
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,030
But...

54
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,630
I didn't let it show around you.

55
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,800
I couldn't.

56
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,910
I knew you'd be hurting more than me.

57
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,440
There's no way I'd be as sad as you.

58
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,980
You got lucky today and met a kind woman
who got you home safely.

59
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,990
What if you met a thug and they hurt you?

60
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,320
I can't go on if something
were to happen to you too!

61
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,000
Mi So would look down on us
and worry about you.

62
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,400
You think Mi So would be worried?

63
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,940
Yes.

64
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,440
So let's see a doctor.

65
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,410
Get help, for Mi So's sake. Please.

66
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,350
I can't let Mi So worry. I can't.

69
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,890
(September 23, 2021)

70
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,590
It's the guest list
for our launch ceremony.

71
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,100
Instead of leasing a banquet hall,
we'll host it in our building's main hall.

72
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,740
Good for you. People will criticize us
for hosting something fancy these days.

73
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,670
Donate the money you'd have spent
on leasing the banquet hall to poor kids,

74
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,910
and be sure it's in the news.

75
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,310
Is there anyone you'd like to invite,
Director Moon?

76
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,910
No, there isn't.

77
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,850
Why don't you invite your parents?

78
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,520
It takes less than a day
to fly in from the US.

79
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,850
It's their sabbatical this year,
and they're volunteering in Africa.

80
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,160
They have a sabbatical? What do they do?

81
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,020
They teach at a university.

82
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,130
They're great people.

83
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,160
You can tell a lot about a couple
from their children,

84
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,700
and I can imagine
what good people they are.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,170
Do you have siblings?
What about a girlfriend?

86
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,900
Father. You're getting too personal.

87
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,070
I don't mind.

88
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,770
I'm an only child,
and I don't have a girlfriend.

89
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,680
You're in your prime, and you never dated?

90
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,550
Were you a workaholic
like someone else I know?

91
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,310
You're a lot like each other.

92
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,080
I'm sure you'll get along.
Visit us at home too.

93
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,690
Thanks for the sentiment.

94
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,620
I mean what I say.

95
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,360
Visit us often. Let's act like family.

96
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,390
Sure.

97
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,100
My father doesn't usually act like that.

98
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,710
He must like you a lot.

99
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,310
The expectation he seems to have
weighs on me already.

100
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,980
Don't feel too pressured.

101
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,950
The process is as important as the result.

102
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,480
Gosh, I can't believe
I heard you say that.

103
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,990
I see what you did to her, Director Moon.

104
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,590
You always valued the result
more than the process.

105
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,490
Director Min. Don't you have work to do?

106
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,930
I don't just work at my desk.

107
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,300
How about dinner tonight?

108
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,270
I'd like to eat with you...

109
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,740
and come up with a win-win strategy
for your division and the offline stores.

110
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,310
Why are you so rushed
when we haven't even launched yet?

111
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,680
Don't mind her.

112
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,020
She's impatient
and got her priorities mixed up.

113
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,680
No, I like the idea.
We need a win-win strategy.

114
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,250
I'll text you the time and location.

115
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,930
It's best to stay away from her
if you can help it.

116
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,770
That's unexpected.

117
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,640
Aren't you sisters?

118
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,470
You'll find out soon enough,
but it's pretty complicated.

119
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,510
She's a hedgehog, and she'll hurt you
if you let her too close.

120
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,180
I warned you.

121
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,930
I wish you'd killed me.

122
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,840
Her daughter died in an accident recently.

123
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,210
What distracted you so much?

124
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,110
I knocked on the door.

125
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,580
I was thinking about something.

126
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,150
I met a woman just like me last night.

127
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,690
She reminded me of myself 16 years ago,

128
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,460
and it was a strange feeling.

129
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,360
Who did you meet?

130
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,160
I wonder who that was.

131
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,560
I don't know her name or age.

132
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,930
We'll meet again if we're meant to.

133
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,730
What about the thing I told you to get?

134
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,040
Right.

135
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,370
I got it for you.

136
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,880
(Dear valued guests,
We invite you to our launch...)

137
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,380
You'll attend the launch
and fly back, right?

138
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,690
Yes.

139
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,020
It's too early to take action.

140
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,030
I came here to take note of their faces.

141
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,590
Book my return plane ticket.

142
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,330
She gets up during the night
and walks around outside,

143
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,970
but doesn't remember doing so.

144
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,270
When did the symptoms start?

145
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,370
Recently.

146
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,270
It hasn't been like this for long,
but it got bad suddenly.

147
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,360
I'm glad you'll get better...

148
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
if you take your medicine and rest.

149
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,870
Sul Hee. Shall we move to the countryside?

150
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,910
We don't need to stay here
since we closed the snack bar.

151
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,680
Let's move to the country,

152
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,920
farm our own land,
and grow stuff in our garden.

153
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,550
If we do that long enough,

154
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,190
then we can forget.

155
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,560
What should I forget?

156
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,030
Why should I...

157
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,430
move to the country and grow stuff
which I've never done before?

158
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,900
To forget what?

159
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,570
Would that help me forget?

160
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,910
Can I erase what happened?

161
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,480
Sul Hee.

162
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,180
There's no point in that.

163
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,070
Kyung Chae said
she'd get me a personal assistant.

164
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,770
Then I can go out whenever I want.

165
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,840
I heard about it from Ms. Min.

166
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,810
I see Kyung Chae
really cares about you a lot.

167
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,110
You didn't know?

168
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,850
She'll do anything for me.

169
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,590
She always says yes.

170
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,090
I'm jealous.

171
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm an only child,
so I don't know what that's like.

172
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,960
Kyung Chae can be pretty weird, though.

173
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,660
If she wants to look out for her siblings,

174
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,330
she should put Ji Seop first.

175
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,070
A full sibling should be closer
than a half-sibling.

176
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,670
My gosh.

177
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,080
What I meant was...

178
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,240
I don't care.

179
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,880
Everyone here knows I'm a love child.

180
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,550
I hope she finds someone soon
so I can go out this weekend.

181
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,990
I don't think that will happen.

182
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,320
The new business launches this Friday.

183
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,290
What the... Is that true?

184
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,000
You didn't know?
I thought everyone was told.

185
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,870
Honey.

186
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,040
You shouldn't be taking time off work.

187
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,670
We have an emergency.

188
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,210
What are you on about?

189
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,310
I lose my leave days
if I don't use them up.

190
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,010
Did you know the new business
launches this Friday?

191
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,620
Your father is so mean.

192
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,550
How can he think so little of you?

193
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,790
Who says that?

194
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,920
I bet you heard a silly rumor.

195
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,820
Everyone knew but you.

196
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,030
What? That isn't right!

197
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,400
They're leaving me out of a family affair?

198
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,260
I'll go and complain to Father.

199
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,430
Don't stop me.

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,800
I'll cause some trouble today!

201
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,240
What? What's happening on Friday?

202
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,410
I didn't get a call,
let alone an invitation.

203
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,110
I knew it.

204
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,610
My father-in-law...

205
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,980
seems to look down
on both you and Ji Seop.

206
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,990
Ji Seop is furious right now.

207
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,590
He went to the head office
to take it up with his father.

208
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,690
Okay. Hang up. I should go with him.

209
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,430
Chairman Min just doesn't seem
to care about us at all.

210
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,930
I'm not just his son's father-in-law.

211
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,640
How dare he belittle
a major shareholder of Mingang?

212
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,640
He's hard to understand.

213
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,040
He took so much of your money.

214
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,140
If I were him,
I'd pretend to like you in person...

215
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,410
even if I hated your guts.

216
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,350
He doesn't know what I'm like.

217
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,380
I'm no pushover. I can be sweet,
but I can be venomous too.

218
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,250
Why won't you just let me in today?

219
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,320
- Don't you know me?
- I'm sorry.

220
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,030
We're preparing for a ceremony,
and outsiders are not allowed.

221
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,690
How am I an outsider? I'm an insider.

222
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,700
I'm a member of the royal family.
I'm related to the chairman.

223
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,330
I'm sorry. I'm following an order.

224
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,670
Call and say the chairman has a visitor.

225
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,140
The chairman is away.

226
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,380
Then call the CEO's office.

227
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,740
She's in a meeting.

228
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,850
Then call the director or something.

229
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,310
She's also in a meeting.

230
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,750
Darn it.

231
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,450
Make an appointment
before you visit next time.

232
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,600
I swear I'll remember your face.

233
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,500
I won't forget how you treated me today.

234
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,140
I used to be the heir and successor
to Mingang Distribution, okay?

235
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,340
What's your problem?

236
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,640
Hey, son-in-law.

237
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,340
What? Father?

238
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,910
Over there?

239
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,480
Should I just quit...

240
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,120
being the eldest son
and wanting to join the company?

241
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,490
I can't take the humiliation.

242
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,830
That makes as much sense
as saying an octopus...

243
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,830
cracked its head open
while skipping rope with its legs.

244
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,130
Don't do anything to mess up your future.
Just leave it to me.

245
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,430
You didn't get an invitation either.

246
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,570
When did I ever require an invitation?

247
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,340
I always invite myself to places.

248
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,670
No one ever invites people
with my occupation.

249
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,880
I don't visit debtors
because they invite me over.

250
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,380
I show up on their doorstep.

251
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,310
You'll just show up at the ceremony?

252
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,250
Can you do that?

253
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,120
Keep your worries deep inside your pores.

254
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,920
I'll show up, see what's really going on,

255
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
and create an opening for you.

256
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,890
Father...

257
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,590
Don't get too emotional over this.

258
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,660
Much more is to come.

259
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,530
Because I will move you to death.

260
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,100
Let's go and get a few drinks.

261
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,110
There are times
when you suddenly crave alcohol.

262
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,390
Sul Hee.

263
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,730
It's time to take your medicine.

264
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,070
Here.

265
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,370
Come on.

266
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,340
I don't see the point
in taking my medicine.

267
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,620
I can't bear the idea
of living the rest of my life.

268
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,260
The days I must struggle through.

269
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,340
CEO Min Kyung Chae and I
are half-sisters from different mothers.

270
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,910
Isn't that common in rich families?

271
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,920
I don't see why
we had to meet for dinner...

272
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,650
to talk about that.

273
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,290
What do you really want?

274
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,390
Enough about your family
and your half-sister.

275
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,590
I need someone on my side
within the company.

276
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,030
Not a half-baked family,
but someone truly loyal.

277
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,670
And I think that could be you.

278
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,100
You could get into big trouble
if the CEO...

279
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,570
caught wind of what you said.

280
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,910
It won't get that far
as long as I keep quiet.

281
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,750
You're not the type to spread gossip.

282
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,950
Shall we team up?

283
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,750
I'll be your golden connection.

284
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,120
You can be my trusted man.

285
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,890
It's not a bad deal.

286
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,090
Oh, let me give you a tip.

287
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,760
There's a pitfall to the familism
Mingang says they follow.

288
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,330
Watch out.

289
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,840
Were you with him until now?

290
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,810
We had dinner and then a drink.

291
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,680
Why? Do I have to report that to you too?

292
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,250
What did you talk about?

293
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,490
I told you during the day.

294
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,260
We discussed a win-win strategy.

295
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,560
Forget that. What are you really up to?

296
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,330
Do you want to win him over first?

297
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,830
What got into you now?

298
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,900
You're going overboard again.

299
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,540
We talked about work.
Ask him yourself if you don't believe me.

300
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,640
It's all good, but don't do to him...

301
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,070
what you did to Lawyer Kim.

302
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,680
What did I do to Lawyer Kim?

303
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,780
Don't you know what you did?

304
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,010
You asked him to be a double agent...

305
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,380
and tried to win him over
with your supposed beauty...

306
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,180
just to steal information.

307
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,250
You did what I call
vulgar and underhanded.

308
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,090
You speak so sweetly.

309
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,990
I can be even sweeter.

310
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,090
So watch out.

311
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,170
The drinks had put me in a great mood,
and she sobered me right up.

312
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,080
It's not fair.

313
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,150
I'm so angry, and it's driving me crazy!

314
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,220
It's not fair.

315
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,340
- Yeon Ah.
- What?

316
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,510
What is it?

317
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,670
Did you hear Mi So crying?

318
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,780
- What?
- She was crying just now.

319
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,850
I heard her.

320
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,720
Mi So was crying out to me.

321
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,390
Sul Hee.

322
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,220
It was her.

323
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,930
She said it was unfair.

324
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,030
Mi So said it was unfair!

325
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,330
What if she's wandering about,

326
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,570
unable to cross over?

327
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,670
What if she's stuck here
because she's angry?

328
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,840
You're wrong.

329
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,040
Our Mi So was a good girl.

330
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,610
What should I do?

331
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,110
If she still feels wronged,

332
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,120
how can I help her?

333
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,990
What should I do to help?

334
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,220
Don't think about that, Sul Hee.

335
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,890
I should go.

336
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,560
Go where?

337
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,760
To Mi So.

338
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,330
Are you going to go to the columbarium?

339
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,730
Let's go together
in the morning when it's bright.

340
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,570
No, I have to go right now.

341
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,040
Sul Hee.

342
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,270
No.

343
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,540
- Sul Hee, please! Don't go.
- No...

344
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,850
I have to go now.

345
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,360
Hello. Can I see your invitation?

346
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,140
Wait right here while I pay the bill.

347
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,050
For real?

348
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
What, then?

349
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,320
Yes.

350
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,460
No way.

351
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,990
Are you serious?

352
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
Mi So.

353
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,840
Yes.

354
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,640
Mi So. It's Mom.

355
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,710
- What are you doing?
- Mi So. It's Mom.

356
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,480
- Mom!
