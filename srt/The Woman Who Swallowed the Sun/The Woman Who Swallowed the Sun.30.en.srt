1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,180
What do you mean Father is missing?

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,280
Why would he be missing
when he's unconscious?

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,190
(Episode 30)

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,660
So you transferred hospitals
without telling your children?

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,970
I'd like the punks
to worry and fret for once.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,930
You keep quiet too.

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,240
You know what will happen
if you talk, right?

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,470
Was I ever able to disobey you?
I could never even talk back.

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,180
You got really lucky.

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,780
You fainted in the stairwell,
and there are never any CCTV cameras.

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,650
You should thank and spoil
whoever it was that saved you.

12
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,450
I'm grateful already.
You don't have to tell me that.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,890
If you'd missed the golden hour,

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,790
you'd be smelling incense
and watching your own funeral.

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,700
This was yet another coincidence?

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,270
What if it wasn't?

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,700
Are you saying the person waited for you
to faint before bringing you to the ER?

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,070
That's nonsense, right?

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,470
Of course it's nonsense.

20
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,710
I know you never trust anyone...

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,080
and wonder and doubt people's intentions,

22
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,080
but you shouldn't, you know.

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,280
You got a second chance in life,
and you owe that to your lifesaver.

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,090
What on earth is happening?

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,990
He was lying still in bed.
Did he suddenly eat a wild ginseng root?

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,260
Where did he get up and go?

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,330
Did Ja Kyung say anything else?

28
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,870
What did the hospital staff say?

29
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,100
Only that
he got himself discharged and left.

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,840
He didn't say where he was going?

31
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,110
No.

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,450
What is going on?

33
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,190
Is there no need for an emergency measure?

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,920
Do you know where he could've gone?

35
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,930
You know what we're like.

36
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,000
We were never that close.

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,130
We have his broken phone,

38
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,870
so we can't reach him.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,800
All we can do is wait to hear from him.

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,670
It might be for the better.

41
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,040
Why don't you make plans...

42
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,640
for when the chairman returns?

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,050
Director Min said...

44
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,780
the chairman wouldn't be the same
even if he were to return.

45
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,790
Are you saying Soo Jung is right
and that he might revise his written will?

46
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,550
We never know.

47
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,320
What we do know...

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,890
is that this incident
will have scared the chairman...

49
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
much more than we think.

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,730
A person who's narrowly cheated death
can never be the same.

51
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,300
Not even Chairman Min,
because he also has just one life.

52
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,510
Whatever happens to him
or whatever he does,

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,840
you must preserve the company.

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,880
It depends on the percentage of ownership,

55
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,780
and I own more shares than anyone.

56
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,150
It's the variables I'm worried about.

57
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,390
Eliminating those variables...

58
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,020
is what I'm good at.

59
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,670
Vice director. Where were you
when you should be working?

60
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,370
Where's the report I asked for by today?

61
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,810
That's not the issue right now.

62
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,540
What is an issue, then?

63
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,150
Well, the thing is...

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,790
Just say it.

65
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,150
I can't. It's a secret.

66
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,990
The chairman...

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Don't.

68
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,660
If you don't want the team to hear,
don't say it at all.

69
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,760
I'll take the afternoon off.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,930
You can't.

71
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,170
You say no
without even asking what's wrong?

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,170
I asked you to hand in the report today.

73
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,110
Do you know how many extensions
I gave you already?

74
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,370
I need it by the end of the day.

75
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,580
Why are you standing there?
Sit down and start typing.

76
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,020
Darn it.

77
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,190
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

78
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,760
Talk to Stella Jang...

79
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,530
and find out whatever you can.

80
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,100
I'll use that to get more details.

81
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,760
You'll use that information
to look into Lucia's past?

82
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,200
What are you so bothered about?

83
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,940
Well...

84
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,070
I'll tell you another time.

85
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,040
You need to know about it too.

86
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,050
Lucia.

87
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,180
How are you tied to Lawyer Kim?

88
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,630
She looks beautiful.

89
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,000
How much must you love someone
to be able to paint her like this?

90
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,500
You even sacrificed yourself.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,770
I hate her so much.

92
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,680
My blood boils...

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,310
whenever I see this face.

94
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,890
Hello, Ms. Min.

95
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,030
It has been a while.

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,300
Right now?

97
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,900
No, not at all. I'll come over.

98
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,670
(Mingang Distribution)

99
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,880
It's nice to see you again,
but why did you ask to see me?

100
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,110
We haven't talked in a while.

101
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,120
How is everything? Is the chairman well?

102
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,650
He is.

103
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,320
Lucia is fine too.

104
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,860
It's good to hear everyone is doing well.

105
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,990
Really, why did you want to see me?

106
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,030
Find out about Stella Jang's past.

107
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,700
She has an ex-husband and step-children,
but who knows?

108
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,270
She might have had a child in secret.

109
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,510
Why do you live alone?

110
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,440
Isn't single life lonesome?

111
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,010
It's my second time being single,
to be exact.

112
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,280
You must've heard
the story of my marriage.

113
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,910
I got married and got divorced,
and it was a messy circus.

114
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,480
You'd be much less lonely
if you had a child.

115
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,550
I have lots of children.
So many that they're more of a hassle.

116
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,020
Not like that.

117
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,260
Biological children.

118
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,830
Do you have any?

119
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,760
A child I gave birth to, you mean?

120
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,270
I had one. And you took him from me.

121
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,640
Why are you asking about that?
Why do you want to know about me?

122
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm interested.

123
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,510
Don't you know you're my role model?

124
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,310
You don't want me for a role model.

125
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,680
Find someone
who will make you a better person.

126
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,880
If she's asking me things like that,

127
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,490
it means she did
as much digging as she could into you.

128
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,920
And she switched targets
because she found nothing.

129
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,860
She wants to find out how we're connected.

130
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,300
What we have in common.

131
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,800
It will have been Sun Jae's idea.

132
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,400
He suspects who I am,
but he can't prove it,

133
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,470
which is why he's playing along for now.

134
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,540
I talked to my contacts in the US,

135
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,870
but be careful, just in case.

136
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,910
He's persistent and cunning.

137
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,550
Once he latches on, he never lets go.

138
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,220
He will find out who I am.

139
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,520
And soon after that,
he'll find out who I am.

140
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,490
This isn't the happy ending we want.

141
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,460
I must make Chairman Min my protector
before that happens.

142
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,800
Has he regained consciousness?

143
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,630
He never was unconscious.

144
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,670
I looked into it,
and he transferred hospitals in secret.

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,910
That means his children
upset him a great deal.

146
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,140
That's perfect.

147
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,480
The more upset he is,
the closer he'll want to be with you.

148
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,820
Shouldn't she check on me
at least once if she saved my life?

149
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,920
Doesn't she want to know how I'm doing?

150
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,330
She won't know where I am.

151
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,630
Neither of you cared about Father at all.

152
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,100
You never came with us
when Ja Kyung and I went to see him.

153
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,440
It's not like you were there every day.

154
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,440
The number of visits doesn't count.
At least I went more than you did.

155
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,140
So what?
You're bragging that you did more?

156
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,050
I'm not bragging.
I'm saying that you two are useless.

157
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,750
He had emergency brain surgery.

158
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,550
Weren't you worried he was unconscious?

159
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,220
He wasn't unconscious.

160
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,220
He'd have been in the ICU
wearing an oxygen mask if he were.

161
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,960
What are you on about?
He was in bed with his eyes closed.

162
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,030
It was the doctor's recommendation.

163
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,300
Wait. You put him to sleep on purpose?

164
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,500
Did you know that too?

165
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,000
Only a moron wouldn't catch on.

166
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,310
He was on a simple IV drip,
and he was breathing on his own.

167
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,240
You should've told me, then!

168
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,940
Ja Kyung says it's possible
Father has amnesia and is wandering...

169
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,510
because he can't find his way home.

170
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,910
Do you think he'd do that?

171
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,480
He'll be somewhere taking a break.

172
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,620
He's not at the holiday home.
I checked already.

173
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,290
He's not at a hotel either.

174
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,520
I called all the major ones in Seoul.

175
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,560
You give me chills.

176
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,960
This is why it's so hard to love you.

177
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,430
Darn it.

178
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Kyung Chae.

179
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,640
You really don't know where Dad is?

180
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,140
No.

181
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,880
He left home at his age?

182
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I'm the one who wishes I could run away.

183
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,620
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

184
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,050
I'm warning you ahead of time.

185
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,690
If someone wants your shares,
tell me right away.

186
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,690
My company shares?

187
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,130
Keep what is yours safe.

188
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,930
I'll tell you when I need it.
Give it to me then.

189
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,530
Se Ri, you need to
keep your wits about you.

190
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,740
Using what happened to your father
as an excuse,

191
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,470
your brother or sisters
will try to take your shares.

192
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,610
Wait and find out
whether I'm right or not.

193
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,010
There's something I need to tell you.

194
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,080
What is it? Go on.

195
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,880
I actually found someone.

196
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,950
And you can never mention me.

197
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,320
Your brother and sisters
won't leave me alone.

198
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,200
Why won't you finish the story?
What is it about?

199
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,200
Never mind.

200
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,270
It's nothing.

201
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,080
"I, you, my, 19... Nineteen..."

202
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,240
Darn it.

203
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,780
The squiggly letters are taunting me.

204
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,880
You should've studied your ABCs.

205
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,620
Why accept a US property deed
you can't read?

206
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,920
I feel like I'm watching
an elephant do a triple axel on ice.

207
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,990
How dare the likes of you say that?

208
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,030
I attended night school
to get my high school diploma.

209
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,630
You only finished elementary school.

210
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,330
You dare say I can't read?

211
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,560
There was a reason
why I couldn't get a higher education.

212
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,900
My father said an educated woman
would have a hard life...

213
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,840
That makes as much sense
as a turtle losing its shell while mating.

214
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,110
Go to a cemetery.

215
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,340
You won't find someone
who died early for having an education.

216
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,010
Why did this guy
leave you a US property deed?

217
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,420
What does he need the money for?

218
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,720
Why do I need to know that...

219
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,090
as long as he pays the interest on time?

220
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,590
Hello?

221
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,000
It's Mandarin Fish.

222
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,370
Yes, fishy boy. What is it now?

223
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,100
I just got a call from CEO Jo.

224
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Are you renting out a room?

225
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,770
I am. My dear wife...

226
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,180
wants to rent it out,
and she's being stupid about...

227
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,310
She's being insistent, and that's it.

228
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,610
I found someone who's interested.

229
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,050
Really? Who is it?

230
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,450
I tossed them the bait,

231
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,220
but I'm not sure what will happen.

232
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,660
Thank you so much for your help.

233
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,530
You said you had
unfinished business with Oh Pan Sool,

234
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,860
so I had to do something.

235
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,530
I don't know what happened,
but you should make amends.

236
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,670
Thank you.

237
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,240
I'll be in touch.

238
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,940
Bye.

239
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,540
Director Moon.

240
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,880
I called some of my contacts.

241
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,680
Our business partners don't seem
to want to renew their contracts with us.

242
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,120
What's going on?

243
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,520
I don't know your contacts
or how trustworthy they are,

244
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,920
but tell them to comment
on our business when the time is right.

245
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,690
Do you need to taste to see
if something is rotten?

246
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,230
If that's the general consensus,
it's a fact. Denying it won't help.

247
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,160
I don't like how you say I'm in denial.

248
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,670
How about you stop right here
unless you're trying to get on my nerves?

249
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,840
You want me to shut my mouth?

250
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,440
The contacts you mentioned
seem to be a special source.

251
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,210
I recommend you switch
to people who have decent info.

252
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,750
He thinks he has it under control.

253
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,690
If you fail to renew the contracts,
you'll be fired immediately.

254
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,090
Wait and see what I do to you.

255
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,010
Come to the rooftop immediately.

256
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,810
I have a few questions
about the contract renewals.

257
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Where are you going?

258
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,020
Lawyer Kim asked to see me.

259
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,530
What's his problem?

260
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,840
What are you doing here?

261
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,740
Ms. Lucia is busy working.

262
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,640
What do you want to know? I'll tell you.

263
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,680
I have a few questions
about the contract renewals.

264
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,720
Didn't you ask me everything just now?

265
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,490
You didn't give me...

266
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,920
a straight answer, so I have to ask
Ms. Lucia who went with you.

267
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,490
Mr. Kim.

268
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,490
If you want to talk to her,
shouldn't you ask for my permission first?

269
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,330
If I were to call someone on your team
to my office to do something...

270
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,830
without telling you,
wouldn't you mind that?

271
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,370
Borrow whoever you want.

272
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,910
You can make them do manual labor,
and I won't mind.

273
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,610
"Manual labor?"

274
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,310
Fine.

275
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,650
If you mistreat any of my people again,

276
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,780
I will take action.

277
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,820
That could sound pretty strange,
depending on how you take it.

278
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,090
It sounds like you're saying she's yours.

279
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,320
Listen up, Director Moon.

280
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,630
I get that you want to look cool,

281
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,360
but that depends on the situation.

282
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,660
You're at a clear disadvantage.

283
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,700
You don't seem to know what it means...

284
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,570
to lose a long-standing business partner.

285
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,300
It has a bigger impact than you think.

286
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,610
That means...

287
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,280
you will have a lot to answer for
if things don't work out.

288
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,910
Do you understand?

289
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,140
If you mistreat any of my people again,

290
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,180
I will take action.

291
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,320
That could sound pretty strange,
depending on how you take it.

292
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,820
It sounds like you're saying she's yours.

293
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,470
Why did you ask to see me?

294
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,940
Lend me your phone.

295
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,510
I dropped mine when I fainted,
and it would've been broken.

296
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,340
Do you need anything else?

297
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,450
This will do.

298
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,410
I'll call Secretary Kim
if I need anything else.

299
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,820
You can go.

300
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,190
Get some rest, then.

301
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,790
Is that HR? It's the chairman.

302
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,000
Get me the phone number
of one of the employees.

303
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,690
Hello?

304
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,330
It's Min Doo Sik. Is this Lucia?

305
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,970
How did you get my number?

306
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,200
It's not that hard to find out.

307
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,900
I'm at Hankuk Hospital's VIP suite.
Come and see me.

308
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,710
Are you listening?

309
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,740
I'm at work. I can't come right now.

310
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,450
I'm the chairman.
Mingang Distribution is my company.

311
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,950
You do as you're told. Don't complain.

312
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,890
What do you want?

313
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,330
It's a good thing that he's awake.

314
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,190
He'll be out there getting some fresh air.

315
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,530
I'd be glad if that were the case.

316
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,570
He has money and all he needs.

317
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,100
I bet he could even
go to the moon if he wanted to.

318
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,870
He'll be looking after
his body and soul somewhere nice.

319
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,540
I wish that were the case,
but if only he called at least.

320
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,910
I'll bring you the invigorating dishes...

321
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,520
when the chairman returns home.

322
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,320
I'd appreciate that.

323
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,090
I tell myself he's fine,

324
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,190
but I haven't heard from him,
and I don't know where he is,

325
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,930
so I'm anxious.

326
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,390
I think I know a little how you feel.

327
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,570
If someone you were living with
as if you were family...

328
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,170
were to disappear like a wisp of smoke...

329
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,170
The person left behind has to go on,
but their life feels empty.

330

(Searching for a missing person)

331
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,980
Don't people have anything better to do?

332
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,390
Who would do this to my flyer?

(Searching for a missing person)

335
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,300
Sul Hee.

336
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,410
Be sure to eat on time, wherever you are.

337
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,510
Don't let anyone
upset you or mistreat you.

338
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,310
Keep only good people close by.

339
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,450
I've waited for you for 4 years.
I can wait for 40 if I must.

340
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,120
When you're ready to come back...

341
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,460
Come back then.

342
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,300
(Searching for a missing person,
Baek Sul Hee, September 7, 1985)

343
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,600
Okay?

344
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,050
You took your time. I called long ago.

345
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,420
I pretended to have a meeting.

346
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,720
I have to get back soon.

347
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,920
Don't make me repeat myself.

348
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,590
I own the company you work for.

349
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,230
No one knows I came here.
Now only you know.

350
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,300
So don't tell anyone you came to see me.

351
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,470
Why won't you say anything?

352
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,840
You saved my life.
You must have something to say.

353
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,110
It just wasn't your time.
It means nothing.

354
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,410
I'd have saved anyone
had I found them in your predicament.

355
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,450
Of course...

356
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,690
You still suspect my intentions.

357
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,820
You think I followed you in secret,

358
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,130
waited until you passed out,

359
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,260
and took you to the ER and saved you
to become your savior and gold digger.

360
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,500
Don't say that. I don't think so now.

361
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,410
You always doubted or misconstrued
my pure intentions.

362
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,450
Do you know
how afraid I was in the ambulance?

363
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,350
I feared you wouldn't wake up.

364
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,890
I trembled in fear
until we reached the hospital.

365
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,460
I'd never prayed that hard in my life.

366
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,790
I prayed that...

367
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,430
you'd wake up as if you'd had a long nap.

368
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,460
I prayed that you'd be fine.

369
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,330
I even prayed
that if you made a full recovery,

370
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,140
I wouldn't care...

371
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,010
if you misunderstood me
or looked down on me.

372
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,220
It might look like
we're celebrating the chairman's return.

373
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,820
We should celebrate,
but for a different reason.

374
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,590
This is the beginning.

375
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,560
He told you something
he kept from his own children.

376
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,070
That shows you have become special to him.

377
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,770
It's the future I'm worried about.

378
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,940
As I sat outside the OR
waiting for the chairman's surgery to end,

379
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,250
I was reminded of how I felt
when Mi So was in surgery.

380
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,150
That must've felt dreadful.

381
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,050
I cried so much in the corridor.

382
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,920
I asked her to pull through
the difficult surgery...

383
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,730
and told her that if she did,
there was nothing I wouldn't do.

384
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,630
I even said...

385
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,230
I'd give my own life.

386
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,470
That was what I prayed.

387
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,470
Yes.

388
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,770
A mom will do anything for her child.

389
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,910
Do you know...

390
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,680
how much I envy you?

391
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,050
Me?

392
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,850
Find someone else to envy.

393
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,320
Why would you envy
a jobless woman who's growing old?

394
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,260
At least your son...

395
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,360
got to live until he was in his twenties.

396
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,250
How do I look?

397
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,520
Don't I look like...

398
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,820
Father's mini-me in this chair?

399
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,130
Yes, you do.

400
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,060
You should be the chairman.
It's such a shame.

401
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,170
Don't give up just yet.
Opportunities come around.

402
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,500
Don't just sit there. Take a photo.

403
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,100
Oh, okay.

404
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,010
What are you doing?

405
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,380
Nothing. I was just testing out the chair.

406
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,250
Come and sit down.

407
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,900
Are you sure
we don't have to look for Father?

408
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,700
You look for him if you think you can.

409
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,300
If we can't,
let's hire a private investigator...

410
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,900
Do you want to broadcast to the world...

411
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,770
how messed up our family is?

412
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,210
Everyone is waiting to gossip about us.

413
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,980
Father and I regularly meet journalists
for dinner and bribe them...

414
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,880
with cash to write favorable articles.

415
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,880
They're a bunch of hyenas.

416
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,690
They love to bite, tear, and chew.

417
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,050
If they want to,

418
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,590
they can bring us down
with a few nasty reports.

419
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,990
- So we just wait?
- What else can we do?

420
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,330
How can we find someone
who's hiding from us?

421
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,460
That might not be the case.

422
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,400
Do you know
60,000 adults go missing each year?

423
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,440
About 1,000 of them are found dead...

424
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,900
in terrifying conditions.

425
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,170
What if someone nasty
found our father and took him...

426
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,540
- Ji Seop!
- Ji Seop!

427
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,110
What?

428
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,010
Let's just eat.

429
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,290
You always doubted or misconstrued
my pure intentions.

430
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,460
Do you know
how afraid I was in the ambulance?

431
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,390
I feared you wouldn't wake up.

432
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,300
I trembled in fear
until we reached the hospital.

433
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,830
I'd never prayed that hard in my life.

434
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,200
I prayed that...

435
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,970
you'd wake up as if you'd had a long nap.

436
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,840
I prayed that you'd be fine.

437
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,480
She's much better than any of my kids.

438
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,020
(Mingang Distribution)

439
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,060
Did you talk to Stella Jang?

440
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,960
She's too quick-witted.
She wouldn't say much.

441
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,130
So many stories about her
go around in the US,

442
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,700
and I don't know what to believe.

443
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,370
All the rumors and gossip
must be based on slivers of truth.

444
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,240
And you think those slivers...

445
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,510
make you and me uncomfortable?

446
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,540
I can handle some discomfort.

447
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,010
I'm worried it could be more than that.

448
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,650
It could be more?

449
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,520
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you?

450
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,860
You're hard at work.

451
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,320
Have a coffee.

452
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,490
Thanks so much for the regular snacks.

453
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,630
It smells amazing.

454
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,230
How could you wait 40 minutes
for some fish-shaped pastries?

455
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,870
You're ridiculous.

456
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
I was craving it and couldn't help it.

457
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,910
Honey. It's really good.

458
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,650
Do you want a bite?

459
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,990
Isn't it good? It is, isn't it?

460
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,760
It's good.

461
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,360
See?

462
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,930
I see your condition is emerging.

463
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,140
We can barely help ourselves.

464
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,080
Our noses are fine,
which means we are fine.

465
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,350
Hello.

466
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,090
Snack on this.

467
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,890
My goodness...

468
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,630
Thank you.

469
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,030
- Thank you.
- Take care.

470
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,010
Why did you want to see me?

471
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,920
The payment to Jeongse Distribution.

472
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Hello?

473
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,930
It's Cha Jeong Hyeon from HR.

474
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,060
What is it?

475
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,160
Something odd happened.

476
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,230
The chairman called
without going through his secretary,

477
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,640
as if he were out of the office.

478
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,710
Without saying anything else,
he asked for an employee's number.

479
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,070
Is that so? Whose was it?

480
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,940
Jung Lucia's.
She's on the Online Business Team.

481
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
- Who?
- Jung Lucia.

482
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,460
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

483
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,370
(We thank Lee Joong Moon
for the special appearance.)

484
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,310
I'll ask you again. You really don't know?

485
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,810
How would I know
what the family doesn't know?

486
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,780
I think I know why you feel bothered.

487
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,680
- What do you want to hear?
- Your honest truth.

488
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,650
- The two seem pretty close already.
- What?

489
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,090
Spending time and loving people
you connect with.

490
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,420
It's time for you to be happy.

491
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,420
I'll do just that.

492
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,060
That's what revenge is like.

493
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,690
The pain of swallowing the sun.

494
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,300
It's impossible without that.
