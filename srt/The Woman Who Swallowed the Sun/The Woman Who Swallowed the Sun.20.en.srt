1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,740
(Jung, the deceased)

2
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,480
Goodness.

3
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,830
You can throw it away.

4
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,900
We meet again here.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,470
Why are you at a temple this early?

6
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,870
I come here sometimes
when I have a lot on my mind.

7
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,410
Why would a young woman
have a lot on her mind?

8
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,280
I keep thinking of someone.

9
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,480
We only met by chance...

10
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,850
a couple of times.

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,790
But I can't stop thinking of him.

12
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,360
I came here to forget about him.

13
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,330
I must've chosen the wrong day.

14
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,370
I met someone I shouldn't have.

15
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,970
Are you talking about me?

16
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,800
You told me...

17
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,810
not to put meaning into it
when we crossed paths...

18
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,410
just a couple of times.

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,910
I felt ashamed and embarrassed.

20
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,320
In case I was getting ahead of myself.

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,990
I apologize.

22
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,790
Pretend you didn't hear that.

23
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,990
I got carried away.

24
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,060
I'm sorry, but I don't believe in fate.

25
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,430
At my age, you doubt
and suspect everything.

26
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,200
And you learn that hunch means something.

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,580
Meeting by chance a third time...

28
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,090
would mean bad karma.

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,830
That bad karma...

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,770
was your making.

31
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,110
(Episode 20)

32
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,110
Manager Gong. Where's my morning coffee?

33
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,410
Manager Gong.

34
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,650
What's the occasion? Did she sleep in?

35
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,450
Here's your coffee.

36
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,090
Thanks.

37
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,820
Did Manager Gong go out?

38
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,160
I don't know,

39
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,330
but I know for sure that she's not in,
and neither is Father.

40
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,530
Where did they both go
this early in the morning?

41
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,970
Ja Kyung.
You really don't know what today is?

42
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,070
What is today?

43
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,840
It's weird that I'm the only one to care,

44
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,510
but today is
your mother-in-law's death anniversary.

45
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,150
What?

46
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,820
(Mother's death anniversary)

47
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,900
Wake up. Honey.

48
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,530
Ji Seop!

49
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,070
Darn it.

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,930
You nuisance.

51
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,670
You shouldn't have had so much to drink.

52
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,950
You didn't know either, did you?

53
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,780
- Know what?
- It's Mother's death anniversary.

54
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,890
Father is not in.

55
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,860
Maybe he left because he was furious.

56
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,290
Where's Ji Seop?

57
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,160
Fast asleep. He got drunk last night.

58
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,830
I feel bad that we forgot,
but what got into you?

59
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,230
You forgot Mother's death anniversary.

60
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,400
We just got back from the temple
where your mother is resting.

61
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,370
Goodness.

62
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,850
What should we do?

63
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,150
Father looks really angry.

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,590
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,330
I remembered up to a few days ago,
but I forgot last night.

66
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,330
My gosh.

67
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,070
I'll pay Mother a visit some other time.

68
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,640
I've been trying to solve
the funding issue.

69
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,380
It comes around just once a year,
and you forgot?

70
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,580
You know how much
your mom cared about you.

71
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,750
Your brother was the eldest,
and she still favored you.

72
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,350
She coddled and spoiled you
as much as you coddle Se Ri.

73
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,220
Forgetting that makes you less than human!

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,060
Father.

75
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,730
I make no excuse
for forgetting what today is.

76
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,400
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
So am I.

78
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,370
If you're that upset,

79
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,840
even though it's a bit too late,
shall I get some food to offer up?

80
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,180
Forget it.

81
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,080
She never cared for formalities
even when she was alive.

82
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,320
That's why we left her urn at a temple.

83
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,720
They say the deceased needs
to be fed well.

84
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,020
A hungry ghost gets in the way of...

85
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,690
Darn you.

86
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,560
My goodness.

87
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,060
(Mingang Distribution)

88
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,170
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

89
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,070
It has been a while, Chairman Jung.

90
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,470
Are you well?

91
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,780
Why the sudden call?

92
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,850
My CEO daughter?

93
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,610
That can't be.

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,520
I'll see what that's about
and get back to you.

95
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,430
Tell CEO Min to come over.

96
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,140
Did you mention your money problems
to Samjeon Corporation's Director Jung?

97
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,670
It was just a passing comment.

98
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,540
We're around the same age
and we play golf together.

99
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,210
What were you thinking?

100
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,380
Did you think he wouldn't tell
his chairman father?

101
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,280
Did you have no one else to ask?

102
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,150
I didn't mean much when I said...

103
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,690
Chairman Jung called to ask
if our business was doing that poorly.

104
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,620
He even asked
if we might go into receivership.

105
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,230
How could you humiliate me like this?

106
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,330
Word will spread in no time.

107
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,230
- I'm sorry.
- Don't do what you'll feel sorry about.

108
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,040
I plan to promote Soo Jung to CEO
at the regular board meeting.

109
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,740
- Father.
- It's only right...

110
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,340
to reward the more competent one.

111
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,640
If this is about what I did,
don't do that.

112
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,710
If you're doing this to urge me to...

113
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,980
You're mistaken.

114
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,380
I acknowledged you so far...

115
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,920
only because Mingang needed you,
and that's it.

116
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,190
Soo Jung was born out of wedlock,
but I don't care about that.

117
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,320
I wouldn't care if we were unrelated.

118
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,390
I'll hire anyone Mingang needs.

119
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,030
No. You can't promote Soo Jung.

120
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,630
You can't promote anyone.

121
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,560
Not after what I did to get this far.

122
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,070
I'll find an investor and sort it out.
Just you wait and see!

123
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,400
Madam, it's Min Kyung Chae.

124
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,900
Can I see you right away?

125
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,070
Is it urgent?

126
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,300
I rushed over because you asked me to.

127
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,870
Well...

128
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,640
I'm in a bind.

129
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,080
The Macau fund you mentioned last time.

130
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,750
Oh, hey. Lucia.

131
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,790
Madam.

132
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,790
Fancy seeing you here.

133
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,360
When did you fly in?

134
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,130
What about you?
You should've called to say you were here.

135
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,730
I'm glad we met. I wanted to see you.

136
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,270
Can I let her join us?

137
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,740
Yes.

138
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,650
This is Min Kyung Chae,
CEO of Mingang Distribution.

139
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,950
This is Jung Lucia.

140
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,620
She's my acquaintance from the US.

141
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,250
No, I can't call you an acquaintance.

142
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,390
I owe her a lot.

143
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,660
She helped me a great deal
when I was struggling abroad.

144
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,900
Not at all. I'm in your debt.

145
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,970
Don't say that.

146
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,540
I asked you to let me return the favor.
Why won't you give me a chance?

147
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,940
I swore that I'd do anything you asked.

148
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,810
I'll think about it, then.

149
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,880
Do you still jog every morning?

150
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,880
You jogged around Central Park
every morning at 7 a.m.

151
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,620
Here, I jog along the Han River.

152
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,820
I'll be in touch.

153
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,620
Sorry for the intrusion.

154
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,470
She's a real star.

155
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,070
She studied at Wharton.

156
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,910
She got an MBA there,
and she knows her stuff.

157
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,580
She was an MD
at a US distribution company.

158
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,610
It looks like
she returned to Korea for good.

159
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,880
Oh, what did you ask me about?

160
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,050
The Macau fund?

161
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,520
My online business needs an investor.

162
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,090
Put me in touch with someone.

163
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,770
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

164
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,870
We're not utter strangers,

165
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,870
but we're not that close either.

166
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,310
I apologize for being too forward.

167
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,980
I don't have much time.

168
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,480
Is there anything you can do?

169
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,050
I'm sorry,
but I can't help you out with that.

170
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,920
I have ears that pick up rumors,

171
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,060
and everyone in the know
is aware of the situation you're in.

172
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,290
I can't ask anyone to invest
knowing how things are right now.

173
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,430
Oh, dear. I have a meeting to get to.
Do excuse me.

174
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,730
But... Madam.

175
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,070
Madam.

176
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,250
You asked to see me?

177
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,520
Do you know what CEO Min is up to?

178
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,390
She's asking people for money.

179
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,860
There are many domestic online stores...

180
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,300
as well as overseas ones
that offer bargains.

181
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,430
I know the industry is a mess.

182
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,670
Even so,

183
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,370
we have a reputation and pride to uphold.

184
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,100
I can't let Mingang go down like this.

185
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,640
Kyung Chae is embarrassing herself
to borrow money...

186
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,210
while you sit at your desk,
staring at papers.

187
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,780
This is your fault, if you think about it.

188
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,520
Would it have come to this
if you'd done a better job?

189
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,450
I'm sorry, sir.

190
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,560
Make up for it, then.

191
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,660
What is this?

192
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,260
There's a tiny company
called Jogeon Logistics.

193
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,100
The founding CEO
came up with something big.

194
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,170
A new automatic payment system...

195
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,700
and an unmanned
automated logistics system.

196
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,900
They have some good ideas.

197
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,100
The plans are all there.

198
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,370
Adjust it to suit our company
and build on it.

199
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,070
How did you get your hands on this?

200
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,910
It must be that company's secret.

201
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,550
You don't need to know that.

202
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,850
They came up with the idea,
but they can't implement it yet.

203
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,920
Every business requires money.

204
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,150
We have enough to implement the idea.

205
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,020
Then...

206
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,190
you want to steal what they developed?

207
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,660
Is there a reason I can't?

208
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,200
Lawyer Kim will handle the legal side.
You just do as I say.

209
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,410
Was it your idea
to take over Jogeon Logistics?

210
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,550
Yes.

211
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,180
We can absorb what they have
without any legal problems.

212
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,620
What happens to that company, then?

213
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,090
They developed a new technology
and gave it to us expecting an investment,

214
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,490
only for us to take it.

215
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,490
Come on.

216
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,790
Why do you care about that?

217
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,860
Shouldn't you be welcoming my help?

218
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,430
The chairman gave you that task
because he still thinks something of you.

219
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,500
Are you out of your mind?

220
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,470
This is stealing!

221
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,580
Follow me. Let's talk.

222
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,060
Even if it's the chairman's order,
there are things we can't do.

223
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,700
What can't we do?

224
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,100
Don't you know the answer to that?

225
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,870
Even if it's legally sound,

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,770
we shouldn't do things that go against
our conscience and ethics.

227
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,340
I'm getting sick of your lecturing.

228
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,970
Do you have the right to say that?

229
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,580
How true were you
to your conscience and ethics?

230
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,580
I'm saying we should go after
a tiny company no one has heard of.

231
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,690
Aren't you shaking Mingang to its core?

232
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,620
With your incompetent management.

233
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,750
I'm saying...

234
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,960
it doesn't end with just the company.

235
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,930
What you're doing will end the lives
of the people who rely on the jobs there.

236
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,000
Why do you care whether they live or die?

237
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,970
Why should I care about
something so insignificant?

238
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,640
Don't you dare say that.

239
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,510
- You arrogant punk.
- What do you think you're doing?

240
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,520
(Mingang Distribution)

241
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,420
Why are you acting like this too?

242
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,460
Why are you angry at just me?

243
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,630
You must've seen more than enough.

244
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,700
Do you want me to call Director Moon
for a three-way confrontation?

245
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,100
To figure out who's in the right?

246
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,330
Do you have feelings for Director Moon?

247
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,040
What did you say?

248
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,770
That's the only thing
that explains your stance.

249
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,470
For the past four years,

250
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,910
you were overly lenient and accepting
of whatever Director Moon did.

251
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,910
You're not like that to anyone else.

252
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,210
That's because...

253
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,850
Because you scouted him.

254
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,420
That's what I thought it was at first.

255
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,120
But now I'm thinking
there might be more to it than that.

256
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,590
I didn't consider that, but great.

257
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,460
I might as well think about...

258
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,430
the feelings I didn't know I had.

259
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,870
Ms. Min.

260
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,130
You can go.

261
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,470
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

262
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,910
What's going on? Why is he so angry?

263
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,510
Wait.

264
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,120
You can't barge in without an appointment.

265
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,020
What if no one's there?

266
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,450
- What do you mean?
- They're busy people,

267
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,990
both the chairman and the CEO.

268
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,490
There's no way
they're always in their offices.

269
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,860
Am I looking at a flatfish
that broke a leg in a Pilates session?

270
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,330
They're running around
asking people for money,

271
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,800
and I want to offer them money.

272
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,970
Yes, but I still think
you should talk to Ji Seop first.

273
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,600
Don't you know what a surprise present is?

274
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,470
I'll make a deal for my money
with the director position...

275
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,840
without Ji Seop or Ja Kyung knowing.

276
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,320
Your daughter sent me.

277
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,290
You're the side dish girl Ja Kyung sent.

278
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,420
Yes.

279
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,460
I brought you radish greens kimchi,
kkakdugi with oysters,

280
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,360
grilled fish, and seasoned vegetables.

281
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,960
Oh, my goodness.

282
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,930
Where's your hometown?

283
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,970
It looks like what I ate growing up.

284
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,070
You have the accent too.

285
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,400
Yes.

286
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,740
My gosh. It's delicious.

287
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,510
Honey. It's just the way you like it.

288
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,310
My word. My hometown flavors
are waltzing in my mouth.

289
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,650
Bring me some rice, woman.

290
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,590
The whole pot. If there's no cooked rice,
I'll eat uncooked rice.

291
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,690
- The radish greens kimchi.
- Radish greens kimchi.

292
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,390
- Oh, my country.
- My gosh.

293
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,630
Goodness.

294
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,530
(Hankuk Hospital)

295
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,460
That is what happened
to my parents 30 years ago.

296
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,870
They'd worked hard
to develop the new technology,

297
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,240
but didn't have the money
to do anything with it.

298
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,110
He approached them,
disguised as an investor.

299
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,680
And when they caught on,
he killed them in a staged accident.

300
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,160
Will you please wake up?

301
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,090
We can't let the same thing happen again.

302
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,700
The only way
to counter Min Doo Sik's greed...

303
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,830
is for you to take the stand and testify.

304
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,800
So that there are no more victims like me.

305
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,970
Please, Mr. Jo.

306
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,580
I swore that I'd do anything you asked.

307
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,280
I'll think about it, then.

308
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,450
Do you still jog every morning?

309
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,220
Here, I jog along the Han River.

310
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,970
Manager Gong. Pack me some ginger tea
in a thermos tomorrow morning.

311
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Enough for two to drink during a workout.

312
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,240
You plan to exercise?
You don't like exercising in the morning.

313
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,440
I have a reason to try it out.

314
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,310
Hey.

315
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,350
We meet again.

316
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,550
I usually work out at the gym
and come outside very rarely.

317
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,090
You're Lucia, right?

318
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,520
I didn't expect to see you here.

319
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,330
Enjoy your workout.

320
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,530
Wait.

321
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,930
If you're done, how about some tea?

322
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,200
The ginger tea is extra nice today.

323
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,140
Sorry. I'm not yet done with my workout.

324
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,640
I must run two more laps.

325
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,370
Really?

326
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,010
That's too bad.

327
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,850
Would you like to wait, then?

328
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,890
I'll wait for you over there.

329
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,470
How many hours is her workout?

330
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,310
Is she training for a marathon?

331
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
Over here!

332
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,690
Thanks for waiting.

333
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,460
It's better to drink hot tea
after a sweaty workout.

334
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,280
You seemed pretty close with Madam Jang.

335
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,350
We're not close friends,

336
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,990
but we help each other out
every now and then in the US.

337
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,020
I'm envious.

338
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,990
That kind of relationship with her
is what I need right now.

339
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,290
But she's hard to befriend,

340
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,330
and I need a favor.

341
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,200
I heard.

342
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,230
Your business is struggling.

343
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,070
It's a common problem.

344
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,310
An investment is all I need to solve it.

345
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,880
Do you think...

346
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,380
you could help me out, Lucia?

347
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,280
It would be nice if I could help you,

348
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,690
but I heard the news that Mingang's
online business wasn't doing well.

349
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,690
A competitor had that published
to portray us in a bad light.

350
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,400
Fake news and twisted truths
even get people killed.

351
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,370
I think people
who use the media like that are evil.

352
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,670
They should pay for it.

353
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,950
We're struggling financially...

354
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,980
only because
I'm a stickler for the law and rules.

355
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,250
That's the only reason.

356
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,050
We'd be fine if I abused legal loopholes.

357
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,430
Lucia.

358
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,300
I'm putting my ego aside
to ask you for help.

359
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,500
Will you put in a good word for me
when you talk to Madam Jang?

360
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,940
If things work out well,
I won't forget your help.

361
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,440
I always repay the favor.

362
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,760
(Mingang Distribution)

363
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,760
Good morning, every...

364
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,760
These people...

365
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,710
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

366
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,850
I hope she talks to Madam Jang for me.

367
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,790
I mentioned your request
to the director and my board.

368
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,360
They're all against it.

369
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,660
They don't see why
we should invest our reserve funds.

370
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,300
I pleaded with them,
and they still said no. What now?

371
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,100
Did you come here to tell me that?

372
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,470
Yes, I had to come by.

373
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,970
In case you weren't doing anything
because you relied on us.

374
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,770
Things must be really bad
if you came to me of all people.

375
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,210
Don't worry. I don't need your money now.

376
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,250
I found an investor.

377
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,920
You did? Who is it?

378
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,450
They'll invest
knowing the situation you're in?

379
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,160
Hello, Madam.

380
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,290
Right now?

381
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,860
Of course. I'll be right there.

382
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,530
Did you see that?

383
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,100
They can't wait to give me their money.

384
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,450
Lucia mentioned she met you.

385
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,060
We happened to meet on the jogging course.

386
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,490
So she said.

387
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,490
She said she felt like
she'd made a friend,

388
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,530
which is just what she needed...

389
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,730
because she hasn't been here
for long and was feeling lonely.

390
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,130
We can be friends. Why not?
We're in the same age group.

391
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,940
You're so open-minded, Ms. Min.

392
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,140
Madam.

393
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,810
Since we're on the topic,
I must ask you again.

394
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,080
Put me in touch with the Macau fund.

395
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,680
Oh, that?

396
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,480
I'll see.

397
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,660
Lucia did ask me to show you some favor.

398
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,220
Did she?

399
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,760
But this is a monetary matter.

400
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,130
And it's not a small amount.

401
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,370
Things will get better in no time.

402
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,570
We just lack the funds.

403
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,570
Once that's in place,
we'll get right back on track.

404
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,370
I'd like to believe you,

405
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,940
but I'm not at Mingang every day,

406
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,940
and there's no way I know how things work.

407
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,010
I have to take your word for it,

408
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,850
and that's a bit...

409
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,720
How about this, then?

410
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,860
Lucia. I'll have her work at my company.

411
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,690
She can tell you exactly what's going on.
You trust her, don't you?

412
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,400
I guess so, but...

413
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,330
I need Lucia to agree with that idea.

414
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,330
I'll talk to her.

415
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,370
All you have to do is set up a meeting
and ask her to come to Mingang.

416
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,440
Pass on the request
to meet me in my office.

417
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,650
Hello, Madam.

418
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,690
Lucia will be there soon.

419
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,990
If she accepts your offer,
I'll think about investing.

420
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,530
Don't worry.

421
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,730
I'm expecting a guest.

422
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,530
Escort her to my office politely.

(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

424
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,710
Welcome.

425
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,480
I couldn't wait to see you again.

426
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,450
Hello.

427
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,590
You asked to see me?

428
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,340
This is lawyer Kim Sun Jae,
head of our Legal Team.

429
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,970
This is Jung Lucia.

430
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,470
Nice to meet you.

431
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,110
I'm Jung Lucia.

(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

433
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,610
Meeting someone I need
at the perfect timing.

434
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,450
It can't be a coincidence, can it?

435
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,850
I hope this relationship
lasts to the very end.

436
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,720
Did you forget what I gave up in the US
to come back here?

437
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,060
I won't share Mingang Distribution,
and I won't lose it to anyone.

438
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,360
Don't worry.
I'll bring Mingang down myself.

439
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,830
We must turn someone's crisis
into our opportunity.

440
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,430
We must climb over them to get higher.

441
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,200
I won't create more victims like myself.

442
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,800
I will stop you.
