1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,810
Stella Jang.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,010
Your Korean name is Jang Yeon Sook,
correct?

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,810
That's a little out of the blue.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,810
And?

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,450
David Jung.

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,250
His Korean name is Jung Ho Se.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,650
And you're his mother.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,690
Was there a son I didn't know I had?

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,100
Okay, then let me ask you this.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,230
You sent that portrait to
CEO Min Kyung Chae, didn't you?

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,340
I saw it with my own two eyes.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,210
I'm talking about the painting
in your room...

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,010
when I came in here looking for Lucia.

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,480
I have no idea what you're talking about.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,880
Are you daydreaming?

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,350
I don't know what your game is,
but get out now.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,580
So, the portrait and Jung Ho Se...

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,620
You're saying you've never heard of them?

20
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,290
My son is in the States.

21
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,360
You're so good at background checks.
You couldn't have missed that.

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,060
If you're going to keep stonewalling me,

23
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,800
well, there's nothing more I can say.

24
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,030
What can I say about what I don't know?

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,170
You're smart.
Why are you being like this?

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,800
If you insist on acting this way, Madam,
you leave me no choice.

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,570
However,

28
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,610
about that portrait...

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,780
Whoever sent it childishly made it look
like a funeral portrait.

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,980
It's not like that's going to actually
hurt CEO Min.

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,150
It just adds fuel to her fire.

32
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,350
What do you mean by that?

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,560
CEO Min said she was going to find
whoever sent it and make them pay.

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,860
It was a stupid move, whoever did it.

35
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,160
They likely thought they could rattle her
with something like that,

36
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,700
but it's not going to go as planned.

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,880
That guy...

38
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,180
That man is as slippery as an eel.

39
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,750
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

40
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,060
(New York, 20 years ago)

41
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,540
Darling, how much longer do I have to
hold this pose?

42
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,470
Just a little longer. I'm almost done.

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,380
Make sure you make me look pretty.

44
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,250
You're already beautiful.

45
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,820
All done.

46
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,060
Gosh! This is amazing!

47
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,900
That's because I had a beautiful model.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,570
Can't argue with that.

49
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,910
This is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.

50
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,910
If this ever falls into
someone else's hands,

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,810
it means I'm no longer of this world.

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,520
Because I plan on keeping it
until the day I die.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,740
Did you really have a family?

54
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,170
Does that mean your family...

55
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,340
wants me dead?

56
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,910
If Kim Sun Jae went to see you,

57
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,780
he's sure to report it to CEO Min.

58
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,390
It doesn't matter.
There's no proof it was me.

59
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,220
Maybe not right away,

60
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,760
but he'll eventually figure out
the connection between you and your son.

61
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,460
Ho Se and I have no official ties,
so it won't be easy.

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,370
Still, the fact that he tracked me down
just from the portrait...

63
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,370
means he's exceptionally sharp.

64
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,440
This Kim Sun Jae,
what are we going to do about him?

65
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,610
I'll keep an eye on him for now.

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
Understood.

67
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,280
Where have you been?

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,820
And what if I have?

69
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,020
Do I have to report my whereabouts to you?

70
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,530
No. Of course,
you don't have to report to me.

71
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,530
But the contract our team sent
to the Legal Team...

72
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,430
still needs your legal review.

73
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,570
I'm sure someone else will handle it.
The Legal Team isn't short-staffed.

74
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,940
Still, it would be best if you handled it,
Lawyer Kim.

75
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
You're the expert, after all.

76
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,210
Gosh, I can't tell
if that's a compliment...

77
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,010
- or if you're trying to pick a fight.
- Pick a fight?

78
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,590
- Why would I have any reason to do that?
- Or are you just trying to sound me out?

79
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,460
You need to know what I'm thinking
and what my next move will be...

80
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,160
so you can prepare yourselves.

81
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,090
That's quite a leap.

82
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,760
Why would I need to prepare
for anything from you?

83
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,230
Well, what a shame.

84
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,870
Because I don't have time to deal with you
for the foreseeable future.

85
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,870
You see, I've just found out
something very interesting.

86
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,480
I don't think I can pay you any attention
for a while.

87
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,050
What a shame.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,100
Se Ri says she doesn't have an appetite.

89
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,070
- Why not?
- Well...

90
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,340
She says she won't sit with the criminal
who ruined her birth mother.

91
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,480
Oh, just great. Absolutely brilliant.

92
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,220
You're all determined to be the death
of your own father.

93
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,550
There's no other explanation.

94
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,750
Judging by your actions,
it's enough to make me lose my appetite.

95
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,020
Seriously.

96
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,030
Please eat more.
I heard you barely touched your lunch.

97
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,730
Please put something simple on a tray.
I'll take it up to her.

98
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,230
You will?

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,270
Of course.
I should be the one to handle this.

100
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,270
I'll try to calm her down,
so don't worry and finish your meal.

101
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,790
Eat.

102
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,560
Get it out of here.

103
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,000
Eat it.
The chairman is worried about you.

104
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,200
This is why you can't be a sister
to Kyung Chae.

105
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,540
Seriously, why are you starving yourself?

106
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,510
This is when you need to eat properly
more than ever.

107
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,910
So I can have the strength to fight?

108
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,210
Ultimately, thanks to you,

109
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,680
my sister and I
are now worse than strangers!

110
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,850
The two of you could never be
on the same side anyway.

111
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,890
One of you will become the successor
to Mingang Distribution.

112
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,390
So isn't it obvious what will happen
to the one who's left behind?

113
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,560
It's not because of me.
This was always your destiny.

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,170
You just had to turn us sisters
against each other.

115
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,080
- Is this why you came into our family?
- It's "Mom," not "you."

116
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,920
Besides, what reason would I have
to drive you two apart?

117
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,250
Unless...

118
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,990
Think carefully.

119
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,460
I signed away my rights to any shares
when I married the chairman.

120
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,130
That means if I ever leave this house,
I'll walk away with nothing.

121
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,460
So what motive could I possibly have?

122
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,230
If it's not my father's fortune,

123
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,670
then you must have another motive.

124
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,770
All done?

125
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,370
There's my good girl.

126
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,140
Let's go talk in your room.

127
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,760
She seems to lay it on even thicker
in front of you.

128
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,790
So it seems.

129
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,930
She should just get on Father's good side
and squeeze a penny out of him.

130
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,330
I don't understand why
she's so fixated on Se Ri.

131
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,430
The problem is Se Ri.

132
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,440
You haven't spoken much with her lately,
have you?

133
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,710
No, I haven't.

134
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,140
But that woman is with Se Ri
all day long, talking nonstop.

135
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,640
They even sleep in the same room.

136
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,220
Ms. Min,

137
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,390
there's nothing more heartbreaking
than having your child taken from you.

138
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,330
You have to get Se Ri away
from that woman.

139
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,000
It's been a while, CEO Min.

140
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,770
Welcome. Please, have a seat.

141
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,440
(Mingang Distribution)

142
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,750
I wonder what you wanted to see me about.

143
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,450
Meet with Stella Jang
first thing tomorrow.

144
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,320
And when you're with her,

145
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,320
you must tell her that a trashy portrait
like that means nothing to you.

146
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,430
Like someone who can't be rattled.

147
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,760
Why do I have to do that?

148
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,330
I'll explain later.

149
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,430
It's the best way
to mess with those trying to break you.

150
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,240
- I don't understand what you mean.
- Just trust me,

151
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,270
and please do as I say.

152
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,540
Lucia... No...

153
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,280
This is our first meeting
since my stepmother's wedding.

154
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,850
You say "stepmother" so naturally now.

155
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,450
What choice do I have?
I have to accept reality.

156
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,120
I was overly sensitive at the wedding,
saying that you two were in cahoots.

157
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,720
So you realize it was a misunderstanding?

158
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,190
Does that mean we can go back
to the way things were?

159
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,590
Of course.

160
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,640
This must be a portrait of you.

161
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,270
My gosh! What is this?

162
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,770
This isn't a funeral portrait.
Who on earth did this?

163
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,980
I know.
It's such a childish, immature prank.

164
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,110
I actually find this kind
of thing laughable.

165
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,750
I don't know who did it,

166
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,560
but I'd love to see the face of the person
who pulled this pathetic stunt.

167
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,930
"Pathetic stunt?"

168
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,530
The nerve of her.

169
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,160
So this is nothing to you, is that it?

170
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,170
Secretary Kim.

171
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,070
Get rid of this trash.

172
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,110
"Trash?" How dare she...

173
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,040
I have a meeting scheduled today,
so now isn't great,

174
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,640
but we should have a meal sometime.

175
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,710
She made a point of calling me here.

176
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,780
And with that innocent face,
she acted like nothing had happened.

177
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,650
Kim Sun Jae must have coached her.

178
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,460
For her to come here and sound you out
means she's suspicious but lacks proof,

179
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,790
so she's just fishing.

180
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,500
If that's her game, we can't stand by.
It's time to drop that bomb, isn't it?

181
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,950
That's my wife's handiwork.

182
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,250
Your wife?

183
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,180
Lucia.

184
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,820
She replaces them when they start to wilt,
and she takes excellent care of them.

185
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,770
I'm here to report
on what you asked me about.

186
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
You mentioned...

187
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,970
that you were looking for a mole...

188
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,340
who hid their identity
and infiltrated Mingang.

189
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Did you find them? Who is it?

190
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,910
Who could it be, Moon Tae Kyung?

191
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,720
Don't you have anyone in mind?

192
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,980
Why are you asking Director Moon?

193
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,350
Just on a hunch.

194
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,390
I just had a feeling he might know.

195
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,360
What are you talking about?
Are you playing games with me?

196
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,460
Of course not. Play games?
How could I do that to you, sir?

197
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,830
I suspected someone,
so I did a little digging.

198
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,000
- It turned out to be a dead end.
- What? So it was a false lead?

199
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,440
You made all this fuss over that?

200
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
My apologies.

201
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,090
Kim Sun Jae.

202
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,390
So you think you can toy
with people like that?

203
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,660
It's me.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,170
I have a favor to ask.

205
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,630
Could you find out CEO Min's schedule
for tomorrow?

206
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,700
All of a sudden? Why?

207
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,570
Min Kyung Chae has to find out, too.

208
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,140
She needs to learn
who is responsible for what happened...

209
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,910
to the man she loved more
than life itself.

210
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,480
(Mingang Distribution)

211
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,350
What is it?

212
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Well...

213
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,620
Do you happen to have any plans tomorrow?

214
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,560
There's something I need to discuss
with you in private.

215
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,130
I'm sorry.
I have prior engagements tomorrow.

216
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,130
I have a meeting with Chinese buyers
about our online distribution.

217
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,730
Oh, well then...

218
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,140
Where is your appointment?

219
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,040
If you don't mind,
I could wait for you nearby.

220
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,140
At Mucheon Klimp, 3 p.m.

221
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,780
But I think it'll run late.

222
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,180
Is it urgent?

223
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,750
No, it's not.

224
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,420
Then I guess tomorrow won't work.

225
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,020
Then just tell me here and now.

226
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Some other time.

227
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,670
Tomorrow, 3 p.m., at Mucheon Klimp.

228
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,570
(Jung Lucia, tomorrow at 3 p.m.
at Mucheon Klimp)

229
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,920
Thank you.

230
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Be careful.

231
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,160
And don't forget that
I'm always worried about you.

232
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,540
What did Moon Tae Kyung say?
Why the long face?

233
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,270
It's nothing, really.

234
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,450
I mean, honestly,
ever since that woman moved in,

235
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,250
we haven't had a single quiet day.

236
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,150
And you know, my husband says...

237
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
that this time, that woman was why...

238
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,790
Kyung Chae
and Se Ri had that huge blow-up.

239
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,090
- Is that so?
- She's a total troublemaker.

240
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,760
Why are you bad-mouthing someone
who isn't even here?

241
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,730
Has anything gone wrong
since my stepmom moved in?

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,070
Oh my goodness!

243
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,200
My stepmom is ten times better
than Kyung Chae.

244
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,770
Kyung Chae is cold and selfish,
and that's all she is.

245
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,410
You shouldn't say that.
Blood is thicker than water, after all.

246
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,610
Sometimes the bonds you make are stronger
than the ones you're born with.

247
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,980
You and that woman...

248
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,720
I mean, your stepmother,
it hasn't even been that long.

249
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,650
It's not about time,
it's about the connection.

250
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,650
You wouldn't understand.

251
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,170
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

252
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,900
Welcome!
Oh, are you just finishing up?

253
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,710
Yeon Ah, my fellow hometown girl!
Business still booming?

254
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,040
You know it. Just leave it all to me.

255
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,550
Looks like a customer was here
about 25 minutes ago.

256
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,750
Oh, honestly. You're just unbelievable!

257
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,350
Do you think she can't handle it herself?
You were born suspicious, I swear.

258
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,820
So, is everything all right at home?

259
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,890
Oh, there's plenty happening.
Not at our house, but with our in-laws.

260
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,060
Oh? What's happening over there?

261
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,600
Don't even get me started. It's chaos.
Those two sisters fight constantly,

262
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,800
and our Ja Kyung can't get
a moment's peace.

263
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,470
Oh my, that's awful!
Is it something serious?

264
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,570
That's all because my in-law is useless.

265
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,810
When the man of the house isn't respected,
that's when trouble starts.

266
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,550
If it were me, Oh Pan Sool,

267
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,980
I'd have disowned my children
on the spot and sold them online.

268
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,950
Oh, please.

269
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,720
If you were in charge,
it'd be a madhouse.

270
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,320
You're the type to drink an Americano
with fish sauce...

271
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,660
and be like, "Oh, what an interesting mix
of bitter and salty!"

272
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,730
I, Oh Pan Sool,
am the last true patriarch of our time.

273
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,600
Patriarch...

274
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Patriarch.

275
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,780
Let's meet outside tomorrow
for a change of scenery.

276
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Tomorrow?

277
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,920
Your daughters are at each other's necks.

278
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,650
It must be so upsetting for you.

279
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,120
Let's eat out together
and get some fresh air.

280
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,270
Did you enjoy your meal?

281
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,710
Getting out really helps clear my head.

282
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,440
See? What did I tell you?

283
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,510
Try not to worry about it so much.

284
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,010
My kids are the only ones
who don't have a clue.

285
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,020
How they're making me rot
from the inside out.

286
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,950
How can kids understand a parent's pain?

287
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,890
Not unless rivers start flowing uphill.

288
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,590
By the way,

289
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,170
why hasn't your oldest daughter
married yet?

290
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,770
She's such a catch.

291
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,100
Kyung Chae... It'll be hard
for her to ever get married.

292
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,440
Years ago, I came between her
and some guy she was in love with.

293
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,240
Why? If she loved him,
you should've approved.

294
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,350
What was I supposed to see
in a penniless artist?

295
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,380
I'd rather have her die single
than give her to a bum like that.

296
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,150
So you broke them up?

297
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,660
You think he went away quietly?

298
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,230
He must have smelled money
because he clung to her like a leech.

299
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,600
So, what happened to him?

300
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,230
You know me.
You think I'd let that stand?

301
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,300
My policy is to remove problems early.

302
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,490
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

303
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,030
They definitely said
he had an accident in the States...

304
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,030
Don't tell me my father...

305
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,270
Did the meeting with the buyers go well?

306
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,910
You said that man died in a crash
in the States, right?

307
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,410
You mean...

308
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,280
David Jung?

309
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,080
Yes. In a car accident.

310
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,820
Did they ever catch
the one responsible?

311
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,250
They did catch someone, but...

312
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,090
Come to think of it,
something was a little strange.

313
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,490
The homeless man who was identified
as the culprit...

314
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,500
was an alcoholic
and could barely communicate,

315
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,000
but he went out of his way
to the police station to confess.

316
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,830
That's ridiculous.

317
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,500
- What's wrong?
- That...

318
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,640
is exactly the kind of trick
my father would pull.

319
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,110
Do you think Min Kyung Chae
heard everything?

320
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,750
She definitely heard everything.
She was too close not to.

321
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,320
What about Min Doo Sik?

322
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,720
He didn't notice a thing.
He went right into the company, after all.

323
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,590
You think she'll just stand by
after finding out her father hurt her man?

324
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,430
Not a chance. Not with her personality.

325
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,940
Move.

326
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,270
I'm not in the mood
to deal with you right now.

327
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,170
And you think I am?

328
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,740
Too bad, though.

329
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,840
This is just our fate.

330
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,050
We're destined to always stand
in each other's way.

331
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,420
The least you could do is apologize.

332
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,050
For what you did to my mother.

333
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,090
I said, apologize!

334
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,600
I thought I told you
I was not in the mood.

335
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,160
You knew she couldn't say no,

336
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,900
so forcing her into that nursing home...

337
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,230
was a crime.

338
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,140
I said, move.

339
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,810
I don't have time for the likes of you.

340
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,540
I have a bone to pick with my father.

341
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,880
Confront me about what? Go on, try me.

342
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,220
Was it you, Father?

343
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,490
Were you the one who did that to him?

344
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,290
What are you talking about?
Make some sense!

345
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,960
The man from 20 years ago! Jung Ho Se!

346
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,330
Did you kill him, Father?

347
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,060
Don't be ridiculous!
What do you take your own father for?

348
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,970
I heard you say it yourself,
loud and clear.

349
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,600
What could you have possibly heard?

350
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,440
What's wrong with you?
Looking for a fight?

351
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,340
First, you raise hell with your sister,
and now you're coming after me?

352
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,850
I chose you over your incompetent brother.
You should be grateful!

353
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,350
What are you questioning?
You think you have a right to question me?

354
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,680
If I hadn't done that,
you wouldn't be where you are today!

355
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,150
Father!

356
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,250
Don't you dare raise your voice at me!

357
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,590
Even if I could go back,
I'd do the exact same thing!

358
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,330
For what I did,

359
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,460
I don't regret it one single bit!

360
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,570
The nerve!

361
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,440
Oh, my head...

362
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,580
Looks like Lucia really started a fire
in that family.

363
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,450
So, does that just leave the son?

364
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,820
He has an inferiority complex...

365
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,520
because of his
two accomplished younger sisters.

366
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,390
And he's obsessed with the inheritance
he'll get when Chairman Min dies.

367
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,200
I figured as much.

368
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,700
A forged will.

369
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,940
For a simpleton like Min Ji Seop,
this is the perfect bait.

370
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,410
(Last Will and Testament)

371
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,590
Gosh...

372
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,890
Goodness...

373
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Oh my, is your head hurting again?

374
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,170
After the scene Kyung Chae caused earlier,
how could my head not hurt?

375
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,240
And the medicine isn't even helping.
What are we going to do?

376
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,270
Any more stress and I feel like
I'm going to collapse.

377
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,640
I need to get some rest.

378
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Gosh.

379
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,260
I guess you're not one to support
your husband, are you?

380
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,700
Excuse me?
What is that supposed to mean?

381
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,830
The chairman has been so distressed lately
because of his two daughters.

382
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,070
Wouldn't it be great if his son were
to step up at a time like this?

383
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,240
Step up how?

384
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,840
To be a dutiful son.
And make up for his sisters' behavior.

385
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,610
He'd win his father's favor, wouldn't he?

386
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,780
It's the perfect opportunity.

387
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,520
This is the chance for your husband
to finally win his father's approval.

388
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,530
So that woman is telling me
to be a "good son?"

389
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,900
Well, she's not wrong.
You should use this to win his favor.

390
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,630
I mean, how often does an opportunity
like this come along?

391
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,230
If this is about Father's inheritance,
I don't need to try so hard.

392
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,170
He's not going to forget about
his one and only son.

393
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,810
Kyung Chae and Soo Jung can be
as capable as they want.

394
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,310
Once they're married, they're out.

395
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,710
Who'll be by Father's side in the end?
You think he doesn't know that?

396
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,250
- Come on, darling.
- You don't get it.

397
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,850
Father only gives me a hard time
on the surface.

398
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,120
Deep down,
he has it all planned out for me.

399
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Darn it.

400
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,030
Go to work with your father.

401
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,540
I told you,
it was easier for me to go on my own.

402
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,270
Were you even listening to me yesterday?
While your father is sick of your sisters.

403
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,180
I said go score some points.

404
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,750
- Gosh.
- Oh, seriously. Fine.

405
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,750
Father.

406
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,760
What? Did he leave already?

407
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,700
(Last Will and Testament)

408
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,440
What?

409
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,520
Mingang Distribution goes to Kyung Chae,

410
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,050
and the chain stores to Soo Jung...

411
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,520
and all the real estate to Se Ri...

412
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,490
Lucia?

413
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,090
Wait, why her?

414
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,430
Wait a second, what about me?

415
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,860
- Why am I not in here?
- Oh, my.

416
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,070
Should you be reading that?

417
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,570
You're his son, but reading his will...

418
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,940
The chairman left early
for a breakfast meeting.

419
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,740
Is this will for real?

420
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,180
I'm asking if it's real!

421
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,780
You should go now.

422
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,950
I won't tell the chairman you saw this.

423
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,150
Darn it.

424
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,460
- Darn it all.
- Honey, what is it?

425
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,530
Honey!

426
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,730
Father!

427
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,170
Did you decide to stop knocking?

428
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,810
Where are your manners?

429
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,780
That's right!
I have no manners whatsoever.

430
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,550
I'm not afraid of anything.
You got a problem with that?

431
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,080
What's gotten into you?

432
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,920
Did you hate me that much?

433
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,920
Even for a disappointing son,
how could you?

434
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,790
People say that a parent loves
all their children equally.

435
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,590
You even took care of that woman, Lucia.

436
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,890
What are you talking about?
Start making sense!

437
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:35,030
Did you think I wouldn't find out
that you left me out of the will?

438
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,940
Father, please tell me it's not true.

439
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,970
But still, when you pass away,

440
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,440
I'm the one who has to
serve you at your own memorial!

441
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,810
You insolent brat!

442
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,450
Gosh, my head...

443
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,450
Before his own father is even
in the grave,

444
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,050
what kind of son harps on about a will
when his father is still alive?

445
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,290
Get out!

446
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,860
Get out this instant!

447
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,390
That...

448
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,660

449
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,330

450
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,940
No...

(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

452
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,250
The chairman's will!

453
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,710
If you'd shown me sooner,
this would've been avoidable.

454
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,520
For now, we must fight tooth and nail
to protect our shares and your father's.

455
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,220
From now on, Moon Tae Kyung,
you will keep influencing Oh Pan Sool.

456
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,030
Are you saying we can stop CEO Min
from becoming chairman?

457
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,630
I think the time has come.
I should prepare to take over as chairman.
