00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,180
(Episode 66)

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,710
What are you looking at?

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,520
Why did you open that?
You have no business looking in there.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,450
It's nothing.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,550
I was looking for your medicine,
and I just wondered what this was.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,320
Why are you awake?

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,160
That herbal medicine
should make you sleep well.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,960
I had a headache earlier,
so I took some medicine.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,230
You can't mix herbal and medicine.
It can be dangerous.

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,340
Where is your medicine bottle?
I couldn't find it anywhere.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,910
I always keep it right here.
Did you forget?

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,310
I guess it slipped my mind.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,310
Have another dose and get some sleep.
I'll sleep with Se Ri tonight.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,680
I'll go warm it up for you.

15
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,560
Does she even know
what she was looking at?

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,100
What is it?

17
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,340
We had him pose as a local petty thief
and arrested him on the spot.

18
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,240
He's been turned over to the prosecutors.
And did you get the documents all right?

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,910
I did. But everything else is still here.

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,820
Won't he be suspicious
if this is the only thing gone?

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,990
It's just a suspicion. What can he do?
He's already been indicted.

22
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,690
The case is closed.

23
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,490
All right. Got it.

24
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,230
Thank you for going to this trouble.

25
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,530
What a bolt from the blue.

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,170
No, wait. Since we got it back,
it's not a clear day.

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,410
It's a thunderbolt on a cloudy day.

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,480
How did you find it so quickly?

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,010
Well, I was searching the area
and decided to check with the police.

30
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,710
It turned out it was already there.

31
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,490
That thief has the worst luck.

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,250
That's as ridiculous as a mayfly's exam.

33
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,790
What are you, the thief's sister?

34
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,830
Actually, he wasn't caught.

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,530
He turned himself in.

36
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,260
He dared to mess with Oh Pan Sool.
He must have been shaking in his boots.

37
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,370
Wait a minute.

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,870
But...

39
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,770
That's strange. Something's missing.

40
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,010
What? What's missing?

41
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,240
Well, um, everything else is here,

42
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,550
but the contract for Han Kyung Soo
of Doeun Industries is missing.

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
What?

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
That's weird.

45
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,950
Look again carefully.
How could just that one file be gone?

46
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,320
That's what I'm saying.

47
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,660
No, that's the only one missing. See?

48
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,960
Are you sure you brought it back
exactly as it was?

49
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,100
Yes, of course.
I brought it as the police gave it to me.

50
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,500
Then did it grow legs and walk away?
Why is it gone?

51
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,570
That was the most important one.

52
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,440
Why are you taking it out on him?
He personally went to help you.

53
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,580
This is driving me crazy.

54
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,450
Doeun Industries...
Theirs is the only one gone!

55
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,820
How could this have happened?

56
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,620
Doeun Industries... Han Kyung Soo.

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,530
Stealing only my father's contract.
That means they know what it is.

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,100
This is too strange to be a coincidence.

59
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,440
Then, could this also be...

60
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,740
Min Doo Sik's doing?

61
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,490
A document was delivered
for Chairman Min last night.

62
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,990
What kind of document?

63
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,160
Chairman Min woke up unexpectedly,
so I couldn't get a look at it.

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,530
I'll look for it.

65
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,230
That's weird. I'm sure it was right here.

66
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,770
It's gone?

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,570
Min Doo Sik
must have moved it somewhere else.

68
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Then that must mean
it's an important document.

69
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,180
What on earth could it be?

70
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,710
Good question.

71
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,080
For him to be that concerned about it,
it can't be just any ordinary document.

72
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,620
I'll call you later.

73
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,390
Who is it?

74
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,660
It's strange that my father's contract
was the only one that disappeared.

75
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,100
Yes, it is strange.

76
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,970
I'd even set up a meeting with Tae Joo.
And of all the times for this to happen...

77
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,570
Do you think Min Doo Sik is behind this?

78
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,310
As a matter of fact,
I just heard from Lucia.

79
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,480
She said a document was sent to his house
by courier last night.

80
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,380
I suspected as much.

81
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,450
That devious man.
How could he go to such lengths?

82
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,060
To take the only piece of evidence
from the last remaining witness.

83
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,160
Lucia said it's not at his house,
so I think it's in the chairman's office.

84
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
The chairman's office?

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
(Mingang Distribution)

86
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,600
What are you doing here?

87
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Me?

88
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,270
I just have some documents
that need the chairman's approval.

89
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,070
Well, if the chairman is out,

90
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,710
isn't it common sense
to just come back tomorrow?

91
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,550
You're right. I was just about to leave.

92
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,120
That's not what it looked like to me.

93
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,420
It looked like you were searching
by the chairman's desk.

94
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,120
You must have been mistaken.

95
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,890
Was I?

96
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,230
Fine. We'll go with that.

97
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,830
Since you're so insistent.

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,700
I'm not being insistent.

99
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,230
That's just what happened.

100
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,350
He said he was here for an approval,
so why's he taking the documents with him?

101
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,290
What the heck was he looking for?

102
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,690
You're acting more and more suspicious,
Moon Tae Kyung.

103
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,270
Ma'am.

104
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,770
Do you know why people go to
all the trouble of climbing a mountain...

105
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,610
just to shout "Yahoo"
at the top of their lungs?

106
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,250
Why is that?

107
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,380
It's for the echo.

108
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,720
It's an exchange. A call and a response.

109
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,350
What are you trying to say?

110
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,120
I made you a clear offer.
Why haven't I heard back, yes or no?

111
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,290
I told you I'd pay
your husband's hospital bills.

112
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,460
But, I can't just...

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,460
I owe CEO Han so much.

114
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,100
And I'm saying don't let that ruin you.
That's my point.

115
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,540
Because I'm the kind of person
who can save a life, or destroy one.

116
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,310
Your life is hard enough as it is.
Do you really want to make it worse?

117
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,220
Whatever! I'm busy right now.

118
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,550
Let's talk later.

119
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,910
Excuse me.

120
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,310
CEO Han Kyung Soo of Doeun Industries.

121
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,780
I'm his son, Han Ki Cheol.

122
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,820
It is you, isn't it? I knew it!

123
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,650
Of course. I never forget a face.

124
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,560
But now...

125
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,660
I'm living under the name Moon Tae Kyung.

126
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,330
What? Why? You have a perfectly good name.

127
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,830
It's a long story.

128
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,070
What kind of story?

129
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,070
Is it because of what happened
after your parents passed away?

130
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,140
Yes.

131
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,240
After my parents passed away,
I had no guardian to take care of me,

132
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,580
so I was adopted by a family
in the United States.

133
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,880
My goodness. You poor thing.

134
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,150
You don't have to say another word.

135
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,390
I'll keep my mouth shut.

136
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,190
I won't say a word to anyone
about who you are,

137
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,330
- so don't you worry.
- Thank you.

138
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,330
I overheard that you're behind
on your hospital bills,

139
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,770
and I'll take care of them for you.

140
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,570
Gosh, I couldn't possibly!

141
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,540
I owed your father so much
when he was alive.

142
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,280
No.

143
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,380
If my parents were still alive,

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,710
they would have insisted on it.

145
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,430
So he finally got his hands
on the last piece of evidence...

146
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,160
and plans to bury the truth about
my parents' accident forever?

147
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,030
I'll never let that happen.

148
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,100
- Why are you staring at me like that?
- It's...

149
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,970
It's nothing.

150
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,910
The document Min Doo Sik got last night
was Tae Kyung's parents' contract.

151
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,780
Really?

152
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,820
He said it wasn't at his house,
so it must be in the chairman's office.

153
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,520
I told Tae Kyung to search there,
but I don't know if he has yet.

154
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,990
But if he gets caught,
his cover will be blown.

155
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,660
What was that about earlier?

156
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,830
That you were running a background check
on someone.

157
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,570
What does that have to do with me checking
the employee personnel files?

158
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,770
I have a feeling they're connected.

159
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,380
So you're saying there's someone here
under a false identity?

160
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,040
I said I would tell you
when I had something more concrete.

161
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,980
So you do have a suspect in mind.

162
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,420
Just tell me who.
We can take our time confirming it.

163
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,820
I can't say much,

164
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,160
- but they're someone close to you, sir.
- Right, so who is it?

165
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,430
Please, just give me a little more time.

166
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,030
Unbelievable.

167
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,440
How could he think of taking the contract
for Tae Kyung's parents?

168
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,840
So ruthless.

169
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,710
He plans to die with his sins, doesn't he?
Just like what happened to our Mi So.

170
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,210
What horrible people.

171
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,320
Just thinking about Mingang
makes my blood boil.

172
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,190
Hello?

173
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,490
Se Ri, sweetie. What's up?

174
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,690
I'm bored.

175
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,800
We can't have my daughter being bored.

176
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,900
Want to go for a drive with Mom?

177
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,580
And here I was, thinking we were going
somewhere fun.

178
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,450
What's wrong with this place?
You get to see the chairman. It's nice.

179
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,550
You really like my dad that much,
don't you?

180
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,620
But I love you more.

181
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,430
What are you two doing here?

182
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,700
Getting some air with Mom.

183
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,700
Knock it off with the "Mom" stuff.
People will think she's your real mother.

184
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,970
Why are you talking to a child like that?

185
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,970
Don't you dare talk to Se Ri that way.
I won't stand for it.

186
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,510
Our Se Ri is too precious
to be treated like this.

187
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,010
What did you just say?

188
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,250
"Our" Se Ri?

189
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,150
That's right. Our Se Ri.

190
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,690
My daughter.

191
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,420
She's not your daughter, she's mine.

192
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,620
Min Kyung Chae,
you may have given birth to her,

193
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,890
but she's my daughter now.

194
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,300
Let's go for that drive.
I'll call Mr. Kim.

195
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,870
- Okay, Mom.
- Wait. A word.

196
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,170
What is it?
If you have something to say, say it here.

197
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,310
Follow me!

198
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,150
Gosh, what's her problem?

199
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,910
Go on. Quickly.

200
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,660
Why do you let that woman wrap you
around her little finger?

201
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,160
She's not "that woman." She's my mom.

202
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,130
I told you not to call her "Mom"
in front of me!

203
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,130
Kyung Chae.

204
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,770
You said to assume my birth mom is dead,
didn't you?

205
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Yes, I did.

206
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,180
I've been looking for her so hard
and still can't find her.

207
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,740
Maybe my birth mother isn't
with us anymore.

208
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,710
But I'm right here in front of you.

209
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,020
I'm your mother.

210
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,120
I'm your real mother,
the one who gave birth to you.

211
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,620
Well, if that's true...

212
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,230
I'll just believe that my mom in the stars
sent me my new mom as a gift.

213
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,030
Don't be ridiculous!

214
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,030
Aren't you two done talking yet?

215
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,670
- We're done. Let's go.
- Let's go.

216
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,930
I swear, my head spins thinking about it.
If it hadn't been for you,

217
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,900
my husband here would be six feet under...

218
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,900
This is exactly why you need a young man
around the house.

219
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,540
It was nothing.
I really didn't do all that much.

220
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,110
What do you mean you did nothing?
It's such a relief nobody got hurt.

221
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,910
Who cares if we lost some scraps of paper?

222
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,350
What in the world are you talking about?

223
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,620
That thieving bastard stole my safe,
and now my precious documents are gone.

224
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,690
Gosh.

225
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,630
You should put him on a pedestal.

226
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,260
He saved your life, after all.

227
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,800
No, better yet, you should just adopt him!
It'd be great to have someone reliable.

228
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,870
What?

229
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,840
Adopt him?

230
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,140
No, of course not.
An adoptive son? Goodness, no.

231
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,710
Why? Am I not good enough
to be your adoptive father?

232
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,010
No, sir. Of course not.
That's not it at all.

233
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,150
You don't have that gloomy look anymore.
You look good.

234
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,920
While we're at it, why don't we forge
a father-son bond?

235
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,790
Son.

236
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,460
- Eat up.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,130
- Eat up, son.
- Okay. You too, ma'am.

238
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,610
It's me.

239
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,750
I heard what happened.
It was your father's contract, wasn't it?

240
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,450
Did you check the chairman's office?

241
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,490
I searched, but I couldn't find it.

242
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,160
It must be there.
Especially since it's not at the house.

243
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,200
If I knew it was your parents' contract,
I would've kept it somewhere safe.

244
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,570
No, that would've been impossible.

245
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,240
If you get caught,
it will put you in more danger.

246
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,710
I've had it. I can't stand
Mingang or Min Doo Sik anymore.

247
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,780
How could they stoop so low?

248
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,390
Shouldn't we be doing something?

249
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,190
At this rate, how are you ever going
to get Dad's shares?

250
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,560
I thought I told you to wait.

251
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,860
You're supposed to be on your honeymoon,

252
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,600
but Dad coming back late itself
is the problem.

253
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,430
So what do I do?
Forbid his meetings with other chairmen?

254
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,870
Look here.

255
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,370
You seem to be confused
about your role here.

256
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,980
Your job is to get my dad's shares
and hand them over to me.

257
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,480
Why do you think I went to all the trouble
of getting you to marry my dad?

258
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,820
I don't care if you're sly or seductive.
Just do something!

259
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,690
Is that really the best
you can come up with?

260
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,760
Do you have a better idea?

261
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,960
Did you really come here just to play
the part of the lady of the house?

262
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,630
Be patient.

263
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,470
If you want those shares,
you need to learn to be patient.

264
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,680
- Mom!
- Hey, Se Ri.

265
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,010
I feel all stiff.

266
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,080
Really? A hot bubble bath would feel nice.

267
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,690
Want to take one with Mommy?

268
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,560
Really?
I've never taken a bath with anyone.

269
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,330
- It's embarrassing.
- There's no need to be shy with me.

270
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,330
I'll wash you.

271
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,460
You just relax like a princess.

272
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,830
- Let's go!
- Okay.

273
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,640
Look at them.
One might think she gave birth to Se Ri.

274
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,350
A real fate-touched mother and daughter,
aren't they?

275
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,620
They're so perfect together
it brings a tear to my eye.

276
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,220
Shut it.

277
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,690
- Don't tell me you're jealous.
- I thought I told you to shut it.

278
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,160
Say what you will,
but since Lucia moved in,

279
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,600
it's a good thing
that Se Ri has settled down.

280
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,370
She's not settling down,
she's having her heart stolen.

281
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,470
I don't know why you brought her here,
but you're going to regret it.

282
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,180
Your plan? It's all for nothing.

283
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,980
You've been barking up the wrong tree.

284
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,950
What's that supposed to mean?

285
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,680
What's all for nothing?

286
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,530
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

287
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,740
What are you thinking so deeply about?

288
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,580
About how to kick that woman
out of the house.

289
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,410
You mean Lucia?

290
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,020
Se Ri is changing day by day.

291
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,050
She's becoming too dependent
on that woman.

292
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,620
Well, Se Ri is the bigger problem,
not my father.

293
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,490
At a time like this,

294
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,730
joining forces with Director Min Soo Jung
could be an option.

295
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,160
Join forces with Soo Jung?

296
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,700
Do you know whose fault it is that Lucia
married my father in the first place?

297
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,870
- What do you mean?
- I mean Soo Jung...

298
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,870
She coached my father into the marriage,
and that's how this whole mess started.

299
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,240
But why on earth would she do that?

300
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,010
There's nothing in it for Min Soo Jung.

301
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,180
Apparently, after Lucia married him,

302
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,920
the deal was she'd get Father's shares
and hand them over to Soo Jung.

303
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,190
What? How could they
possibly make a deal like that?

304
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,390
And you want me to side
with someone like that?

305
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,300
I don't know why you brought Lucia here,
but you're going to regret it.

306
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,800
Your plan? It's all for nothing.

307
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,300
You've been barking up the wrong tree.

308
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,380
What did you mean yesterday?
About my plan being all for nothing.

309
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,960
Did you actually think a reckless plan
like that would work?

310
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,960
Is that why you set Dad up with Lucia?

311
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,830
If you hadn't gotten in the middle of it,
they never would have gotten married.

312
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,260
Well, that's...

313
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,870
What does that have to do with my plan?

314
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,140
You pushed for Lucia and my father
to get married...

315
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,370
on the condition that she'd get his shares
for you. Isn't that right?

316
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,710
- How did you know?
- Did you think I wouldn't?

317
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,150
So, what now?

318
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,490
Do you know on what terms
Lucia married Dad?

319
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,920
She signed a share waiver agreement.

320
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,130
A waiver saying she'll accept no shares
of Mingang stock from the chairman.

321
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,000
What?

322
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,730
Do you get it now?

323
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,540
That means you get no shares from Lucia.
Not one.

324
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,040
Lucia played you.

325
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,480
She used you to pull off the marriage.

326
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,360
What brings you here at this hour?

327
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,200
Where's Lucia?

328
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,800
Oh my! Soo Jung,
aren't you supposed to be at the office?

329
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,940
I asked you, where's Lucia?

330
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,530
What do you think you're doing?

331
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,630
What is wrong with you?
I'm married to your father.

332
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,130
I'm your stepmother!
There's a limit to your terrible behavior.

333
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,870
How dare you come in here
and cause a scene?

334
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,780
Why did you hide it from me?

335
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,310
Who do you think you are,
playing me for a fool?

336
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,950
I heard you signed that share waiver
with my father.

337
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,220
No wonder you made no move
to get the shares.

338
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,760
So what are you going to do now?
What are you going to do?

339
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,860
- Who told you that?
- Kyung Chae did.

340
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,100
I'm the only one who was made a fool of.

341
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,140
I can just imagine her laughing at me
for being played by you.

342
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,910
Do you really think Chairman Min Doo Sik
would have let me marry him otherwise?

343
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,480
Then you should have told me!

344
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,310
Whether I told you or not was up to me.
That wasn't a condition of our deal.

345
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,120
The deal was you'd get his shares for me.
I set you up with a man so above you...

346
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,390
and after all my work, what?

347
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,790
Now you say that wasn't part of the deal?

348
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,760
That's absurd.

349
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,590
So what do you want me to do about it?

350
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,460
Are you going to get the marriage annulled
or something?

351
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,430
Yes. That's exactly what I'll do.

352
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,900
I'm going to throw you out myself.

353
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,790
My goodness, what is all this?
A share waiver agreement?

354
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,690
Madam Jung did sign a waiver
before the wedding.

355
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,790
Wait, "Madam Jung?"

356
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,160
Manager Gong,
since when was she Madam Jung?

357
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,800
I thought you called her "that woman."

358
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,800
Well, she is living with the chairman now.

359
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,940
What?
If she's "The Madam," then what am I?

360
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,410
Hey, if you're going to change your tune,
you should've given me a heads-up!

361
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,850
So does that mean I have to call her
"Mother" now?

362
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,050
Right. I need to call my husband.

363
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,690
A share waiver agreement, was it?

364
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,830
Here you go.

365
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,770
The legal team has finished their review.
The partner deal will get approved soon.

366
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,210
That was much quicker than I expected.

367
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,710
Well, I'm always happy to help you out.

368
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,750
By the way,

369
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,580
besides the name Moon Tae Kyung,

370
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,850
do you happen to have any other names?

371
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,750
Like a childhood name or a nickname.

372
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,220
Why the sudden curiosity?

373
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,030
Come on, I'm curious.
We're not exactly strangers.

374
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,290
If we're not strangers, then?

375
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,800
Come on, after everything
we've been tangled up in.

376
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,170
Honestly, it's just pure curiosity
on my part.

377
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,840
Careful. Someone might get the wrong idea.

378
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,300
I'd suggest you curb your curiosity.

379
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,770
All right, then...

380
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,510
You're not some kind of undercover agent,
are you?

381
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,950
Someone who has to hide
their name and identity...

382
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,320
because they're on another
top-secret mission?

383
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,320
Seriously, don't you have better things
to do?

384
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,020
Legal Team must have a lot
of free time on their hands.

385
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,090
What's with you two?

386
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,360
What do you think?

387
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,530
About Director Moon Tae Kyung...

388
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,370
Don't you think
he seems shrouded in mystery?

389
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,870
Shrouded in mystery?

390
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,170
What are you talking about?

391
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,750
What do you mean?
What about Director Moon?

392
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,850
Let's just say I have a hunch.

393
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,180
I've got a nose for these things.

394
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,590
We need to talk.

395
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,160
If you have something to say, say it here.

396
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,470
When I say follow, you follow.

397
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,500
What did you just say to me?

398
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,850
Your whole purpose for coming here
was to get Dad's shares for me.

399
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,850
Since that plan fell through,
it's time for you to leave.

400
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,420
Watch your mouth.

401
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,560
Who do you think you're talking to
like that?

402
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,160
What, did you expect me
to call you Mom or something?

403
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,330
Why don't you just run along
and go to bed?

404
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,900
Dad will have to find out, then.

405
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,240
About the little deal we had between us.

406
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,770
If Chairman Min Doo Sik finds out,
you won't get away unscathed either.

407
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,480
I'll just end up being the bad daughter
who was greedy for her dad's shares.

408
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,580
But it's a different story for you.

409
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,420
You're the one who's going
to suffer for it.

410
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,850
Because you deceived the chairman
with ulterior motives.

411
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,460
So I'm telling you,
get out before the chairman finds out.

412
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,460
And give you the satisfaction?
I'm the lady of this house.

413
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,530
And legally, your mother.

414
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,170
- Don't give me that "mother" nonsense.
- I told you to watch your mouth!

415
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,480
Become my father's woman.
I'll back you all the way.

416
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,320
If that happens, I'll be your stepmother.
Are you sure you're okay with that?

417
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,950
I don't care.
Just marry my father and get his shares.

418
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,760
Do whatever it takes.
Get me the Mingang Distribution shares.

419
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,860
And what do I get out of it?

420
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,970
Just hand over the shares,
and I'll make sure you're set for life.

421
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,800
What are you doing?

422
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,340
Why aren't you packing?

423
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,540
I said pack your bags
and get out of this house!

424
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,160
