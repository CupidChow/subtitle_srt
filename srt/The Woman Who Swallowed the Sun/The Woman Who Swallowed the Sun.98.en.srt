1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,070
Madam Jang is...

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,040
David Jung's...

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,880
or Jung Ho Se's...

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,720
birth mother.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,650
She's Ho Se's...

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,220
birth mother?

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,930
(Episode 98)

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,560
No way. How is that possible?

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,800
What are you even saying right now?

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,870
You...

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,540
If this isn't true, I swear
I won't let you get away with this!

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,100
It's true.

13
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,940
That portrait that was delivered
to the CEO's office.

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,940
I saw it in Madam Jang's room, remember?

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,150
You said only the bereaved family
could have it.

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,250
And I spoke to Madam Jang myself.

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,950
So that means...

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,990
- Madam Jang is really his mother?
- Go see for yourself.

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,780
That was quite a show earlier.

20
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,880
Min Kyung Chae,
seething in the chairman's office.

21
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,750
I almost wanted to take a picture
so I could look at it when I'm bored.

22
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,290
She never would've guessed
you'd have the deciding vote.

23
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,600
She should've tried to live a better life.
Why cause trouble and hurt people?

24
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,500
She's just reaping what she sowed.

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,370
I hope she learns her lesson from this,
but she's not the type.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Tell me about it.

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,940
I don't get why my son, of all people,
fell for a girl like Min Kyung Chae.

28
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,550
Does this make you feel a little better?

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,020
When I think about my Ho Se,
not even close.

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,820
Not until I destroy
Min Kyung Chae and Min Se Ri,

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,090
the mother and daughter,
with my own hands.

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
I'll admit,
that was a little satisfying earlier.

33
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,230
If she finds out
that the three percent stake...

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,400
came from that brat Se Ri,

35
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,430
she's going to lose her mind.

36
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,800
What should I do?
This is all too entertaining...

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,240
that I don't think I can sleep tonight.

38
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,310
It's all thanks to you.
You've always guided and looked after me.

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,110
Why so formal all of a sudden?

40
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,580
Come on, we're family.

41
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,490
We're going to see this through
to the end together, no matter what.

42
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,760
So don't you worry.

43
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,330
From now on, you just focus on
officially taking over the chairmanship.

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,030
You need to get rid of that
"acting" label as soon as possible.

45
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,900
Who could that be at this hour?

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,640
Open the door, now!

47
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,540
- I said, open this door!
- That voice...

48
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,380
Lucia, I have to go. I'll call you back.

49
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,060
What brings you here at this hour?

50
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,400
Come to think of it,
she looks so much like him.

51
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,100
How did I not see it before?

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,100
Ms. Min. Are you listening to me?

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,070
What are you thinking about?

54
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,340
Are you...

55
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
Ho Se's mother?

56
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,320
Do you want to sleep with me tonight?

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,490
You've been so quiet since you got back
from seeing the chairman at the hospital.

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,630
I don't know when Dad will wake up,

59
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,200
but I hope by the time he does,
our family will be different.

60
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,740
I wish Kyung Chae and Ji Seop would
snap out of it and start living right.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,740
My poor Se Ri, you must be really upset.

62
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,910
To be thinking all of this.

63
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,150
It's because I feel like our family
is slowly turning into monsters.

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,350
Monsters?

65
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,890
I'm just afraid that...

66
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,790
we'll get to a point
where there's no turning back.

67
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,230
What are you still doing here?
I told you to leave.

68
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
No.

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,030
I can't leave like this.

70
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,410
Just because my son briefly dated you
in the past,

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,610
what difference does that make?
People date and break up all the time.

72
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,040
It's not a big deal.

73
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,110
It's all over now, a thing of the past.

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
No.

75
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,620
Ho Se and I are not a thing of the past.

76
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,890
What's between us
is still very much alive.

77
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,460
Get out.

78
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,360
And don't ever come back.

79
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,900
Ho Se and I...

80
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,030
are still bound to each other.

81
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,000
What is wrong with you, Ms. Min?
Don't talk such nonsense.

82
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,970
Why are you tormenting me?
Keep it up, and I'll call security.

83
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,410
If you want to be dragged out of here,
then by all means, keep standing there.

84
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,250
My Se Ri...

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,760
is Ho Se's daughter.

86
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,330
What did you just say?

87
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,800
I said, my Se Ri...

88
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,630
is Ho Se's daughter.

89
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,040
The daughter I secretly had 20 years ago.
Her biological father...

90
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,010
is your son, Madam Jang!

91
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,400
That's impossible.

92
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,670
How could she...

93
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,070
be my son's flesh and blood?
What proof do you have?

94
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,040
If you don't believe me,
I'll give you proof.

95
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,620
Ultrasound photos from my pregnancy,
prenatal records, her first clothes...

96
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,580
I still have them all.

97
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,620
That doesn't sound like my Ho Se.

98
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,020
You think he wouldn't know he had a child?

99
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,090
Because I didn't even know myself
at the time.

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,290
I had to return home suddenly
at my father's insistence,

101
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,730
and I only found out I was pregnant
after I arrived.

102
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,970
I was pressured to get an abortion,
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

103
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,600
Not when it was Ho Se's child.

104
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,310
So you gave birth in secret,

105
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,570
registered her as Chairman Min's daughter,

106
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,810
and raised her, pretending she was
your younger sister?

107
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Yes.

108
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,320
You're Se Ri's grandmother.

109
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,550
So how can you help Lucia
destroy Se Ri and me?

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,220
Who on earth is that woman, Lucia, to you?

111
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,960
What is she to you?
She's not even blood-related.

112
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,390
Don't say that.

113
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,200
Lucia and I share a bond
that's thicker than blood.

114
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,900
There's nothing in this world
thicker than blood.

115
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Mingang Distribution.

116
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,400
I planned to leave it to Se Ri someday,
but now it's in Lucia's hands.

117
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,410
So that dream is over now.

118
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,070
Do you know how she treats Se Ri at home?

119
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,140
She pretends to be a good stepmother
on the surface,

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,480
but she's gaslighting my Se Ri
and manipulating her.

121
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,580
And I'm sure you're the one
who put her up to it.

122
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,390
You must have ordered her to destroy...

123
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,090
me, Se Ri, and even Mingang.

124
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,360
Why on earth are you doing this?

125
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,060
Is it because I abandoned Ho Se?

126
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,930
Because I coldly turned my back on him
when he begged me to stay?

127
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,970
Still, this is going too far.

128
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,900
To your own flesh and blood!

129
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,270
It's your fault Ho Se ended up
the way he did!

130
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,940
I honestly had no idea.

131
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,810
I just thought he was living a good life
in the US.

132
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,710
I only found out when I received
the portrait you sent me.

133
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,680
I never imagined my father
would do something so horrible.

134
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,320
I...

135
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,890
can never forgive my father.

136
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,920
You've heard what I did to my father,
haven't you?

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,390
What's with her?

138
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,900
Is she being sincere?

139
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,500
You've made it over the first hurdle.

140
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,970
I'm not sure how long you'll be
the acting chairman,

141
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,180
but until your term is up,
hold your head high, whatever they say.

142
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,410
All right?

143
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,280
I will.

144
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,250
By the way, the team
is having a get-together tonight.

145
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,250
Do you want to join?

146
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,650
Everyone's been wanting to see you.

147
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,490
Are you sure it's okay if I tag along?

148
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,990
Of course. Why not?

149
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,960
You used to be on our team, right?

150
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,730
You may be the acting chairman now,
but you were once one of us.

151
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,000
I'd love to. Thanks for including me.

152
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,370
I've been wondering how everyone is doing.

153
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,480
In a situation like this,
what am I supposed to do, Tae Joo?

154
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,520
If she really is Ho Se's daughter,

155
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,420
then you can't take Lucia's side, Mother.

156
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,090
Of course I can't.

157
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,890
That would be like plunging a dagger
into my own granddaughter's heart.

158
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,930
Then you should meet with Lucia
and hear her side of the story.

159
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,670
Find out how she really feels about Se Ri,

160
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,970
and what she plans to do with her.

161
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Shall I?

162
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,410
Oh, my.

163
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,940
I wasn't expecting you.
What brings you here?

164
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,680
I was in the neighborhood,
and there's something I wanted to ask you.

165
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,250
Ask me?

166
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,120
Just a moment.

167
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,420
Hey, Se Ri.

168
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,360
I have a team get-together,
so I'll be late. What is it?

169
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,100
I'll be eating out. Don't wait for me.

170
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,470
Okay, see you later.

171
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,280
Was that Se Ri?

172
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,980
Yes. She asked to have dinner together
if I get off early.

173
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,610
Please have a seat.

174
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,950
It seems...

175
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,590
she relies on you
a lot more than I realized.

176
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,760
She'd better.
After all the effort I put into it.

177
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,400
Anyway, what was it you wanted to ask?

178
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,340
What are your true intentions?

179
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,640
Regarding Se Ri, I mean.

180
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,940
You asked me this before.

181
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,080
Don't worry. None of it's sincere.

182
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,850
Do you really think I could play mother
to the girl who caused my child's death?

183
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,350
Then...

184
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,890
are you going to make Se Ri pay later?
A child that young?

185
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,060
Is there an age limit on punishment?
If you commit a crime, you pay the price.

186
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,660
Eventually, I will bring Mi So's case
back into the spotlight,

187
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,770
and that's when I'll make sure
Se Ri is properly punished.

188
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,530
But she's more fragile than she appears.

189
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,670
Once she finds out Min Kyung Chae
is her birth mother,

190
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,310
loses the company,
and is punished on top of that,

191
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,580
it'll completely destroy her.

192
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,450
So be it.

193
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,820
Someone paid with their life,

194
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,380
so she should be prepared
for that, at least.

195
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,730
So, wait, you're the only one
who skipped the team dinner?

196
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,590
You think I'm in any mood to join them?

197
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,630
Why are you in a bad mood?
It's Kyung Chae who should be upset.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,100
Lucia totally outplayed her.

199
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,670
Kyung Chae won't let that get to her.
I'm the only one who feels awful.

200
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,580
After all, I just found out exactly
what my own sister thinks of me.

201
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,180
Kyung Chae is one thing,
but remember what happened before?

202
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,950
The way Manager Gong came at us.
Why is she involved in our family dispute?

203
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,950
Tell me about it.
You'd think she was Kyung Chae's mother.

204
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,990
I'm starving.

205
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
How come no one's called us for dinner?

206
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,100
Gosh, I'm starving.

207
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,940
Dinner is all set. Please come and eat.

208
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,040
We'll pass.

209
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,780
From now on, we'll take care of ourselves,
so you can just stay out of it.

210
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,650
Now that we know
what you really think of us,

211
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,050
we'd have no self-respect
if we ate food prepared by your hands.

212
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,820
I'm surprised you haven't damaged
your vocal cords.

213
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,690
From what I saw last time,
you're quite the screamer.

214
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,260
You've clearly got quite a temper.

215
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,160
That's because you two were ganging up
on Ms. Kyung Chae.

216
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,030
My goodness! So you're saying
you'd ride or die for Kyung Chae?

217
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,800
No, leave it. Let her take her side.
Even so, there are only two of them,

218
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,770
and there are three of us.
We have them outnumbered.

219
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,510
Let's go, honey. Gosh.

220
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,850
Good grief.

221
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,510
Yes?

222
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,520
Hey, Soo Jung, you should be on our side.

223
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,560
He's right, Soo Jung.
It's in your best interest to join us.

224
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,130
What is it this time?

225
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,860
When you said you were giving your shares
to that woman, Lucia,

226
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,860
didn't that mean you were done
with Kyung Chae for good?

227
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,800
That means you should be on our side.

228
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,740
We're basically
the Anti Min Kyung Chae Club.

229
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,700
What is this?
Are we picking teams for a brawl?

230
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,040
Right. You already had your little brawl,
didn't you?

231
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,680
Darn it.

232
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,050
Hey, you should've told me
you were coming.

233
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,720
I didn't know we'd be coming here.

234
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,220
Director Moon recommended it.

235
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,590
I didn't realize your sister worked here.

236
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,030
So you've been here before?

237
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,260
Yes, I came by once before...

238
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,700
and thought this would be the perfect spot
for a team dinner.

239
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,300
You came to the right place.
Since my sister's here today,

240
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,170
I'll throw in some extras on the house.
You're in for a treat.

241
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,640
- Excuse me.
- One second. I'll be right back.

242
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,380
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

243
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,450
Gosh, this place is so busy.

244
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,980
This would be a great place
to bring your family!

245
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,980
I had no idea there were
so many different black goat dishes.

246
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,220
Then let's order one of everything.
It's on me tonight.

247
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,520
Oh, no, you shouldn't.
This is our team dinner, so it's my treat.

248
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,430
You all work so hard and put up
with a lot of drama at the office.

249
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,800
Gosh, look at how packed this place is.
There's barely room to sit.

250
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Then we'll be sure to eat well
and recharge tonight.

251
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,710
Director Moon. They're famous
for strong black goat extract.

252
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,910
Everyone, grab a box of the pure extract
on your way out.

253
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,580
- That's on me too.
- Yes!

254
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,650
- Yes!
- Yes!

255
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Pass it here.

256
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,490
Goodness! This is so good.

257
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,030
I have to bring my parents here sometime.

258
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,730
You've all been working so hard.
Eat up and recharge your batteries.

259
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,470
Since everyone seems to love it,
let's have team dinners here more often.

260
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,210
Now that Lucia's over this hurdle,
she'll be the acting chairman for real.

261
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,180
What choice do I have?
I'll have to grit my teeth and bear it.

262
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,820
It's hard to say if we're better off
if the chairman wakes up or doesn't.

263
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,150
If Father remains in a coma,

264
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,060
that woman will become the chairman
after her acting position is over.

265
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Then again, even if the chairman wakes up,
he might give your spot to her anyway.

266
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,300
So you're saying Lucia
becomes the chairman, no matter what?

267
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,340
You'll have to get reinstated as CEO
while the chairman is still incapacitated,

268
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,170
convene the board, and pass a motion
to have her dismissed. It's the only way.

269
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,640
You think I don't know that?
But it's a long shot right now.

270
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,580
You saw it yourself.
I don't have the shares.

271
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,010
That's why I'm saying
we need to find a way.

272
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,620
Isn't there anyone who could help us
in a situation like this?

273
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,620
There is one person.

274
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,290
You haven't eaten all day.
You're going to make yourself sick.

275
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,930
Tae Joo, if Lucia and I became enemies,
whose side would you take?

276
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,930
I believe I've answered
that question before.

277
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,470
Is Lucia on your mind that much?

278
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
You already know.

279
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,700
You know how Lucia and I became allies.

280
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,510
Then why don't you have Min Kyung Chae
get a DNA test...

281
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,610
for you and Se Ri?

282
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,980
If you have the results in hand, at least
you'll have grounds to stand on later.

283
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,880
What kind of grandmother would stand by
and watch her own granddaughter get hurt?

284
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,990
A DNA test?

285
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,060
Yes.
Get a grandparentage verification test.

286
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,810
Yes, Madam Jang.

287
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,810
Listen to me very carefully.

288
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,480
I want you to prove
that Se Ri is my son, Ho Se's daughter...

289
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,520
with a paternity test.

290
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,420
After I see the results,

291
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,520
I'll decide whether or not
I'm going to take your side.

292
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,890
Do you really mean that?

293
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,990
I'm sending someone over to you.

294
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,630
They'll have a collection kit with them,
so use that for the test.

295
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,660
Yes, Madam Jang. I will.

296
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,270
I have to go now.

297
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,540
Let me excuse myself.

298
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,410
What's the first thing you want to do
as acting chairman?

299
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,510
I told you before.

300
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,250
That I would find your parents' contract.

301
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,190
Oh, come on. That's impossible.

302
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,420
We can't just force open a locked drawer.

303
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,090
Why not? We'll just open it.

304
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,230
We can check it and then
just put everything back the way it was.

305
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
No, you can't do that.

306
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,700
And there's no guarantee
Chairman Min Doo Sik won't wake up.

307
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,840
When he does, he'll check there first.
So who do you think he'll suspect?

308
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,380
Are you worried about me again?

309
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,740
But I'm more worried about you.

310
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,680
If Chairman Min wakes up, even tomorrow,

311
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,880
he won't spare you, knowing who you are.

312
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,620
You know exactly how terrifying he can be.

313
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,520
I can't bear to see
anything happen to you.

314
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,630
What are you smiling about?

315
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,430
It's nothing.

316
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,400
I just feel so supported.

317
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,430
Just knowing there's someone
who cares about me this much...

318
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,170
makes me smile.

319
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,580
You should get going now.

320
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,780
I'll walk the rest of the way on my own.

321
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,780
We can't risk being seen together
by someone we know.

322
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,250
All right, then.

323
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Get home safe.

324
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,400
This is from Madam Jang.

325
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,440
This should be more than enough
for the test.

326
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,050
Please let her know I'll come see her
as soon as the results are in.

327
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,910
I will.

328
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,320
If you run into any problems
with the test,

329
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,720
please contact her directly.

330
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,130
Tae Joo? What's he doing here?

331
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,370
If the DNA test is a match,

332
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,470
she said she'd consider it.

333
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,450
If Chairman Min wakes up, even tomorrow,

334
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,190
he won't spare you, knowing who you are.

335
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
She's right.

336
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,630
He won't spare me
if he finds out who I am.

337
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,600
But on the off chance...

338
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,630
my father's contract really is
in that desk drawer...

339
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,070
Excuse me.

340
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,340
What?

341
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,240
What are you so deep in thought about?

342
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,270
It's nothing, sir.

343
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,340
But what brings you here at this hour?

344
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,310
Remember? I said I'd sell
my Mingang stake after our talk.

345
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,880
That's a very wise decision.

346
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,020
Actually, this is highly confidential,

347
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,920
but Chairman Min Doo Sik
is in the hospital, unconscious.

348
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,220
What? What happened?

349
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,290
How did that happen?

350
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,190
But Ja Kyung didn't say a word to me.

351
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,400
It all happened so suddenly,

352
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,470
and we're concerned the stock price
will plummet if word gets out.

353
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,970
Goodness. You mean
he's not going to make it?

354
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,940
Thankfully, his doctor said there is hope,
and that we should just wait and see.

355
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,850
I see.
So that's why you gave me the tip to sell.

356
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,980
Thank you.
Who else would give me a tip like this?

357
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,320
I would've been completely blindsided.

358
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,890
I'm not one to just say "thanks"
and leave it at that.

359
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,490
I pay in cold, hard cash.

360
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,090
Thanks again.

361
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,200
Is it not enough? Here. It's 50 dollars.

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Gosh.

363
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,000
Sir, this is five dollars.

364
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,470
The colors are similar, aren't they?

365
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,440
Besides, the man on this bill is
the son of the lady on the 50-dollar bill.

366
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,610
They're from the same family.
So it's practically the same thing.

367
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,910
What were you doing in that room again?

368
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,050
Just drop it.
I'm in no mood for your nonsense tonight.

369
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,820
- I'm just feeling a bit off.
- Oh, are you now?

370
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,320
What's that supposed to mean?

371
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,090
Why is the great Oh Pan Sool
feeling so out of sorts?

372
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,330
Did your secret crush
finally hit the jackpot?

373
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,400
I'm biting my tongue to keep from
cursing you out. You hear me?

374
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,970
Our daughter's father-in-law was rushed
to the hospital. He's unconscious.

375
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Our in-law?

376
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,070
What happened?

377
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,340
How should I know?
You know as much as I do.

378
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,410
You'd better keep your mouth shut.
If this gets out, the company is ruined,

379
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,680
and the stock will tank.

380
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,650
But why haven't we heard
from Ji Seop and Ja Kyung?

381
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,820
They must be frantic right now, you know?

382
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,750
Anyway, you just never know
what life has in store.

383
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,290
That's why they say,
"Easy come, loudly go."

384
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,730
It's not "Easy come, loudly go."
It's "Come empty-handed, go empty-handed."

385
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,900
It's close enough, right?
"Easy come, loudly go."

386
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,560
It's all meaningless anyway.
Life is fleeting.

387
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,500
So don't say a word about what I do
with the Mingang stock.

388
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,010
It's all meaningless. Life is fleeting.

389
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,010
Mountain is mountain, and water is water.

390
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,910
Mountains are mountains,
and water is water.

391
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,150
And stock is stock.

392
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,480
Mountains are mountains, water is...

393
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,890
Wait, what is he even talking about?

394
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,990
Hey! What was that about the stocks?
Oh Pan Sool!

395
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,400
You said this was for
a grandparentage verification test, right?

396
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,900
Yes. How long will it take?

397
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,400
The results will be available tomorrow.

398
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,440
Where have you been?

399
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,280
I just had something to take care of.

400
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,550
By the way, Manager Gong.

401
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,050
A delivery is coming tomorrow.
Could you please get it for me?

402
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,890
Are you going somewhere?

403
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,460
Just in case.

404
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,360
It might arrive when I'm not here.

405
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,160
Is it something important?

406
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,730
Yes. Please get it
and keep it safe in my room.

407
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,770
Manager Gong, did you clean my room?

408
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,670
I can't seem to find my hairbrush.

409
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,210
Your hairbrush?

410
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,880
No. Why would I have touched it?

411
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,610
My toothbrush is missing too.

412
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,020
It must be around somewhere. Look again.

413
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,290
Just buy new ones.

414
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,690
- Want me to buy you some?
- No, it's fine. I have extras.

415
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,960
By the way, I went to see Dad.

416
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,430
When?

417
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,200
They let you see him?

418
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,300
Our stepmother said I could visit anytime.
Day or night, whenever I miss Dad.

419
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,770
Really?

420
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,100
Then take me with you.

421
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,870
I want to see how he is too.

422
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,450
They say he can still hear us
even though he's unconscious.

423
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,480
If there's anything you want
to say to him, you should.

424
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,120
I have nothing to say.

425
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,350
I just wanted to see for myself.

426
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,720
Let's go.

427
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,770
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

428
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,000
You should go home first.
I'm going to stay a little longer.

429
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,070
There's something I need
to say to him too.

430
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,040
- I can wait for you. Go ahead.
- No, don't.

431
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,740
It's something private, just between us.

432
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,180
You should head home first.

433
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,710
Oh, right.

434
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,350
Keep this a secret
from our stepmother, okay?

435
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,850
She won't be happy if she finds out
I tagged along with you.

436
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,190
You know she's forbidden anyone but you
from seeing our father, right?

437
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,230
I asked the nurse to keep it quiet,
so we should be fine.

438
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,700
Okay, thanks.

439
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,560
Go on, get going.

440
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,180
You're not actually conscious
right now, are you?

441
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,180
If this is another test for your children
like last time, just stop.

442
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,580
We can see right through you, Father.

443
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,530
It's me.

444
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,800
I'm in my father's hospital room.

445
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,600
My father is showing a subtle reaction.
What should I do?

446
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Is that right?

447
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,510
Then that means he isn't
completely unconscious.

448
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,580
If you can, stay there and keep an eye
on him for a bit longer.

449
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,310
I think I'd better.

450
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,010
If he suddenly wakes up,
it'll make things a lot more complicated.

451
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,650
No doubt about that.

452
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,790
Who's with him when he wakes up
will affect the inheritance division.

453
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,460
And more importantly, if the chairman
were to suddenly regain consciousness,

454
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,430
we'd have to come up with a new plan.

455
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,960
That's what I was thinking too.

456
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,730
Speaking of which,

457
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,600
a courier is dropping something off
at my house tomorrow morning.

458
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,800
I need you to pick it up for me
and deliver it to Madam Jang.

459
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,300
To Madam Jang?

460
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
(Express Delivery)

461
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,820
Excuse me.

462
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
I'll take that.

463
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,490
I was asked to accept this
on behalf of Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

464
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,400
- Are you sure?
- If you don't believe me,

465
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,630
call to confirm.

466
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,170
Okay.

467
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,230
(Client 1, Min Se Ri,
and Client 2, Stella Jang,)

468
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,960
(do not have
a grandparent–grandchild relationship.)

469
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,140
No way.

470
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,780
The grandparent-grandchild relationship.
That's between Madam Jang and Min Se Ri.

471
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,780
And it's not a match?

472
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,780
Then that means Jung Ho Se
isn't Min Se Ri's biological father.

473
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,820
Min Kyung Chae, you...

474
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,730
There was someone else besides Jung Ho Se?

475
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,360
Unbelievable.

476
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,050
Lawyer Kim, what brings you here?

477
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,550
I'm here on an errand.

478
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,620
Kyung Chae had something urgent come up,

479
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,480
so she asked me to deliver this for her.

480
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,100
(Client 1, Min Se Ri,
and Client 2, Stella Jang,)

481
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,470
(do not have
a grandparent–grandchild relationship.)

482
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,490
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

483
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,870
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
