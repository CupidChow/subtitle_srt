1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,310
The chairman called
without going through his secretary,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,810
as if he were out of the office.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,780
Without saying anything else,
he asked for an employee's number.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,950
Is that so? Whose was it?

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,820
Jung Lucia's.
She's on the Online Business Team.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,090
- Who?
- Jung Lucia.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,130
Did the chairman call you?

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
No.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,700
Then you don't know where he is?

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,940
I don't.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,110
How would I know
what the family doesn't know?

12
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,280
I didn't say the family doesn't know.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,390
You asked if he called me
and if I knew where he was.

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,660
I assumed you didn't know either.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,390
Is that so?

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,860
Why are you asking me about him?

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,690
Isn't he at the hospital?

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,360
He left Daemyung Hospital.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,870
In secret.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,500
We don't know where he is.

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,370
You seem very surprised.

22
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,970
You really had no idea?

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,340
He had brain surgery and must rest.

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,580
If you get a call from him
or find out where he is,

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,620
do tell me.

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,090
Why would the chairman call me?

27
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,960
And he wouldn't tell me where he is
if he didn't alert any of you.

28
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,560
Just in case, though.

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,000
Be sure to tell me if you hear anything.

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,500
You can go.

31
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,170
(Mingang Distribution)

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,050
Director!

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,990
What's the matter?

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,220
Do you know what I just heard?

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,490
Miyeon and Woojin,
companies that worked with us for...

36
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,730
How many years has it been?

37
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,860
What did those companies do?

38
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,270
Get to the point.

39
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,300
They stabbed us in the back
and signed a partnership deal...

40
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,370
with Judo and Hangeon!

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,070
How could they do that when their deals
with us haven't yet expired...

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,510
Did they sign a dual agreement?

43
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,380
Yes, they did.

44
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,080
They were offered a much better deal.

45
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,420
I thought Judo and Hangeon
were doing well.

46
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,620
They used money to steal our partners.

47
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,690
That's unbelievable.
How could they poach our partners?

48
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,860
They should know better.

49
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,330
I don't know where you got that news,
but we haven't been notified yet,

50
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,060
and rumors like that
are common in our field.

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,100
Don't get too worked up
and focus on your tasks.

52
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,040
Let's get back to work.
Our director will handle it.

53
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,880
And be sure not to spread any gossip.

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,480
I think it would be best
if the vice director weren't informed.

55
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

56
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,150
He's here.

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,660
What's with the atmosphere?
Is something wrong?

58
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,060
Were you talking about me?

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,900
Are you sure you'll be okay?

60
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,170
If there is a dual agreement,
then they're in the wrong.

61
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,440
We can hold them responsible
for breach of contract...

62
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,810
and demand compensation.

63
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,780
That's the legal process.

64
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,120
We lost close partner companies
to competitors.

65
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,550
Mingang will hold you responsible.

66
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,590
I will take responsibility
if I did anything wrong,

67
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,590
but I won't have to.

68
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,990
I did nothing wrong.

69
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,070
I've been through enough to know
sometimes you're made to be guilty,

70
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,870
and the innocent becomes the aggressor.

71
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,670
It's all fine as long as
I know I'm honorable.

72
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,240
They're experienced
at making someone look guilty.

73
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,380
They'll hold you responsible
and penalize you...

74
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,780
for not handling our partners properly.

75
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,020
"They're experienced
at making someone look guilty?"

76
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,150
Are you talking about the Min family?

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,960
Well, I just...

78
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,260
I agree with you.

79
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,230
That's why
I'm even less interested in giving in.

80
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,400
How emboldened would that make them?

81
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,670
I'm grateful for your concern for me,

82
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,240
but I'm more worried about you.

83
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,980
Why won't Lawyer Kim just leave you alone?

84
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,110
Goodness...

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,820
I won't give in either.

86
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,090
How emboldened would that make him?

87
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,590
He already seems to think he's special.

88
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,060
I can't stand that.

89
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,600
What?

90
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,540
What are you thinking about?

91
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,080
You should take just half your pay
if you have a conscience.

92
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,780
When do you get any work done?

93
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,950
A conscience?

94
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,980
I got rid of that long ago.

95
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,480
What's the plan?

96
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,750
You won't do anything
when Father is missing?

97
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,660
What should we do, then?
Hire a private investigator?

98
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,560
No. But you know what he's like.
He doesn't trust us enough...

99
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,630
to stay away from work for this long.

100
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
He'd have come in long ago...

101
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,400
even if he'd had
something worse than surgery.

102
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,930
He'd rather die at work than at home.

103
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes. He said
he wanted to die in his office.

104
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,870
Mingang is Min Doo Sik,
and Min Doo Sik is Mingang.

105
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,410
When he refuses to show up,
not caring what happens to Mingang,

106
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,710
it means what happened to him
shocked him badly.

107
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,680
Who knows?

108
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,550
He might appear a few days from now
and announce he'll step down.

109
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,860
I'm saying we need to be prepared
for such situations.

110
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,360
What was that smirk about?

111
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,600
I can't believe you're right for once.

112
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,670
Darn you.

113
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,940
Even a broken clock
tells the correct time twice a day.

114
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,770
Don't try to scare me. I know I'm fine.

115
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,810
You be the doctor, then.

116
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,880
You should step down and relax.

117
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,880
The company doesn't function without me.

118
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,320
It does.

119
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Your smart kids are running it just fine.

120
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,260
So what if they're smart?
They don't respect their father.

121
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,360
- What do they take you for?
- A pushover.

122
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,700
They only care about fighting over
what they'll get when I die.

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
Shall I lend you my phone?

124
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,500
If there's someone
you'd like to see, call them.

125
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,570
I got one of the nurses here
to get me a new phone.

126
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,510
There's not much to life, sir.

127
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,780
Spending time and loving people
you connect with. That's happiness.

128
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,020
It's time for you to be happy.

129
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,920
I'll do just that.

130
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,420
What? You have someone in mind?

131
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,390
You have feelings for someone?

132
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,400
- Hello?
- Save this number.

133
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,150
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

134
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,350
How do you feel?

135
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,050
Do you even care?

136
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,090
I do. I wonder and I'm concerned too.

137
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,860
Then see for yourself.

138
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,060
It's quickest if you were to visit.

139
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,100
I'm not free today.

140
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,030
And you say you care?

141
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,900
Why aren't you free?

142
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,540
I have things to do.

143
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,810
Push that back and come see me...

144
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,240
if your life isn't at stake.

145
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,240
I need to see you.

146
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,380
Okay. I'll come and see you later.

147
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,490
Manager Gong.

148
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,290
Yes, Ms. Ja Kyung.

149
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,130
How about
we have something special for dinner?

150
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,030
We can ask the good cook to come over.

151
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,470
I don't have an appetite.

152
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,000
That wouldn't be ideal.

153
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,040
Eating something special
when the chairman isn't home...

154
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,710
Who cares?

155
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,540
Should we starve
just because Father is away?

156
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,920
To be honest, he's the one staying away
because he can't stand us.

157
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,090
Aren't you worried at all?

158
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,050
I would worry
if worrying would make him come back.

159
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,320
Where is Se Ri?

160
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,390
She went out to see someone.

161
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,830
See?

162
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,470
His own kids go out to see people
and do what they want.

163
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,900
You're the only one making a fuss.

164
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,770
Goodness.

165
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,070
We haven't met in a while,
and I missed you so much.

166
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,940
I even had a dream about you.

167
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,710
My father left home.

168
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,220
My word. You said
he'd had surgery after passing out.

169
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,690
He left after the surgery.

170
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,990
He ran away from home?
The old man is not acting his age.

171
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,860
Do you remember my dad when he was young?

172
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,200
Of course I remember.

173
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,770
I remember a lot.

174
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,610
It was like...

175
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,080
He looked rich and exquisite
from head to toe.

176
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,780
He's not at all like that.

177
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,620
Does that matter right now?

178
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,750
Are you watching your company shares?

179
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,660
My eldest sister told me
to give them to her when she asked later.

180
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,830
What did I tell you?

181
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,260
I knew something like this would happen.

182
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,270
You need to stay alert, Se Ri.

183
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,670
No, forget that.
Why don't you leave the shares with me?

184
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,810
I'll keep them safe for you,

185
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,410
and give them right back
when you get married.

186
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,810
She's in big trouble.

187
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,350
What if she hands them over?

188
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,220
Her family doesn't seem to
care at all about her.

189
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,820
Rich families only stick together
when they feel threatened.

190
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
What shall I do?

191
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,830
Shall I bring it to an end
or let things play out?

192
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,690
Let it play out for now.

193
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,170
Get rid of the fake mom
and her male sidekick at once later on.

194
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,770
Leave them alone for the time being.

195
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,510
Do you think Lucia
can actually handle the girl?

196
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,210
There's nothing
a mom who lost a child can't do.

197
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,080
She's the kid
who assaulted Lucia's daughter.

198
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,680
How can she think of
pretending to be her mom?

199
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,780
That's what revenge is like.

200
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,790
The pain of swallowing the sun.

201
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,520
It's impossible without that.

202
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,900
Goodness.
You're really hard to get to see.

203
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,500
Now you show up?

204
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,440
I came straight from work.

205
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,070
Mingang keeps employees that late?

206
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,780
I should tell them to change the rules.

207
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,680
The traffic was crazy.

208
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,650
I managed to get through it, though.

209
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,420
I told you to visit once a day.
Why won't you?

210
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,120
I can't do that. I have a job.

211
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,020
This is part of it.
You're checking on your chairman.

212
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,760
What could be more important?

213
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,760
Why won't you call your family?

214
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,300
They'll be worried.

215
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,130
They're worried? What about?

216
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,000
That I'll live much longer
and won't step aside soon enough?

217
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,340
You don't have children,
so you don't know.

218
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,410
You need to rest and recover at home
since you had surgery.

219
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,080
This place is even better than a hotel.
I can do what I want.

220
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,580
Did Kyung Chae say something?

221
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,090
She asked if I'd heard from you.

222
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,990
You should've denied it.

223
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
You didn't tell her the truth, did you?

224
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,660
You told me not to.

225
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,700
You obeyed me on that?

226
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,030
Then visit me once a day as well.

227
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,870
I'll see.

228
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,070
There's nothing to see.

229
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,370
You won't answer?

230
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,180
Okay.

231
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,310
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

232
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,050
This place serves the VIPs
five-star hotel-quality food.

233
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,890
Even so.

234
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,520
I'm not sure.

235
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,160
Why? What will you cook for me?

236
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,990
It's a secret.

237
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,900
Goodness.

238
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,430
What will you make him?

239
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,800
I read a financial paper interview...

240
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,540
where he said he liked rice balls
and rice wine bread.

241
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,140
He has enough money to burn in a bonfire,

242
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,980
and he likes such cheap foods?

243
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,980
I guess that was what he survived on
when he was young...

244
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,220
and had no time to eat
from expanding Mingang Distribution.

245
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,950
So you're going to use
his old memories to get to him?

246
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,960
You don't just taste with your tongue.
You feel it with your mind too.

247
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,630
He'll like it if I make him feel
something from the past.

248
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,770
(Mingang Distribution)

249
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,350
You're here early.

250
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,850
You don't like our cafeteria food?

251
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,590
It's not for me. It's for someone else.

252
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,330
Is it?

253
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,650
- Hello.
- I decided to call early today...

254
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,420
to see if you're having a good morning.

255
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,090
It is a good morning.

256
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,930
Come by as soon as you get off work.

257
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,060
I'll wait with an empty stomach.

258
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,200
I can't wait to see what you'll bring.

259
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,140
You'll see later.

260
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,510
Okay. See you soon.

261
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,780
You said the chairman never called
and that you didn't know where he was.

262
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,050
Yes.

263
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,450
I'll ask you again.

264
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,360
You really don't know?

265
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,830
How would I know
what the family doesn't know?

266
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,650
Tell Kim Sun Jae from Legal
to come see me.

267
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,230
What's the matter?

268
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,590
Follow Lucia after work today.

269
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,230
Why should I?

270
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,830
HR told me...

271
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,470
that the chairman asked for her number.

272
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,900
Did he?

273
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,640
Why are you so angry?

274
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,440
She lied to my face.

275
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,410
I asked multiple times.

276
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,510
She said she didn't know anything.

277
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,510
Lucia, you mean?

278
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,980
I think I know why you feel bothered.

279
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,090
She keeps threatening to cross the line.

280
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,590
I won't have to worry
about side dishes for a while.

281
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,160
You freed me, you know.

282
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,400
I'd have worn my joints down
cooking for my husband by now.

283
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,400
You can call me at any time.

284
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,740
How is my Ja Kyung doing?

285
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,210
She's doing well.

286
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,340
Have you heard
that the chairman had surgery?

287
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,910
How did that feisty man
end up getting surgery?

288
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,450
Cash... Money...

289
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,090
Honey. Darling. Sweetie.

290
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,160
The chairman passed out.

291
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,060
He had emergency surgery. Things were bad.

292
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,560
What? How? Why? What happened?

293
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,530
This young lady told me.

294
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,100
I think I told you something
I shouldn't have.

295
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,340
I should get going.

296
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,510
Okay. Bye.

297
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,980
He thought only of how to
make more money and lost his mind.

298
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,540
I hate money.

299
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,380
Did I just hear
a leech explode while mating?

300
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,750
What did money do to you?

301
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,420
Put yourself in their shoes.
How upset would they be?

302
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,720
Nothing is as honest and pure as money.

303
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,960
Study history.
It's always the man at fault.

304
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,820
Money never did anything wrong.

305
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,790
Oh, Bulgwang-dong's Mandarin Fish called.

306
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,730
The tenant will pay whatever we ask.
Shall we sign the contract or not?

307
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,200
Why not?

308
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,830
I'll let anyone stay
if they'll pay double the rent.

309
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,970
Who is it?

310
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,710
I wish it were a young man.

311
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,670
There's a young man right before you.

312
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,540
My physical age is still 27.

313
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,420
I'm right here. I'm a young boy.

314
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,450
You're a young boy?

315
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,230
Hello, CEO Jo.

316
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,990
I just got a call.

317
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,430
Oh Pan Sool will let you move in.

318
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,670
That's great. I owe you.

319
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,600
I'll buy you a meal one day.

320
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,540
Sure, goodbye. Take care.

321
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,610
Do you have good news?

322
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,050
You could say so.

323
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,150
I'm just getting started.

324
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,050
Then you're halfway there.
Well begun is half done.

325
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,050
Yes.

326
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,890
I'm off to the CEO's office.

327
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,330
How is Lucia to work with?

328
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,100
What do you think?

329
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,370
Don't you know
more about what she can do than I do?

330
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,510
She's your special hire.

331
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,740
You work more closely with her.

332
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,140
I wonder if you saw something I didn't.

333
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,980
What do you want to hear?

334
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,080
Your honest truth.

335
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,790
Then work with her yourself.

336
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,890
That's quicker and most efficient.

337
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,590
People asked what I got...

338
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,960
from scouting you...

339
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,830
and keeping you as the head
of a department for four years.

340
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,240
The trend is to take risks
to implement aggressive strategies,

341
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,940
and they asked why you didn't do that.

342
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,940
Sales, performance.

343
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,010
Is that the topic?

344
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,510
No.

345
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,810
I'm saying I now agree
with your management style.

346
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,880
What do you mean by that?

347
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,420
Judo and Hangeon.

348
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,750
They're trying to keep it quiet,

349
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,160
but they're unable to pay
their suppliers on time, and it's serious.

350
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,430
They're also lying about how much
they sell on home shopping networks.

351
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,900
Marketly went bankrupt after failing
to cover the largest amount in history,

352
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,870
and experts are saying
Judo and Hangeon will follow suit.

353
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,670
How do you know that?

354
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,970
You think I got to be CEO
without my sources?

355
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,310
Soon, everyone will see
that I wasn't wrong about you.

356
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,150
How about we eat out together?

357
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,450
Instead of a meal, how about a drink?

358
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,220
I'm fine with that too.

359
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,760
So,

360
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,930
what brought you to the CEO's office?

361
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,100
Do I need your permission
to see the CEO now?

362
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,390
Why was Director Moon here?

363
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,030
If you need help from Legal...

364
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,230
It's nothing.

365
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,230
And I don't need your help at all.

366
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,710
Shouldn't you come by my team
before you see the CEO?

367
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,780
What kind of logic is that?

368
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,020
I had a report to give her
that didn't involve Legal.

369
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,980
Your team doesn't have any business...

370
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,120
that doesn't involve Legal.

371
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,020
If you keep belittling my team...

372
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,460
I don't belittle you. You belittle me.

373
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,990
How little do you think of us...

374
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,130
that you say I must talk to you
before seeing the CEO?

375
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,860
That's because
it's a business requirement.

376
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,670
You have pending contract renewals.

377
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,100
That's a pretty pathetic excuse.

378
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,900
If you're upset with the CEO,
take it up with her.

379
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,210
Why would you take it out on me?

380
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,780
That darn punk.

Chairman Min.

384
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,410
Hi.

385
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,780
Why are you out here?

386
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,450
I was waiting for you.

387
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,420
I told you not to.
Now I feel uncomfortable.

388
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,060
There's no need to be.

389
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,490
I'd just seen my doctor.

390
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,960
Let's go to your suite.

391
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,030
Was the traffic not as bad today?

392
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,030
I left a bit early.

393
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,040
Min Doo Sik?

394
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,910
What's that?

395
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,880
What did I just see?

396
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,520
What did you make?

397
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,160
What's all this?

398
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,090
You...

399
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,900
What some might consider simple fare...

400
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,500
could be a feast to someone else.

401
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,800
They say food isn't just about
what you see and taste.

402
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,610
What memory they invoke is more important.

403
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,480
How did you know about this?

404
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,810
You won't believe me
if I say it was a coincidence, will you?

405
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,450
Why I made this
out of the thousands of possibilities.

406
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,690
I'll come clean, then.

407
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,060
I read one of your interviews.

408
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,660
I don't know if it's something...

409
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,030
you want to forget
or remember from time to time,

410
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,200
but there was a time...

411
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,740
when you worked so hard,
you barely had time to eat.

412
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,310
That's how you made Mingang
what it is now.

413
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,040
I respected you for remembering
the rice balls and rice wine bread...

414
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,110
that could've meant nothing.

415
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,490
Sip some broth first.
Your mouth will be too dry.

416
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,450
Do you like the food?

417
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,020
Lucia. No, Baek Sul Hee.

418
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,860
How close are you to the chairman?

419
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,170
Why did you come back?

420
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,840
Wait.

421
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Was the girl's name Mi So?

422
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,380
There's no way to prove she's Sul Hee.

00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,960
Take a seat.

425
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,700
Did you follow Lucia?

426
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,170
Yes.

427
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,530
Where did she go?

428
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,870
To Hankuk Hospital's VIP suite.

429
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,270
Hankuk Hospital's VIP suite?

430
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,110
Then...

431
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,840
That's where the chairman is.

432
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,510
I knew it.

433
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,580
I had a feeling she knew.

434
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,320
Are you saying Lucia
moved Father to that hospital?

435
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,750
She didn't, and she has no reason to.

436
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,220
From what I found out, the chairman...

437
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,890
called her over there.

438
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,230
Father called her?

439
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,900
Because she saved his life?

440
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,040
But then,

441
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,200
he takes things like that seriously.

442
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,070
How much praise will he heap on her?

443
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,910
It didn't look like that either.

444
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,580
What do you mean?

445
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,080
The feelings the chairman has for her...

446
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,080
seem to go beyond
what he'd feel for his lifesaver.

447
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,690
Why else would he
meet up with her in secret?

448
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,660
The two...

449
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,530
seem pretty close already.

450
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,860
What?

451
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,830
You call too often. I can't concentrate.

452
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,700
It doesn't matter. Who will fire you?

453
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,640
That's not what I mean.
I'll be a nuisance to my team.

454
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,010
Who cares? What can they say
when the chairman says you're not?

455
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,780
You know you're being silly, right?

456
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,380
I don't like having to sneak out
during work hours to take calls.

457
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,090
I'll see you after work. Get some rest.

458
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,630
That was the chairman, wasn't it?

459
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,670
I don't think I have to answer that.

460
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,270
It's not common sense
to demand to know who people talk to.

461
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,080
I'd accept that if it were anyone else,

462
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,410
but not if you were talking to my father.

463
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,950
There's no difference.

464
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,120
The chairman isn't underage.

465
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,990
He's free to go where he pleases...

466
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,350
and talk to who he wants.

467
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,160
You duped me by lying to me twice.

468
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,160
In my office, and then in the elevator.

469
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,360
You vixen. You said...

470
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,370
you didn't know where Father was
and that he didn't call you.

471
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,070
Watch what you say.

472
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,870
Don't call me a vixen...

473
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,440
when I only did as the chairman asked.

474
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,980
Why do you think he decided to stay
in the hospital instead of going home?

475
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,550
Why do you think he decided
not to call any of his children?

476
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,680
Why do you think...

477
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,820
he bares his heart to me
when I'm not even family?

478
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,890
He comes to me for solace.

479
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,990
You should look back on yourself
to see if you were a good daughter.

480
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,330
How dare you chew me out?

481
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,090
What?

482
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,000
If you want to berate someone,

483
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
figure out the circumstances
and see why they did what they did.

484
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,440
First, try to see if they had
a good enough reason.

485
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,170
Are you lecturing me?

486
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,610
I didn't mean to lecture you,

487
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,180
but I'm glad you've learned something.

491
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,450
That's why I told you
to talk to Stella Jang.

492
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,320
What do you think is her plan?

493
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,990
It looks like Se Ri
will cause some huge trouble soon.

494
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,350
I need her to, so I can clean it up.

495
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,760
Will cleaning it up be enough?

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,060
