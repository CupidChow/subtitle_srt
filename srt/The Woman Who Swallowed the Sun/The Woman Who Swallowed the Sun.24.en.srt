00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,040
(Episode 24)

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,710
You're Baek Sul Hee, aren't you?

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,720
She's the only one
who knows I was left-handed.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,620
I didn't think clearly last time.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,450
You can erase a burn scar
easily with surgery,

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,290
but you can't do that with memories.
Memories can't be faked.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,230
Did I hit the nail on the head?

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,260
Do you know what happened
after you got away four years ago?

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,400
Min Kyung Chae treated me like dirt.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,900
I worked so hard to earn her trust,
and I lost it in an instant!

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,910
Where were you hiding until now?

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,610
What are you after?
Why did you come back?

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,680
Why return to where your daughter died?

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,450
Will you get revenge?

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,980
Answer me!

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,720
Why should I
put up with this kind of nonsense?

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,090
Baek Sul Hee?

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,190
I don't know who that is,
but you just messed up.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,400
Your daughter!

20
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,230
You brought about her death.

21
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,770
She wouldn't have died if you'd
remembered your place and kept quiet.

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,700
You must've done
a lot of terrible things...

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
that made people want to get back at you.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,100
Do you know...

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,410
what I think you look like?

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,280
A scared mongrel.

27
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,450
A scared dog barks the loudest.

28
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,850
What did you say?

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,060
That was self-defense. You started it.

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,990
You brought me here without my consent...

31
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,830
and scared me with random comments.

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,290
I felt threatened.

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,600
Your dashcam will have filmed everything,

34
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,930
and there are many other cars.

35
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,100
Shall we fight about that now?

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,240
Who's at fault?

37
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,240
You know the law.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,080
I put your utensils on the wrong side,

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,410
and you thought that meant
I was someone else?

40
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,250
Baek Sul Hee?

41
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,220
Listen up, Kim Sun Jae.

42
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,160
I don't know what happened,

43
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,830
but don't go around threatening others.

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,530
I was Jung Lucia my whole life,

45
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,630
and I can't believe what just happened.

46
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,810
He's more astute than I thought.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,750
But I guess that's how he rose to head...

48
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,950
Mingang's Legal Team.

49
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,790
I forgot. I should've been more careful.

50
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,660
He's right. Memories remain.

51
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,060
They can't be erased or cut out.

52
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,500
Once he catches on, he never lets go.

53
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,170
He won't mention it
in public again, though.

54
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,940
Not after you reacted so strongly.

55
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,490
Your daughter!

56
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,820
You brought about her death.

57
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,260
She wouldn't have died if you'd
remembered your place and kept quiet.

58
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,170
She wouldn't have
reacted like that if it weren't her.

59
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,310
Baek Sul Hee.

60
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,810
I don't know why you came back,

61
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,250
but you won't get your way.

62
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,950
(Mingang Distribution)

63
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,790
Hello.

64
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,970
Why don't you ask about Jogeon Logistics?

65
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,170
I won't ask.

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,270
I'm sure you did your job.

67
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,670
Why? Are you disappointed in me?

68
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,180
Me, disappointed? I was, at first.

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,610
But soon after, I realized I was wrong.

70
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,620
Once I trust someone,
I shouldn't feel let down.

71
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,790
I should trust them to the end.

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,460
Do you know me well enough
to trust me to the end?

73
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,100
You don't need to know someone
to trust them.

74
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,830
What if I go too far and can't turn back?

75
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,770
You won't do that.

76
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,810
Swallowing up a small company...

77
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,540
like Jogeon Logistics under the guise...

78
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,510
of a legal merger, that's just...

79
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,350
Some things are just wrong.

80
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,180
If that company were to disappear,
everyone who works there...

81
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,790
would be unable to protect
the people they want to.

82
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,560
I'm sure you know...

83
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,960
exactly how it feels
to be unable to protect...

84
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,360
someone you love.

85
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,370
Going up.

86
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,140
You're not getting in?

87
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,980
The doors are closing.

88
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,870
- Hello.
- Good morning.

89
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,750
Ms. Jung...

90
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,580
is working on the CEO's special project,

91
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,950
so she won't work with us for now.

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,150
Until she accomplishes what she must
and returns to her normal duties,

93
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,620
I'd like you three to share her workload.

94
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,490
- Okay.
- Sure. No problem.

95
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Ms. Lucia.

96
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,400
The chairman wants to see us.
Come with me.

97
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,780
Oh, right.

98
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,450
About last night.

99
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,790
That was my bad.

100
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,860
You look a lot like someone I know.

101
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,390
I'm glad to know you realized I'm not her.

102
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,400
Let's not make the chairman wait too long.

103
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,980
I was told you two
are in charge of the merger.

104
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,110
Yes. There are no legal problems.

105
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,480
There won't be. This is your specialty.

106
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
You know what you're doing.

107
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,120
I'm worried about the aftermath.

108
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,220
Mergers and acquisitions are common
in business,

109
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,660
but companies often get criticized
for them.

110
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't worry, sir.
We're working on it so that won't happen.

111
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,330
If you know you'll be criticized for it,
you shouldn't do it at all.

112
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,870
If you still must do it,
you must accept the consequences.

113
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,940
You're excused, Kim.

114
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,790
You have a grudge against me.

115
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,630
Is it because I suspected you?

116
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,330
No. I'm not in the position
to dare hold a grudge about that.

117
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,740
You pretend not to be,
but you're still angry.

118
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,300
I don't trust anyone
until I know them completely.

119
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,380
Do you know me well enough
to trust me to the end?

120
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,950
You don't need to know someone
to trust them.

121
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,920
You don't need to know someone
to trust them.

122
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,630
We met due to a mistake on my part,
but I believed it was meant to be.

123
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,500
And I got upset when that
fizzled out to become nothing.

124
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,860
There's nothing else to it.

125
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
You'll understand when you're my age...

126
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,440
that you can't trust just anyone.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,210
Especially a woman who approaches
as if it were a coincidence.

128
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,140
You haven't changed.

129
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,010
You still describe me in that manner.

130
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,950
I understand no amount of explaining
will get through to you.

131
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,520
I'm only upsetting myself more.

132
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,920
If you have nothing more to say,
I'll get back to work.

133
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,940
Dragging it on won't do any good.

134
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,240
CEO Jo has no other options now,

135
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,980
but other companies
are bound to reach out.

136
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,010
He might change his mind, then.

137
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,750
That's why we're trying
to get the deal signed soon.

138
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,920
But almost everyone knows
CEO Jo's situation.

139
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,480
That's why we must get to him first.

140
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,420
His company itself means nothing to us,

141
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,690
but if we can commercialize
their technology,

142
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,390
we'll make a hundred times more profit.

143
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,760
We gave him...

144
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,930
a copy of our partnership contract.

145
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,130
He'll call us soon.

146
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,000
How's Lucia? Can you work with her?

147
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm not yet sure.

148
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,610
It might be easier to work
with someone who knows how we do things.

149
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,740
I partnered her with you on purpose.

150
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,040
The other employees
can accept that more readily.

151
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,710
Why did you...

152
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,080
bring her in as a special hire?

153
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,350
Didn't I tell you?

154
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,350
The Macau private equity fund
that invested in my business.

155
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,490
Lucia got me the deal.

156
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,530
The condition
was that I give her a job here.

157
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,430
Do you mean...

158
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,500
a huge financier is behind her?

159
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,600
I don't know about that,

160
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,540
but I am sure that she has ties
with some powerful people.

161
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,610
You asked to see me?

162
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,750
You should tell me
how the Jogeon Logistics deal is going.

163
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,860
Director. I don't care
about your private emotions.

164
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,860
If you're planning to use me
because you're against the CEO...

165
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,400
Are you that bothered
that I said we should be a team?

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,100
Then, how about
you work with both teams for a while?

167
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,200
What does that mean?

168
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,040
Test the waters.

169
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,210
Figure out whose side
will benefit you the most.

170
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,480
I'll make something clear.

171
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,810
I mentioned Jogeon Logistics to you
because I needed advice.

172
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,980
I didn't know about the rivalry
between you and CEO Min.

173
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,890
Who cares?

174
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,690
It won't hurt to play both sides for now.

175
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,890
That's what Lawyer Kim did.

176
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,830
He stupidly chose Kyung Chae in the end.

177
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,060
You wouldn't be that foolish.

178
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,800
You're smart.

179
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,470
So,

180
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,500
what did Kyung Chae
offer Jogeon Logistics?

181
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,580
I'm sorry to call you over
on your day off.

182
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,550
It's fine. I don't mind.

183
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,210
Why did you want to see me?

184
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,220
Our chairman's birthday
is coming up next month.

185
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,820
Can you help me cook that day?

186
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,590
You'll celebrate at home?

187
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,790
I want to cook for him this year.

188
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,290
Can you help?

189
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,900
I'd be honored if you'd hire me.

190
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,830
Have you decided what to serve?

191
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,570
I want to serve a Korean banquet.

192
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,100
Can you take some notes?

193
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,170
(Jinwon Gene Laboratory)

194
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,880
You really found my mom?

195
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,310
So soon?

196
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,850
It's the 21st century, isn't it?

197
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,920
People travel to the moon these days.

198
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,390
Korea is the best in this field.

199
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,520
I told you this had better not be a con.

200
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,890
I turn really nasty when I'm angry.

201
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,360
Go to the website and access the QR code.

202
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,300
See for yourself if we're frauds.

203
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,100
Anyone can make a fake website these days.

204
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,470
Leave it, then.

205
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,770
You doubt too much for a kid.

206
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,070
Whatever.

207
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,540
I'll meet her
and see for myself if she's my mom.

208
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,640
Don't trust me. Trust the report.

209
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,880
Your mom happened to give us
a sample of her DNA,

210
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,650
and the timing just worked out.

211
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,590
Okay, then. Call my mom.

212
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,620
Tell her to come over right now.

213
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,630
Right now... It's too soon.

214
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,830
Your mom...

215
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,200
She took a sedative and is ill in bed.

216
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Why?

217
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,870
Why do you think?

218
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,740
She's about to be reunited
with her daughter after 20 years.

219
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,540
Wouldn't you be in shock if you were her?

220
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,280
That's what moms are like.

221
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,680
Blood ties...

222
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,550
are hard to shake off.

223
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,300
Why won't you eat?

224
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,800
It's not that I won't eat. I can't eat.

225
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,140
It's braised spicy seafood.

226
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,910
Just looking at it might give me hives.

227
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,650
She's so weird.

228
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,450
I wonder who Se Ri takes after.

229
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,390
None of us has allergies.

230
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,830
She can't eat seafood, right?

231
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,160
She can't even touch it.
She ended up in the ER once.

232
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,330
Did she get the allergy from her mom?

233
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,070
Make her something else, Manager Gong.

234
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,400
I'll do that.

235
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,640
CEO Min has her own project.

236
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,510
How is the chain store these days?

237
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,310
You don't have to worry.

238
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,680
We raised the sales target
to reflect our growth.

239
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,550
I'm not saying much
because you're doing fine on your own.

240
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,450
Do your best while you have my trust.

241
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,050
That's exactly what I'm doing.

242
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,650
And I'll do even better from now on.

243
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,170
You heard that, didn't you?

244
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,270
Father gave Kyung Chae another task.

245
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,800
It must be really important.

246
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,110
Why don't you do it
if it's that important?

247
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,010
Do you think I don't want to do it?

248
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,080
The job went to Lawyer Kim and Lucia.

249
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,510
Lucia?

250
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,220
Who's that?

251
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,150
The special hire who's just joined.

252
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,920
No way.

253
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,360
Kyung Chae pushed you aside
and gave the project to a new recruit?

254
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,690
She's not a novice.

255
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,000
She's qualified and has experience.

256
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,200
Still, that job should be yours.

257
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,800
Sun Jae's a lawyer, so he doesn't count.

258
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,640
Who is this Lucia woman?

259
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,940
Do you see why I'm so stressed out?

260
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,940
Why don't you just side with Soo Jung?

261
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,450
Who knows? If you two work together...

262
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,520
Don't even mention that brat.

263
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,320
She can be worse than Kyung Chae.

264
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,690
I'd love to see that Lucia woman.

265
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,290
(Hankuk Hospital)

266
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,430
I heard your father
desperately needed money...

267
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,670
and took out a private loan.

268
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,100
A private loan?

269
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,710
There was a really famous lender
called Oh Pan Sool.

270
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,370
Rumor had it that he borrowed from Oh.

271
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,550
The interest would've accumulated
more and more each day,

272
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,950
and he'd have freaked out.

273
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,180
He'd have been frustrated enough
to go to Min Doo Sik.

274
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,980
Min Doo Sik is known...

275
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,420
to turn someone else's crisis
into an opportunity for himself.

276
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,890
You found nothing while you worked...

277
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,590
at Mingang for the past four years.

278
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,630
It's possible...

279
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,500
the crucial proof might be somewhere else.

280
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,600
Somewhere else?

281
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,300
Loan sharks...

282
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,810
never give out money without collateral.

283
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,080
From what I heard,

284
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,440
Oh Pan Sool's hidden safe...

285
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,010
contains everything.

286
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,820
My father's missing secret document...

287
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,120
could be in there too.

288
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,850
The day of the accident,

289
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,560
I turned myself in as Min Doo Sik said.

290
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,490
The document in the car...

291
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,200
was the partnership contract
signed by Min Doo Sik and your father.

292
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,600
Your father lost everything
because he'd signed away the company...

293
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,400
and the new technology.

294
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,510
It's highly likely
that the contract was a fake.

295
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,010
The only way to reveal the truth...

296
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,150
is to find the original contract.

297
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,680
Yes.

298
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,020
The document that could
still be in the loan shark's...

299
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020

The Online Business Team turned a corner.

302
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,740
It's time to prove your worth.

303
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,580
You refused the opportunity I gave you,
so you must have a plan.

304
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,150
The project you gave me.

305
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,180
I didn't think it was an opportunity.

306
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,950
It wasn't an opportunity?

307
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,450
Your acquisition of Jogeon Logistics.

308
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,990
I still think
it's not the right thing to do.

309
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,020
I heard you did business
pretty aggressively in the US.

310
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,360
That's true. But at least...

311
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,460
I didn't break the law.

312
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,060
Even though I was under pressure
to perform well,

313
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,270
I never went against
my principles or beliefs.

314
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,240
Conscience and morals
are virtues to any human being,

315
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,670
but not when it comes to business.

316
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,970
My Kyung Chae is extremely prideful.

317
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,980
She's keeping you on
because hiring you was her idea,

318
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,150
but she can't shield you forever.

319
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,580
Nothing's more harmful to a company...

320
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,520
than a leader who can't perform.

321
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,460
Wait and see.

322
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,590
Judo and Hangeon
are number one and two in the industry,

323
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,230
but they'll fall soon.

324
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,730
They're hurting themselves
to compete with each other,

325
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,330
and that can never last.

326
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,400
When that happens,

327
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,400
you'll see...

328
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,770
it was best to follow the rules
without resorting to tricks.

329
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,510
And that my method was right.

330
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,110
You're too eloquent.

take down any more people.

What's wrong with me?
I was never like this.

354

Is it because I'm distracted?

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,830
No, darn it.

357
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,400
I'm getting emotional
when I should connect with cash.

358
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,000
What should I do?

359
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,370
Yes. I must find out her name.

360
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,370
Are you going somewhere?

361
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,540
- To see my son-in-law.
- Ji Seop? Why?

362
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,050
To ask him something. I need to know.

363
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,050
My heart is about to explode.

364
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,620
Your heart? What's wrong with it?

365
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,850
I don't know!

366
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,990
What got into him?

367
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,560
Lucia told me...

368
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,160
you'll acquire a business.

369
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,730
It's a small company,

370
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,570
but they have a patented technology.

371
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,300
Soon, it will be worth
hundreds of times more.

372
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,700
That's great.

373
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,440
Will taking over that company
improve your standing within Mingang?

374
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,840
I should hope so.

375
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,480
I owe it to you.
You got me the investment.

376
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,420
I didn't do anything.

377
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,350
A private equity fund invests
in businesses with goals that suit theirs.

378
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,790
You don't have to thank anyone.

379
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,990
I want you to do well.

380
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,830
Because I'll recover my investment
that much sooner.

381
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,360
Even so.

382
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,830
Without your help,
I might have lost my position by now.

383
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,270
Things got so bad, my father
considered replacing me with my sister.

384
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,310
That's not right at all.

385
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,610
How could he replace you
with your younger sister?

386
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,240
Exactly.

387
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,510
That's why I need this deal to work.

388
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,960
Ji Seop. I'm right under your nose.

389
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,460
I'm here to see you
and to ask you something.

390
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't need to ask anymore.

391
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,660
Bye.

392
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,920
Where are you? I'm downstairs.

393
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,460
Do you have something to say?

394
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,130
I have nothing to say,
but I want to speak.

395
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,000
You have been dropping things,
and I want to get them for you.

396
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,160
Give me a moment.

397
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,300
You dropped this here. And this too.

398
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,170
You dropped so much.

399
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,340
Oh, dear.

400
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,510
You spilled so much of your beauty...

401
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,280
Who the heck...

402
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,480
is that tall fool with her?

403
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,950
How dare he ruin
our innocent first meeting?

404
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,220
Should Oh Pan Sool throw a fit or not?

405
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,790
Do you get what I'm saying?

406
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,760
It's not a bad deal for you at all.

407
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,230
What is there to think about?

408
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,070
No, forget it. Let's talk in person.
I'll come over.

409
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,900
(11 Basic Safety Rules. Let's stay safe!)

410
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,910
Here's your coffee.

411
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,180
(Jogeon Logistics)

412
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,150
I explained on the phone,
and I want an answer.

413
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,290
I don't get it at all.

414
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,590
You're both from Mingang.

415
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,820
Why are the director and CEO
offering different deals?

416
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,990
If you don't get it, don't try.

417
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,060
Just do as I say.

418
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,130
But I already agreed
to sign the CEO's deal.

419
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,700
You agreed to sign it,
but you haven't signed it yet.

420
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,040
Can't you tell
that my offer is much better?

421
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,540
It is, but...

422
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,240
As I said, I'll think about it
and then give you an answer.

423
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,460
What are you doing in my empty office?

424
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,090
Where were you at?

425
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,030
Why ask? Do I have to report to you?

426
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,870
I told you...

427
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,800
you'd overstep your boundary
and pay dearly for it one day.

428
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,940
Why are you picking a fight with me?

429
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,340
Focus on the chain store.

430
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,380
That's already too big a business for you.

431
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,190
I think Soo Jung knows.

432
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,830
That can't be. How could she...

433
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,530
Was it...

434
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,170
Do you suspect me?

435
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,000
Father said this was a top-secret project,

436
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,840
and as far as I know,
he'd never tell Soo Jung.

437
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,140
How could you conclude that I...

438
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,380
You got me wrong, and that hurts.

439
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,950
You said something like that last time.

440
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,520
And you asked me to trust you.

441
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,020
Yes. This happened four years ago.

442
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,760
The mom of the girl
whom Ms. Se Ri beat up.

443
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,130
You thought I let her go on purpose.

444
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,060
I say what I said last time,
that I did not.

445
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,400
It's possible
that's when things went wrong...

446
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,440
between you and me.

447
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,470
Why would you say that?

448
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,840
It might be too late,

449
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,180
but shall I get her
to confirm you're wrong?

450
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,580
What does that mean?

451
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,680
Do you know where she is?

452
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,880
Who knows?

453
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,420
She could be under our noses.

454
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,530
Kyung Chae seems to be
extra wary of her half-sister.

455
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,400
Things would get crazy
if Director Min found out.

456
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,570
She'd froth at the mouth.

457
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,100
But that works for us.

458
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,000
This is the best way
to start a fight between sisters.

459
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,810
What did you say?

460
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,650
The chairman wanted to promote
Director Min to CEO,

461
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,720
but CEO Min scrapped everything?

462
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,990
Is that true?

463
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,060
Director.

464
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,290
I asked if what you just said is true.

465
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,630
Did my sister
get in the way of my promotion?

466
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,330
Why don't you calm down and...

467
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Director.

468
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,960
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

469
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,470
Sisters? What is that anyway?

470
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,770
You know how Kyung Chae treated my mom!

471
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,240
Lawyer Kim.
Is this how you treat a colleague?

472
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,080
I have something to say. Come with me.

473
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,810
How long will you
keep Director Moon around?

474
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,810
We hired him because he had a use,
but why keep him when we're done with him?

475
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,280
You don't have feelings for him, do you?

476
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,290
The worst thing a person can do
is die before their parents,

477
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:06,090
and the most pitiful people
are those who have lost a child.

478
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,690
Are you my mom?
