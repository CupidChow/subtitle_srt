1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,810
Bring proof that I'm a gold digger.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,980
If you can prove
that I seduced the chairman,

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,580
I'll admit to it then.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,650
And...

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,020
go and tell the person
who paid you to frame me.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,560
Very soon, they will end up paying...

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,500
the exact same way.

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,720
When did she get photos of them?

9
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,890
They're too stupid to do their job.
They couldn't even fend her off.

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,390
Right.

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,060
Do you know how much
they take from me each month?

12
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,430
They shouldn't demand money
if they can't do their job.

13
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,270
Or make sure it's done properly.

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,700
We can't rely on the media now.

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,970
You saw her.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
She's all in on this.

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,970
She thinks she used the reporters
to get to you this time,

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,640
but nothing much has changed.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,310
Nothing will change
until our stock price recovers.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,350
That could've gone bad.

21
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,350
I was so afraid they'd hurt you.

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,890
Keep doing what you just did.

23
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,030
What do you mean?

24
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,130
Even if you want to get involved,

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,830
hold back like you did today.

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,570
Please.

27
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,900
I don't think...

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,570
I can do as you ask.

29
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,850
I am a gold digger.

30
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,080
I approached the chairman on purpose.

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,450
I stole a copy of his schedule,

32
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,160
lay in wait for him to appear,
and pretended it was a coincidence.

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,990
I also did all sorts of things
to win over the chairman,

34
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,360
who never trusts anyone.

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,600
I thought all was lost...

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,200
when that didn't work,
and I thought I should give up.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,730
Then the chairman passed out,

38
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,070
I saved his life,
and I used that to my advantage.

39
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,210
Don't do this.

40
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,780
I'll go to the chairman's office...

41
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,390
and smile and laugh for him.

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,190
If he cries, I'll wipe his tears,

43
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,730
and if he's sad, I'll act cute and sweet
to make him smile.

44
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,360
I'll act coy, like a vixen.

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,860
So...

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,900
Stop caring about me.

47
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,870
Stop thinking about me.

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,610
Go...

49
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,150
and fight your own way.

50
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,250
Did you have a hard time
at the board meeting?

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,250
Yes.

52
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,990
Let's go out if you don't have
any important plans.

53
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,320
We have a bucket list.

54
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,220
You want to do that now?

55
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,690
In this situation?

56
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,160
Does it bother you?

57
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,100
The scandal about
the old chairman and his employee?

58
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Is that why you didn't take my call?

59
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,770
It's not a small matter.

60
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,940
Our stock price plummeted in just one day.

61
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,290
Take it back.

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,030
Why would you...

63
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,130
Even kids don't demand
that someone return a gift.

64
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,430
You're practically asking me
to return the ring.

65
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,900
Circumstances can change,
and they do all the time.

66
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,370
Romeo and Juliet cheated death many times.

67
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,680
People even risk their lives for love.

68
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,020
I won't get you into trouble.

69
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,350
I'll sort it out.

70
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,890
Trust me.

71
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,430
I'll put this back on if you say you will.

72
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,570
Shall I put it on or not?

73
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,410
It's tasty, isn't it?

74
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,950
Sir. Open wide.

75
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,620
Go on.

76
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,820
Goodness.

77
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,330
- It's not bad.
- No?

78
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,500
It's awkward and almost embarrassing
to do this at my age.

79
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,200
What if we meet someone I know?

80
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,270
Look around. No one here cares about us.

81
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,270
They're busy being in love.

82
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,710
Walking on grass barefoot
is a healing experience,

83
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,840
and it's good for your health too.

84
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,610
People must have time to waste.

85
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,250
What are they doing out here
instead of being productive?

86
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,150
This is being productive.

87
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,160
You can't live life with just a clock.

88
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,790
Sometimes you need a compass.

89
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,690
I haven't enjoyed
a break like this during the day...

90
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,630
in a long time.

91
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,440
Shall we go that way?

92
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,550
I asked him again,
and he said he's not hungry.

93
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,650
If he had an appetite right now,
he wouldn't be human...

94
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,490
Hey. What happens to him now?

95
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,020
We must do as the board says.

96
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,430
Why call a board meeting
over his love life?

97
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,770
What about the harm
his love life caused the company?

98
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,500
Can't you just let Dad date her?

99
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,070
Stay out of it.

100
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,440
Isn't it fine
if he's not cheating on anyone?

101
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,710
My point exactly.

102
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,640
That's not right.

103
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,810
It wouldn't be a problem
if he were just dating.

104
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,680
Father gave her
his first wife's engagement ring...

105
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,250
and invited her home.

106
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,820
He's showing signs
of wanting to marry her.

107
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,450
I might as well make something clear.
Father cannot marry that woman.

108
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,990
Our family's future depends on this.

109
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,260
Do you see how that woman
turned the company upside down?

110
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,460
There won't be a wedding,
so don't even talk about it.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
What did the board say?

112
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,270
The executives don't want him
to step down, do they?

113
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,370
If that's their vote, it can't be helped.

114
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,270
What? How can you say that
like it's no big deal?

115
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,180
There's bound to be a new chairman.

116
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,410
It's not Father's title forever.

117
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,450
Now isn't the time.

118
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,950
I'm not ready yet.

119
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,190
Goodness.

120
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,730
Kyung Chae made up her mind.
She'll get Father fired.

121
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,460
Why are things moving so fast
and so suddenly?

122
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,800
His crisis is her opportunity.

123
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,530
That's what Kyung Chae is like.

124
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,040
She's using the ruckus
to replace the king.

125
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,570
What happens to you, then?

126
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,740
If Kyung Chae becomes chairwoman,

127
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,410
what do you become?

128
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,780
I'll be a loser.

129
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,780
Darn it.

"A rich chairman and an employee
overcome differences with love?"

134
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,400
The reporter even interviewed the director
of the orphanage Lucia sponsors...

135
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,970
and a lady who cleans our offices.

136
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,540
What's going on?
The tone is completely different.

137
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,940
Yes. Even all the comments
are rooting for them.

138
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,350
They call it true love.

139
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,720
The first few articles were weird,
to be honest.

140
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,680
She's a gold digger?

141
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,390
If she were after the chairman's money,

142
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,850
they'd be eating course meals
at fancy hotels, not tteokbokki.

143
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,930
I should follow the board's decision?

144
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,700
Yes.

145
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
You seem to want me
to step down as chairman.

146
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,700
Not immediately, but if need be, yes.

147
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,800
The fools. I made Mingang what it is now.

148
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,540
I honored them for their help,
and this is how they treat me?

149
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,240
They'll decide soon. Wait for the call.

150
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,850
Who taught you to be like this?

151
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,750
You act like you control everyone...

152
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,690
and tell your superior
to wait for a decision.

153
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,090
I learned it from you.

154
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,820
You taught me...

155
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,090
to push to no end without mercy.

156
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,990
To make someone's crisis my opportunity.

157
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,530
I didn't teach you
to ruin your own father.

158
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,500
If you didn't want to be ruined,
you shouldn't have done anything wrong.

What? You dare...

Sir.

161
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,840
Sit down.

162
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,980
Try to relax.
I'll take you to the hospital.

163

Don't you know why all this trouble began?

166
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,490
What trouble are you talking about?

167
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,290
You're the one who doesn't seem to know
what's going on.

168
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,800
Go and get a reality check.

169
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
What?

170
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,470
Go and get a reality check.

171
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,780
Don't you need to see your doctor?

172
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,810

180
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,610
Do people even think for themselves?

181
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,340
Someone has to be behind this.

182
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,610
You mean...

183
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,610
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

184
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,920
You did exactly what our CEO did.

185
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,650
You used the media...

186
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,620
and faked the online comments.

187
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,290
There's no reason I shouldn't.

188
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,930
You heard me say...

189
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,830
I'd make them pay the exact same way.

190
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,970
Doing that will only make you
become like them.

191
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,630
Do you want to
become a monster to catch one?

192
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,000
What's wrong with that?

193
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,970
Is revenge all you want?

194
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,040
Don't you care about your life after that?

195
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,410
Yes, I get why you're doing this,

196
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,050
but you don't have to risk
your whole being.

197
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,580
No. I'll give it everything I have.

198
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,720
I won't hold back.

199
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,890
What about me, then?

200
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,090
What about the man
who has to watch you become a monster?

201
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,930
Your revenge might motivate you right now,

202
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,430
but once that's over, you'll crumble.

203
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,630
That's what people are like.

204
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,370
I don't care.

205
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,740
You took me to those places on purpose?

206
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,850
So we'd end up in the news again?

207
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,120
I lied about the bucket list
because I knew...

208
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,620
you'd say no if I'd told the truth.

209
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,520
I didn't know you could control the media.

210
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,820
Shouldn't I have fought back...

211
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,490
when someone faked the scandal article?

212
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,690
You mean someone
told the reporters about us?

213
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,460
It's just a guess.

214
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,470
Who was it?

215
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,040
Was it the CEO?

216
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,470
Don't make assumptions.

217
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,980
The two reporters did have
a special arrangement with her, though.

218
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,350
She's more than capable of doing that.

219
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,350
She's good at handling the media.

220
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,150
You won't know, but something similar
happened four years ago.

221
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,490
Kyung Chae is like me,
and she thinks and acts fast.

222
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,230
She's a clever strategist.

223
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,200
And now, she's waging war against me.

224
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,660
Are you afraid?

225
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,870
A father and daughter
shouldn't fight for too long.

226
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,770
You have no choice.
You might even have to draw blood.

227
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,140
There's only room for one sun in the sky.

228
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,850
Do you want me to go against Kyung Chae?

229
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,250
I wish and hope you'll have
a close and happy relationship,

230
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,580
but if she attacks you first,

231
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,920
I will side with you and take her on.

232
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,260
Why are you calling me?

233
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,830
Hangeon and Judo, your competitors.

234
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,200
They're about to go into receivership.

235
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,240
It'll be on the evening news.

236
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,040
What happened?

237
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,970
They failed to pay
their business partners,

238
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,710
broke the Mutual Cooperation Law,

239
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,180
and bullied their suppliers,
which was a chronic issue.

240
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,910
There are so many reasons.

241
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,420
Both companies' stocks are worth less than
the paper they're printed on.

242
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,550
Really?

243
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,990
Judo and Hangeon were both known
for their aggressive business tactics.

244
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,960
Those tactics ended up haunting them
as cash dried up...

245
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,090
and they failed to keep their promises.

246
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,460
Both companies applied
to go into receivership.

247
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,700
Unlike them,

248
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,600
Mingang's Director Moon Tae Kyung
stuck to morals and principles...

249
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,870
and won a Clean Business Award.

250
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,610
He's famous for maintaining...

251
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,810
a good relationship
with all business partners.

252
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,510
News of Judo and Hangeon
caused Mingang's stock price to soar,

253
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,010
making Director Moon a true star.

254
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,390
Did Moon Tae Kyung save me this time?

255
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,260
The detective kicked you out again?

256
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,860
No one will listen.

257
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,730
It's like they all plugged their ears.

258
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,640
It can't be helped.

259
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,510
Don't get into trouble for harassing them.

260
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,040
Stop going there.

261
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,540
Don't say that.

262
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,510
It's not like they'll kill me.

263
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,810
Mr. Jo.

264
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,550
I want to clear my parents' names,
and that's important to me,

265
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,520
but I don't want you
to get hurt in the process.

266
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,660
Are you...

267
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,390
a reincarnation of Buddha?

268
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,430
Why are you always so kind...

269
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,530
after what I did to you?

270
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,700
I forgot all about that,

271
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,300
so don't try too hard.

272
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,570
Stop telling me to stop.
I must do what I can as a human being.

273
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,040
I'll go to the police station
and lie on the floor until they help me.

274
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,720
Don't worry about me,
and look out for yourself.

275
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,290
I'm so scared...

276
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,390
Min Doo Sik will catch on.

277
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,770
Everyone is praising Mingang
that no one cares about the scandal,

278
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,170
and our stock price recovered.

279
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,900
That's not all.

280
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,770
Our competitors' customers...

281
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,540
are registering with us,
and numbers are through the roof.

282
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,950
The chairman's scandal
ended up benefiting us.

283
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,450
What do you think the board will say?

284
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,890
Isn't it obvious?

285
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,320
Why is this happening?

286
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,060
I thought you were
close-minded and stuck-up,

287
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,190
but that worked in our favor.

288
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,700
I don't want to take credit
for our competitors' poor judgment.

289
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,400
I'm not saying...

290
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,300
you should take credit.
It's a reflective interest.

291
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,870
I will keep doing things my way.

292
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,210
I know you will. You said so many times.

293
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,980
You only do what's right.

294
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,080
I said it didn't matter
as long as we got the result,

295
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,650
and you proved me wrong.

296
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,780
And you're rubbing it in.

297
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,020
Are you proud that you helped me out?

298
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,820
No, sir.

299
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,630
I hope it makes up for
my poor performance in the past few years.

300
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,960
That's it.

301
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,730
I'm glad if that's all it is.

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,030
Do you...

303
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,900
still have feelings for Lucia?

304
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,170
Do I have to answer?

305
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,640
Yes. I'm curious.

306
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,340
I don't think I have to.

307
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,780
You seem to know the answer already.

308
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
Bye, sir.

309
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,860
The arrogant punk.

310
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,460
Is everything sorted out?

311
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,460
Both our company image
and stock price recovered.

312
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,370
We got lucky.

313
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,230
Luck requires skill.

314
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,070
You have lots of it.

315
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,840
What should I call you
if you marry my dad?

316
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,710
"Stepmom?"

317
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,510
Shall I start calling you that now?

318
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,980
You remember our deal, don't you?

319
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,580
I do.

320
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,690
I'll give you whatever shares
the chairman gives me.

321
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,590
Wait. There's one more thing.

322
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,560
Give Kyung Chae
the worst time of her life.

323
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,530
She's too spoiled,
and she needs to learn a lesson.

324
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,570
I look forward to seeing
what you do as a stepmom.

325
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,570
Once she marries Dad, gets some shares,

326
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,180
and gives them all to me...

327
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,450
Just you wait.

328
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,880
I'll get rid of you myself then.

329
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,020
Hey.

330
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,920
When did Mingang's stock price
get this high?

331
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,920
It plummeted
after the scandal hit the news.

332
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,990
It kept you awake,

333
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,400
and you cursed the chairman
with all the words you knew.

334
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,300
Read the papers.

335
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,200
Everyone is talking about...

336
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,800
how Mingang did well
when their major competitors fell.

337
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
Oh, really?

338
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,970
And that news buried the scandal?

339
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,140
Yes.

340
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,140
People are even saying
their love transcended age and class.

341
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,620
We're the same age,
and while he's dating a young woman...

342
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,220
Poor me.

343
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,290
What? Why won't you finish the sentence?

344
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,760
If I keep talking,
we'll only fight again...

345
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,090
and throw punches.

346
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,930
I can slap you instead.

347
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,430
Darn you. Scissors.

348
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,100
- Rock.
- Paper.

349
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,170
- Oh, shoot.
- Let's stop playing.

350
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,780
I feel like I'm suffering from whiplash.

351
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,450
My father's scandal.

352
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,250
It went from her
being a gold digger to his true love.

353
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,480
I don't know
which extreme scenario to believe.

354
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,390
Believe whatever you want.

355
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,050
That's what you always did.

356
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,620
No, I shouldn't be wondering about that.

357
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,190
If Father ends up marrying her,

358
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,830
he'll give her some of his shares too.

359
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,730
He wouldn't give her that too.

360
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,400
He most definitely would
if you look at how things are going.

361
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,370
That complicates things
about who will succeed him.

362
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,080
We should go and talk to my dad.

363
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,380
Your father?

364
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,880
This evening?

365
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,610
Yes, today.

366
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,450
I want to cook for you at home.

367
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,850
Why bother when we can eat out?

368
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,520
It can't be helped
if you must eat out for work,

369
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,190
but home-cooked food is the best.

370
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,660
I'd like that,
but it would be extra work for you.

371
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,900
It's an excuse to see Se Ri too.

372
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,970
When did you get so good
at manipulating the press?

373
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,170
You don't seem to fear taking risks.

374
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,480
Now that you know, don't try to stop me.

375
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,110
If...

376
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,520
you're going to keep fighting the CEO...

377
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,420
What if I keep going?

378
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,820
Be prepared to put your life on the line.

379
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,090
I died four years ago.

380
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,160
What makes you think I wouldn't die twice?

381
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,430
If I had feared death,
I wouldn't have gotten started.

382
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,650
We meet again.

383
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,220
Why are you here without an appointment?

384
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,390
Because I can come without an appointment.

385
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,790
Ms. Jung.

386
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,790
What are you doing here?

387
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,530
I came to see you.

388
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,600
What's all this?

389
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,800
You cooked it all yourself?

390
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,570
It's nothing fancy.

391
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,740
Try it. It's mock ritual bibimbap.

392
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,340
Like an ancestral ritual?

393
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,280
It's not that day today.

394
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,150
It's a traditional meal.

395
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,120
It's a bibimbap you eat...

396
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,480
with soy sauce instead of red gochujang.

397
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,920
It's usually served...

398
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
with grilled meat and jeon,

399
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,720
but I skipped those today.

400
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,160
On purpose,
so you'd eat a lot of vegetables.

401
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,030
Gosh, there are so many vegetable dishes.

402
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,070
I wish I could eat like this more often.

403
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,970
Manager Gong always serves seafood.

404
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,070
Why? You don't like seafood?

405
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,440
I'm allergic to seafood and can't eat it.

406
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,380
You are? So am I.

407
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,650
Are you?

408
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,880
We have something in common.

409
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,320
The rest of the family likes seafood,
so they eat it often.

410
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,060
You can join us.

411
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,730
No, thanks.

412
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,530
Then go somewhere else.

413
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,930
I don't like someone watching me eat.

414
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,230
This is my job.

415
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,030
Leave just for today, then.

416
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,100
As I said, this is my job.

417
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,370
Leave us.

418
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,350
It looks good. How do you eat it?

419
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,220
I'll mix it for you.

420
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,300
Try it.

421
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,830
Goodness.

422
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,880
It's good.

423
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,650
Me too.

424
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,810
Okay.

425
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,650
You need to eat lots of vegetables too.

426
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,660
The gate was open.

427
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,130
You didn't lock it when you came in?

428
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,360
I guess that woman
didn't shut it behind her.

429
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,300
What woman?

430
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,640
When do I get to see you again?

431
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,210
Soon? Look up places
you want to go. I'll take you.

432
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,480
Shouldn't you find
a decent title to call her?

433
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,710
Like what?

434
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,810
Just get married already.

435
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,280
Will you call her "Mom" then?

436
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,020
Don't, sir.

437
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,920
Will you really marry her?

438
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,690
I'm all for it.

439
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,930
Look at us now.
We look like an awesome family.

440
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,860
Mom, Dad, and I.

441
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,860
Goodness.

442
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,580
So you left again?

443
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,180
Like last time?

444
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,290
You might end up...

445
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,150
losing the house to her.

446
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,120
Yes.

447
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,660
I just couldn't stand it.

448
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,600
I might want to kill her
if she keeps showing up.

449
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,670
I told you...

450
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,640
I'd do anything for you
if you got her out of my sight.

451
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,140
Why won't you do anything?

452
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,980
Do you really want her out of your sight?

453
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,950
Do you want me to become a murderer?

454
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,450
No.

455
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,080
I won't let you get blood on your hands.

456
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,220
This is why I like you.

457
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,870
(Mingang Distribution)

458
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,010
Hello?

459
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,180
Is this Jung Lucia?

460
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,490
Yes, it is.

461
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,460
A gentleman sent you a parcel,
saying it's a surprise.

462
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
A parcel?

463
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,060
Who is it from?

464
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,060
Come downstairs and sign for it.

465
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,760
I'll tell you then.

466
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,630
Okay.

467
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,670
Basement level parking? Got it.

468
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
Ms. Lucia.

469
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,680
If you're off to get something,
shall I help you?

470
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,020
No. I can manage.

471

(Mingang Distribution)

472
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,970
Get her inside.

473
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,440
Let me go!

474
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
Mr. Lawyer?

475
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,150
We have her.

476
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,820
Don't worry.

477
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,390
No one knows the place.

478
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,250
We won't get caught.

479
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,690
Yes. I'll call when we're done.

480
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,360
Lucia!

481
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Who are you?

482
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,970
Get lost.

483
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,570
Stay still!

484
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,410
Lucia.

485
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,190
Lucia!

486
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Darn you!

487
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,440
Lucia.

488
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,500
Do you want her to die?

489
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,510
Drop the knife.

490
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,710
As if I would.

491
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,420
I said drop it!

(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

493
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,650
Don't worry about me.
I can handle myself.

494
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,320
You think I'll stop worrying
because you tell me to?

495
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,250
Min Doo Sik will get worked up
if he can't reach you.

496
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,660
Shouldn't you give me what I want?

497
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,790
Isn't it me? Min Kyung Chae,
the CEO of Mingang Distribution.

498
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,430
I'll search the whole country
if I must and find you.

499
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,000
Forget Min Kyung Chae.

500
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,100
