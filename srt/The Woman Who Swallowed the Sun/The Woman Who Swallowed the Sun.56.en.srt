1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,970
I was...

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,880
(Episode 56)

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,280
kidnapped.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,150
I was lucky enough to get away.

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,380
What do you mean?

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,380
Who would do such a thing?

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,520
It was Min Kyung Chae.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,260
What is it?

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,190
It looks like she's there with you.

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,030
Chairman. You must believe me.

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,300
Can you do that,
whatever your daughter says?

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,840
It's the only way to reveal the truth.

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,210
Leave that here. I'll eat on my own.

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,020
Did he eat?

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,820
He will.

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,860
He must care a lot about what you think.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,000
Nothing I said would make him eat.

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,470
That woman won't come here again,
so you don't have to worry.

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,200
Is that true? Did they break up?

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,040
It wasn't even a real relationship.

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,340
She didn't deserve him.

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,610
I can sleep well at last.

23
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,310
I never showed it,

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,810
but I was really worried...

25
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,520
I'd have to serve her too.

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,490
That won't ever happen.
Don't mind her again.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,090
We can speak freely now. I'm alone.

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,660
What do you mean,
Kyung Chae kidnapped you?

29
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,730
She's afraid you'll ask me to marry you.

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,760
If we do get married,

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,730
I'll become your legal wife.

32
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,770
So she did that?
Doesn't she have better things to do?

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,670
I'm not surprised...

34
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,540
that she disapproves of someone like me.

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,310
How dare she? What's so bad about you?

36
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,080
Who does she think she is?

37
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,850
How dare she insult
the woman her father chose?

38
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,780
I'm out of your league
in every conceivable way.

39
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,950
She had you kidnapped
because she disapproved?

40
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,920
Do you understand that witch?

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,660
I don't understand. I forgive.

42
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,730
You might forgive her, but not me.

43
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,730
Attacking my loved one is attacking me.

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,770
Don't be like that.

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,370
This is why I was reluctant to call you.

46
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,040
- You're family.
- Forget that.

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,410
All she wants
is to defeat me and take my place.

48
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,240
Let's meet right now.

49
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,480
I need to see for myself that you're safe.

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,350
We can't talk for a while.

51
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,480
I fear what Ms. Min will do to me
if she sees me.

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,820
What are you saying?
Will you go into hiding?

53
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,050
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,530
Hello? Hello!

55
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,500
What the...

56
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,400
My goodness...

57
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,670
Now that he knows
Min Kyung Chae had you kidnapped,

58
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,540
things will get a bit crazy.

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,070
He will be angry,
but he can't do anything right away.

60
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,310
Min Kyung Chae will take him down
if he berates her without proof.

61
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,710
He would know his own daughter
better than anyone.

62
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,950
What about Sun Jae?

63
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,490
Was he by the door all day long?

64
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,320
Don't even ask. I'm getting sick of it.

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,260
He's playing the long game.

66
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,990
He hired someone to watch the door
when he goes to work.

67
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,430
His plan is to keep you in here.

68
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,050
Breakfast is ready.

69
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,020
I'll ask you again.

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,150
You really don't know where Lucia is?

71
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,390
You thought about that all night?

72
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,260
I don't know.

73
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,930
I'd have told you if I knew where she was.

74
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,960
You got lucky.

75
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,360
I should assume
I got away from a gold digger?

76
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,300
Because the fact
that she disappeared on her own...

77
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,400
means she had a guilty conscience?

78
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,540
I get that you feel betrayed,

79
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,640
but you must make a clean break.

80
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,710
That woman approached you with a purpose,

81
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,750
and she was never serious about you.

82
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,150
She was never serious about me?

83
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,050
You should be glad
all your children are meek and mild.

84
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,050
Something bad would've happened
if we were like any other family.

85
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,190
You and her? It never made sense.

86
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,590
My children are meek and mild? Who, you?

87
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,530
If you cared any more...

88
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,660
I'm not hungry. Get out.

89
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,600
I'll come to work in the afternoon.

90
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,270
Okay.

91
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,440
The darn brat.

92
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,580
How dare she lie to me?

93
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,780
Is he really not feeling well?

94
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,620
It's not that, so don't worry.

95
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,080
You're not a doctor.

96
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,420
How can you be sure
when he wasn't diagnosed?

97
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,220
It is what I say it is.

98
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,890
What? Now you want to boss me around
at home like you did at work?

99
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,430
How dare you?

100
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,200
I think it's a condition
of the heart, not the body.

101
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,270
Like lovesickness.

102
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
It's exactly that.

103
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,840
What?

104
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,070
He's acting like this
over that Lucia woman?

105
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,170
She disappeared without a trace.

106
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,040
What are you talking about?

107
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,050
They've broken up for good,
and that's all you need to know.

108
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,420
I'm sure someone had other plans.

109
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,490
As if their relationship made sense.

110
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,660
What do you mean, Kyung Chae?

111
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,620
Did they really break up?

112
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,730
Is she gone for good?

113
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,090
Of course.

114
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,300
She was a gold digger
who was after Father's money.

115
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,100
Hey. That doesn't make sense.

116
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,570
If she were a gold digger,
why would she give up...

117
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,900
when she had as good as had him?

118
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,040
Whatever.

119
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,910
We'll never see her again,
and that's that.

120
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,190
What do you want?

121
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,020
Kyung Chae said something odd.

122
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,260
She said we'll never see Lucia again.

123
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,930
Do you know anything about that?

124
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,630
She's not answering her phone.

125
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,900
Do you know...

126
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,130
how Mingang Distribution's equity
is structured?

127
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,930
Why mention that?

128
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,270
If the chairman
really were to marry Lucia...

129
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,210
and give her a stake in the company,

130
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,010
no one knows what will happen next.

131
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,750
You're saying there's a possibility
that Lucia will take the shares...

132
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,620
the chairman gives her
and stab us in the back?

133
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,380
It's not entirely impossible.

134
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,060
That's why we must prevent a woman
like that from marrying the chairman.

135
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,360
I don't care about that.
My dad's happiness comes first.

136
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,200
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

137
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,200
But you're the one who's being duped.

138
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,700
What are you saying?

139
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,940
That Lucia woman.

140
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,940
Don't trust her too much.

141
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,550
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

142
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,530
I'll reappear
when I think the time is right.

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,530
Cover for me at work.

144
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,500
That's how we can expose
that Min Kyung Chae...

145
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,030
was behind my abduction.

146
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,250
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

147
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,720
What will you do about Lucia?

148
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,660
What do you mean?

149
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,430
Don't your duties include
dismissing a subordinate...

150
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,260
who is absent without leave?

151
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,700
Who says she's absent without leave?

152
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,300
I'd like to know...

153
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,870
how you know something
that no one else knows about.

154
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,470
I assumed...

155
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,310
because I haven't seen her.

156
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,650
Is everyone you can't see
absent without leave?

157
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
Did you know...

158
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,180
she would miss work like this?

159
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,520
That means you also know where she is.

160
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,490
How could you know that?

161
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,360
Did you play a part
in creating a situation...

162
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,260
in which Lucia had to disappear?

163
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,360
What are you saying?

164
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,300
Quit talking nonsense and get out.

165
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,180
What will you do to her?

166
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,880
We can't keep her locked up forever.

167
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,550
I'm still thinking.

168
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,590
Where is she? You said something
about the outskirts of Seoul.

169
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,520
Why do you ask?

170
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,630
I want to see the state she's in.

171
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,390
Not yet.

172
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,700
She freaks out so much,
she's hard to control.

173
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,300
You'll only end up with nightmares.

174
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,740
You handle her, then.

175
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,310
At least until the chairman
has gotten sick of her,

176
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,370
keep her locked up.

177
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,510
You bet. Don't worry about that.

178
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,420
Keep a close eye on her.

179
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,560
If she takes one step out of the suite,
do whatever it takes to grab her.

180
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,460
Does Ms. Min know you lost her?

181
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,030
Not yet.

182
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,900
We must grab her again
before Ms. Min catches on.

183
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,640
So stand guard at all times.

184
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,880
Is that HR?

185
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,720
I need someone's address.

186
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,050
Whose do you mean?

187
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,960
Jung Lucia, Online Business Team.

188
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,660
I checked, and it's not on file.

189
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,970
Why not? Don't they put
their addresses in personnel files?

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,970
That used to be mandatory,

191
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,440
but now we leave it to them.

192
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,570
There's no way to find her, then?

193
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,940
Pardon? What do you mean by that?

194
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,240
Never mind.

195
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,320
Do I need to hire someone to find her?

196
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,820
Where is she hiding?

197
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,060
Sir, I set the table for you.

198
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,000
You too.

199
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,600
You're so cute when you eat.

200
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,270
What's wrong?

201
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,040
Being jobless suits you.

202
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,940
Have you given up on making a living?

203
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,580
Give me a job, then, Father.

204
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,380
Oh, right. I heard Lucia skipped town.

205
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,950
Who cares?

206
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,880
It's for the best.

207
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,620
It was obvious what she was.

208
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,360
I'm glad it's over
before she got her fangs in too deep.

209
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,660
What?

210
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,790
Relax and enjoy life.

211
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,330
It's great to be single.

212
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,160
- Feed me, honey.
- Okay.

213
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,900
Marriage is like sealing your own coffin.

214
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,940
Why are you so desperate to walk into one?

215
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,400
Feed me more.

216
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,240
- Do you want melon flavor?
- Yes.

217
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,540
Okay.

218
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,340
Here.

219
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,750
How dare he say that
when he's happily married?

220
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,650
"Marriage is like
sealing your own coffin?"

221
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,850
- Darn you.
- I don't like the melon one.

222
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Goodness.

223
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
Oh, dear.

224
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,360
Eat this and cheer up.

225
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,200
Why would you say that?

226
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,960
You were unwell for a while.

227
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,570
I'll take better care of you.

228
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,200
You're not alone, sir.

229
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,240
What does that mean?

230
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,080
Why do you worry
when you have me to care for you?

231
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,680
Have they all decided to rub it in?

232
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,710
Why? Would your lives end up in ruins...

233
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,580
if I were to marry Lucia?

234
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,660
I'll make it up to you.

235
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,240
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

236
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,340
Goodness...

237
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,510
She's so cruel.

238
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,810
I get that stuff happened,
but she can't even call once?

239
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,080
But then, if I'd been through
something like that...

240
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,320
Is she taking it out on me?

241
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,860
Where on earth is she?

242
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,560
If your sister-in-law said
she was a gold digger, then she was.

243
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,600
Kyung Chae is not the type to lie.

244
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Why did he allow himself to be in the news
if he were to end it like this?

245
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,410
To be honest, we don't know
if Kyung Chae did something in secret.

246
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,080
She could have that woman somewhere.

247
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,110
Would she go that far?

248
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,210
Whatever they did, it's way better...

249
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,850
than him marrying a much younger woman.

250
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,890
We don't have to worry about him anymore.

251
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,790
It's Ji Seop I'm worried about.

252
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,220
He can't stay jobless forever.
He should get back to work.

253
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,430
I was going to wait
until Father rehired me,

254
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,560
but I don't see it happening.

255
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
Don't worry.

256
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,300
I plan to pay him a visit.

257
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
He won't ignore what I have to say...

258
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,270
when I've invested a fortune in Mingang.

259
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,440
To be honest, you should be
a non-executive director, Dad.

260
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,710
Right, darling?

261
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,310
That's right.

262
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,510
You contributed way more than Stella Jang.

263
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,610
Wait. Who?

264
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,420
Whose name did you just say?

265
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,920
What got into you now?

266
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Your eyes only sparkle like that
when you're making money.

267
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,820
Stella Jang is a newly appointed
non-executive director. Why?

268
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,930
That Stella Jang?

269
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,330
No.

270
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,230
That woman was called Sdella.
This one is called Stella.

271
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,270
They're not the same person.
It's not important.

272
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,300
Let's take some time apart to think.

273
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,240
(Mingang Distribution)

274
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,650
Who could this be?

275
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,150
I apologize for intruding last time.

276
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,990
I'm glad you know what you did was wrong.

277
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,730
Do you have a meeting
with the non-executive directors?

278
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,930
Do I have to tell you
things like that too?

279
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,770
Even the most honest people
make enemies along the way.

280
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,900
You can swear them to secrecy,

281
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,670
but the US Korean-American community
is pretty small,

282
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,140
and the word must've gotten out.

283
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,510
I don't know what you're talking about.

284
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,310
You must know what I'm talking about.

285
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,110
Stella Jang and Jung Lucia.

286
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Anyone else, and I'd have
something on you by now.

287
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,420
I couldn't find anything weird
or suspicious about either of you.

288
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,660
That means
you looked into our backgrounds.

289
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,290
Why not?

290
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,330
She's an employee,
and you're a non-executive director.

291
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,530
Shouldn't we do our due diligence?

292
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,440
So what? Are you sorry
you couldn't find anything on us?

293
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,140
The identity is just too perfect,

294
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,670
and I wonder if it's fake.

295
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,140
Listen, Lawyer Kim Sun Jae.

296
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,480
You're going a bit too far.

297
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,250
Am I?

298
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,220
What?

299
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,160
Stand guard. She'll leave one day.

300
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,130
She won't stay in there forever.

301
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,260
This is when we say...

302
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,330
the rat is trapped.

303
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,200
Kim Sun Jae is the worst person
to be born in a million years.

304
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,840
Are there men outside?

305
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,410
Of course there are.

306
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,670
No news from Tae Joo yet?

307
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,810
It must be hard to find footage.

308
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,840
He'll get it somehow.

309
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,910
Tae Joo is pretty good in that field.

310
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,920
How are things at Mingang?

311
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,920
Do you want to know about Mingang
or Moon Tae Kyung?

312
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,730
Call him.

313
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Use my phone
if you don't want to use yours.

314
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,870
Why hold back if you want to know?

315
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,240
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

316
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,820
Moon Tae Kyung speaking.

317
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,290
It's me.

318
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,960
I didn't expect much from
an unknown number, but I'm glad it's you.

319
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,690
I've been looking at
your empty seat all day.

320
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,430
That's why I called.

321
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,630
I appreciate that.

322
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,170
Don't worry about things at work.

323
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,970
I took care of it,
so nothing much will happen.

324
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,310
Are you making progress...

325
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,910
to prove that the CEO
was behind the kidnapping?

326
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,080
We're looking for footage to prove it.

327
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,590
Okay, talk to you again soon.

328
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,160
If you hear from Lucia,

329
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,260
I'd appreciate a heads-up.

330
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,360
I can't reach her.

331
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,630
The call just now. Wasn't that her?

332
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,670
It wasn't.

333
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,310
They say not doing anything
causes the least amount of problems.

334
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,510
Being nosy
and getting involved in something...

335
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,250
that doesn't involve you
will only get you hurt.

336
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,010
What?

337
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,180
I never liked you from the start.

338
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,850
How should I put it?

339
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,050
You felt like an enemy...

340
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,120
who'd infiltrated our camp
to get something.

341
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,490
I still think that of you.

342
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,500
I have a feeling...

343
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,670
someone who works for you
is busy getting up to no good.

344
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,980
Hang on.

345
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,680
Let's see.

346
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,850
Why are you doing this?

347
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,220
You know why I'm doing this.

348
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,720
I told you many times.

349
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Oh, my gosh.

350
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,220
Darn it. Do whatever you want.

351
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,090
I am doing exactly that.

352
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,000
What does he want?

353
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,470
He's the worst kind of nuisance.

354
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,670
He wants me to look up something
from 30 years ago.

355
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,970
What case is it?

356
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,210
It was a minor theft case.

357
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,940
The victim identified him by mistake,

358
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,810
so we warned him before cutting him loose.

359
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,080
That's that, then. What's the problem?

360
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,820
He needs confirmation
that we questioned him at that time...

361
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,320
so that he can prove an alibi.

362
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,890
He wants to clear himself of murder.

363
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,120
He wants to get a retrial.

364
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,560
A retrial on a murder case?

365
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,060
Who's the actual killer?

366
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,200
It's plain stupid.

367
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,660
Who is it?

368
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,930
Min Doo Sik,
Mingang Distribution's chairman.

369
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,880
Thank you.

370
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,520
Life can be so tough and unfair.

371
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,060
It doesn't go as you'd like.

372
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,890
Some do time for something they didn't do,

373
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,700
while the real killer enjoys life.

374
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,060
That's what I'm saying.

375
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,100
You get it.

376
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,940
I heard about your plight.

377
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,010
You have a thing
with Mingang's chairman, Min Doo Sik.

378
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,380
Telling it would take more time
than it would to fill a jar with a hole.

379
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,210
I have a lot of time.

380
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,580
Tell me the story. I'll hear you out.

381
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,420
I can't help you if I don't know.

382
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,020
You'll help me?

383
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,620
You're saying you'll help this Jo Pil Doo?

384
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,130
Yes, I will.

385
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,660
What else can an officer do?

386
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,130
Your name is Jo Pil Doo?

387
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,600
Yes. I'm Jo Pil Doo.

388
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,640
Mr. Jo.

389
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,510
What's the story
between you and Min Doo Sik?

390
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,210
We go a disgustingly long way back.

391
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,750
Darn it.

392
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,280
My gosh...

393
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,590
How much longer must I wait?

394
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,400
What took you so long?

395
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,630
Why? Is something up?

396
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes.

397
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,640
I met someone who offered to help me.

398
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,240
You did?

399
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,010
How could Kyung Chae do that?

400
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,250
Will you let her get away with it?

401
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,820
What can I do?

402
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,650
She'll kick up a fuss...

403
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,620
if I condemn her with no proof.

404
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,060
That's why Lucia went into hiding...

405
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
without even calling in to work.

406
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,160
I'm putting her through too much.

407
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,030
You should've proposed
and married her already.

408
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,970
I regret not doing that.

409
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,100
I need proof...

410
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,440
if I'm to stop your sister
from doing that again.

411
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,040
Did you talk to her?

412
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,210
Is Lucia okay?

413
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,380
She said she was,

414
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,680
but I'm worried,
and I might hire someone to find her.

415
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,820
That won't work.

416
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,590
She'll reappear if you reveal
the truth behind the kidnapping.

417
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,490
You should do that first.

418
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,130
The phone is turned off.

419
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,230
Connecting to voicemail.

420
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,440
You will be charged after the beep.

421
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,970
She went underground?

422
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,540
Just because she broke up with Dad?

423
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,280
She won't see me again, either?

424
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,520
Did Dad and that woman really break up?

425
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,820
Yes.

426
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,960
She wouldn't disappear without a word.

427
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,830
She never said anything to me.

428
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,760
Forget about that fraud.

429
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,330
Who's a fraud?

430
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,200
Why do you hate her so much?

431
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,940
You're making me angry.

432
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,010
After all that I did for you,
you're worried about her?

433
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,780
I know you cared about me.

434
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,610
But you're just a sister.
You're not my mom.

435
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,120
Was she your mom, then?

436
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,920
I thought it would be nice if she were.

437
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,390
I still do.

438
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,690
Get a hold of yourself.

439
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,860
I can't accept that woman.

440
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,260
I won't accept anyone.

441
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,330
You can pretend I'm your mom.

442
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,360
You've done that so far.

443
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,870
You'll get married one day
and have children.

444
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,840
You can be a mom to your real children.

445
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,420
I worked hard to get that.

446
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,920
I had a hard time finding a car
parked close to where it happened.

447
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,650
I get that. Good job.

448
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,120
Do we just show this to Min Doo Sik?

449
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,060
He'll have to believe
Min Kyung Chae was behind it.

450
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,730
I'll go and pull the fire alarm.

451
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,400
Sneak out afterward.

452
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,550
Watch out. Try not to meet Kim Sun Jae.

453
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,550
He'll get the call right away.

454
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,950
The moment he catches on, you're done for.

455
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,870
So she got away?

456
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,610
Who leaves because the fire alarm rings?

457
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,440
I'm sorry, sir.
The hotel staff forced us to evacuate.

458
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,950
You idiots.

459
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,250
There's another problem.

460
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,020
What's that?

461
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,220
It looks like they have footage
of the kidnapping going down.

462
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,490
What do you mean?
That area is a blind spot.

463
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,590
They got dashcam footage from a car
parked nearby. What should we do?

464
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,730
Darn you...

465
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,730
What now?

466
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,830
The chairman will make everyone pay
if he finds out what happened.

467
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,440
Go somewhere and die.
You're not worth the food you eat.

468
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,150
Who's that?

469
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,620
I have to go.

470
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,230
(Mingang Distribution)

471
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,110
You showed up.

472
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,840
You lasted a long time in that suite.

473
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,810
You'll take the footage...

474
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,780
and show the chairman
who had you kidnapped?

475
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,520
Baek Sul Hee.

476
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,120
I told you.

477
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,530
You won't get your way.

478
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,600
- Give me that!
- Stay still.

479
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,430
Hey.

480
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,370
I told you to lie low.

481
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,110
Did you think
the chairman would marry you?

482
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,710
Would I let that happen?

483
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,810
Once I become the chairman's wife,

484
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,710
I'll get you fired first!

485
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,610
Oh, gosh, I'm so scared.

486
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,650
Should I go on my knees and beg, then?

487
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,920
What are you doing?

488
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,860
Stay away if you don't know what's up.

489
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,700
It's none of your business.

490
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,870
You can't...

491
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,140
What I just witnessed.

492
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,510
I will not let this slide.

493
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,380
I swear on my job title...

494
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,820
that I will make an official complaint.

495
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,820
I'll put you before the in-house
ethics committee, so be prepared.

496
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,070
I'll ask you one last time.

497
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,810
Is it really true that Lucia
went into hiding to keep cover?

498
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,880
Did she really come clean to you?

499
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,420
I told you.

500
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,050
She admitted to being a gold digger.

501
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,820
I'll ask again.

502
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,630
She said she was never serious about me,

503
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,830
and that she approached me
on purpose to get to my assets.

504
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,830
I even confirmed
that she boarded a plane to the US.

505
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,370
From what I heard, she has a lover there.

506
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,640
He's younger, too.

507
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,580
Then she won't show herself
before me ever again?

508
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,750
That's right.

509
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,150
I bet she's in the US right now
with her younger lover.

510
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,850
Women like that...

511
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,190
ditch old men
once they have no more use for them.

512
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,530
Who ditched whom?
