Your ID card was deactivated
upon your termination.

2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,350
Ma'am, that's enough.

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,260
- Ma'am, that's enough.
- Leave me alone!

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,720
Do you have any idea who I am?

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,700
What's going on here?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,070
She's an outsider.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,840
Are you going to let her in?

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,380
- Let's go, ma'am.
- Let go of me!

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,150
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Let go!

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,950
I'm Min Kyung Chae
of Mingang Distribution!

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,590
Let me go!

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
Let go!

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Unbelievable.

15
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,410
(Episode 84)

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,380
Hey, Yeon Ah.

17
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,420
You know what tomorrow is, right?

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Of course, I do.

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,120
We have to go celebrate with Mi So.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Of course.

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,130
(Mingang Distribution)

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,260
Did you really have to go that far?

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,170
You'll get what's coming to you for this.

24
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,070
What did you just say?

25
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,510
Did you have to drive out
the poor CEO to make yourself happy?

26
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,180
Is that what you're here to argue about?

27
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,580
Listen, Baek Sul Hee.

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,010
I know this is revenge for our daughter,
but this is going too far.

29
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,120
Mi So wasn't just your daughter.
She was my daughter, too.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,220
Your daughter?

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,090
That's right. My daughter.
My own flesh and blood.

32
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,130
You wrecked someone else's company
to steal the CEO position.

33
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,430
Do you think she's looking down
happy about any of this?

34
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,940
Don't you dare say her name
with that filthy mouth.

35
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,270
That's why...

36
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,940
you've done enough.

37
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,710
Stop this. Right now.

38
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,580
No. I'm just getting started.

39
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,720
Doing this won't bring her back.

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,980
That's why I have to do this...

41
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,320
because she's not coming back!

42
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,190
Since we're on the subject,
do you even know what tomorrow is?

43
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,260
It's Mi So's 20th birthday.

44
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,570
She would have been so beautiful
at the best time of her life.

45
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,600
Do you know what I'm going through today?

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,470
How dare you lecture me
about our daughter!

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,710
After all this time, now you care?

48
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,670
She was your daughter, too?

49
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,510
If you considered Mi So your daughter,
you wouldn't be defending Min Kyung Chae.

50
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,920
How can a father...

51
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,120
side with his own child's enemy?

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,790
You're spineless, but this is too much.

53
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,660
Who do you think
did that to your daughter?

54
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,330
So get out of my sight.

55
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,670
You were never a father to her.

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,470
Becoming CEO has really gone to her head.

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Then again,

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,910
she's the one in charge
of Mingang Distribution now.

59
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,720
(Director Min Soo Jung)

60
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,390
Hey!

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Soo Jung!

62
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,390
You won't believe what I just saw.

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,560
What now?

64
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,100
Kyung Chae was just dragged
out of the building.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Dragged out?

66
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,770
That woman takes the CEO position,
and her first act is firing Kyung Chae.

67
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,570
It's a bloodbath.

68
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,370
She's crossed the line.

69
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,770
Regardless of the reason,
this is too much.

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,910
That's what I'm saying!

71
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,350
Come on. No matter how much of a pain
Kyung Chae is, this is just wrong.

72
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,280
If we let this go, we could be next.

73
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,220
What's to stop her from coming after us?

74
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,020
She's basically declaring war
by taking out her rival...

75
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,520
after becoming CEO, right?

76
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,820
She thinks she's untouchable now.

77
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,590
I swear, that woman...

78
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,060
Hey, Min Soo Jung!
You're coming with me! Darn it.

79
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,010
(Mingang Distribution)

80
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,410
What's all this commotion?

81
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,820
Is it true you fired my sister?

82
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,350
I heard she was just dragged
out of the building.

83
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,020
They dragged her out like a dog.

84
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,020
That's rich.

85
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,230
When were you ever concerned
for your half-sister?

86
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,860
Excuse me?

87
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,700
Weren't you two worse than enemies?

88
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,630
Weren't you the one who begged me
to remove Min Kyung Chae as the CEO?

89
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,500
You did that?

90
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,940
But that didn't mean I wanted you
to take her place!

91
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,080
Have you already forgotten
about your birth mother?

92
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,880
That's a separate issue.

93
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,610
Are you really going to fire my sister
just like this?

94
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,450
She had it coming. The chairman is aware.

95
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,750
Can you do whatever you want
as long as the chairman knows?

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,790
So, does this mean Jung Lucia is
calling the shots at Mingang now?

97
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,760
The shot caller of Mingang...

98
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,930
I like the sound of that.

99
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,700
So you'd better grovel.

100
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,670
If you don't want to end up fired
like your sister.

101
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,010
What are you doing home at this hour?

102
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,990
What's wrong, Ms. Kyung Chae?

103
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
What is it?

104
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,240
Don't tell me that woman
kicked you out of the company.

105
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,020
Right now, our team has an opening
due to Min Kyung Chae's dismissal,

106
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,490
and that spot will be filled by a transfer
from another department,

107
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,190
or until we get a new hire.

108
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,030
Otherwise, we'll have to manage
with the current team.

109
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,960
It's going to be one or the other.

110
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,700
So, what do you think?

111
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,130
Let's just stick with our current team.

112
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,030
A new person would just
make things awkward,

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,870
and to be honest,
those few days were tough enough.

114
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,970
I agree. We're all so in sync,

115
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,780
and bringing in the wrong person
could mess up our teamwork.

116
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,210
That's true.

117
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,710
We've been the core members
since the online team formed.

118
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,180
Anyone new would just feel
like an outsider.

119
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,220
Okay. I understand what you're all saying.

120
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,490
And it's true, when it comes to teamwork,
no other team can touch us.

121
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,730
Look at them, subtly bad-mouthing her.

122
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,560
No matter what a wreck
Kyung Chae is in right now,

123
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,400
how can they be so cheerful
the second she's gone?

124
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,170
Vice Director Min.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,370
Do you have something to say?

126
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,410
No. I have nothing to say at all.

127
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,750
It looks like you have something
on your mind.

128
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,080
I said I don't.

129
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,790
How does it feel...

130
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,260
after kicking Min Kyung Chae out
of Mingang?

131
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,130
I should feel great,
but it hasn't really sunk in yet.

132
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,260
Mingang was her life, her entire goal.

133
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,530
Now that she's been
completely tossed aside,

134
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,030
she's going to fall apart mentally.

135
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,940
I'm sure she will.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,240
The CEO role was never
just a title to her.

137
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,080
Now, no matter what anyone says,

138
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,910
you're the second-in-command
at Mingang, Lucia.

139
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,150
She won't have any power
on the Board of Directors anymore, either.

140
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,020
So, does the real battle
for the shares start now?

141
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,650
It has to.

142
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,990
Depending on who holds the most shares
of Mingang Distribution,

143
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,890
the de facto owner of Mingang
will be decided.

144
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,000
The owner of Mingang...

145
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,630
It'll be impossible to get any more shares
from Chairman Min Doo Sik.

146
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,100
So now, the key is...

147
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,440
to sway the Board's shares
that were with Min Kyung Chae...

148
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,500
and bring them over to our side.

149
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,350
What are you thinking so deeply about?

150
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,880
Lucia.

151
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,350
What about her?

152
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,250
Something about her makes me uneasy.

153
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,760
I know there's nothing more unpredictable
than a person's heart,

154
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,430
but still, this just doesn't feel right.

155
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,100
Has she had a change of heart
or something?

156
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I think Lucia is starting to
see that girl, Se Ri, as her own daughter.

157
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,400
No way.

158
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,570
She was the reason
Lucia lost her child. How can that be?

159
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,940
I don't think Lucia herself realizes it,
but that's how I see it.

160
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,380
That explains why she'd jump
in there to save the kid.

161
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,720
Did she grow fond of her
from living in the same house?

162
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,490
Does that even make sense?

163
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,720
To think she married that man for revenge,
only to grow fond of his own daughter.

164
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,760
Besides, who started this whole
cursed relationship in the first place?

165
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,380
What's up with Kyung Chae?
She's been acting weird.

166
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,750
- She's acting like she's lost her mind.
- This isn't happening!

167
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,450
She's not in her right mind right now.

168
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,450
And how could she be?

169
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,550
That woman... I mean, Madam Jung...

170
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,490
I heard she had Ms. Kyung Chae
fired from the company.

171
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,200
Do you still think she's so great?

172
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,100
She must've had her reasons.
She wouldn't do that for nothing.

173
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,700
It's going to be tense around the house,

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,870
so you should get out for a little while.
Go see a friend or something.

175
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,450
Min Se Ri?

176
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,060
- Who are you?
- I'm your stepmom's best friend.

177
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,690
Can we talk for a minute?
I have something to tell you.

178
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,530
Why did you suddenly want to meet,
Grandma?

179
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,830
Come to think of it,
you always call me "Grandma."

180
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,570
I may be old enough to be one,

181
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,370
but I certainly don't look the part.

182
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,210
Whatever. You look like a grandma to me.

183
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,050
Who on earth does she take after?

184
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,050
She's nothing like Min Kyung Chae,

185
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,720
so she's definitely not Ho Se's kid.

186
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,720
There's zero resemblance.

187
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,860
But there's something
oddly familiar about her.

188
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,730
Who could she look like?

189
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,970
What is it?

190
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,530
Why are you staring at me like that?

191
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,100
No. It's nothing.

192
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,440
I was just surprised you came to meet me
without putting up a fight.

193
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,550
I just needed some fresh air.
It's a little tense at home.

194
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,520
Is something going on at home?

195
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,420
That's none of your business.

196
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,930
- Did you meet with her?
- I did.

197
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,400
I looked her over with a hawk's eye
for a good hour.

198
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,500
- And?
- She's nothing like Min Kyung Chae.

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,440
- So she must take after her dad.
- I don't know about that,

200
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,910
but as I was looking at her,

201
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,010
she reminded me of someone.

202
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,350
Who was it?

203
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,950
Never mind.

204
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,550
Who is it?

205
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,960
You don't look so well.

206
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm just tired.

207
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,970
Meetings and conferences all day.

208
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,970
You should rest.
I'll go warm up your herbal medicine.

209
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,270
About Kyung Chae...

210
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,710
I let her go from the company today.

211
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,210
So you fired her.

212
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,150
Are you upset about it?

213
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,380
Upset? If that's what you decided,
then that's that.

214
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,760
She grew up with Mingang Distribution,
so this won't be easy for her to accept.

215
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,960
It wasn't an easy decision for me either.

216
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,360
But if I'd kept her on,

217
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,460
I was afraid something
irreversible might happen.

218
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,330
I know what you mean.

219
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,300
I'm fine with it. As long as you're happy,
that's all that matters.

220
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,250
The chairman is tired.

221
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,920
If it's not urgent, come back later.

222
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,230
Even if she is the CEO,

223
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,270
she can't just fire me like this.

224
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,800
Personnel decisions are
the CEO's prerogative.

225
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,310
So what are you then, Father?
A figurehead?

226
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,340
If you're just going to let that woman
do whatever she wants.

227
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,650
This right here is why you were fired.

228
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,550
If you were going to do this,
why did you call me back from the States?

229
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,350
You should have just let me stay there
with the man I love.

230
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,250
Believe me,
I regret it more than you know.

231
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,760
I never knew you could sink this low.

232
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,230
Dumping your own father in a nursing home,
playing tricks on someone with allergies,

233
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,670
getting so jealous when someone succeeds
that you try to sabotage a deal,

234
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,130
and to top it all off, you even locked
a person in the supply room.

235
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,570
Was that really so wrong?

236
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,410
Have you lived your entire life
without making a single mistake, Father?

237
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,440
You've never sinned?

238
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,010
I was just trying to do well.
I can't control the outcome!

239
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,780
Can't we just put it behind us?

240
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,810
What's the point of keeping score
between a father and daughter?

241
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,360
I'll do better.

242
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,160
If you just give me my job back,

243
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,900
I'll work hard to make
Mingang Distribution number one in Korea,

244
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,330
no, the number one distribution company
in the world.

245
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,170
So please, let's just go back
to how things were.

246
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,340
Please, Father?

247
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,510
Let's go back to how it was...

248
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,980
before that woman ever came
into our company,

249
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,310
and before she ever set foot in our home.

250
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,380
It's far too late for that.

251
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,490
Father.

252
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
What are you doing?

253
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,970
I'd rather die than be kicked out
of the company.

254
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,440
- What?
- Kill me.

255
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,870
Taking Mingang from me
is a death sentence.

256
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,140
You've completely lost your mind.

257
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,650
It would be an honor to die at your hands.

258
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,680
Since you're Mingang's great founder,
the titan of distribution in Korea.

259
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,420
Are you really going to act like this?

260
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,220
Why?

261
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,690
Can't bring yourself to do it?

262
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,220
I guess not. I'm your daughter, after all.

263
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,760
Then you have to let me live.

264
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,630
You can't just take Mingang away from me!
It's my whole life!

265
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,700
What are you all doing?
Get this thing out of here.

266
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,700
Either give me back the CEO position,
or kill me right here, right now.

267
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,310
- This girl has lost it.
- Kyung Chae.

268
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,810
- Ms. Kyung Chae!
- I said, kill me already!

269
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,110
Kill me!

270
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,090
Let go!

271
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,860
How can you say something so morbid?
Asking your own father to kill you.

272
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,300
He's right, Kyung Chae.
I know you're angry,

273
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,530
but you shouldn't say things
like that to your father.

274
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,900
(Mingang Distribution)

275
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,920
Min Kyung Chae can't get through a day
without her sedatives.

276
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,230
She's always crying, screaming,
and throwing fits.

277
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,960
Why are you telling me this now?

278
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,030
As a wake-up call.

279
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,470
That lifeline you're clinging to
is about to snap.

280
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,470
So what? You want me to come crawling
to you for help?

281
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,740
Go on. Try me.

282
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,780
Then I'll decide if you're worth saving.

283
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,380
It's better to swallow
your pride a little...

284
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,590
than be an outcast with no support,
passed over for promotions,

285
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,190
and then thrown out.

286
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,660
Wouldn't that be such a tragedy?

287
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,690
Play your cards right.

288
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,800
Your entire career is in my hands.

289
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,770
You don't want to end up
like Min Kyung Chae.

290
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,830
She took a sedative and just fell asleep.

291
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,300
I've never seen Kyung Chae like this.

292
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,150
I was so shaken up
that I didn't even get to the market.

293
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,480
We'll just have to make do
with what's in the house today.

294
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,890
Just put the side dishes back
in the fridge after you eat.

295
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,430
Nobody remembers my birthday.

296
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,470
(The late Baek Mi So)

297
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,380
You shouldn't have.

298
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,160
Oh, please. Today is a special day.
It's Mi So's birthday!

299
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,360
When you were in the States,
I took care of it on my own,

300
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,330
but now our whole family
is finally together again.

301
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,900
It's Mi So's favorite.
Your Auntie's kimchi fried rice and soup.

302
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,540
Happy birthday, my dear Mi So. Eat up!

303
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,970
Looks like Mi So is...

304
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,710
getting the royal treatment
from her Aunt Yeon Ah.

305
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,980
Come on. It's a happy day.
Don't upset Mi So.

306
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,220
Yeon Ah.

307
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,460
I'm the new CEO.

308
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
What?

309
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,960
For real?

310
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,530
You're the CEO of Mingang Distribution?

311
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,170
So you're really the CEO
of that enemy of a company?

312
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,600
Then you can finally get justice
for Mi So.

313
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,070
Now that company...

314
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,510
won't be able to just throw
its weight around anymore.

315
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,440
As long as I'm the CEO,

316
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,910
I will never let it trample
on the powerless.

317
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,090
I'll see you at the office.

318
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,790
Are you okay?

319
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,960
I have to be.

320
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,860
I have an appointment. I'll be back soon.

321
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,370
Don't you even know what today is?

322
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,970
What's today?

323
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,240
You know what? Nevermind.

324
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,980
You know what I'm going through.

325
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,380
I don't have the energy
to deal with you right now,

326
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,580
so just stay out of trouble.

327
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,690
She's acting like she owns the place,
walking all over everyone at work.

328
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,030
It's the same way at home.

329
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,030
Are you just going to stand by and watch?

330
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,170
You think I'm putting up with this
because I want to?

331
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,000
Isn't this when you should
be doing something, Lawyer Kim?

332
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,210
With you gone,
I'm not powerful enough on my own.

333
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,780
Even the Board has turned its back on me.

334
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,940
Then you might as well go talk
to Soo Jung.

335
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,450
She's no fan of Lucia either.

336
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,680
You think she'll just take our side,
even as the director?

337
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,820
She'd have to risk getting
on the chairman's bad side.

338
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,620
So you're saying
there's no way out of this?

339
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,160
Not necessarily.

340
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,330
As long as we have the chairman's will,
we still have a chance.

341
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,290
Because the chairman's will
clearly states...

342
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,530
that in an emergency,
you are named as the acting Chairman.

343
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,900
The way things are now,

344
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,840
I doubt I'll ever get to be
the acting Chairman.

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,670
As long as the will isn't changed,
you'll have an opportunity.

346
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,640
Then you can step
into the Chairman's role...

347
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,940
and set everything right.

348
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,720
Why are all the stocks
in the distribution industry...

349
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,190
tanking like this?

350
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,890
Mingang is holding up,
but something about it seems fishy.

351
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,130
Does staring at those darn stocks all day
put food on the table?

352
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,230
What rock have you been living under?
It puts food on the table, and then some.

353
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,400
It can even get us a car.

354
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,300
Have you ever heard
of a stock market tycoon?

355
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,400
No, I'm saying the CEO was replaced,

356
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,140
so Mingang will manage to get by somehow.

357
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,140
But we're the ones in serious trouble.

358
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,080
Now that Lucia's the CEO,

359
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,010
our Ja Kyung's in-law troubles
are going to get even worse.

360
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,450
You've got a point.
I wonder how Ji Seop is doing with her.

361
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,820
I think I'll go pay him a visit
and see for myself.

362
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,360
Blood is thicker than water.
Why worry about him before your daughter?

363
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,360
My lovely wife.
You know Ji Seop isn't the brightest bulb.

364
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,630
He's lacking.

365
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,800
He's a big guy,
but he's got nothing between the ears.

366
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,200
Right.

367
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,400
I'm home.

368
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,310
Speak of the devil.
Tae Kyung, the man of the hour.

369
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,140
So, how are things at the company?

370
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
The company?

371
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,010
The new CEO.

372
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,520
He's been here,
worried about that all day.

373
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,420
Our new CEO is doing great.

374
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,920
She just landed a deal
with the Doil Department Store...

375
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,320
to have our products on their shelves.

376
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,230
Doil Department Store?
One of the top three department stores?

377
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,100
Does that mean Mingang's stock
is going to skyrocket?

378
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,100
It's not official yet,

379
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,100
but the price should go up soon.

380
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,770
See? I told you! It buys us new cars.

381
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,270
If I make a killing this time,

382
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,780
I'm going to buy that luxury supercar.

383
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,350
You're just getting home?

384
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,570
Are you mad at me or something?

385
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,670
Did I do something wrong?

386
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,510
"Something you did wrong?"

387
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,140
As if I could ever forget
what you did to my Mi So.

388
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,250
No, it's nothing.

389
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,280
I told you I wasn't the one
who sent that text.

390
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,150
You don't believe me, do you?

391
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,050
I believe you, so just leave.

392
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,320
- I'm tired.
- Mom!

393
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,420
That word, "Mom."

394
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,000
Just for today,
can you please not call me that?

395
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,370
Why are you being like this?

396
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,770
It was my birthday today,
but no one remembered.

397
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,100
I'm not that happy either.

398
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,480
Today's your birthday?

399
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,280
You had no idea, did you?

400
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,610
Figures.

401
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,980
Who would remember a birthday
for someone like me?

402
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,230
What's with you?

403
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,960
It's nothing.

404
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,870
You're not going to tell me what's wrong?

405
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,980
You didn't know it was my birthday
today either, did you?

406
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,140
Your birthday?

407
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,680
I swear I remembered it
just a few days ago.

408
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,850
What do you want for a present?

409
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,450
I wonder if any cake shops are still open.

410
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,290
I'm not a kid asking for things like that.

411
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,160
It just hurts
that everyone in the family forgot.

412
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,590
And what about Lucia?

413
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,500
That stepmother you adore so much
didn't bother?

414
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,270
See?

415
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,570
I told you you mean nothing to that woman.

416
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,710
No matter what that woman says or does,
I told you not to fall for her, didn't I?

417
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,780
How can she and Mi So share a birthday?

418
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,290
What kind of fate connects these two?

419
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,760
I guess no one celebrated her birthday.

420
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,400
Listen carefully.

421
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,140
Just because I got fired
doesn't mean this is over.

422
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,310
The company will be mine in the end.

423
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,110
What are you talking about?

424
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,910
If Father can no longer act as chairman,
I'm supposed to take his place.

425
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:20,050
That's what's in the will
that Father wrote with his own two hands.

426
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,690
Do you think Father is going
to live forever?

427
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,060
Once I become the chairman,
that woman will lose her position anyway,

428
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,630
and she'll be kicked out of this house
without a penny.

429
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,170
As long as the will isn't changed,

430
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,030
Mingang, this house, and even you...

431
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,940
will all be mine.

432
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,980
Acting chairman?

433
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,380
Min Kyung Chae.

434
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,990
So that was your ace
in the hole all along.

435
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,170
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

436
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,720
Once she takes over as acting chairman,
it's all over.

437
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,920
There are only two ways
to stop Min Kyung Chae.

438
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,090
She thinks if I'm gone, Mingang is hers?

439
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,590
So that’s what she's thinking.

440
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,660
Do you want to see me go down like this?

441
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,770
If I go down, so do you, Kim Sun Jae.

442
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,070
There is one way,

443
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,270
but it'll be
my final, all-or-nothing move.

444
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,570
When is the right time to use this
to deal them a fatal blow?

445
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,340
I think it's time to make
some revisions to my will.

446
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,850
