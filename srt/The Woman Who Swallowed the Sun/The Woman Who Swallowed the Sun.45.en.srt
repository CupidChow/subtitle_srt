1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,570
What were you doing...

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,110
(Episode 45)

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,950
It's beautiful.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,020
- Is it?
- Yes.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,550
I'm pleased that you think so.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,450
You have good taste.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,890
I think I still have it, don't I?

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,130
- I wasn't sure what color...
- What's this now?

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,230
- would suit you.
- Was he jealous?

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,600
It suits you perfectly.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,000
I forgot about Moon Tae Kyung.

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,070
I've never picked one out.

13
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,300
Do you like the color? It suits you.

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,300
Yes.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,480
When did those two get so close?

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,790
I look forward to seeing
the signed contract next week.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,020
Why would you?

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,220
I trust in you.

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,690
Not from the start, but still.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,060
I never did anything well, to be honest.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,300
It's scaring me
how you suddenly became so supportive.

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,770
Don't say that.

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,800
As you said,
I'm not our father's only child.

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,410
I took advantage of everything,

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,940
and I think we should share more evenly.

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,410
Do you mean that?

27
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,280
It is true that you never got
a decent opportunity.

28
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,020
If you bring me the deal,

29
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,420
I'll make you a director.

30
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,490
What about Moon Tae Kyung, then?

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,020
The team doesn't need two directors.

32
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,790
That's for me to take care of.

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,730
Honey. I think I just saw a ghost.

34
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,900
What happened this time?

35
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,210
It's Kyung Chae. She ate something bad
or didn't eat what she should've.

36
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,640
She got weird.

37
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,810
She wished me luck with the promotion.

38
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,150
She'll make me a director
if I bring the signed deal.

39
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,420
What? Is that true?

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,980
Did she really say that?

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,020
See?

42
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,660
She said that because it looked like
you'd get the deal.

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,360
You need to
forge the contract if you must...

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,190
and bring it to her.

45
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,600
Can you approve the payments
to our chain store suppliers?

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,170
Help out with the upcoming regular sale.

47
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,240
That's not my business.

48
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,980
You're under the same company.
You should help each other.

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,810
Don't you know what Kyung Chae is like?

50
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,150
She'll throw a fit
if I try to do anything.

51
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,150
You should dye your hair.

52
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,790
Salt-and-pepper hair has its charm,

53
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,390
but younger women
prefer men who look more their age.

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,790
Why should I appeal to younger women?

55
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,330
What if I were talking about Lucia?

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,900
Take her out to eat.

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,600
You did too little for her,
considering she saved you and Se Ri.

58
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,870
It makes you look bad.

59
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,710
When did you prepare this?

60
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,280
Kyung Chae can't stand the woman.

61
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,780
That's her problem.

62
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,050
Why can't she recognize a good person?

63
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,580
Do you think she's a good person?

64
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,720
Must you even ask?

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,390
You're a better judge of character
than your sister.

66
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,560
You should tell her how you feel
before someone steals her away.

67
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,430
What does that mean?

68
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,290
You don't know?

69
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,730
She's pretty close to Director Moon.

70
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,870
Everyone is talking about
how good they look together.

71
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,940
What if they become official
before you get a chance?

72
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,250
Shouldn't we start spreading the word...

73
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,010
now that we have the CEO's orders?

74
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,980
Yes, like put a banner
on the site saying...

75
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,550
we have exclusive rights
to Helena Louise products.

76
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,750
We need pop-up ads...

77
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,290
and related events too.

78
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,130
Let's do it.

79
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,100
Why wait when the CEO gave the order?

80
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,670
Put up a notice
saying we'll take pre-orders.

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,800
Are you sure about this?

82
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,840
You're asking me?

83
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,840
Why wouldn't I be sure about it?

84
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,280
Do you think I won't get the deal signed?

85
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,880
It's just that it's not good
to get things going too soon.

86
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,210
Perhaps we could wait
until the deal is actually signed?

87
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,820
It's the same thing.

88
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,590
You say that because you don't think
I can get the deal.

89
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,190
I have the CEO's full support.

90
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,890
Who are you to doubt me?

91
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,390
That's not what she's saying.

92
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,960
If we didn't trust you,

93
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,860
we wouldn't have put you in charge at all.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,430
Don't say that's not what she said.

95
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,970
Anyone can tell that's what she said.

96
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,640
Ms. Lucia was the one
who asked me to give you a chance.

97
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,410
We'll start to take pre-orders,
so don't worry about that.

98
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,810
Do your thing.

99
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,320
I said we're late.
What's taking her so long?

100
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,120
I'll leave in three seconds.

101
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,820
One, two, bye.

102
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,420
I'm coming!

103
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,190
You're so impatient.

104
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,160
Women take longer to get ready.

105
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,430
It's the makeup and everything.

106
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,430
Drawing a few stripes
won't make you prettier.

107
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,360
You're still a cucumber, not a melon.

108
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,970
We're late for the consultation.
Let's bow and leave.

109
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,370
See you later.

110
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,510
If I'm a cucumber, you're a squashed cake.

111
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,510
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

112
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,580
(Various special black goat dishes)

113
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,450
You did all the explaining,

114
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,880
and it's down to me to decide.

115
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,280
That's right. Discuss with your family...

116
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,950
and call when you've made up your mind.

117
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,390
Are you trying to sell
air conditioning units in the Antarctic?

118
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,960
I don't need to discuss with anyone.

119
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,520
I do what I want.

120
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,930
Let's do it.

121
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,000
You made the right call.

122
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,900
There are lots of people like you
who care about what they eat.

123
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,240
That's right.
One's health is most important.

124
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,440
Yes.

125
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,910
Our food is available year-round,

126
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,610
so there's no peak or off-season.

127
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,510
You'll see that for yourself.

128
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,750
When I was younger, the elderly
ate goat soup when they felt weak.

129
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,410
Didn't the royals eat it?

130
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,280
That's common knowledge.

131
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,820
Kings ate this?

132
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,590
That's why I loved it.

133
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,890
Back in the day,
women ate it more than men.

134
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,790
No wonder.

135
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,260
I think my skin turned brighter
since I started eating your soup.

136
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,570
Your skin?

137
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,940
I hope there will be
a change for the better soon.

138
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,840
Let's make the call, Queen.

139
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,010
If I open a chain,
I'll make money and become healthy.

140
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,080
It's time to buy a bill counter.

141
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,480
Hello.

142
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,850
Here you go.

143
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,020
Kim Sun Jae will visit regularly.

144
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,460
He handles Min Doo Sik's slush fund
and window-dressed ledgers.

145
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,100
What is all that?

146
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,700
It's Min Doo Sik's weakness.

147
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,340
Do you mean...

148
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,540
we can teach them all a lesson
if we have that?

149
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,640
- Yes.
- That's great.

150
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,740
I'll look around
whenever I make a delivery,

151
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,780
figure out when the lawyer visits,

152
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,180
and steal the ledger.

153
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,380
He knows you, so you need to be careful.

154
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,250
Don't worry. I can do an awesome job.

155
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,590
I'll do it...

156
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,290
to make sure they pay...

157
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,390
for what they did to Mi So.

158
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,430
- Yeon Ah?
- Yes?

159
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,070
I'd like a cup of coffee.

160
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,800
What's the occasion?

161
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,840
Your coffee is the best in the world.

162
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,950
It's not at all about me.
We have a good machine.

163
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,220
That Mr. Kim I saw last time. The lawyer.

164
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,890
He must visit often.

165
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,760
I wouldn't say often. Sometimes?

166
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,830
Last time, it looked like
he'd come on urgent business.

167
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,830
When will he visit next?

168
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,770
Why do you suddenly care so much
about our family?

169
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,340
It's not that I suddenly care.

170
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,380
I was wondering
how great of a guy he must be...

171
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,680
to be a lawyer.

172
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,280
He's a cousin from my mom's family.

173
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,750
Oh, is he really?

174
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,250
I'm not sure
if you'll understand what I mean,

175
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,820
but he comes by regularly
for the chairman's approval on something.

176
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,020
It's a ledger.

177
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,720
Ms. Ja Kyung.

178
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,560
Who cares? She won't know what I mean.

179
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,360
The last Saturday of the month.
It's the day you drop off your specials.

180
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,970
Fancy palace food
or invigorating delicacies.

181
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,440
He loves that kind of food.

182
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,610
Oh, I see...

183
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,010
The last Saturday of the month.

184
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,710
Why would you take note of that?

185
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,250
So I can make sure
the food tastes extra good.

186
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,290
Hey. How did it go?

187
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,330
The lawyer visits the chairman's home
on the last Saturday of the month.

188
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Does he?

189
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,530
He brings a ledger
for the chairman to check.

190
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,130
It could be
the secret ledger you mentioned.

191
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,470
I think so too.

192
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,570
He'll visit this month too, then.

193
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,970
Leave it to me.

194
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,580
I'll do whatever it takes
to steal the ledger.

195
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,510
Yeon Ah. Don't do anything too dangerous.

196
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,710
We don't want you
to be threatened like last time.

197
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,850
Okay? Be careful.

198
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,390
What was that call about
that you took it in secret?

199
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,530
You don't fear me anymore?

200
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,430
I never feared you.

201
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,730
You were always pathetic.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,970
You must have a staunch backer.

203
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,870
You should fear something, considering...

204
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,140
you're using an alias on enemy territory.

205
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,280
You fear nothing
if you have nothing to lose.

206
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,250
People like you
who have too much tremble in fear.

207
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,850
You have nothing to lose?

208
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,150
What about your life?

209
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,560
Take it from me if you can.

210
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,790
I have a feeling
you'll crumble before you do.

211
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,260
Do you actually think
Ji Seop can get the deal?

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,400
- He can't?
- We both know...

213
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,340
what a bumbling idiot he is.

214
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,710
At least he doesn't play dirty tricks.

215
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,340
Unlike you, you mean?

216
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,080
You think I don't know you and Tae Kyung
are using Ji Seop to do something?

217
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,450
Why would we do that?

218
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,850
Our team will suffer
if the vice director were to mess up.

219
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,350
Would we do something that stupid?

220
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,250
That is what's bothering me.

221
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,560
You're going too far,
even considering you know Stella Jang.

222
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,030
I called the US and confirmed...

223
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,390
that Helena Louise won't sign
an exclusive deal with Korea,

224
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,760
but I don't know what your actual plan is.

225
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,330
Go and study and think.

226
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,270
You're good at that.

227
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
If he said that to your face,

228
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,880
it means he doesn't know
how things will go.

229
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,650
That goes for us too.

230
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,150
I don't know what made them
agree to back the vice director.

231
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,920
Moon Tae Kyung said...

232
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,060
Min Kyung Chae stands to gain something
if this goes wrong.

233
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,800
It would be a personal gain worth risking
harming the company's image...

234
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,730
and losing business profits.

235
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,330
Right.

236
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,540
A company's downtrodden image
will improve if you spend millions...

237
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,970
and wait long enough,

238
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,970
and lost profits
can be made up in other ways.

239
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,480
I think it involves the company shares.

240
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Yes. You have a point.

241
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,490
Director Moon Tae Kyung.

242
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,890
What about him?

243
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
His parents' deaths.

244
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,360
He blames Chairman Min for it.

245
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,360
How many crimes did that man commit?

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,430
I feel so sorry for him.

247
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,700
He lost both parents at the same time.

248
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,470
Min Doo Sik made so many people miserable.

249
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,380
Both you and Moon Tae Kyung
could've led happy lives.

250
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,250
Hello, Director.

251
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,290
They feel each other's pain.

252
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,260
Was it wrong for me to call so late?

253
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,100
It's not too late. What's up?

254
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,840
I just wanted to hear your voice.

255
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,640
We only talk about work in the office.

256
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,740
We never discussed any private stuff.

257
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,380
"Private stuff?"

258
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,410
Like what?

259
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,880
Private stuff...

260
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,350
What did you have for dinner?

261
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,090
Who are you with now?

262
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,990
What?

263
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,060
Are you resting?

264
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,730
Do you have plans for tomorrow?

265
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,000
Why do you suddenly have
so many questions?

266
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,940
It's not sudden. I'd always wanted to ask.

267
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
I mean...

268
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,210
from the start.

269
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,910
Why won't you react? It's embarrassing.

270
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,490
I was curious from the start.

271
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,120
I wanted to know everything.

272
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,590
Why would you want to know...

273
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,900
about someone like me?

274
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,800
Don't say that about yourself.

275
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,400
Excessive humility can be rude, you know.

276
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,140
I'm not someone
you should be curious about.

277
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,510
Or rather, even if you were curious,

278
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,910
I can't tell you anything.

279
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,650
The line is busy.

280
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,850
Connecting to voicemail after the beep.

281
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,790
Who is she on the phone with?

282
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,460
Is it him?

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,430
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

284
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,000
The line is busy.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,010
Connecting to voicemail after the beep.

286
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,510
You will be charged.

287
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,210
What if I were talking about Lucia?

288
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,080
You should tell her how you feel
before someone steals her away.

289
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,620
You don't know?

290
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,350
She's pretty close to Director Moon.

291
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,990
Everyone is talking about
how good they look together.

292
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,960
What if they become official
before you get a chance?

293
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,200
Cash... Money...

294
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,610
Cash... Money...

295
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,310
Cash... Money...

296
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,840
Nothing is out of place
or was tampered with, right?

297
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,010
How many times do you need to check?

298
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,080
Goodness...

299
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,620
You can't treat people
like they're thieves.

300
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,390
Why would the tenant
come in here to steal from you?

301
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,390
Frogs can drown
while attempting artistic swimming.

302
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,230
How are we to know what he did
while we were out?

303
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,800
How can you say that about him?

304
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,370
He's the poster child
of morals and ethics.

305
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,000
To be honest,
you look more like a thief than he does.

306
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,240
What?

307
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,940
I'd rather hear of a shrimp
that threw out its back while mating.

308
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,310
I have two strengths.
My money and my looks.

309
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,320
Who would be crazy enough...

310
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,550
to come in here when there's a camera?

311
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,020
- Enough with the nonsense and get out.
- My gosh.

312
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,820
Fine. I'm leaving.

313
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,440
Will you ever hear of another landlord
who left the house...

314
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,270
so the tenant could host
a rite for his dead parents?

315
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,050
I'm sorry, sir.
I should've thanked you sooner.

316
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,750
Don't be like that.

317
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,780
How unfortunate is it that he lost
both parents at the same time?

318
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,120
It's not common.

319
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,820
Didn't Doeun Industries'
CEO Han and his wife...

320
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,290
die at the same time too?

321
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,120
How many times must I say so?

322
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,460
I think I heard they had a son too.

323
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,560
When they died, you swore...

324
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,170
you'd find the son
and make him pay you back.

325
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,570
I never did find him because he got away.

326
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,610
I wonder what happened to him.

327
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,940
He'd have died long ago.

328
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,250
No one lives a full life
unless they pay me back.

329
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,910
They all die at least ten years sooner.

330
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,830
Why would you come in here?

331
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,830
I just...

332
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,330
You're not drinking already, are you?

333
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,370
I'm old enough to, you know.

334
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,310
Meet up with Lucia this weekend.

335
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,570
Watch a movie
or go to a classical concert.

336
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
Dad. I said I'd do as you said
to get back at Kyung Chae...

337
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,650
I know. Meet with her anyway.

338
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,480
It won't hurt to get to know her.

339
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,920
She saved your life.

340
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,850
Pay her, then.

341
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,090
How dare you...

342
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,490
You need to meet people who aren't family
and get used to talking to them.

343
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,730
I'd rather see a psychiatrist.

344
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,200
Why do you expect help
from people who want our money?

345
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,970
They use fancy words
to turn normal people into patients.

346
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,470
She's no doctor.

347
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,140
Watch your language!

348
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,410
She's not my tutor.

349
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,510
Are you using me to get to her...

350
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,280
because you have feelings for her?

351
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,190
What's that reaction? You should say no.

352
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,120
Do you like her?

353
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,970
Take a seat.

354
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,680
Why did you ask to see me?

355
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,550
My youngest will call you this weekend.

356
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,520
I'm not sure if I'll be any good.

357
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,790
You will be.

358
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,790
You helped me. Why wouldn't you help her?

359
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,660
I didn't know you trusted me this much.

360
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,930
There's a lot you don't know.

361
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,860
How I feel. What I think.

362
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,100
You seem to be
pretty close with Director Moon.

363
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,440
We're on the same team.

364
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,570
Goodness.

365
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,210
Why wear something
that doesn't suit you at all?

366
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,510
It was a gift.

367
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,980
Who would call that a gift?

368
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,720
Why say that?
It's nice, and it means something.

369
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,920
How good can it be
when it's not a luxury brand?

370
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
Anyone can give meaning to something.

371
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,860
Don't give meaning to just any odd thing.

372
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,570
Why are you so angry?

373
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,800
I'm not angry. I'm in a great mood.

374
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,300
You're like a child.

375
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,570
Are you saying I'm not acting my age?

376
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,480
No. You're not like that.

377
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,410
Here.

378
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,550
What's this?

379
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,120
Director Min gave it to me
and told me to take you to dinner.

380
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,220
She acted like a dutiful child for once.

381
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,160
Hello.

382
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,030
Our server might crash.

383
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,070
Thanks to you,
we might make a record sale.

384
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,470
Already?

385
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,010
We haven't kicked off
any official promotions yet.

386
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,880
There's still time until the sale,
so we'll take pre-orders until then.

387
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,310
Once the sale starts,
we'll start shipping in order.

388
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,980
I think that schedule would work.

389
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,950
That's my team's business,
so you can stay out of it.

390
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,090
It's our company's business.

391
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,790
You're reacting too sensitively
to a few joyful comments.

392
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,230
What if I were to come to your office
and comment on your team's work?

393
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,400
Would you like that?

394
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,570
My team isn't doing so poorly...

395
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,500
that we'd need your feedback.

396
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,440
I'm a perfectionist.

397
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,240
Then go back to your office and work...

398
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,370
instead of butting into
my team's business.

399
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,070
Will you two stop it?

400
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,610
Why are you always arguing?

401
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,980
The deal is a given.

402
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,650
How much product can we get?

403
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,310
We need enough.

404
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,050
We don't want people
to resell their stock.

405
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,220
Lawyer Kim!

406
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,250
It's just a bit of advice.

407
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,990
Your team will sink
if this doesn't work out,

408
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,630
and I'm concerned for you.

409
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,460
We won't know who will sink
until we go to the very end.

410
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,130
Some things become clear
without having to go all the way.

411
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,370
Oh, gosh.

412
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,110
Will you please stop it?

413
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,310
I'll get the deal signed.

414
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,040
Don't fight about it anymore.

415
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,580
Will you really meet up
with my sister this weekend?

416
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,480
I have no reason to disobey the chairman.

417
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,250
Why would you meet with her?

418
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,620
What could you talk about?

419
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,190
I might have a lot to tell her
as a mother figure.

420
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,360
I told you to stop
inserting yourself as her mom.

421
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,230
You'd better not say
anything weird to her.

422
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,470
You're smiling?

423
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,040
You're not taking me seriously?

424
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,580
You're overreacting.

425
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,210
You could never care for a sister
as much as you would a daughter.

426
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,380
The chairman trusts me with her.

427
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,980
Who are you to object?

428
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,550
That's only because
my father thinks you're...

429
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,950
He thinks I'm what?

430
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,830
I'll let you see her
because I can't stop my father,

431
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,060
but if you do something to her,

432
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,700
you'll pay with your life.

433
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,670
Min Kyung Chae cares...

434
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,780
a dreadful lot about her sister.

435
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Yes.

436
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,780
If her sister meant that much to her,

437
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,180
she should've cared about your daughter.

438
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,170
This is where it begins.

439
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,770
You'd better pretend to die
if I tell you to.

440
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,840
That's what I'll make you do.

441
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,490
I'm only here because I wanted to
get back at my sister.

442
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,760
I'm not interested
in doing anything with you.

443
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,730
I know that.

444
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,170
I'm glad you know.

445
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,770
What could we possibly do anyway?

446
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,040
And I don't want to hear crap...

447
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,480
about a mom's heart, love, and care.

448
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,320
You think you can handle me
when neither my dad nor my sister can?

449
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,290
Not even a deity can stop me
once I decide to act out.

450
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,790
It looks like it.

451
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,290
I'll talk to Dad for you.

452
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,700
Let's never meet up again.

453
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,570
If this is it,

454
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,400
how about we have a drink?

455
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,850
(Convenience Store)

456
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,380
You're old enough, right?

457
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,830
Have a snack too.

458
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,610
What was that for?

459
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,220
Have another piece.

460
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,980
Why are you so anxious?

461
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,750
I don't know.

462
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,950
I feel strangely uneasy.

463
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,250
I'm sure Ms. Se Ri will be fine.

464
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,290
The chairman vouched for her.

465
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,090
It's Father who makes me anxious.

466
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,230
What do you mean by that?

467
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,400
It's a thing.

468
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,570
Do you have feelings for my dad?

469
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,870
Why do you want to know?

470
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,010
Don't fall for him.

471
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,380
I'll object like crazy
to the relationship.

472
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,380
Why do you dislike me?

473
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,850
Do you need a reason to dislike someone?

474
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,390
Did you think I'd be touched
because you saved my life?

475
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,830
We drank to commemorate our parting,
so let's never meet again.

476
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,330
And stay away from my dad.

477
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,070
Don't get to the old man.

478
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,610
Try as you might,
you'll never make him yours.

479
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,070
Who are you?

480
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,230
Shall we go somewhere to chat?

481
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,100
No.

482
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,070
Let me go!

483
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,480
Don't you touch me. Do you know who I am?

484
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,390
Take it all.

485
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,530
Someone, help!

486
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,360
Is anyone there?

487
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,030
Help me!

488
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,930
It's just us.

489
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,870
There's no point in screaming.

490
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,610
You can't leave this place.

491
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,320
Do you know why?

492
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,550
If you run, you'll get brought back.

493
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,220
If you run again,
you'll get brought back again.

494
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,360
Don't you dare touch her!

495
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,910
If you so much as touch a hair on her,
I will kill you.

496
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,440
Who do you think you are?

497
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,880
Me?

498
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,790
I'm her mom.

499
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,170
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

500
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,780
I won't know if you won't tell me!

501
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,020
What do you know?

502
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,620
You've lost all sense of reason!

503
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,890
Is that the police?

504
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,550
Even I think she's charming.

505
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,560
Why wouldn't Director Moon fall for her?

506
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,060
Are the two that close?

507
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,660
Here. The exclusive sales deal
for Helena Louise's products.

508
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,090
You actually got it signed?

509
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,200
You took my daughter, who was my life.

510
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,700
It's only fair if you lose yours too.

511
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,770
