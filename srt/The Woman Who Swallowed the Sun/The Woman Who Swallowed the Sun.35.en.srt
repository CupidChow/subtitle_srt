1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,340
Don't just stand there. Leave.

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,840
(Episode 35)

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,580
Didn't you hear me?

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,550
Don't come here again.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,430
Why the sudden change?

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,930
You resent me for breaking you up
with your lover 20 years ago.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,100
I'd do the same
if we were in that situation again.

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,630
You could never be with that fool.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,200
Ji Seop is half the man he should be,

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,510
and I still believe
you should succeed me and not him.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,710
Let's make something clear.

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,340
You chose to leave him
and work at Mingang.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,080
You gave up on love
to chase your ambition. Am I wrong?

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,990
What you did for Mingang 20 years ago.

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,690
I just did the same.

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,490
You and I. We're even now.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,760
Don't resent me anymore.

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,960
You're really something.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,400
Fine.

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,330
I won't mention him again.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,540
You shouldn't mention her either.

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,540
I always keep my word.

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,010
"Take this and stay away?"

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,050
Let's see how much is in here.

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,020
My gosh.

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,590
Was Min Doo Sik this cheap?

27
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,630
He chose that amount on purpose
to make a clean break.

28
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,130
I thought you had him in your grasp.

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,400
I don't know what's going on.

30
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,240
I'm pretty sure Min Kyung Chae
did something to get between us.

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,670
And he cut you off like this?

32
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,740
Min Doo Sik really is decisive.

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,510
What now?

34
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,450
There's nothing I can do
if the chairman won't cooperate.

35
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,150
Right. I never considered
there would be this kind of variable.

36
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,190
I can't say what it is, but I bet...

37
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,830
they made a deal about you.

38
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,030
They're father and daughter,
and they're exactly alike.

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,740
You and I. We're even now.

40
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,110
Don't resent me anymore.

41
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,150
He's direct and calculative
with his own children too.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,560
Pour me one too.

43
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,840
Why did Father want to see you?

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,840
He didn't say much.

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,410
He called you to the hospital
at that hour for nothing?

46
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,010
That makes no sense.

47
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,580
Do you two have a secret or something?

48
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,780
If you push me,
Soo Jung, and Se Ri aside...

49
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,990
and make a deal with Father
and take the inheritance and Mingang too,

50
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,660
I won't see you ever again.

51
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,520
Is money the only thing you care about?

52
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,500
What a brat.

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,170
The materialistic one
is pretending she's different.

54
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,800
What else would we talk about now?

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,160
Take that.

56
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,160
Thank you for saving my life.

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,560
I called you to give you that.
You can go now.

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,200
Don't just stand there. Leave.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,270
Didn't you hear me? Don't come here again.

60
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,890
(Mingang Distribution)

61
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,210
Now you know what the chairman wants,

62
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,840
you must know how to act too.

63
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,680
"What the chairman wants?"

64
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,650
You don't know...

65
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,880
what the money meant?

66
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,920
He gave me exactly 5,000 dollars.

67
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,120
The chairman's life
must be worth more than that.

68
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,290
He must have another idea.

69
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,730
You're talking back at me so calmly...

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,160
after the humiliation you suffered?

71
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,200
When the chairman does something,
there must be a good enough reason.

72
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,070
What do you trust in
that makes you so brave?

73
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,510
I trust in...

74
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,710
sincerity.

75
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,110
The chairman didn't mean it yesterday.

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,310
Wasn't that obvious?

77
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,880
That's not...

78
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,650
the kind of man
you think your father is, is it?

79
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,090
Is he so dishonorable and crass
that he'd give someone...

80
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,260
some chump change to get rid of them
when he owes them a great deal?

81
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,360
You speak as if you know him well.

82
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,660
You don't need to
know someone for long to get them.

83
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,200
Here's some advice.

84
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,500
My father is calculative and direct.

85
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,510
Once he makes a transaction, it's over.

86
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,110
Your business with him is done,
so wake up from your pipe dream.

87
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,810
You seem to have
wanted to become his lover.

88
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,410
"The chairman's lover."

89
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,190
I never considered that option,
but should I have?

90
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,920
It's not over...

91
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,590
just because one person does the math
and announces it's over.

92
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,300
There's no room for money...

93
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,070
when emotions are involved.

94
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,110
I'll take the stairs.

95
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,410
It's a great morning workout.

96
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,590
Who says it's over?

97
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,730
You might have started it,
but I decide when it ends.

98
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,100
I'll never stop until you all pay...

99
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,670
for what you did to Mi So
and suffer just as much.

100
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,180
Do you ever get any work done?

101
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,420
Why bother when Father is not here?

102
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,850
It's okay to slack off
when the chairman is away.

103
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,760
It's a relief
that no other employees are like you.

104
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,020
I have a tough time
at work myself, you know.

105
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,530
I'm the odd one out.

106
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,960
The director and Lucia stop talking
whenever I come in when they're chatting.

107
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,530
The same goes for Sun Jae
and Kyung Chae too.

108
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,270
Kyung Chae?

109
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,170
Father called her to the hospital,
and I poked and prodded her,

110
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,040
but she won't say what he said.

111
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,280
It must've been a secret powwow.

112
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,950
Who's to say something bad
won't happen to Father?

113
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,680
Why would something bad happen to him?

114
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,680
I talked to Doctor Kim,
and he said Father was fine right now,

115
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,920
but surgery aftereffects
could surface at any time.

116
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,120
Maybe he told Kyung Chae something
so they'd be prepared.

117
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,430
How am I to know when she won't say?

(Mingang Distribution)

119
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,330
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

120
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,240
Welcome. I was surprised to hear from you.

121
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Take a seat.

122
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,070
A surprise visit is always more enjoyable.

123
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,910
By the way.

124
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,980
I heard about the chairman.
Is he all right now?

125
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,480
How did you hear?

126
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,550
It's a well-kept secret.

127
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,250
Oh, yes.

128
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,920
You have a hotline in my company.

129
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,020
I sense a hint of sarcasm.

130
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,390
Lucia said something out of concern.

131
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,060
Wait.

132
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,200
Lucia is the one who found him
and got him help within the golden hour?

133
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,430
It so happens, yes.

134
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,700
Why would you speak like that
about your father's savior?

135
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,410
I guess I had some foresight.

136
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,910
If I hadn't told you to hire Lucia,

137
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,550
the chairman might not be alive now.

138
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,980
I'd like to know
what your relationship with her is like.

139
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,680
Didn't I tell you?

140
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,090
We're acquaintances.
Why do you keep asking?

141
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,390
Oh, good.

142
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,520
I was worried you'd be close.

143
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,360
Why?

144
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,860
Is there a reason we shouldn't be?

145
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,100
I'd feel bad if you were close...

146
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,160
and Lucia had to leave the company...

147
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,170
or transfer to a regional post.

148
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,340
You sneaky wench.

149
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,910
You want to manipulate her as you see fit.

150
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,280
You never know what might happen.

151
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,040
That's not right.

152
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,750
Human relationships mean a lot,

153
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,280
and just because you're the CEO
doesn't mean you can do what you want.

154
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,190
Don't you remember
grasping at straws to get funding?

155
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,320
I put you through to the Macau fund
for Lucia's sake.

156
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,830
It's pretty low to change your tune now,
as if you have the upper hand.

157
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,900
Eat up. You skipped breakfast.

158
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,440
Have you ever made gimbap?

159
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,010
Do you want gimbap?

160
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,550
Making it is a lot of work.

161
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,980
When you cook something that takes work,

162
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,620
you can't do it without love, right?

163
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,620
You must really want some gimbap.

164
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,290
Shall I order some for you?

165
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,020
No, I don't want gimbap
that you can get delivered.

166
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,890
I want something a mom made.

167
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,290
That has more meaning.

168
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,870
How would you feel
if I were to find my mom?

169
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,570
Why do you ask?

170
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,710
Did you hear anything from someone?

171
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,910
Who would I hear from and how?
It was a hypothetical question.

172
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,410
Where's Ja Kyung?

173
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,510
She went to her parents'.

174
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,620
Her mother invited her to dinner.

175
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,250
See? That's what moms do.

176
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,590
The side dish girl told me...

177
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,560
the chairman had brain surgery.

178
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,360
It bothered me a bit to hear
it was the brain of all places.

179
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,130
It sounds scary, but it wasn't serious.

180
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,830
I thought of visiting him,

181
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,570
but he considers me a rival
when it comes to our looks and riches.

182
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,240
Don't be silly. You're no rival.

183
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,410
Does it make you feel good to say so?

184
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,180
The chairman dislikes your dad
because your dad isn't as smart.

185
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,180
"Despicable" is the word.

186
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,680
You sound like a chipmunk
vomiting with motion sickness.

187
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,850
He dislikes you much more than he does me.

188
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,590
You're more like a next-door neighbor
than a rich man's wife.

189
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,020
Who moved into my old room?

190
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,030
Did you do a thorough background check?

191
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,230
You're just like your dad.

192
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
Don't worry.

193
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,000
He's an ordinary salad man
who has an office job.

194
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,870
"Salad man?" Does he work at a bakery?

195
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,970
It's "salaried man."

196
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,670
Your mom's brain is way too pure.

197
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,570
The wrinkles went to her face.

198
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,140
Her face is creased
while her brain is smooth.

199
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,610
How smart do you think you are?

200
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,150
We're just as ignorant
as each other, you know.

201
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,390
You finished elementary school,
and I went to night-time high school.

202
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,650
There's a six-year difference.

203
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,160
I told you not to mention that!

204
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,590
Do you know what an equation is?

205
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,360
"X equals Y."
That's news to you, isn't it?

206
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,530
Darn you.

207
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,760
It looks like Stella Jang
knows everything.

208
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,730
I think the two
are much closer than we thought.

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,770
I found it weird that I couldn't
find out anything about her.

210
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,310
Are you sure
the chairman broke it off with Lucia?

211
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,610
We have to trust him.

212
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,710
He keeps his word.

213
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,080
Whatever the chairman said,

214
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,180
Lucia is the problem.

215
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,750
She approached Father with a purpose,

216
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,620
and she happened to save his life too.

217
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,620
She must've thought she was in.

218
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,590
The chairman will keep his promise
for the time being,

219
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,560
but there's no guarantee what he'll do
if Lucia hangs around.

220
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,900
You're right.

221
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,570
She won him over once.
She can do it again.

222
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,340
Whether she wants to marry my father...

223
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,710
and become the lady of the house,

224
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,410
or she has another goal,

225
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,740
I doubt she'll give up now.

226
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,950
That means...

227
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,780
it would be best
to get her out of our sight.

228
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,320
Min Kyung Chae is tougher than we thought.

229
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,790
She's a fighter.

230
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,760
That's how she beat
her two siblings to become CEO.

231
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,500
The chairman distanced himself
from you pretty quickly and coldly.

232
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,670
I don't think
you can get back with him easily.

233
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,610
Kyung Chae will try to fire me
before I can do anything.

234
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,410
It's hard to fire employees these days,

235
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,310
especially when they did nothing wrong.

236
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,080
I'm worried about what will happen
to Director Moon too.

237
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,420
What about him?

238
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,250
I think we'll lose
our existing business partners.

239
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,160
There was talk that competitors
were stealing Mingang's partners.

240
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,760
I guess that was true.

241
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,790
Our partners signed with them
because they offered...

242
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,500
a better package with an added cash bonus.

243
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,670
That means Mingang
will want to hold someone responsible,

244
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,770
and that person will be Moon Tae Kyung.

245
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,420
If they summon the board
to discuss the failure...

246
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,520
to renew the contracts,
I won't be let off.

247
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,290
If I lose my position at Mingang now,

248
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,030
I can't get my revenge.

249
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,080
I can't steal
my father's papers from the safe.

250
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,090
Where is Jo Pil Doo hiding?

251
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,020
He's my only hope.

252
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,730
I worked so hard to build up my company.

253
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,970
I can't waver over a woman.

254
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,270
Lucia. It's not that I don't like you.

255
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,370
I must protect Mingang.

256
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,140
I can give up my life, but not my company.

257
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,500
Is Father never going to come home?

258
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,770
I wonder.
He must be sick of hospital food.

259
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,300
Wouldn't it be better to fill his seat
instead of leaving it open?

260
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,170
Do you want to fill it?

261
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,940
It's not that.

262
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,040
We shouldn't leave a seat empty.

263
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,510
That's true.

264
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,750
The whole family
gathers here to eat together,

265
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,920
and it feels weird to have an empty seat.

266
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,220
Exactly.

267
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,190
There should always be someone
at the head of the table.

268
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,390
Ji Seop, stop being so transparent.

269
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,030
You want to sit there.

270
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,090
Do you want to act like the adult
because Dad is away?

271
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,530
Hey, get your facts straight.

272
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,630
I don't want to act like an adult.
I am an adult.

273
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,670
Who else here can take Father's spot?

274
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,670
If anyone, it should be Kyung Chae.

275
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,910
You can't say things like that.

276
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,780
Kyung Chae is my superior at work,

277
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,410
but I'm the eldest son.

278
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,110
Instead of trying to take Father's seat,
try not to lose your own.

279
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Everyone is talking about how you never
do anything and you're never at your desk!

280
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,920
I didn't slack off that much.

281
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,160
I only go out a few times for some air.

282
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,170
Hello. Take a seat.

283
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,600
Why did you ask to see me?

284
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,570
To have a cup of tea.

285
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,640
I thought you and the chairman
would make some progress.

286
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,010
Dating is never easy, is it?

287
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,220
Did you think I didn't know?

288
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,320
I know everything Kyung Chae knows.

289
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,230
I don't know
what you're trying to get out of me,

290
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,130
but there's nothing
between the chairman and me.

291
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,430
What you fear might happen...

292
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,770
No. I'm the complete opposite.

293
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,100
I want you and my father to get closer.

294
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,440
The board could vote to replace...

295
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,810
Director Moon at the upcoming meeting.

296
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,310
I confirmed that our existing partners
signed a new deal with our competitors.

297
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,550
My source is pretty reliable.

298
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,350
I can't do anything myself,

299
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
but I have
quite a few allies on the board.

300
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,420
That means...

301
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,190
one word from me and they'll vote
against replacing Director Moon.

302
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,860
What do I have to do?

303
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,230
You're quick.

304
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,940
I see why Father likes you.

305
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,010
I'll prevent Director Moon
from being replaced.

306
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,550
You are to become my father's lover.

307
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,920
What do you stand...

308
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,690
to gain from that happening?

309
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,290
I don't ask for much.

310
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,130
All I want
is for you to get the chairman...

311
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,730
to drag my sister down
from her CEO position.

312
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,510
Director. I just heard something from...

313
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,610
I know.

314
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,850
I confirmed it with our partners.

315
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,910
They won't renew our deal,

316
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,120
and they'll send an official notice soon.

317
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,020
Which is why...

318
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,350
I have this.

319
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,530
That's a list of possible
new business partners.

320
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,300
They're small companies now,
but they'll work hard when given a chance.

321
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,170
Are they relative startups?

322
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Yes.

323
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,600
They have little capital
and almost no know-how.

324
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,940
They're not at all as big
as our old partners Miyeon or Woojin,

325
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,980
so they won't be as specialized,

326
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,350
and they most definitely
will make mistakes.

327
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,050
You'll have to shoulder
the extra responsibility, then.

328
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Yes,

329
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,590
since it's my job to manage them.

330
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,030
Send the signed partnership
renewal forms to my team by next week.

331
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,130
And Director Moon.

332
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,000
Shouldn't you
visit the chairman at least once?

333
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,540
Why? Did he ask to see me?

334
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,340
Does he have to ask for you?

335
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,470
Your chairman was admitted after surgery.
Shouldn't you pay him a visit?

336
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,010
You're a director at his company.

337
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,250
Don't just cover for your subordinates.

338
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,380
Look out for your superiors too.

339
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,950
Goodness...

340
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,630
My gosh.

341
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,230
If the chairman turns antagonistic,

342
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,730
Lucia will have a harder time there.

343
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,770
Should we change our plan, then?

344
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,210
We can't do that.
Not after how we got together.

345
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,350
If only Ho Se had left behind a child.

346
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,150
I'd look at them and find comfort.

347
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,920
You've been saying that
more often these days.

348
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,450
I have.

349
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,220
I find myself wanting what I can't have
when I see kids in the street.

350
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,660
I wonder how it would feel
to have a grandchild.

351
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,730
I'd be fine as long as
it weren't a dreadful kid like that Se Ri.

352
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,300
What has she been up to?

353
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,100
From what I saw a few days ago,
she's latched onto that woman.

354
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,240
The fake mom?

355
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,580
Se Ri.

356
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,650
What were you doing, darling?

357
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,920
Shall I make you more gimbap?

358
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,390
I had a lot last time.

359
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,430
That was then.

360
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,860
Tell me whenever you want more.

361
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,200
Mommy can do anything you want.

362
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,140
Then can you go to the US?

363
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,310
That's where I want to live.

364
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,770
America?

365
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,250
You don't even have to ask.

366
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,650
I'd love that.

367
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,820
Shall we go?

368
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,950
Do you mean that?

369
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,490
If I leave for the US this time,
I won't ever come back to Korea.

370
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,390
Are you okay with that?

371
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,530
Of course I am.

372
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,630
I just want to be with you.

373
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,570
By the way,

374
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,000
the thing I told you about last time.

375
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,770
Are you still thinking about it?

376
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,740
Leaving my shares with you?

377
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,080
Yes.

378
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,750
You can't trust anyone
as much as you can me.

379
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,390
I'll keep it safe for you,

380
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,820
then cough it up...

381
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,660
when you need it, or when you get married.

382
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,790
No, forget about that.

383
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,730
Let's take the shares and go to the US.

384
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,340
We're only missing one person,

385
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,970
and we seem to eat much less.

386
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,780
One less person makes a huge difference.

387
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,380
When I couldn't reach him for a few days
after he'd transferred hospitals,

388
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,080
I felt devastated.

389
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,350
I couldn't reach him,
and I didn't know where he was.

390
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,090
When did you say
you lost touch with your sister?

391
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,490
Four years ago.

392
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
How did you manage all that while?

393
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,370
I just kept going with the hope
that I'd see her again one day.

394
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,270
We'll meet again if it's meant to be
and we're both alive and well.

395
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,610
You still miss her, don't you?

396
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,410
Yes.

397
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,010
She appeared in my dream a few days ago.

398
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,250
I'm expecting some good news.

399
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,250
My dreams often come true.

400
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,190
I'll visit the companies on my list
and meet the CEOs.

401
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,760
I'll come with you to help.

402
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,200
You don't trust me?

403
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,800
It's not that. I'm concerned.

404
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,530
Okay, then. Come with me.

405
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,870
Are you two going somewhere?

406
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,810
You don't need to know.

407
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,950
I'll call the Audit Team
if you keep doing that.

408
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,150
You bully me and don't include me at all.

409
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,290
I won't fill you in
because this doesn't concern you.

410
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,730
If it doesn't concern me,
then it's not about work.

411
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,230
That means you're going out
on personal business.

412
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,730
Isn't that even worse?

413
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,600
You two can't have any personal business.

414
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,540
Shall we talk about work, then?

415
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,470
When can I get the report I asked you for?

416
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,440
I'm pretty sure I said I wanted it today.

417
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,010
You always mention reports.

418
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,890
Director.

419
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,100
I'm sure you selected companies
with no visible issues,

420
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,330
but it won't be enough
to convince Mingang's board.

421
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,840
There is something I have in mind
that I hope I can fall back on.

422
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,140
I think our competitors
will fall into some grave trouble soon.

423
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,080
You mean Hangeon and Judo?

424
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,780
There had been signs for a while,

425
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,880
and they might not be able
to pay their suppliers on time.

426
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,650
That goes for the new partners too.

427
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,890
We're not the only company
to lose a long-standing...

428
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,160
business partner to them.

429
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,390
Then it's just a matter of time.

430
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,030
Yes.

431
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,430
If their issue breaks out first,

432
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,840
we might not have to do anything.

433
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,910
Can we drop by somewhere on the way?

434
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,210
What made you want to visit me?

435
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,480
I'm here on business.

436
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,350
Is it about the partnership renewals?

437
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,060
I'm a step ahead of you.

438
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,890
You must've found
possible new partners by now.

439
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,730
If the board is summoned
and they want to penalize you,

440
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,560
you'll show the list
and ask them to let you off.

441
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,130
I won't ask for anything.
I'm only doing the best I can.

442
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,340
The only other options...

443
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,210
are to do
what our competitors did to us...

444
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,880
or to crush them.

445
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,180
You know what to do.

446
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,850
I won't do either
because neither option is fair.

447
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,280
I can't break the rules...

448
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,620
because our competitors did,

449
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,520
and I can't ruin them...

450
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,560
because they betrayed us.

451
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,560
You're so stuck-up.

452
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,960
Where did you learn how to do business?

453
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,900
This is why you get stabbed in the back.

454
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,800
My father taught me...

455
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,670
that what I gain unfairly
is not truly mine.

456
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,810
That is what my father said.

457
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,680
You still say that when you lost
our most important partners?

458
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,250
Tell your father...

459
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,380
that he taught you poorly.

460
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,580
If he's the same as you,

461
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,990
he'll lose everything
and cross over without a penny.

462
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,320
I'll prove to you...

463
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,590
that you are wrong.

464
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,180
I'm fine. Stop glancing at me.

465
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,250
Did you and the chairman argue?

466
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,280
I shouldn't argue with a patient.

467
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,080
I told him the status of the renewals.

468
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,250
He knew already.

469
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,290
I wanted to offer you moral support.

470
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,430
You are a great support right now.

471
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,230
Don't you know that?

472
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,330
Am I really?

473
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yes.

474
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
Who knows?

475
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,370
We might find something this very day...

476
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,240
that solves all our problems.

477
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,500
Can you park the car for me?

478
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,900
- What?
- Please.

479
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,140
Director!

480
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,010
Sorry. My bad.

481
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,880
Goodness...

482
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,260
Where were you all this time?

483
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,930
Now you finally show up.

484
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,900
Jo Pil Doo!

485
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,260
What the...

486
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,910
Why did you run away?

487
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,150
Why on earth?

488
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,410
Why?

489
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,190
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

490
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,710
You can't live like this forever.

491
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,710
Wouldn't it be better
to testify in court and start over?

492
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,550
Can't we just let it go?

493
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,850
You can't go,
even if you're being forced out.

494
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,450
I might not have a choice
if things don't work out.

495
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,450
Promise that you will do what you said.

496
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,690
One sentence is all it takes.
"I am Baek Sul Hee."

497
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,060
You're close to your mom.

498
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,990
That's how moms and daughters are.

499
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,730
What's yours is mine,
and what's mine is yours.

500
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,430
Do you know her birth mom killed herself?

501
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,700
She took her own life?
