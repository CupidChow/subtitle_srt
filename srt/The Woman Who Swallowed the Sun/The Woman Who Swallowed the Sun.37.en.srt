00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,190
(Searching for a missing person)

2
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,590
Will you look at this?

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,990
Where has this been hiding all this time?

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,270
(Episode 37)

5
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,680
Hello?

6
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,490
Hi. I got your number off a flyer.

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,620
Are you looking for Baek Sul Hee?

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,920
Gosh, you saw my older sister?

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,290
Where did you see her?

10
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,790
It's too late at night.

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,760
I'll call you back soon.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,160
Soon when?

13
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,170
Can't you tell me now?

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,570
Tell me where Sul Hee is,
and I'll go find her.

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,170
If you want to see her, wait.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,340
If you keep quiet until I call you,

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,440
you'll get to see her.

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,810
Is Sul Hee okay?

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,680
Is she in good health?

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,350
Where has she been?

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,450
Hello?

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,790
What the heck?

23
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,590
It was a prank call.

24
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,820
Darn you, punk.

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,730
Baek Sul Hee.

26
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,330
Your mask will come off
sooner than I thought.

27
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,300
I don't care why you joined Mingang.

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,270
You can't do anything now.

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,940
So you visited all those companies?

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,310
In the end, we had to walk
because we couldn't find a place to park.

31
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,080
What do you think?
Were any of them any good?

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,690
Some places specialize in parcels,
and one used to be a moving company.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,720
There's also a place that delivers
for small-scale online malls.

34
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,320
None of them specializes in...

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,830
large e-commerce deliveries
like Miyeon or Woojin.

36
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,300
If we sign with them,
we'll have to separate them by size.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,300
Would that even work?

38
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,870
Online malls sell similar stuff,

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,810
so it's all down to
when the products are delivered.

40
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,610
Why do you think some places
offer same-day...

41
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,210
or overnight delivery?

42
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,280
It can't be helped.

43
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,680
It was much less work
because Director Moon...

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,980
had listed the companies.

45
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,790
Did you get any rest?

46
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,660
What about you?

47
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,890
You seemed pretty tired.

48
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,830
I'm fine.

49
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,060
It's my job, but I dragged you into it.

50
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,530
I feel bad.

51
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,170
Why would you say that?

52
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,600
It feels like
you're drawing a line, and it hurts.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,540
You said we were on the same side.

54
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,210
Did I?

55
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,680
You did.

56
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,550
And it's not just about you or your job.

57
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,180
It involves our team and teammates too.

58
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,520
I guess? I might be the target right now,

59
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,420
but it's possible they'll use me...

60
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,960
as an excuse to disband our team.

61
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,000
That's how they'll get rid of you.

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,860
If you know that much,

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,770
don't let them replace you.

64
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,670
Whatever tactic they use,

65
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,200
hang in there and fight back.

66
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,770
Keep your title.

67
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,740
Okay?

68
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,380
Okay, I get it.

69
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,850
See you tomorrow.

70
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,380
Bye. Sleep well.

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,360
(Hankuk Hospital)

72
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,860
It looks like we lost all our partners.

73
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,430
No one has made
an official announcement yet.

74
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,740
We just got a call in secret.

75
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,970
We don't need an official announcement
to know it's over.

76
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,040
They're wrapping things up with us...

77
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,980
while signing a dual agreement
with someone else.

78
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,180
It's done.

79
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,510
CEO Min is looking for other options.

80
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,510
What did she say...

81
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,920
about holding Moon Tae Kyung
responsible for this mess?

82
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,450
She didn't mention that.

83
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,290
She covered for him for four years...

84
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,190
and wouldn't let anyone touch him.

85
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,530
How much stake in Mingang
did we give Moon when he joined?

86
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,700
As much as any other director.

87
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,670
He took that much and did this poor a job?

88
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,440
My gosh.

89
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,710
Ms. Lucia.

90
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,080
I just met with the chairman.

91
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,250
You must wonder how he is.

92
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,950
I'm sure he's well.

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,190
You talk as if he's none of your business.

94
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,350
Was he ever my business?

95
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,060
Come on.

96
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,190
You used the fact that you saved him...

97
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,590
to get close and wiggle your way
into his love life.

98
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,100
What did you say?

99
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,730
That's how it looked to me.

100
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,570
Was I mistaken?

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,770
You only see what you want.

102
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,440
You don't have to get
so worked up about it.

103
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,710
Wouldn't you let it slide
if you didn't have a guilty conscience?

104
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,610
What was that laugh about?

105
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,910
It's just that...

106
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,950
your name Lucia suits you so well.

107
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,020
When someone...

108
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,420
chooses to wear a mask,
they must take it off one day.

109
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,330
Just so you know, I get the biggest thrill
when I make someone...

110
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,090
take off their mask.

111
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,540
Director Moon is contacting
various delivery companies.

112
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,910
He's visiting ones on his list...

113
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,580
and some that aren't.

114
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,210
He'd have to...

115
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,620
if he wanted to find someone...

116
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,620
to handle the load
so his team could keep working.

117
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,020
What will you do now?

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,190
Business has never stalled because...

119
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,620
we couldn't find a company
to deliver our goods.

120
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,990
If things don't work,
we'll give customers benefits...

121
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,860
to tempt them
into collecting their orders,

122
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,460
or cut down on long-distance deliveries...

123
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,960
and deliver only to closer destinations.

124
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,900
There's always a solution.

125
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,270
Moon Tae Kyung could face the board.

126
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,840
What will you do then?

127
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,940
We must follow the board's vote.

128
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,850
Do you know
why I stopped covering for him?

129
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,250
I have no choice
if I'm to get rid of Lucia.

130
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,750
I must eliminate the director
to sort out both of them.

131
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,990
We can't waste this opportunity.

132
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,190
Does that woman bother you that much?

133
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,730
I guarantee you.

134
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,330
If we don't do something now,
she'll become a thorn in our side.

135
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,090
Here.

136
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,490
They're the papers
about my stake in the company.

137
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,790
My gosh.

138
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,790
Se Ri.

139
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,500
You sweet darling.

140
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,360
You good...

141
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,000
You can't tell anyone
in my family about it.

142
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,440
You don't have to tell me.

143
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,210
I'm not stupid. I won't tell,
even if my life is in danger.

144
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,250
My sister-in-law said...

145
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,920
moms never betray their kids,

146
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,780
even if the whole world does.

147
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,290
She knows her stuff.

148
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,060
That's the truth.

149
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,960
Dad gave me a little extra each year...

150
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,060
since I moved home, and I kept it all.

151
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,700
I got pregnant with you
after a one-night stand...

152
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,730
with your dad, whom I barely knew.

153
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,440
I had a tough labor and birth,

154
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,910
and you made it up for me.

155
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,180
What would've happened
if I hadn't had you?

156
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,820
You have no memory of my dad,
so forget about him,

157
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,350
but you should meet my oldest sister.

158
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,790
Your oldest sister?

159
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
Yes.

160
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,590
She's like a mom to me.

161
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,490
I really want you to meet her.

162
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,160
Do I have to meet her?

163
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,800
Okay. I'll do it if that's what you want.

164
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,710
I'll say hi...

165
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,940
- and discuss our flight to the US...
- My gosh, that kid.

166
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,280
- She's not at all like her sister.
- You sweet thing.

167
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,710
She seems brazen and nasty,

168
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,950
but she has a naive side too.

169
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,690
- What now?
- Let's go to the US.

170
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,750
We should follow her.

171
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,490
We should.

172
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,600
Her family must have
much more money than we thought.

173
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,400
What's all this? Stocks,
a certificate of deposit, and a trust.

174
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,340
We scored big this time.

175
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,740
This is the last time I have to play mom.

176
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,480
It was so corny, I got goosebumps.

177
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,720
Who are you?

178
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,360
What do you want?

179
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,630
Let's select
as many candidates as possible.

180
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm looking up each company's sales
and financial statements...

181
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,870
to see if they can replace
Miyeon and Woojin.

182
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,810
If that doesn't work, we can
split the load between multiple companies.

183
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Allocating certain products
to certain companies...

184
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,710
has its pros and cons.

185
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,750
The people high up
will focus on the negatives...

186
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,050
and try to ignore the positives.

187
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,460
Still, we're in a rush.

188
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,190
They wouldn't stop us from
selecting partners to ruin the business.

189
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,400
They might even use the situation
to their advantage.

190
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,710
Let's be honest.
If they drop two good partners...

191
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,780
and sign up a few nobodies,

192
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,350
nothing will work properly.

193
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,950
They must make it work.

194
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,620
Isn't that the Online Business Team's job
and yours too?

195
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,260
They're keeping quiet because
there's still time, but everyone knows.

196
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,430
If Father hears we lost our partners
to our competitors...

197
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,030
Do you think he hasn't heard already?

198
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,430
He knows?

199
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,030
Don't you know what he's like?

200
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,100
But then, that's why you're still...

201
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,340
That's why I'm still what?

202
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,270
I'm what?
Why won't you finish the sentence?

203
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,240
You can finish it yourself.

204
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,810
- You brat.
- What?

205
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,780
Do you know how rotten it feels...

206
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,750
when someone doesn't finish a sentence?

207
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,450
Don't you treat me like Kyung Chae does!

208
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,090
I won't come here again.

209
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,460
Please don't!

210
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,090
You... Darn it.

211
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,340
Oh, dear...

212
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,610
My gosh.

213
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,340
What's that around your head?

214
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,880
It distorts your pretty face.

215
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,910
You're not even human.

216
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,150
He hadn't visited in a long time,

217
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,120
and I didn't even get to give him dinner.

218
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,190
You saw how he was.

219
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,990
The first thing he should've done
was bow to me deeply,

220
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,560
not toss me an envelope with money.

221
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Make up for it.

222
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,130
I lost my only living relative
because of you.

223
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,830
That makes as much sense
as eating cereal in hot soup.

224
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,100
Why is that my fault?

225
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,970
Sun Jae is a jerk, that's all.

226
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,270
That's because you gave him a hard time...

227
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,140
and drove him stir-crazy
like you would anchovies in a pan.

228
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,140
I didn't drive him stir-crazy.

229
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,180
Did Sun Jae ever treat me
with respect as an elder?

230
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
He's always so cunning and quiet.

231
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,850
Forget that and serve me lunch.

232
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,320
I barely had any breakfast,
and my insides are empty.

233
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,620
Grill me a nice mackerel from Norway.

234
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,990
You like Norwegian mackerel?

235
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,330
Cook one yourself, then.

236
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,530
Are you on strike?

237
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,330
I'll force you into submission.

238
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
One, two...

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,910
Get up. Set the table.

240
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,450
Welcome back, sir.

241
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,950
You're so welcome, Father.

242
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,590
You should've come home sooner.

243
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,690
Why did you slack... Play hooky...

244
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,830
Anyway, welcome back.

245
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,060
I represent the rest of the family.

246
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,260
Yes. We're so glad you're back.

247
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,630
The house was so empty
without you, Father.

248
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,100
It was practically bare.

249
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,940
No home is complete without an elder.

250
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,870
- Right, honey?
- Yes, right.

251
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,740
Have you fully recovered?

252
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,550
Are you all right, Dad?
You won't get sick again?

253
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,910
I just don't get him.

254
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,140
He should say something
now that he's back after a while.

255
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,780
He acted like we were strangers.

256
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,410
Right.

257
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,180
They say other people change...

258
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,520
after a drastic operation.

259
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,190
Father is just the same.

260
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
Nothing happened while I was gone?

261
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,390
What could be worse than your absence?

262
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,000
That's a big deal to you,
but not to any of my kids.

263
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,130
They were all very worried about you.

264
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,830
Not about me, but about my money.

265
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,870
They only cared about
who'd take over the company.

266
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,010
Why are you so upset?

267
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,910
What could I be happy about?

268
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,840
I can't do anything I want.

269
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,710
She got involved
and lectured me on my love life.

270
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,420
She even blackmailed me.

271
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,990
Your love life? What do you mean?

272
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,120
Never mind.

273
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,570
What is it?

274
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,270
You have something to say?

275
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,410
I want you to meet someone.

276
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,610
Who?

277
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,380
You'll see who it is when you meet up.
Spare me some time tomorrow.

278
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,680
Not tomorrow. I have an afternoon meeting.

279
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,390
Can't you spare a short while?
No meeting lasts a whole day.

280
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,660
If it's someone I want you to meet,
it means that person is important to me.

281
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,690
Fine. Call me when you're near the office.

282
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,240
Min Se Ri doesn't own
a whole lot of the company,

283
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,680
but depending on
which sister she gives it to,

284
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,440
it could become the casting vote.

285
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,820
Min Kyung Chae will freak out
when she hears what her sister did.

286
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,850
Now I can't wait to find out...

287
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,150
who the kid's birth mom is.

288
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,090
I don't get who she's like.
How could she even think of...

289
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,290
giving these papers to someone else?

290
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,860
It shows how much she craves
a mother's love.

291
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,100
That could be why
she keeps getting into trouble.

292
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,700
Yes. She grew up
in that unfriendly place...

293
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,370
around some freaks.

294
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,010
I kind of get why she's messed up.

295
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,710
When will Chairman Min leave the hospital?

296
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,250
I checked, and he left already.
He should come to work tomorrow.

297
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,960
(Mingang Distribution)

298
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,170
(Mingang Distribution)

299
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,260
What brings you here?

300
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,190
I returned home yesterday.

301
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,430
What were you doing in my office?

302
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,570
There's no need to return it.
It's your share, so take it.

303
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,170
I was paid in full.

304
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,680
What do you mean you were paid?

305
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,080
You already paid me for saving your life.

306
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,480
You said to me...

307
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,190
that you were grateful
and that you appreciated me.

308
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,960
That was more than enough.

309
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,160
You rarely smiled,

310
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,070
but you smiled at me.

311
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,370
You called and urged me to visit,

312
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,370
and we talked over food
that I'd packed for you.

313
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,380
You gave me some enjoyable moments.

314
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,050
That's enough for me.

315
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,980
Didn't what I've said hurt your pride?

316
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,180
It did.

317
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,650
It wounded my heart as well.

318
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,120
But I understood where you came from.

319
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,330
What do you understand?

320
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,160
That you didn't mean it.

321
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,900
There must be a reason
you must treat me that way.

322
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,300
But...

323
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,670
However I feel,

324
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,210
I don't want to get you in any trouble.

325
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,310
I'll sort out my feelings in my own time.

326
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,650
Don't worry.

327
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,590
I still want to see you
every now and then at work,

328
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,960
so don't take that from me too.

329
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,120
What do you mean?

330
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,560
Does someone want you
to leave the company?

331
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,760
No.

332
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,770
I won't say anything
that could get misconstrued.

333
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Bye, then.

334
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,590
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

335
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,030
I bought the Gongjindan
from a reputable Korean medicine doctor.

336
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,330
It's good for people who have had surgery.

337
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,470
Take it regularly.

338
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,010
As long as you're healthy and well,
that's good enough for me.

339
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,710
I wish for nothing more.

340
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,390
We have a good idea
of the shape each company is in.

341
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,760
What more do we need?

342
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,300
How about we prepare a presentation
just in case?

343
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,170
Rather than a boring printed report,
something visual would appeal more.

344
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,370
That's a good idea.

345
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,370
We could include
clips of interviews with the CEOs.

346
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,070
That's not a bad idea.

347
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,670
Ideally,
she'd want to meet them in person,

348
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,480
but an interview clip
would put the CEO at ease.

349
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,910
I think we're creating
even more work for ourselves.

350
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,120
Shall we divide and conquer?

351
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,820
You meet the CEOs and interview them,

352
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,090
and I'll compile the material.

353
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,620
How should we schedule everything, then?

354
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,860
Why don't you meet the CEOs
and ask when they're free?

355
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,370
We might have to contact
our PR Team first.

356
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,370
What will you do?

357
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,780
Moon Tae Kyung seems to have found
other possible partners.

358
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,810
He'll check thoroughly and select places
he thinks are good enough.

359
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,020
He won't allow this problem...

360
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,020
to wreak havoc with his team's business.

361
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,790
Are you saying you'll approve
the companies he selects?

362
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,060
I'll pretend to approve
as if I have no choice,

363
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,720
but penalize him for losing our partners.

364
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,460
What about the board meeting, then?

365
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,930
Didn't I tell you?

366
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,330
Regardless of whether he finds a solution,
I'll follow the board's vote.

367
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,130
Whatever that may be.

368
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,970
Let's put out the urgent fire first.

369
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,970
If the Online Business Team flounders,

370
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,770
I'll be held responsible too.

371
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,710
I must avoid that fate.

372
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,540
Take a look at this for me.

373
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,180
Hello, everyone.

374
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,150
It's good to see you work hard together.

375
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,720
Good luck.

376
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,160
When you select the new business partners,

377
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,830
I'll go over
the contracts for you thoroughly.

378
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,100
Don't worry about that.

379
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,240
Why the sudden change?

380
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,970
I don't get it.

381
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,240
I thought he'd be against our plan.

382
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,490
The number you dialed does not exist.

383
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,290
Check the number and try again.

384
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,000
The number you dialed does not exist.

385
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,800
Check the number and try again.

386
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,510
The number you dialed does not exist.

387
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,310
Check the number and try again.

388
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Hello?

389
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,300
I'm the person who called last time.

390
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,300
You're Baek Sul Hee's sister, right?

391
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,040
Quit toying with me.

392
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,370
I don't have time to waste.

393
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,070
I'll text you a location. Come over.

394
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,940
You can see your sister.

395
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,050
How can I trust you...

396
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,650
in a world full of scams?

397
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,150
Your older sister is Baek Sul Hee.

398
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,250
Her daughter's name is Baek Mi So,

399
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,150
and she unfortunately died
some years ago in an accident.

400
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,760
My gosh.

401
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,390
How do you know our Mi So?

402
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,490
Because your sister told me about her.

403
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,800
Yes.

404
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm sorry for doubting you.

405
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,670
Where should I go?

406
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,930
I'll go there right now.

407
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,970
Come in.

408
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,280
I heard something weird.

409
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,320
The reason Mingang's partners
switched over to their competitors...

410
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,520
was largely because of Kim Sun Jae.

411
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,790
What does that mean?

412
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,390
He laid out
some preposterous conditions...

413
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,260
so the competitors
could swoop in to steal the business.

414
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,360
He's the reason all this happened.

415
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,930
And he wants Moon Tae Kyung
to take the fall?

416
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,100
I heard from a reliable source,
so it's likely true,

417
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,240
even though it'll be hard to find proof.

418
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,240
It won't just be hard to find.
He won't have left any proof.

419
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,580
Leaving no trace
is the only way he can save his skin.

420
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,150
Our only option is to make him confess.

421
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,520
Is that true?

422
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,460
According to Tae Joo.

423
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,130
I asked around myself
just in case, and he was right.

424
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,760
How could he...

425
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,100
And he wants Director Moon
to take the fall?

426
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,900
As I said, because there's no proof,

427
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,670
we must make him confess.

428
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,180
Our business partners.

429
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,050
Handing them over to our competitors
must've kept you busy.

430
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,100
Miyeon and Woojin.

431
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,670
Why did you dissuade them
from renewing with us?

432
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,070
Why did you
let our competitors sign them on?

433
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,710
Why can't you say anything?

434
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,080
Are you lost for words that I know
what you thought would never come out?

435
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,450
Do you think I'll let this slide?

436
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,720
If you thought you could
get away with harming the company...

437
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,820
Go and talk.

438
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,360
Tell the CEO.
Tell the chairman for all I care.

439
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,130
I got Miyeon and Woojin
to sign with our competitors.

440
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,600
So what?

441
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,470
How can you say that?

442
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,810
That's enough.

443
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,340
Did you get all that?

444
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,910
Go and talk.

445
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,980
Tell the CEO.
Tell the chairman for all I care.

446
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,120
I got Miyeon and Woojin
to sign with our competitors.

447
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,450
So what?

448
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,690
That should be enough evidence.

449
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,890
Great. I'll play this for the CEO.

450
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,490
Before you do,

451
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,460
take a look at this.

452
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,870
(Searching for a missing person)

453
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,110
Follow me if you're interested.

454
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,760
I knew something was up
when I saw you freak out on the rooftop.

455
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
What mom...

456
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,030
could stand on the spot
where her daughter jumped to her death?

457
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,070
Don't even think that the likes of you
can threaten or blackmail me.

458
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,140
I don't know what you're on about.

459
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,010
What is this?
What does it have to do with me?

460
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,680
Didn't I prove to you who I was?

461
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,650
What do you think you can do
with a flyer about my lookalike?

462
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,310
Okay.

463
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,190
Put her on.

464
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,330
Hello?

465
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,460
What's going on?

466
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,070
You said you'd let me see my sister.

467
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,070
Where is she?

468
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,200
Where's my sister Sul Hee?

469
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,710
I don't want to hurt your sister.

470
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,080
I have no reason to.

471
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,950
All I want is one sentence.

472
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,850
For you to take off your mask...

473
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,280
and say, "I am Baek Sul Hee."

474
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,350
That's it.

475
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,820
Say it.

476
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,360
Go on.

477
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,670
Right now.

478
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,550
Get rid of that woman.

479
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,790
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

480
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,340
He'll plan something...

481
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,170
without any of the Mins knowing?

482
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,010
If Kim Sun Jae
really did something like that,

483
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,780
they'd have come up with a story.

484
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,380
Even if it means
losing the director I hired myself,

485
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,850
I want to get rid of that woman.

486
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,850
Who can vouch for the loyalty
of a man who once fell for a woman?

487
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,850
If we'd kept the baby that you carried,

488
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,920
as Mom and Dad.

489
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,260
You brought this upon yourself.

490
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,360
You caused everything, Baek Sul Hee.
