1
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,920
The person you called is unavailable.

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,260
Connecting to voicemail.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,220
- She won't pick up?
- No.

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,860
The library would be long closed by now.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,100
Maybe Bo Ram knows.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,070
Hi, Bo Ram.

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,240
Yes, it's me.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,680
Are you with Mi So?

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,410
Oh, really?

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,910
Can you call me if you hear from her?

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,080
Bye.

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,750
Bo Ram doesn't know either?

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,160
- No.
- What?

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,530
Where did she go?

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,830
She always calls
whenever she's running late.

16
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,940
I'm sorry, Kyung Chae.

17
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,100
Forget it.

18
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,910
I don't need your apology.

19
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,140
As I said,

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,740
you're nothing to me now.

21
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,480
I'll pretend we're strangers.

22
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,980
Whether you cause trouble...

23
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,520
or end up dead, I won't care.

24
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,520
I spent money and effort
to clean up your messes.

25
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,360
I'm done giving in to you.

26
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,330
I won't help you behind Father's back.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,230
Fend for yourself now.

28
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,270
Knowing Father's temper,
I wonder what he'll do.

29
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,770
You know...

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,610
your position at home, don't you?

31
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,370
I should've given up long ago.

32
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,380
Stupid me kept helping you out.

33
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,550
I feel great.

34
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,880
Don't call me again.

35
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,550
I'll delete your number.

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,220
Mom.

37
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,490
Do you remember when I called you that?

38
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,030
The day I moved into
Dad's Pyeongchang-dong house.

39
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,570
The whole family looked at me
like I was contaminated,

40
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,810
but only you looked at me with pity.

41
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,540
I still remember that look.

42
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,150
I guess that was why I called you "Mom."

43
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,790
I'm sorry, Kyung Chae.

44
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,830
I'll do whatever you say.

45
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll settle down wherever you send me.

46
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,800
What am I to do if you give up on me too?

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,210
You're all I have.

48
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,680
Kyung Chae.

49
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,090
Bo Ram.

50
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,960
Baek Mi So. Where are you?

51
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,430
Your mom is calling everyone
looking for you.

52
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,530
Hey.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,110
Bo Ram.

54
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,840
Hello? You sound weird.

55
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,380
Are you sick or something? Where are you?

56
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,080
What time is it?

57
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,090
Hi, Bo Ram.

58
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,160
What?

59
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,540
Mi So.

60
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,310
Mi So.

61
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,910
Mi So.

62
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,450
Mi So!

63
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,880
Wake up, Mi So!

64
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,820
Mi So.

65
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,560
Wake up, Mi So!

66
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,800
Mom.

67
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,070
Yes, Mom's here. I'm right here.

68
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,440
Do you recognize me?

69
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,350
It's you, Mom.

70
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Mi So.

71
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,060
Mi So.

72
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,930
Mi So! No!

73
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,670
(Emergency Medical Center)

74
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,810
Hang in there.

75
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,180
Mi So!

76
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,250
(Ambulance Only)

77
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,960
Doctor. Please, save my daughter.

78
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,160
- Kim, book an OR.
- Okay.

79
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,660
Mi So!

80
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,700
Oh, no, Mi So...

81
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Mi So...

82
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,840
Fly out tomorrow.

83
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,510
I'll get you a ticket.

84
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,610
Don't do anything.

85
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,080
I won't make demands too.

86
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,650
Get some rest.

87
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,390
Start over once you recover
mentally and physically.

88
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,790
I'll find another school to take you.

89
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,800
Can you stay the night?

90
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,340
I always slept with a nanny...

91
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,140
or on my own as I grew up.

92
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,210
They pretended to like me
around the family,

93
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,510
but they thought I was a nuisance.

94
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,450
Even as a child,
I guess I instinctively knew...

95
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,590
that they let me stay and hugged me...

96
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,220
so they'd get paid.

97
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,230
(Operating Room)

98
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
Hey.

99
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,910
I'm at the hospital.

100
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,570
There was an accident.

101
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,510
She's in surgery.

102
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,020
The doctor said it was an easy one
and that I shouldn't worry.

103
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,050
Yeon Ah.

104
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,960
I can't live
if something happens to Mi So.

105
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,830
How can I go on without my baby?

106
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,300
Calm down, Sul Hee.
Nothing bad will happen.

107
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,730
We all know what Mi So means to you.

108
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,240
She'll be okay, won't she?

109
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,110
She'll wake up, right?

110
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,720
(Operating Room)

111
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,970
You always do as Mom says, don't you?

112
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,200
Walk out as if nothing happened.

113
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,070
Can you do that?

114
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,310
Come out after the surgery...

115
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,340
with a smile on your face.

116
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,950
I believe in you.

117
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,190
I trust you'll do that.

118
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,960
(Operating Room)

119
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,930
You just got back?

120
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,470
Can you run me a bath?

121
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,070
- Where's Father?
- He's not up yet.

122
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,110
He fell asleep late last night.

123
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,140
Good. Tell him I had
an early-morning workout.

124
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,340
Okay.

125
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,780
You wouldn't have gone to the gym
dressed like that.

126
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,880
It looks like
you spent the night with someone.

127
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,790
With whom, I wonder? I'm dead curious.

128
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,960
Who could Ice Queen
Min Kyung Chae's lover be?

129
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,200
Why else would you lie about working out?

130
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,470
You're not seeing someone in secret
at another home, are you?

131
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,270
That's someone else's specialty.

132
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,940
Secretively, without anyone knowing,

133
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,980
she stops at nothing to achieve her goal.

134
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,480
A Gangnam bar hostess.

135
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,350
The legendary escort
whom all prostitutes aspired to be.

136
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,690
How dare you say that?

137
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,920
Remember your place.

138
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,220
Unless you want me to bring up your mom
this early in the morning.

139
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,600
Good morning, sisters.

140
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,970
What the heck was that?

141
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,510
Why are they both so cold?

142
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,250
Am I an outcast?

143
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,620
No, I can't be.

144
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,820
Hey, Soo Jung. Make me some coffee too.

145
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Hi.

146
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,550
She's out of surgery and in the ward.

147
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,260
The doctor sedated her on purpose
and told me not to worry.

148
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,230
What did I tell you?

149
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,460
Mi So knows exactly how you feel.

150
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,630
She'd never cause you to worry.

151
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,700
Do you know what happened to her?

152
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,200
She was assaulted.

153
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Oh, my gosh. What happens now?

154
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,610
Don't worry about the snack bar.
You look after Mi So.

155
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,550
It wasn't a small accident
if she needed surgery.

156
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,520
I thought all was well
since she got into high school.

157
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,760
What on earth is happening?

158
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,060
Did you see the news?

159
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,830
The youngest kid of Ohsung Group's
Chairman Cho got into trouble.

160
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,300
How couldn't I
when it's all over the Internet?

161
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,240
They told a flight attendant
to make them ramyeon, then sent it back.

162
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,670
It ended in a fistfight.

163
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,710
Ohsung Group's website crashed.

164
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,880
That's how many people
flocked over to comment.

165
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,180
The youngest kid is the troublemaker.

166
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,050
They caused a fuss
at a department store not long ago.

167
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,150
From what I heard, the chairman
spent millions to cover that up.

168
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,490
Money isn't the issue.

169
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,290
Family issues
hurt more than just the profits.

170
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,060
If the customers turn against us,
no amount of money will help.

171
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,900
Once they think
the owner's offspring act entitled,

172
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,500
they dislike everything they do.

173
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,900
It's worse in our industry.

174
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,540
What if they were to boycott us?

175
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,240
Would we get into trouble
when you taught us well?

176
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,840
Se Ri is the problem.

177
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,780
Keep her under control.

178
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,980
I'll disown her
if she gets into trouble once more.

179
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,450
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

180
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,590
You said everything is fine.

181
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,490
If something goes wrong,
you're out too, CEO Min.

182
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,970
Why does it feel like
the calm before a storm?

183
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,710
Se Ri had never been this quiet
for this long.

184
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,940
You don't have the time
to worry about her.

185
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,140
Worry about yourself.

186
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,010
If you want a part
in the new business, find Moon.

187
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,310
Don't you worry.

188
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,620
I have people searching all the hotels.

189
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,920
How about I call Se Ri
to see how she's doing?

190
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,490
I warned you...

191
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,490
not to mind Se Ri.

192
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,660
You forget your place at work and act out,

193
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,600
but I accept that
because that's you being competitive.

194
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,830
But stay well away from Se Ri.

195
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,170
It's quite strange.

196
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,640
To be honest, isn't a troublemaker
like Se Ri a burden to you too?

197
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,440
Why do you coddle her?

198
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,940
She might be a troublemaker,
but at least she doesn't play dirty.

199
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,980
Not again.

200
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,850
Why are you so prejudiced?

201
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,180
I don't need to be prejudiced about you.

202
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,320
You're just not transparent enough.

203
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,630
Get Se Ri on a plane tomorrow.

204
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,340
I'll find her a new home and school
in a different state.

205
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Check her out of the hotel first.

206
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,780
Soo Jung is searching hotels,
and if she were to find Se Ri...

207
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,850
I expected that,

208
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,550
so I had the hotel
take Ms. Se Ri off the guest list.

209
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,320
Well done.

210
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
I can relax since you take the initiative.

211
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
I'll leave Se Ri to you, then.

212
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,090
Where on earth is Moon Tae Kyung?

213
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,860
Soo Jung hasn't found him yet either.

214
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,930
He might not be at a hotel.

215
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,900
I agree.

216
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,770
I wondered if he'd been in a car accident
after he entered the country...

217
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,070
and called the university hospital ERs,
but I couldn't find him.

218
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,770
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

219
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,580
If we don't find him first,

220
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,880
we must wait for him to come to us.

221
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,250
Then we lose the upper hand.

222
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,590
And we'll have to cater to his demands.

223
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,550
That's most likely.

224
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,160
That's not my plan.

225
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,330
Oh, gosh.

226
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,470
Hang on.

227
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,710
She said she'd visit once a day.

228
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,540
What's going on?

229
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,510
Is something wrong?

230
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,500
Mom.

231
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,470
Mi So. Mom's right here.

232
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,840
Are you all right?

233
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,040
Where am I?

234
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,440
You're at a hospital. You had surgery.

235
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,710
It's not serious, so don't be scared.

236
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,680
Goodness.

237
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,590
What happened to you?

238
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,920
Who did this?

239
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,660
It was a passer-by.

240
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,800
It was a random attack?

241
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,040
How did this happen to you?

242
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,210
You must've been so afraid.

243
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,590
Mom's so sorry.

244
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,260
Why would you apologize?

245
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,560
My darling girl.

246
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,170
- Are you okay?
- Don't cry.

247
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,070
Okay, I won't.

248
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,670
Are you okay? Are you sure?

249
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,980
My darling.

250
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,180
You look a mess.

251
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,590
(Detective Kim)

252
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,620
Hello, Detective.

253
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,360
Is that true?

254
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,930
You really have his address?

255
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,830
I'll be there right away.

256
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,570
Why would I put it off
when it took so long?

257
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,170
Okay, sure. Thank you. Bye.

258
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,140
Do you feel any discomfort?

259
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,010
No. I'm well and fine.

260
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,880
Nurse.

261
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,750
Something urgent came up.

262
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,520
Can I get discharged right now?

263
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,260
I'll talk to your doctor
and arrange it for you.

264
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,690
Thank you.

265
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,610
Wait.

266
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,310
She insisted on being here
to see me get discharged.

267
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,010
Jeez.

268
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,210
Did something really happen to her?

269
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,060
Miso Snack Bar is close to
the Seodam three-way junction.

270
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,690
It's my business. It's pretty well-known.

271
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,000
Of course, I named it after my daughter.

272
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,570
(Seodam-ro 10-gil 9, Geumgang-gu, Seoul)

273
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,980
- Thank you.
- Bye.

274
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,650
Hello, Miso Snack Bar.

275
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,390
She's not here. Personal issues.

276
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,690
Bye.

277
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,000
Hello.

278
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,030
Is Mi So's mom here?

279
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,000
Why are you looking for her? Who are you?

280
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,170
I'm the guy she hit with her scooter.

281
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,910
Oh, that was you. She told me about it.

282
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,380
Why are you here, then?

283
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,310
I just got discharged,

284
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,780
and I thought I should drop by to see her.

285
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,790
Is she out on a delivery?

286
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,760
She isn't on that scooter, is she?

287
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,690
It looked really dangerous.

288
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,060
We can't care about that right now.

289
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,930
Goodbye.

290
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,570
Bye.

291
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,580
(Miso Snack Bar)

292
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,610
Darn it.

293
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,540
I hoped to see her one last time.

294
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,860
Hello?

295
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,060
Jo Pil Doo, are you home?

296
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,330
Jo Pil Doo!

297
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,780
Who are you?

298
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,050
What are you doing outside my home?

299
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,520
Are you Mr. Jo Pil Doo?

300
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,320
Yes. I'm Jo Pil Doo.

301
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,020
Hello, sir.

302
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,960
If you're free, can we have a short chat?

303
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,360
Twenty-five years ago.

304
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,270
The accident that happened
at Mucheon Roundabout.

305
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,030
Do you remember it?

306
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,670
There was a head-on collision
between a white Velvo car and your truck.

307
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,770
The driver...

308
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,480
and his wife died at the scene.

309
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,910
I'm the son...

310
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,710
of the deceased couple.

311
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,820
Go away.

312
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,320
I don't know anything.

313
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,660
Sir. Don't say that.

314
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,830
Please tell me the truth.

315
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,630
I believe the culprit is someone else.

316
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,730
What do you mean? I caused that accident.

317
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,870
No, sir. I don't think so.

318
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,300
When the police closed in,

319
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,870
the actual culprit
needed someone to take the fall,

320
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,710
and that was why they got you to confess.

321
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,240
That's nonsense.

322
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,580
I'm the culprit.

323
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,040
Darn you.

324
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,380
That's not true!

325
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,390
You didn't know about
the secret document that was in the car.

326
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,530
Forget the secret document.
It was just an accident.

327
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,700
I dozed off at the wheel and...

328
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,430
No!

329
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,670
It was an intentional murder
disguised as an accident.

330
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,310
And two innocent people died.

331
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,880
You can ask me a hundred times,
but my answer is that I'm guilty.

332
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,450
I have nothing to say. Get lost.

333
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,680
Sir.

334
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,980
Don't call me "sir."

335
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,520
I'm not that great a man,

336
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,520
and that criminal record...

337
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,260
ruined my life completely.

338
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,760
Don't come here ever again!

339
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,060
If you do and bother me again,

340
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,160
I might run you down next, okay?

341
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
Sir.

342
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,200
Sir!

343
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,470
Darn it.

344
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,220
Mi So.

345
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,360
What happened to you?

346
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,430
Who was it?

347
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,700
Who did this to you?

348
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,930
Did you see their face?

349
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,970
Actually...

350
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,840
Do you remember the girl
who caused a scene at the coffee shop?

351
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,910
That psycho?

352
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,610
Did she...

353
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,960
She couldn't stand
what happened at the coffee shop.

354
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,930
So she found you to get back at you?

355
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,800
What's her problem?

356
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,570
Why...

357
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,100
Don't tell my mom.

358
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,070
She'll only get more upset.

359
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,710
She should know the truth.

360
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,510
Things will only get worse.

361
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,880
We can't find her now
since we don't know who she is.

362
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,950
Hi, Bo Ram.

363
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,760
Did you talk to Mi So?

364
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,190
I'd like to stay with her,

365
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,590
but she told me to leave
and get to my class.

366
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,800
Yes, you should.
You can come back tomorrow.

367
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,470
Okay.

368
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
Ms. Baek.

369
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,240
What is it?
Do you have something to tell me?

370
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,880
Actually...

371
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,150
Mi So had been working part-time
at a coffee shop.

372
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,450
To buy you a birthday present.

373
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,630
Here you go.

374
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,930
I found it in the alley.

375
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,970
This dress...

376
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,640
She said it would look great on you.

377
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,740
She was so pleased.

378
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,220
And we know who did that to her.

379
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,720
It's the girl
who caused a scene at the cafe.

380
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,290
She got back at Mi So for what happened.

381
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,790
What...

382
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,830
What are you talking about, Bo Ram?

383
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,030
Well...

384
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,740
Mi So helped me out at the coffee shop.

385
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,470
This is my fault.

386
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,100
That's what happened...

387
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,400
to my daughter.

388
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,030
I had no idea.

389
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,270
Mom was totally clueless.

390
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,280
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

391
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,730
I'll find her and make her pay.

392
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,230
It's only right that people...

393
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,700
who do wrong get punished.
Whoever they are.

394
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,730
I'll take this case.

395
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,230
We need to meet up right away.
It's a pretty urgent matter.

396
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,670
How much do you trust me?

397
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,700
You must be confident.

398
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,640
I said that the guilty get punished.

399
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,910
There are no exceptions.

400
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,540
My dad is Chairman Min Doo Sik.

401
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,480
Chairman Min Doo Sik
of Mingang Distribution?

402
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,180
You know I consider you my family, right?

403
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,380
I'm sorry, Chairman.

404
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,920
I need to become your actual family.
