00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,610
(Episode 89)

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,150
Are you left-handed?

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,450
Why do you ask?

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,820
Is there a problem?

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,160
No, not at all.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,890
It’s just that I am, too.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm a lefty, too.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,130
I usually use my right hand,

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,000
but this one's the star of the show.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,540
Looks like we have something in common.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,540
What's the big deal?
There are tons of lefties out there.

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,450
Don't try to use this as an excuse
to get friendly.

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,480
I don't care what happens
between you and my sister.

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,180
How cute.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,390
You're so annoying!

16
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,620
I'm leaving!

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,030
Where have you been?

18
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,150
What's the deal with that Lawyer Kim?

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,950
What about him?

20
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,990
He dragged me out to eat for no reason.

21
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,760
- You two met?
- I told him no, but he insisted.

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,590
He came on way too strong,
trying to be all friendly.

23
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,530
He was just trying to get along.
You could at least humor him.

24
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,470
We'll talk later.

25
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,970
I heard you took Se Ri out.

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,580
Yes. We need to get close
as soon as possible.

27
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,610
I don't see her as a sister-in-law.

28
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,510
She's more like a daughter to me.

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,150
She got upset and left earlier,

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,320
so I wanted to go over tonight
and smooth things over.

31
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,950
You're coming over again?

32
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,820
You were there just a few days ago.

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,190
It's practically my home now.

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,590
As a matter of fact,
I've always wanted a daughter her age.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,760
Honestly, I wish she were my daughter.

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,730
Even if Se Ri turned out
to be your secret daughter,

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,170
I'd be totally okay with that.

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,210
I didn't realize you'd go that far.

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,510
Thank you for saying that.

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,810
I went to the last place...

41
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,380
Chairman Min was spotted
on a traffic camera with Madam Jang.

42
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,820
Were you able to deduce
their final destination?

43
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,490
No. The location is a little strange.

44
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,230
The car definitely entered that road,
but we lost it after that.

45
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,400
Kim Sun Jae would've anticipated
this move,

46
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,770
and he could've had them switch cars
somewhere along the way.

47
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,200
Or he could've used the rush hour traffic
on a congested road...

48
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,210
to slip down a side road
no one would think to check.

49
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,540
If they have an accomplice,

50
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,280
it would make things much easier for them.

51
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,550
I'll keep looking into it,

52
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,050
but as of now, unless Min Kyung Chae
and Kim Sun Jae start talking,

53
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,750
I don't think it will be easy
to find Chairman Min Doo Sik.

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,960
If I can't find him in a month,
I'll be forced to resign.

55
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,760
I don't think they'll even give you
a full month.

56
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,570
Once those two get engaged this weekend,
they'll be running the show.

57
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,830
What's to stop them?

58
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,240
They'll probably cook up
some other scheme...

59
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,900
to replace you as CEO...

60
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,740
and then get rid of me, too.

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,610
I can't let them push me out like this.

62
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,440
I haven't accomplished anything yet.

63
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,510
Let's go back there together later.
You never know.

64
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,820
We might find that side road you missed.

65
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,790
All right, let's head out after work.

66
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,330
You're home late.

67
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,400
I had to take care of something.

68
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,400
Why? Did the chairman call or something?

69
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,570
No, it's not that. You have a visitor.

70
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,800
A visitor?

71
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,340
It's me, Mother.

72
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,510
You look like you've been busy.
You seem tired.

73
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,310
I had an off-site meeting.

74
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,850
So that's why you look so exhausted.

75
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,190
Would you like a piggyback
from your son-in-law?

76
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,090
Shall I carry you to your bedroom?

77
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
Hop on.

78
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,090
That's enough.

79
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,630
Get me a glass of water, please.

80
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,230
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,080
If the engagement party is this weekend,
when is the wedding?

82
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,790
We don't have a firm date yet.

83
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,860
It's too much to plan for that
with Father gone.

84
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,160
Haven't you been coming over a lot lately?

85
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,930
I know you guys are getting engaged,
but still.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,330
It's because of my youngest sister-in-law.

87
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,930
I saw her for a bit earlier,
and I already miss her.

88
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,240
Your sister-in-law?

89
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,610
That rolls right off your tongue.

90
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,510
Too bad for you.

91
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,910
Se Ri really can't stand you, you know.

92
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,050
Just look at her now.

93
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,550
She's sulking in her room,
refusing dinner.

94
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,890
She'll come around eventually.

95
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Manager Gong.

96
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,360
Allow me.

97
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,630
I've got to score some points
with my future mother-in-law.

98
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,570
See? The guy's got no shame.

99
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,940
"Mother-in-law" just rolls off his tongue.

100
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,180
Here you go, Mother.

101
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,020
You won't accept.

102
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,760
Hearing me call you that
makes you cringe, doesn't it?

103
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,890
The feeling's mutual.

104
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,500
Like you said, it's not like
our relationship was casual.

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,070
We lived together and even had a kid.

106
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,570
For us to become
mother-in-law and son-in-law...

107
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,000
is pretty messed up, right?

108
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,970
I'm glad you realize that.
That's why I told you to call it off.

109
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,910
But after seeing Se Ri today,

110
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,880
I know I absolutely must
have this wedding.

111
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,050
For some reason,
she doesn't feel like a stranger to me.

112
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,080
I wonder if it's because
she's Min Kyung Chae's daughter.

113
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,550
She's the reason your daughter is dead.
And you're saying what?

114
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,060
- She "doesn't feel like a stranger?"
- Look who's talking.

115
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,060
You're doting on your daughter's killer,
acting the perfect stepmom.

116
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,660
When you hold her in your arms,
don't you think about your own daughter?

117
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,200
When you look her in the eye
and talk to her,

118
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,870
or when she smiles and calls you "Mom,"

119
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,870
don't you think of your dead daughter?

120
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,710
I was never a real father to her, but you?

121
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,880
You said she meant more to you than life.

122
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,680
You're putting on an act and playing mom
to Min Kyung Chae's daughter.

123
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,820
How is that any different from me
putting on an act to be her dad?

124
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,090
So don't you dare tell me
to call this wedding off.

125
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,230
I already told you.
If you don't want to be my mother-in-law,

126
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,900
then you're the one
who can pack up and leave.

127
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,830
Are you finished?

128
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,770
What if I am? What are you going to do?

129
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,370
I, for one, am getting a mother-in-law
I never expected,

130
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
and I couldn't be happier.

131
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,710
Is that right?

132
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,240
Fine. Let's see this through to the end.

133
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,780
I'm thrilled to have
an unwanted son-in-law.

134
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,750
But you'd better play your part
as a son-in-law properly.

135
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,220
Because I'm
a very demanding mother-in-law.

136
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,720
Before that, why not show me some love,
Mother?

137
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,160
Next time I come,
at least serve a whole hen for me.

138
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,860
I'll be looking forward to it.

139
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Why, you...

140
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,770
Darn...

141
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,940
Darn it...

142
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,220
Director Moon,
you're really something else.

143
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,890
How can you be
in the same position for so long...

144
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,390
without a single promotion?

145
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,190
What's wrong with being a director?

146
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,960
And what about you, Lawyer Kim?
It's not like your career took off either.

147
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,930
For me, being head of the legal team
was as high as I could go from the bottom.

148
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,640
But now that I'm about to
become a member of the owner family,

149
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,210
I suppose I can get directly involved
in management.

150
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,710
Oh, right.

151
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,940
Speaking of company policy...

152
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,880
The rule that only gives control
to the owner family,

153
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,820
don't you think
that's an incredibly outdated policy?

154
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,150
That's a long-standing tradition
here at Mingang.

155
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,190
Other firms hire management specialists...

156
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,090
to run things more transparently,

157
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,590
but here at Mingang Distribution,

158
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,590
it seems we're keeping...

159
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,100
an autocratic system
of hereditary management.

160
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,970
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the kitchen.

161
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,740
If you hate Mingang so much,
find another company.

162
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,070
That's not my point.

163
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,570
I'm saying the owner family
monopolizing control is unreasonable...

164
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,080
Then become part of the owner's family.

165
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,280
If you weren't born into it,
then work your way up like I did.

166
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,810
With your engagement party so soon,

167
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,580
you act like you're on top of the world.

168
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,750
I guess the chairman's absence...

169
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,390
is the last thing on your mind now.

170
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,290
Don't touch this.

171
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,090
The chairman really liked these flowers.

172
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,760
Don't tell me you've already forgotten
your promise.

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,830
I keep my promises.

174
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,700
If my father isn't back within a month,
then that vase...

175
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,810
and you will be gone before me.

176
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,680
I've put up with you this long.
I can wait a little longer.

177
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,940
Such patience is nice.

178
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,780
Right.

179
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,520
The engagement party is tomorrow.

180
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,380
Should I wear traditional Korean clothing?

181
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,620
After all, as the mother of the bride,

182
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,620
I should at least show
that much courtesy, right?

183
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,790
Wear traditional Korean clothing
or a bikini.

184
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,200
Do whatever you want. I won't stop you.

185
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,670
However, I'm not sure...

186
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,800
how long you'll get to play that
"mother of the bride" act.

187
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,090
(Mingang Distribution)

188
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,490
Is there anything useful?

189
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,030
No.

190
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,560
It's all related to the engagement party.

191
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,230
There's nothing about
Chairman Min Doo Sik.

192
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,500
If we don't find him within a month,
we're in big trouble.

193
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,470
Don't worry. We'll be sure to find him.

194
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,840
You haven't heard from
anyone else, have you?

195
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,950
Heard from anyone?

196
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,250
While we're desperately searching for him,

197
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,080
I'm sure Chairman Min is trying to escape.

198
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,150
He must be trying anything he can.

199
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,520
He might find a way to reach out.

200
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,970
Is he asleep or what?

201
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,110
Yes, Lawyer Kim.

202
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,120
There's no need to ask.

203
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,780
He eats what we give him,

204
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,650
sleeps soundly, and is doing just fine.

205
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,420
The Serno Hotel this weekend?

206
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,860
Congratulations on your engagement.

207
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,030
So you're finally tying the knot
with CEO Min.

208
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,170
What trouble could that old geezer
possibly cause?

209
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,540
Don't you worry.
We're watching him closely.

210
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:14,970
Right.

211
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,870
Yes, sir. I understand.

212
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,220
They lock me up in here...

213
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,060
and will do what behind my back?

214
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,160
Who gave them permission?

215
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,960
I ought to wring their necks!

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,040
(Serno Hotel)

217
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,480
(Congratulations on the Engagement,
Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae)

218
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,480
Kim Sun Jae.

219
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,620
Sun Jae.

220
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,720
Kim Sun Jae!

221
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,660
Today's the day. Finally.

222
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,490
I've worked my whole life for this day.

223
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,230
Engagement, then marriage,
all in one shot.

224
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,730
Half of Mingang Distribution...

225
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,940
is now in the palm of my hand.

226
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,920
Gosh, my stomach!

227
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,820
My stomach! I'm dying!

228
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,660
I think my appendix burst!

229
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,260
My stomach!

230
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,060
Help! Somebody, help me! Goodness.

231
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,070
Hey, what are you doing?
Are you just going to let me die?

232
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,940
- My stomach!
- Darn it.

233
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,640
What's wrong? Where does it hurt?

234
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,270
Help me! Somebody, help!

235
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,910
Hey, what if his appendix
really did burst?

236
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,940
Darn it.

237
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,780
- He needs an ambulance for surgery.
- I'm dying!

238
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,710
He could actually die
if we don't do something.

239
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,080
Hurry up and call an ambulance!

240
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,750
- Unbelievable.
- My stomach!

241
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
I'm dying!

242
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,030
My stomach...

243
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,430
I'm dying! My stomach!

244
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,670
My stomach...

245
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,270
My stomach...

246
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,870
Where is that ambulance?

247
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,310
It should be here any minute.

248
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,710
Right.

249
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,480
Isn't Lawyer Kim's engagement
at the Serno Hotel?

250
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,610
It's probably happening as we speak.

251
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,850
But still, how did him pull off
an engagement so quickly?

252
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,450
He's really something else.
I'm telling you.

253
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,230
Hey, stop right there! Quick, get him!

254
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
Darn it!

255
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,700
(Congratulations on the Engagement,
Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae)

256
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,760
Thank you to all our distinguished guests
for joining us on this momentous occasion.

257
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,990
This event is not only to celebrate...

258
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,690
the engagement of Min Kyung Chae and me,

259
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,360
but also a commitment to the prosperity
of Mingang Distribution...

260
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
My apologies.

261
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,070
- What is it?
- Sir, we have a problem.

262
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,480
That old geezer, Min Doo Sik,
he just escaped.

263
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
What?

264
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,150
Got it.

265
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,890
My apologies.

266
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,490
Something very important came up.

267
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,730
(Congratulations on the Engagement,
Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae)

268
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,600
What do you mean?
How could Min Doo Sik have escaped?

269
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,200
He faked being sick to trick us,

270
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,270
and then vanished in the blink of an eye.

271
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,510
You incompetent fools!

272
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,240
Find him now!

273
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,910
Tie him up or gag him. I don't care how!
Just find him!

274
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,580
What if he shows up at the party
and makes a scene?

275
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,320
I think he might know where it is.

276
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,720
How would that old man find his way here?

277
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,990
I think he may have overheard us talking.

278
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,160
Darn it. Then you need to find him
even faster!

279
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,890
If you fail to catch him,
it's your necks on the line. Got it?

280
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Darn it.

281
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,340
What's going on?

282
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Nothing at all.

283
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,810
Why did you come out here?

284
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Let's go back inside.

285
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,690
Come to the chairman's office
at Mingang Distribution for the fare.

286
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,960
I'll pay ten times,
no, a hundred times over.

287
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,800
There's no way
he'd actually show up here, right?

288
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,070
I wish my father could have been here
to see this.

289
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,180
This is such a happy occasion,

290
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,740
but with my father being absent,

291
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,010
I can't feel completely joyful,
which is a pity.

292
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,590
I feel the same way.

293
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,960
She is an exceptionally devoted daughter,

294
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,060
and her love for her father is profound.

295
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,660
So I completely understand her wish
for the chairman to be here with us.

296
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,270
As do I.

297
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,570
Give me a break.

298
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
All right!

299
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,940
If everyone would please
raise their glasses...

300
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,310
to bless the two of us
as we begin our life together,

301
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,940
and though he cannot be here,

302
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,610
let's also make a toast to the chairman.

303
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,520
What a pathetic show.

304
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,330
You're praying for my safe return?

305
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,960
You kidnapped and imprisoned me!

306
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,830
And what do you do next?

307
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,500
Get engaged?

308
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,470
So this is your plan to take over Mingang?

309
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
You cursed fools!

310
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,480
You two are perfect for each other.

311
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,180
A pair of cockroaches.
That's what you are.

312
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,150
You're soulmates!

313
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,080
Then you deserve an engagement gift!

314
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,350
You scum!

315
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,690
You're not even human!

316
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,220
You're the scum of the earth!

317
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,660
Be gone, you evil spirits!

318
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,560
Be gone, you evil spirits!

319
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,630
Chairman, it's not what you think.
We had no other choice...

320
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,400
Father, please calm down.

321
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,100
Please, just listen to what I have to say.

322
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,430
Listen to what! Here, take this!

323
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,640
Darn it.

324
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,570
You're all the same!

325
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,740
Your own father went missing,
and none of you bothered to look for me?

326
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,310
You're all just brown-nosing
to take over the company.

327
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,750
Pathetic! Just pathetic!

328
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
You despicable fools!

329
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,220
You worthless scoundrels!

330
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,430
What are you doing?

331
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,210
Now, let us all raise a toast.

332
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,110
To the two of us,
as we take our first step toward...

333
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,340
becoming husband and wife,

334
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,580
and to the chairman, who isn't here
but will surely return soon.

335
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Cheers!

336
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,390
(Congratulations on the Engagement,
Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae)

337
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,760
Let go of me, you brats!
Didn't you hear me?

338
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,370
Lucia!

339
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,600
- Lucia!
- Quiet.

340
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,070
Hey, don't do this.

341
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,010
What's wrong?

342
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,550
I don't know. I thought I heard something.

343
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,030
Sun Jae was on cloud nine, right?

344
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,860
He was smiling from ear to ear.
He couldn't have been happier.

345
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,230
And he didn't mention me?

346
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,630
I'm his only blood relative, you know.

347
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,140
He didn't look for me?

348
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,410
When has Sun Jae ever reached out to you?

349
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,810
What do you expect?

350
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,710
Sun Jae? You can't get blood from a stone.

351
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,750
Actually, a needle probably couldn't
even pierce his skin.

352
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,950
Why would he care about
his aunt and uncle?

353
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,450
He wouldn't even invite his own parents.

354
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,950
That's just too much.

355
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,850
I may be his uneducated aunt,
but I'm still his mother's sister.

356
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,360
How can he just blow me off
completely like this?

357
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,230
Please, calm down.

358
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,230
He already acts
like he's a gift to the world,

359
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,630
and now he'll be unstoppable.

360
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,230
He'll be totally insufferable.

361
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,670
Is that what you're worried about now?

362
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,270
What if Sun Jae doesn't invite us
to the wedding either?

363
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,110
What's the big deal? It's simple.

364
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,610
If we're not invited, we don't go.

365
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,510
We won't have to bless his wedding
with our money.

366
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,180
I'm sure he'll invite you to the wedding.

367
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,050
Forget it! I'm disgusted, I wouldn't go!

368
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,150
I won't attend even if he sends
a limo to pick me up.

369
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,750
Anyway, that guy's one sharp cookie.

370
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,150
While his future father-in-law is away,
he just weasels his way in like this...

371
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,860
and snatches up the son-in-law spot
at Mingang Distribution like nothing.

372
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,230
Is being Mingang's son-in-law no big deal?

373
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,900
They look so good together.

374
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,600
A picture-perfect couple.

375
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,770
Lawyer Kim may have rushed
this engagement through,

376
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,500
but I wouldn't bet on a wedding.

377
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,340
It's not over until they're at the altar.

378
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,710
And knowing Min Kyung Chae,

379
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,140
she's not going to
just meekly accept Kim Sun Jae.

380
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,510
That's right. It'll be a struggle for them
to make it to the altar.

381
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,780
What's with you two?

382
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,620
Are you trying to comfort me?

383
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,390
You don't have to do that.

384
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,220
My Ho Se and Min Kyung Chae broke up.

385
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,390
It just means they weren't meant to be.

386
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,400
I don't have any hard feelings,
so you two can stop.

387
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,630
It's just, on a day like today,
I thought you'd be thinking of your son.

388
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,430
Of course I am.

389
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,470
Sometimes I think, if I had known Ho Se
was going to die like that,

390
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,810
I wish he'd at least left a child behind
who looked just like him.

391
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,020
I was so desperate,
I even considered that girl Se Ri...

392
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,720
to be my Ho Se's daughter.

393
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,450
That thought actually crossed my mind.

394
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,330
I think you've had enough.
You're quite drunk.

395
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,470
How is it for you, Lawyer Kim?

396
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,210
We're engaged now.

397
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,710
Do you feel any different
than how you did before?

398
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,880
For me? No, nothing's different.

399
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,980
You should head inside.
I'll see you to your door.

400
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,250
You're such a loyal retainer.

401
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,120
Very reassuring.

402
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,680
We're engaged,
but you won't let me kiss you?

403
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,420
Do you dislike me that much?

404
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,320
Do you love me?

405
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,230
Don't worry.

406
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,730
I'm a woman of my word.

407
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,900
At least you don't have any drama
with other women.

408
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,970
No cohabitation, no kids out of wedlock...

409
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,300
You don't have that kind of past, right?

410
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,870
That's the one thing I can't forgive.

411
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,040
I'm so sick of it because of my father.

412
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,450
As long as your record is clean
in that department,

413
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,450
I'll have no reason
to break off this engagement.

414
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,360
She's the one who had a live-in boyfriend
and a child out of wedlock,

415
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,400
but I'm not allowed to?

416
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,630
All right, fine.

417
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,440
If that's what Min Kyung Chae wants,

418
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,340
I'll play along.

419
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,150
Look, I'm just asking you to let me go up
to the chairman's office.

420
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,920
I told you that the chairman
wasn't in right now.

421
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,190
Then who was the person
who hitched a ride in my car that day?

422
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,890
I'm telling you,
he clearly said he was the chairman.

423
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,430
You can't just enter
the chairman's office.

424
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,430
Please leave.

425
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,230
If you keep this up,
I'll have to call the police.

426
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,600
What? If anyone should be calling
the police, it's me!

427
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,470
What's going on here?

428
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,500
This man keeps insisting
he gave the chairman a ride...

429
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,610
and that he needs to collect the fare.

430
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,140
The chairman?
Which chairman are you referring to?

431
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,180
He said he was the chairman
of Mingang Distribution...

432
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,350
and asked me to take him
to the Serno Hotel.

433
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,180
He said something about...

434
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,480
his daughter's engagement party
being there.

435
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,150
By any chance, could I see
the dashcam footage from that day?

436
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
It's him.

437
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,630
So he was there that day.

438
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,040
No wonder. I heard a noise
outside the banquet hall that day.

439
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,640
I can't believe we missed him.

440
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,680
If he were caught again,
they'd likely move him somewhere else.

441
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,810
That makes sense.
Since he's already escaped once,

442
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,750
they'll definitely take extra precautions.

443
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,720
Sir.

444
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,530
From now on, I'm not Lawyer Kim.
I'm your son-in-law.

445
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,100
And a member of
Mingang Distribution's owner family.

446
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,270
You think I'll accept you
as my son-in-law?

447
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,400
In your dreams.

448
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,870
Your approval means nothing to me.

449
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,810
I'm part of the owner family now,
and I'll be the new head of Mingang.

450
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,440
How I decide to grow this company
is the only thing that matters.

451
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,780
You think I'll actually let you...

452
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,880
and that wench Kyung Chae
get away with this?

453
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,250
- As soon as I get out of here...
- Still dreaming about that, are you?

454
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,450
You got lucky and escaped once,
is that it?

455
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,090
That's never going to happen again.

456
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,790
We're moving you.

457
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,130
To a place
where no one will ever find you.

458
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,760
That's useless. Do what you want.

459
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,030
Lucia will come to save me soon.

460
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,530
- Soon, Lucia will...
- Who?

461
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,200
Lucia?

462
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,710
You have got to be kidding me.

463
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,480
Do you even have a clue
who Lucia really is?

464
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,250
Let me tell you about Lucia.

465
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,780
She's not who you think she is!

466
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,330
What is all this?

467
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,970
Now that the engagement party is over,

468
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,030
I'm finally cleaning out
this storage room.

469
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,640
I have something to throw out too.
One second.

470
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,160
This is from back then...

471
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,630
This is my older sister.

472
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,360
If you ever see someone...

473
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,230
who looks like her,

474
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,240
will you please give me a call?

475
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,780
But why does she look so familiar?

476
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,210
No matter how I look at her,
she reminds me of someone.

477
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,410
(Searching for a missing person)

478
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,680
Don't tell me, Madam Jung?

479
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,560
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

480
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,110
I'll get straight to the point.
Let me meet your sister.

481
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,520
Where are you right now?

482
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,420
Manager Gong took the flyer to the office!

483
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,450
Hello?

484
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,460
Isn't this
Director Moon Tae Kyung's phone?

485
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,390
That voice sounds so familiar.

486
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,630
It's over for you, Baek Sul Hee.

487
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,430
Then I guess I'll just have to make
Min Se Ri end up like my Mi So.

488
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,570
You plan to hold Min Se Ri hostage?

489
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,270
Her real name is Baek Sul Hee?

490
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,770
That's right, it's her.

491
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,370
Now I remember.

492
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,740
