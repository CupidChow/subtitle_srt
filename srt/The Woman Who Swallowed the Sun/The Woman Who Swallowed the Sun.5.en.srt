00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,680
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,490
That's what happened...

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,120
to my daughter.

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,690
I had no idea.

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,930
Mom was totally clueless.

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,680
My gosh.

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,420
Are these really that potent?

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,820
I got them
from a powerful top-class shaman.

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,560
If we put them
in the CEO's and director's office,

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,030
will Ji Seop's future
really become brighter?

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,590
Not only will his future become bright,

12
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,730
but the two girls who are in his way
will shrivel like pickled cabbages.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,130
I'd love that.

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,870
Why didn't you get one
for the chairman's office too?

15
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,670
Everyone in that family is strong-minded.

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,740
The chairman is the worst of them.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,780
Yes, the chairman is my biggest worry.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,110
He's not just a worry.

19
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,750
Don't you remember?

20
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,510
When our families met before the wedding,

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,950
he scanned me like this from head to toe.

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,190
He looked bothered.

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,250
He could've just said I was beautiful.

24
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,030
That's as preposterous as saying
a starfish can turn into the moon.

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,390
Why did you show up in an evening dress?

26
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,800
We met at a Korean restaurant.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
Your lips were red too,
as if you'd been drinking blood.

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,300
I dressed like that
so he wouldn't intimidate us.

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,600
I'd spent a fortune at a salon
in Cheongdam-dong to nail that look.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,410
You should have kept the hair rollers too.

31
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,680
Anyway, these talismans
will turn our son-in-law's life...

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,680
into an 8-lane, no, a 16-lane highway.

33
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,710
Get set and go.

34
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,780
He can speed along
as if he's in a Lamborghini.

35
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,350
Vroom, vroom.

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Hello, Father.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,630
Right now?

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,280
Father!

40
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,460
(Mingang Distribution)

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,430
Take these.

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,400
- What are they?
- Something potent.

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,540
They will make you...

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
the master...

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,040
of this place.

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,780
- The master?
- Not a word.

47
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,010
Just do as I say.

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,850
- An ear.
- An ear?

49
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,210
- An ear.
- An ear.

50
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,780
- Closer.
- Closer.

51
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,180
- More.
- More.

(Mingang Distribution)

53
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,480
Stick.

(Mingang Distribution)

55
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,320
I just love this chair.

56
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,860
It's awesome.

57
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,530
Hey.

58
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,570
What are you doing here?
Where's Kyung Chae?

59
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,500
I don't know. Where could she be?

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,440
How's the new business coming on?

61
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,510
Why do you care?

62
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,780
You said you'd make Moon Tae Kyung
the general manager if he showed up.

63
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,620
That means he'll be
in full control of the business.

64
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,050
- Is that bad?
- Is that good?

65
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,250
Our company came this far
because it stayed in the family.

66
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,860
Can you handle the aftermath
of putting a stranger in charge?

67
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,460
The guy has a conscience.
We did enough research on him.

68
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,500
Even a man with the greatest conscience...

69
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,200
will want what isn't his
if he thinks no one is guarding it.

70
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,970
What do you want, then?

71
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,140
Face me.

72
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,610
We need someone on our side...

73
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,650
to watch him and protect our profits.

74
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,550
Business is about balance
and keeping people in check.

75
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,920
Why do you think Father
keeps putting you against Kyung Chae?

76
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,490
Did I ever side with her
because we were full siblings?

77
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,820
And did I ever look down on you
for being a half-sister?

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,390
Can't you put in a good word
to the chairman for me...

79
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,430
Ji Seop.

80
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,830
Shouldn't you be at your store?

81
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,600
You have nowhere to go
if you lose that job too.

82
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,640
Oh, does the warehouse
still have a vacancy?

83
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,380
What a brat.

84
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,910
She's becoming more like Kyung Chae
each day.

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,750
Darn it.

86
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,220
Once I give you this,

87
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,890
you'll end up like this.

88
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Open wide.

89
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,070
It tastes extra good
because you're feeding me.

90
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,340
Yeon Ah wanted to visit,
but I told her not to just yet.

91
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,110
Good for you. She should watch the bar.

92
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,580
Auntie would only cry
when she saw my face.

93
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,680
She's a crybaby.

94
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,090
Mi So.

95
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,720
Why didn't you tell me?

96
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,730
You met the girl
who did this to you at the coffee shop?

97
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,970
How do you know that?

98
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,470
Bo Ram told you?

99
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,810
Knowing the truth
would only make you worry.

100
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,680
It's not like you can find her
and make her pay.

101
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,520
She should pay.

102
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Should she get away
with committing a crime?

103
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,860
We don't know her name or address.

104
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,990
How will you do that?

105
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,590
It's just a waste of energy.

106
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,530
I don't think so, Mi So.

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,900
Right now,
we don't know her name or address.

108
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,000
But she must be found and punished.

109
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,570
It's stupid not to even try
because we think we can't find her.

110
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,740
Even if we fail to find her,

111
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,410
the time and energy spent isn't a waste.

112
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,480
If the victim were to give up in fear,

113
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,550
the assailants would take over the world.

114
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,720
Is that what you want?

115
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,290
No.

116
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,490
I'll find her and make her pay.

117
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,490
It's only right that people
who do wrong get punished.

118
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,560
Whoever they are.

119
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,130
They can't get away with it.

120
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,100
I was furious when Bo Ram told me
what had happened.

121
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,940
Here's a copy of the CCTV footage.

122
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,210
Everything's right there. It should help.

123
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,380
I have the original.
Tell me whenever you need it.

124
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,850
Thank you.

125
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,350
Will this be enough?

126
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,050
You'll need a statement.

127
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,860
I wrote one out already.

128
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,130
I dropped by before class.

129
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,460
Can I come with you to the police station?

130
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,600
You can go to class.

131
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,660
I'll come with you, then.

132
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,470
I can close the cafe for a while.
I'll give a statement.

133
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,640
Later. I'll tell you if it's needed.

134
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,040
Okay.

135
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,940
Whoever she is, find her and make her pay.

136
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,610
She hurt sweet Mi So so badly.

137
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,710
She's a nasty witch.

138
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,480
My point exactly.
She's the worst of the worst.

139
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,520
Ms. Baek. Find her and send her to prison.

140
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,650
You have my full support.

141
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,090
Thanks a lot.

142
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,920
That comment alone is a huge boost.

143
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,630
We can find her, right?

144
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,770
There are cameras everywhere in Korea.

145
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,100
Please find her.

146
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,210
My daughter needed surgery.

147
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,210
Not only was she physically hurt,

148
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,610
but she was mentally down too
because a girl her age assaulted her.

149
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,480
This girl could do it again
if she isn't stopped.

150
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,390
She must be found and punished.

151
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,920
I get what you mean.

152
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,060
We have video evidence and witnesses.

153
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,760
We can identify her as soon as
we get started, so go home and wait.

154
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,430
Thank you.

155
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,710
What's this?

156
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,840
It's an assault case.

157
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,150
Kids these days are worse than adults.

158
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,080
How could she think of getting revenge?

159
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,820
Hang on.

160
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,390
What is it? Do you know her?

161
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,720
I'll take this case.

162
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,230
You'll take it?

163
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,500
Small cases like this
are a lot of work for little recognition.

164
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,670
I'm not up for a promotion anyway,
so I don't mind taking it.

165
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,470
If you say so.

166
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,470
I'd appreciate that.

167
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,420
I'm stuck in the hotel right now.

168
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,490
I might have to fly back to the US.

169
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,690
I don't know. My sister said so.

170
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,900
It won't last.

171
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,460
Only until she warms up to me again?

172
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,500
I'll try lying low this time.

173
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,670
Hey.

174
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,840
I'll call you back.

175
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,380
Mr. Pauper?

176
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,880
Mister what?

177
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,710
We meet again.

178
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,150
I happen to be staying at this hotel.

179
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,020
The suite's a bit suffocating.

180
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,690
You haven't changed much.

181
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,130
You still talk loudly
on the phone in public.

182
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,160
You haven't changed much either.

183
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,830
You nag and lecture.

184
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,100
You chose the wrong target.

185
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,040
Do you know who I am?

186
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,770
Who are you?

187
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,940
I'll knock your socks off.

188
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,110
My family is pretty powerful.

189
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
My dad is Chairman Min Doo Sik.

190
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,550
Chairman Min Doo Sik...

191
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,520
of Mingang Distribution?

192
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,290
Back down if you know who he is.

193
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,530
I recently took care of someone else
who thought they could lecture me.

194
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,500
You should watch out too.

195
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,750
Why are you calling me this late,
Detective Kang?

196
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,220
We need to meet up right away.

197
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,220
It's a pretty urgent matter.

198
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,170
I recognized her right away.

199
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,900
It's the chairman's youngest, isn't it?

200
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,470
How badly was the victim hurt?

201
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,580
The injuries aren't that serious,

202
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,780
but it's the nature of it, you know.

203
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,450
It was a revenge hit.

204
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,930
I'm outside. I have something urgent
to report regarding Ms. Se Ri.

205
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,900
Lawyer Kim is outside.
I'll go talk to him for a bit.

206
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,040
Why is he here this late?

207
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,810
He must have some important news.

208
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,080
Why do you think he came all the way here?

209
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,850
I wonder what business he has.

210
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,650
He never accepted
my invitation to hang out.

211
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,130
Do you think
Kyung Chae and Sun Jae are dating?

212
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,690
Why else would he come by this late?

213
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,700
How does that work out?

214
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,130
Sun Jae is your mom's sister's son,

215
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,240
and Kyung Chae is my sister.

216
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,770
If they were to get together...

217
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,440
My goodness.

218
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,980
Enough with that nonsense
and invite him in.

219
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,740
I'll go and tell them.

220
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,560
She just got expelled
for getting into trouble.

221
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,360
She's driving me insane.

222
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,930
Calm down.

223
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,630
I'm done for if this gets out.

224
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,400
The chairman will come after me
and not just Se Ri.

225
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,540
That won't happen.

226
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,410
There's video evidence,
a statement, and witnesses.

227
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,040
The detective has everything!

228
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,250
How much...

229
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,950
do you trust me?

230
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,420
Why would you ask that?

231
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,460
How much must I trust you?

232
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,830
With everything?

233
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,500
I don't even trust myself.

234
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,800
If I clean this up,

235
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,700
will you trust me then?

236
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,610
You must be confident.

(Hankuk Hospital)

238
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,370
Is it good?

239
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,070
Hello?

240
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,670
Yes, speaking.

241
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,040
Already?

242
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,350
So soon?

243
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,880
Okay. I'll be right there.

244
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,390
The detective wants to see me.

245
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,820
They found your attacker.

246
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,760
For real?

247
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,470
I'm full of happiness and energy.

248
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,900
Goodness.

249
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,300
Sometimes
you're just like a seven-year-old.

250
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,840
You acted like you were all grown up.

251
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,240
I was actually...

252
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,240
quite afraid.

253
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,180
What were you afraid of?

254
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,620
That things wouldn't go as I was taught.

255
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,920
I was taught that the good won prizes...

256
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,630
and the bad got punished.

257
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,330
I was afraid things would be different.

258
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,730
And that I'd be disappointed.

259
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,310
That was why I said
we shouldn't look for her.

260
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,280
What did I tell you?

261
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,280
I said that the guilty get punished.

262
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,650
There are no exceptions.

263
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,620
The world is right and just.

264
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,320
See how they found her so soon?

265
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,990
Mi So.

266
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,990
Don't ever be disappointed
in how things go.

267

00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,610
Is this her?

271
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,810
Yes.

272
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,510
We got lucky.

273
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,210
The CCTV footage helped,

274
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,980
and Wu Bo Ram testified this was the girl.

275
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Oh, right.

276
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,620
The assailant confessed everything.

277
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,900
Are you okay? You're fine?

278

No.

281

This isn't her.

282

You didn't do it.

286
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,260
I did it.

287
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,840
What got into you? You can't lie.
Do you know where we are?

288

I don't know why you're doing this,
but you shouldn't.

Your life is at stake.

292
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,480
I did it, okay?

293
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,390
I beat your daughter into a pulp.

294
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,920
Got that?

295
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,930
But...

296
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,330
Hey.

297
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,500
Don't you remember me? We met.

298
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,540
When some mean girls
were bullying you in an alley,

299
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,070
I chased them away for you.

300
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,870
No. I don't know you. How would I?

301
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,940
Lock me up already.

302
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,620
This means the case is closed.

303
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,790
You could sue for compensation
in civil court,

304
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,590
but she's a minor...

305
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,660
and an orphan.

306
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,590

You're making a really bad choice.

310
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,370
You can't take this back.

311
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,240
Why would you take the fall
for someone else?

312
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,240
You can't do this, whatever the reason.

313

- Wait.

00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,760
Someone else did it.

322
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,060
Just go home.

323
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,900
This is obstruction, okay?

324
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,200
I put in the work to catch the attacker
and this is what I get?

325

I was wrong.

339
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,530
If the victim were to give up prosecuting,

340
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,230
the assailant would get cocky.

341
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,600
They'd think they could
get away with anything they wanted.

Mom. Why are you so distracted?

346

No, never mind.

347
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,930
Your team will get extra busy
when the new business kicks off.

in the company.

but the position is still vacant.

I thought it would be rude
to intrude that late.

You must've had a reason
to risk that to come by.

I know you well.

363
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,200

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,400
It's not worth reporting.

365
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,940
You're loyal to CEO Min to the end?

366
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,810
I apologize.

367
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,940
Why apologize when that's your job?

368
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,480
Are you updating the ledger?

369
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,010
Of course, sir.

370
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,480
People who don't know anything
talk about making money honestly.

371
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,350
You can't run a business
without breaking a few rules.

372
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,490
You have the final say
in what's legal or not.

373
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,760
You know I consider you my family, right?

374
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,730
Yes.

375
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,810
I'm sorry, Chairman.

376
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,210
That's not good enough for me.

377
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,750
I need to become your actual family.

378
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,760
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

379
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,590
(Mingang Distribution)

380
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,640
Where's the CEO?

381
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,970
I don't know her schedule.

382
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,310
I'm surprised to hear
there are things you don't know.

383
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,580
I only know her work-related appointments.

384
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,780
Come on.

385
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,990
You're closer to her
than her personal assistant.

386
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,950
Is there something...

387
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,790
she must handle in secret
that not even you can know?

388
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,860
It's more likely something personal.

389
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,390
Isn't that the same thing?

390
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,300
My sister...

391
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,570
has only one issue
that could be that personal.

392
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,870
Is it about Se Ri?

393
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,340
I have no idea.

394
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,970
You'd say that.

395
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,780
You must pretend you don't know
even if you do.

396
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,860
I'm packed and ready.

397
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,300
Where's my plane ticket?

398
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,600
I'll go back to the US as you said.

399
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,570
When you got deported from Canada
for causing trouble,

400
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,980
I barely stopped Father
from putting you in a psych ward.

401
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,910
Why bring that up again?
It's not a fun topic.

402
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,720
I'd never seen Father
get that angry before.

403
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,490
He'd have killed you
if you were within arm's reach.

404
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,360
He screamed and not even Ji Seop
or Soo Jung could calm him,

405
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,490
but I did.

406
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,030
I said I'd retaliate
if he got you admitted.

407
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,360
I threatened to join you.
That's how I made him give up.

408
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,500
I know that.

409
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,470
You're always on my side.

410
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,440
You said my life was flawless.

411
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,510
I thought so too.

412
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,780
But there is one flaw.

413
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,050
What is it?

414
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,590
You caused a scene at a coffee shop.

415
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,520
You argued with a girl your age...

416
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,690
whom you tracked down and assaulted.

417
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,790
She's in hospital following
emergency surgery.

418
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,200
She reported you and wants you charged.

419
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,070
A detective is on the case
which is still open.

420
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,670
It won't be long before they identify you.

421
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,540
And Father will find out.

422
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,610
Kyung Chae. I'm sorry.

423
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,250
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

424
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,910
Don't beg.

425
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,580
It won't help anyway.

426
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,790
What's this?

427
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,160
Can't you tell?

428
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,660
It's a psych ward consent form.

429
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,230
(Psychiatric Ward Admittance Consent Form)

430
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,300
(Name: Min Se Ri)

431
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,730
Do you see my signature?

432
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,440
Once you go in, there's no getting out.

433
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,300
As a corpse, maybe.

434
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,270
Who in our family would get you out?

435
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,980
Everyone is sick and tired of you.

436
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,610
They'd welcome this wholeheartedly...

437
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,110
because then they could split
your share of the company.

438
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Kyung Chae.

439
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,320
I'd rather you hit and slap me...

440
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,350
Why would I do that?

441
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,790
You'll get beaten up
more than enough in the ward.

442
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,590
Kyung Chae. I'm so sorry.

443
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm really sorry for what I did.

444
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,170
Father hates family issues
more than anything.

445
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,900
He won't accept his offspring tarnishing
the image of the company he built up.

446
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,510
That's why
I cleaned up your mess every time.

447
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,440
It's over now.

448
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,540
You won't cause more trouble...

449
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,150
and I won't have to
cover anything up in secret.

450
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,750
Enjoy your time in there.

451
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,620
Kyung Chae.

452
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,250

(Mingang Distribution)

454
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,840
How did she react?

455
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,540
The usual way.

456
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,840
She cried, begged on her knees,
and apologized.

457
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,980
It's so obvious.

458
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,880
All that stress
gave me a splitting headache.

459
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,990
I'll help with that.

460
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Stay still.

461
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,770
My gosh.

462
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,940
It's pretty hot in here.

463
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,670
Give me the documents.

464
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,690
You're still here?

465
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,440
The detective in charge is my informant.

466
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,940
We bought the witness,

467
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,880
and the evidence is useless now.

468
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,140
He'll have closed the case.

469
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,310
Already?

470
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,950
Such issues must be handled quickly.

471
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,490
You won't praise me for my work?

472
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,950
"Praise?"

473
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,390
What would you like?

474
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,130
This evening.

475
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,560
Are you free?

(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

477
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,420
Something is off.

478
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,620
Bo Ram won't take my calls
or read my texts.

479
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,820
I won't testify.

480
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,290
I won't do anything anymore.

481
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,830
You caught the culprit. Isn't that enough?

482
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,590
I'll find her and punish her.

483
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,230
There's more to our relationship
than superior and subordinate.

484
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,330
Would we work as a couple,
a man and a woman?

485
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,070
Who on earth is the real culprit?

486
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,940
If you had to find a stand-in,

487
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,570
she must be from a great family.

488
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,940
This is my final goodbye.

489
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,810
I won't appear before you again,
Kyung Chae.

490
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,080
Take care.
