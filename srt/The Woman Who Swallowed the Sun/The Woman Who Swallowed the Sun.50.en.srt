1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,710
Welcome. It's extra nice
to see you at home.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,040
You're today's guest?

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,150
Are you doing okay?

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,620
Welcome.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,020
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,520
Do you know her?

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,260
Why are you at our house?

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,290
The VIP we were expecting...

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,800
- Father, is...
- Eat first.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,370
We'll talk later.

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,910
Father, is...

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
Stop it.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,950
I'm curious.

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,510
Wait.

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,020
I can't wait.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,430
You should taste it first.

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,130
You try it first.

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,560
Then let's try it together.

19
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,200
Shall we?

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,440
Taste this too.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Okay.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,050
Why are you putting yourself
on that cliff?

23
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,120
Why?

24
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,520
I'll drag you away...

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,020
from this horrifying place.

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,000
Open this door.

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Let me in!

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,700
Lucia!

29
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,400
Get out of there, Lucia!

30
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,870
Come outside.

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,370
- Open the...
- Who is it?

32
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,850
Who's there?

33
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,490
Hello?

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,860
Are you out of your mind?

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,660
Why the heck did you go there
and cause a scene?

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
What if Min Doo Sik suspects something...

37
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,930
and looks into who you are?

38
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,300
He wouldn't leave you alone if he knew...

39
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,940
you loved his lover.

40
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,810
I can't ignore what's going on.

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,310
You have to.

42
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,710
Don't do anything to get yourself noticed.

43
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,240
Especially if it'll create animosity.

44
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,780
I was worried what you'd do.

45
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,750
I'm glad I came after you.

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,420
Your family will badmouth me...

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,160
for barging in for a free meal
and staying for a drink.

48
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,090
You didn't barge in,
and it wasn't a free meal.

49
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,390
I invited you and treated you as a guest.

50
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,010
I like the feel of this space.

51
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,470
You can visit often.

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
The house is always open to you.

53
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,750
Your family will feel uncomfortable
if I visit too often.

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,850
So what? Who cares when you're my guest?

55
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,320
You look great.

56
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,090
I'd wanted to dye your hair for you.

57
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,830
The elegant salt-and-pepper hair
suits you too,

58
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,560
but you're still young.

59
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,200
I'm not. I'm flailing around
to look young.

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,970
I hope people won't take us
for father and daughter now.

61
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,380
You remind me of a poem I know.

62
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,780
Shall I recite it for you?

63
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,350
A poem?

64
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,010
Go ahead.

65
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,520
"To my coffee, I added sugar."

66
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,860
"I added cream too, but it tastes bland."

67
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,260
"Oh, I forgot to add a spoonful of you."

68
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,160
That's the poem?

69
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,170
It's silly.

70
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,640
It's cool, not silly.

71
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,410
It means even the best-tasting coffee
isn't as good as a loved one.

72
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,510
That's love for you.

73
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,410
Yes. That's what love is like.

74
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,530
It feels like hundreds of caterpillars
are crawling all over me.

75
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,830
Did you see the look in Father's eyes?

76
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,900
He's falling in love.

77
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,670
No way! He's just interested in her.

78
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,700
No. Let's be honest.
Why would he be interested in her...

79
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,870
of all people?

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,120
What bad blood brought us together?

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,350
Don't dwell on that.

82
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,590
I can't help it.

83
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,690
Where did things start to go wrong?

84
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,630
Where did the bad blood come from?

85
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,460
It's my fault.

86
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,070
I should've gotten her fired sooner.

87
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,110
I shouldn't have brought her to Mingang
in the first place.

88
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,410
It's my fault.

89
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,250
Did you know about Dad and that lady?

90
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,420
Why would you call her "that lady?"

91
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,820
Whatever. Did you know about them?

92
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,360
Why? Are you against the relationship?

93
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,160
You don't like them as a couple?

94
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,360
Well, would my thought count?

95
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,460
You must have an idea.

96
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,170
I don't dislike her.

97
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,110
To be honest, I like her.
I think she's a nice person.

98
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,180
What if the two were to get married?

99
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,810
Are you for it?

100
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,690
Not bad, Lucia.

101
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,250
When did you win over Se Ri?

102
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,090
If you feel that bothered,

103
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,260
go out on a limb and fire her.

104
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,900
Then I'll clean up...

105
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,100
It's too late for that.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,700
Getting her fired now
won't stop the chairman from loving her.

107
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,540
But out of sight...

108
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,770
You know what the chairman is like.

109
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,810
When did he ever give up on
something he wanted?

110
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,680
That woman is a problem.

111
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,980
She ruined your relationship
with the chairman.

112
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,320
She's evil.

113
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,220
Since we're on the topic...

114
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,790
That woman.

115
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,030
Could you sort her out for me?

116
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,130
What do you mean by "sort her out?"

117
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,440
There are lots of options.

118
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,370
If you do that,

119
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,840
I'll think about it.

120
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,480
What it is you want.

121
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,050
What I want?

122
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,840
CEO Min is running late.

123
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,740
Why care about someone
who went out to avoid seeing you?

124
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,510
Don't be like that.

125
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,680
It's as if I drove a wedge
between you two,

126
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,040
and it makes me uncomfortable.

127
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,310
Don't worry about that wedge.

128
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,680
She's too cold toward me.

129
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,150
I trusted her the most,
and she betrayed me.

130
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,090
You're family,
and that bond is unbreakable.

131
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,790
I know that.

132
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,320
I just can't stand the way she treats you.

133
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,560
It depends on how you see it.

134
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,200
Things will get better in time.

135
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,700
Can I use your bathroom?

136
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Yes.

137
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,630
Are you looking for the toilet?

138
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,570
I want to wash my hands.

139
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,470
There's one downstairs.

140
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Is there?

141
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,680
Hello, Lawyer Kim.

142
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,510
Ms. Kyung Chae?

143
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,420
Not yet.

144
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,920
Bring her home anyway.

145
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,430
Is Ms. Min reluctant to come home
because of me?

146
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,030
No.

147
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,060
You're Manager Gong, right?

148
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,270
You should look out for Ms. Min.

149
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
The chairman disapproves of her right now,

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,810
and we don't want
their relationship to worsen.

151
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,740
You don't have to worry
about things like that.

152
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,810
I am worried, though.

153
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,120
I think my nerves got to me.

154
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,520
I feel a bit cold.
Is there anything I could borrow?

155
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,190
A cardigan would be nice.

156
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,290
I'll ask Ms. Soo Jung for something.

157
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,990
Director Min's clothes won't fit me.

158
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,360
The CEO's might.

159
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,470
I can't lend you her clothing
when she's not in.

160
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,600
I'll just cover my shoulders with it.
You can get it washed later.

161
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,540
The chairman is waiting for me.

162
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,010
Come with me, then.

163
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,060
Here.

164
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,660
I'd prefer this.

165
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,530
You can't wear this.
It belonged to her late mother.

166
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,770
Hello, sir.

167
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,840
Yes, sure. I'll get it for you.

168
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,930
Why are you so drunk?

169
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,160
She had a lot to drink for some reason.

170
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,330
Is the woman gone?

171
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,900
You're back.

172
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,440
Manager Gong.
Some hot honey water, please.

173
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,410
Let me take this to the chairman first.

174
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,350
Manager Gong.

175
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,850
Who are you ordering about?

176
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,890
What's this?

177
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
This...

178
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,690
Are you out of your mind?

179
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,160
Was my mom's ring not enough?

180
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,870
I didn't know.
I was going to return it shortly.

181
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,140
Take it off.

182
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,940
- Leave me alone.
- Take it off!

183
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,480
- Ms. Kyung Chae!
- Give it back!

184
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,250
- Calm down!
- It's my mom's!

185
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,810
- Ms. Min!
- How dare you wear this?

186
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,520
- Let go of it!
- That's enough.

187
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,080
- Let me go!
- I won't let you get away with it.

188
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,420
- What do you think you're doing?
- Darn you!

189
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,690
Stop it.

190
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,290
- Darn it.
- What got into you?

191
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,530
- No, stop.
- Let go.

192
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,430
That woman wore Mom's cardigan!

193
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,600
Kyung Chae!

194
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,230
Darn you.

195
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,840
You spoiled brat.

196
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,310
You think so little of me
that you even abuse my guest?

197
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,750
What about you?

198
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,520
How could you give her Mom's ring
and bring her home?

199
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,550
Didn't you belittle me first?

200
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,960
What is that woman to you?

201
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,890
I should go.

202
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,500
Mr. Kim. Go after her.

203
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,840
Yes, sir.

204
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,750
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

205
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,690
To get the CEO riled up.

206
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,200
What are you talking about?

207
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,700
How can you say that
when you saw what happened?

208
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,140
What are you thinking?

209
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,670
You know what I'm thinking.

210
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,280
Do you actually think
you can marry the chairman?

211
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,110
He can't be trusted.

212
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,450
He has a fiery temper
and changes his mind many times a day.

213
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,920
No one can guess
what he's thinking at any given time.

214
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,690
There's no guarantee
his feelings for you will last.

215
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,890
You should worry about the CEO right now.

216
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,460
You saw how she crumbled
and got stomped all over too.

217
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,600
That was crass of her.

218
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,970
How will she face the family
in the morning?

219
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,600
Stop what you're doing.

220
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,570
I get why you did it.

221
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,810
Don't go any further.

222
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,040
If you get why I'm doing this,
you shouldn't tell me to stop.

223
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,410
Will this bring your daughter back?

224
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,610
You keep saying...

225
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,020
she's "my" daughter.

226
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,490
I guess it was fortunate for Mi So
that she died not knowing...

227
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,360
you were her father.

228
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,690
- You really...
- I'm just getting started.

229
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,430
I have lots of fun stuff planned.

230
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,700
Don't tell me to stop already.

231
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,700
Look forward to it.

232
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,390
Why are you staring at me?

233
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,790
Never mind.

234
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,470
If you quit going to the academy,
learn something else.

235
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,240
Do you want to waste
the rest of your life?

236
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,270
I told you that you decided your worth.

237
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,210
One wrong move can ruin your future.

238
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,340
Stay sharp.

239
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,180
Your hair and clothes are a mess.
Can't you clean yourself up?

240
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,420
Is Kyung Chae still in bed?

241
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,620
She'd be too embarrassed to get up...

242
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,260
after what happened last night.

243
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,830
I've never seen Kyung Chae look so bad.

244
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,200
She acted like
she was so classy and elegant.

245
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,170
She's just like anyone else
when she's furious.

246
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,170
It's a pity
I didn't get a video of the fiasco.

247
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,940
How could your father do that?

248
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,010
He should've given...

249
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,150
his late wife's ring to me.
I'm married to his eldest son.

250
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,690
How could he give it to that woman?

251
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Manager Gong. Coffee, please.

252
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,200
What the heck?

253
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,610
You'll lose yet again if you let
your emotions get the better of you.

254
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,610
- What?
- That woman.

255
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,120
She's no pushover.

256
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,790
What do you mean?

257
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,760
I told her the cardigan
belonged to your late mother,

258
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,060
and I even told her not to touch it.

259
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,860
But she wore it on purpose?

260
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,230
She knew how I would react.

261
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,600
I'm too ashamed to even face you.

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,400
Don't scold Ms. Min too harshly.

263
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,470
It was just a drunken incident.

264
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,040
It wasn't just an incident.
I know my own daughter.

265
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,910
She planned it.

266
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,080
She went out to get drunk
and start a fight with you.

267
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,020
I told you to think positively.

268
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,890
If you don't, I'll have the worst time
caught in the middle.

269
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,320
She has never acted like this before.

270
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,930
I really don't mind it,
so don't let it get to you.

271
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,060
I'll happily come over
if you invite me again.

272
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,600
You will?

273
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,730
Of course. It's where you are.

274
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,540
You told me...

275
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,880
she had a grudge against Min Doo Sik too.

276
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,180
Let her get it out of her system
her own way.

277
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,620
You share a target,

278
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,050
but you suffered different tragedies,
which scarred you differently.

279
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,220
Everyone has their own thoughts and plans.

280
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,720
Some people don't care
if they get hurt as long as...

281
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,660
they can ruin the other person.

282
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,000
To people like that,
their life is fuel for revenge.

283
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,070
It means nothing else.

284
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,230
Do you have anything to say to me?

285
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,200
Shouldn't you have something to say?

286
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,050
(Mingang Distribution)

287
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,860
Where are you?

288
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,360
I'm at home.

289
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,100
I'll be in soon.

290
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,870
Okay.

291
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,440
That woman. Could you sort her out for me?

292
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,210
If you do that,

293
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,610
I'll think about it.

294
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,450
What it is you want.

295
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,220
If I get rid of Sul Hee for her,

296
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,250
will she marry me or something?

297
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,660
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

298
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,100
If we get married...

299
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,140
and Min Kyung Chae becomes chairwoman,

300
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,540
will this desk...

301
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,610
become mine?

302
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,680
What happened in that house last night?

303
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,820
- Director.
- I told you.

304
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,820
I know why you're doing this,

305
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,660
but that's exactly why
I can't let it go on.

306
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,730
You get where I'm coming from
even when no one else can.

307
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,860
Getting the reason doesn't mean
I agree with what you're doing.

308
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,130
I never asked for your agreement.
This is my personal business.

309
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,470
I shouldn't have to stop because
someone unrelated to it tries to stop me.

310
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,770
Does saying that make you feel better?

311
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,740
Do I really mean nothing to you at all?

312
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,350
When it comes to what I'm after...

313
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,050
Don't try to stop me.
What if everything goes wrong?

314
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,560
If you're that worried about me,
stop it right now.

315
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,190
No.

316
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,430
Let's do it together.

317
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,330
Whether it's revenge...

318
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,400
or falling in love.

319
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,970
No. I can't do things your way.

320
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,370
Why not?

321
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,440
Because I know from experience
that the law doesn't help...

322
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,840
the penniless and powerless!

323
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,290
Fine.

324
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,950
Do whatever you want.

325
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,720
I'll do whatever I want too.

326
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,300
I'll do everything within my power
to stop you.

327
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,470
I'd rather get in your way...

328
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,340
than watch you ruin your life.

329
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,900
Do you feel all right?

330
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,870
Why wouldn't I?

331
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,440
Last night at your place...

332
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,780
What happened last night?

333
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,310
Nothing happened. Forget it.

334
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,420
I get that you love money,

335
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,820
but who would hang this in their house?

336
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,830
The money-crazed fool who hung that...

337
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,930
in his house is right here.

338
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,430
Oh, dear.

339
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,530
You say too much
when you're staying for free...

340
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,230
in the money-crazed fool's house.

341
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,470
I see how he became
a legendary loan shark.

342
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,040
Why? Do I look like a loan shark?

343
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,470
I don't know how long you'll be here for,

344
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,710
but I'd appreciate it if you'd
watch your language while you're here.

345
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,580
Anything that gets on my nerves is banned.

346
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,950
He'll never let me look inside his safe.

347
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,250
What should I do to get to him?

348
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,990
Are you wondering how to get to me
so you can stay for longer?

349
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,030
Honey. Come and have some fruit.

350
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,800
You can join us.

351
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,200
- Thank...
- Fruit is expensive.

352
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,170
Give him corn or plain rice cakes.

353
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,910
Why are you holed up in your room?

354
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,720
You've been acting weird since
you got back from Min Doo Sik's home.

355
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,990
Tae Kyung figured everything out.

356
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,520
No.

357
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,160
I think he knew all along...

358
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,160
who I was.

359
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,930
Are you serious?

360
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,130
What a twist.

361
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,140
Now two people know who you are.
Kim Sun Jae...

362
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,770
and Moon Tae Kyung.

363
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,770
One is threatening you with the knowledge.

364
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,880
I wonder what the other will do.

365
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,410
He told me to stop what I was doing.

366
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,950
He called me a moth
flying to a flame, knowing it'll die.

367
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,520
So what?

368
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,460
Sometimes you must do
what you're meant to do.

369
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,430
You're not wavering, are you?

370
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,860
I'm more worried he'll waver, not me.

371
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
That he'll give up on getting revenge
because of you?

372
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,970
Could you...

373
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,380
go somewhere with Tae Joo?

374
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,120
Hello.

375
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,130
I'll text you my address.

376
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,030
Can you come over right now?

377
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,140
You've been...

378
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,810
staying here ever since you got back?

379
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,420
With Stella Jang?

380
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,200
(Neul Chan Middle School)

381
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,000
She looked a lot like her mom.

382
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,140
(Baek Mi So)

383
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,080
I just couldn't...

384
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,980
throw anything away.

385
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,480
I get it.

386
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,960
She worked part-time...

387
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,400
to buy this for me on my birthday.

388
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,070
Don't tell me if it hurts too much.

389
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,970
After Mi So died,

390
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,010
I was unable to speak,
and I sleepwalked too.

391
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,140
I know. I remember.

392
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,910
You couldn't answer
when we met in the hotel lobby.

393
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,050
It took a while to get better,
even after I moved to the US.

394
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,620
I struggled for a long time.

395
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,230
I couldn't speak.

396
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,700
I kept going outside at night.

397
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,930
That's why...

398
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,970
you shouldn't ruin yourself.
So you don't suffer like that again.

399
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,100
I won't ask you to do anything with me.

400
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,970
Just watch what I do.

401
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,380
I'll see to it that Min Doo Sik
pays the price.

402
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,050
Can't you wait until then?

403
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,520
Okay. If you don't like how I do things,

404
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,650
let's do what you want.

405
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,160
No. Don't do that.

406
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,630
Follow your parents' teachings.

407
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,560
That's why you've worked
and waited for four years.

408
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,470
What do you want me to do, then?

409
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,970
Should I just watch
the woman I love ruin herself?

410
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,340
No, I won't! I can't do that!

411
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,580
I'll stop you, whatever it takes.

412
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,350
- Don't do that.
- Why not?

413
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,360
When I was in the US,

414
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,760
I kept going out at night to sleepwalk.

415
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,130
That's how I ended up...

416
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,600
with these scars.

417
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,470
I was ashamed of them at first,

418
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,610
but not anymore.

419
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,310
These scars...

420
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
remind me...

421
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,860
of what I must do.

422
