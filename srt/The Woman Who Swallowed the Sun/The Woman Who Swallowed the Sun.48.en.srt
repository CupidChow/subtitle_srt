1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,310
You'll bring that woman to our house?

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,010
Watch how you address her!

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,010
Do you want me to say she's my stepmother?

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,150
Why are you doing this?

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,220
What about you?

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,090
I know how much you want my title,

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,860
but how dare
you harm the company to get it?

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,090
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,530
Your brother, Ji Seop.

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,100
If he lost his shares
for sabotaging the business,

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,300
you were going to take it all.
Do you think I wouldn't catch on?

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,400
That's why you egged on that moron!

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,100
So you could take his shares
and then take me on!

14
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,040
Who told you that? Was it that woman?

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,580
Are you yelling at me
because of what she said?

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,010
Get a hold of yourself.

17
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,350
Don't fall for a vixen...

18
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,780
who's trying to get between us!

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,290
How dare you?

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,650
Watching Kyung Chae...

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,690
lie about everything to our father...

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,690
made me so angry.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,590
Why did you sign the letter of indemnity?

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,660
It was the only way
to make sure Father would trust me.

25
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,730
The sly fox knew you'd bring
a fake contract and made you...

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,300
sign that thing so you'd take the blame.

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,240
What will you do now?

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,310
He wanted me gone. He said I was fired.

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,080
I'm sick of the place.
I don't want to work there.

30
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,450
I'll be jobless for a while.

31
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,080
This is insane.

32
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,690
Will you let Kyung Chae
get away with this?

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,690
You got fired.
You might as well take her on.

34
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,730
I hope it doesn't scar.

35
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,910
What happened?

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,570
This has never happened before
since I got hired.

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,610
The chairman has a fiery temper,
but he never treated you like this.

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,420
It's such an upsetting sight.

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,120
How could the chairman do this to you?

40
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,490
What wouldn't he do
if he's crazy about a woman?

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,190
What do you mean?

42
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,090
He's seeing someone.

43
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,430
She works at Mingang.

44
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,660
What?

45
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,600
There's more to the story.

46
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,540
That woman...

47
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,270
is the same age as me.

48
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,570
My gosh.

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
Is my smart CEO sister home?

50
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,350
Keep it down. Ms. Kyung Chae
is in a bad mood right now.

51
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,590
I'm in a bad mood myself!

52
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,760
But...

53
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,700
Min Kyung Chae. Come out here.

54
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,210
Didn't you hear me?

55
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,720
Let's be honest.
Don't you think you should...

56
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
at least apologize to me?

57
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,620
Whose fault is it that I got fired?

58
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,060
If you had a drink,
go to your room and sleep it off.

59
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,560
You can't do this to me!

60
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,660
I'd let it slide if you were Soo Jung,

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,430
but we're full siblings.

62
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,170
You stabbed me in the back,

63
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,170
and that's immoral. Do you get it?

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,300
Take it up with our father.

65
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,270
He's the one who distrusts you the most.

66
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,280
You wait and see.

67
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,390
At the crucial moment,
see which sister I side with.

68
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,490
My gosh.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,040
Where's Kyung Chae?

70
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,370
She left early in the morning.

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Goodness.

72
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,840
Don't think of coming to the office again.

73
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,650
Be grateful I didn't disown you.

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
Okay.

(Mingang Distribution)

76
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,650
Do you have more luck than competence?

77
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,920
You survive each and every crisis.

78
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,490
I'm sorry if that's how you view me.

79
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,260
I did the best I could.

80
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,730
I guess that wasn't good enough for you.

81
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,160
Now you even talk back.

82
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,900
You used to be humble at least.

83
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,600
I'm surrounded by people who want me gone.

84
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,040
I decided I couldn't afford to be humble.

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,270
So you'll say whatever you want,
even if it's unwelcome advice?

86
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,910
That's not what I meant.

87
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,280
You and I are incompatible.

88
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,480
I had high hopes for you at one time.

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,140
Going up.

92
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,880
The doors are closing.

93
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,490
Do you have plans this evening?

94
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,890
Not really.

95
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,800
Then join me for dinner.
I have something to say too.

96
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,670
You said you'd be responsible,
and you should be.

97
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,440
What was that about?

98
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Shall I not ask?

99
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,180
Do I not have the right
to ask you anything?

100
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,820
I don't know how this might sound.

101
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,330
I'm worried about how close
you're getting with the chairman.

102
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,670
I know what you're worried about,
Director.

103
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,730
I'm not talking as your director.

104
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,270
I'm talking as Moon Tae Kyung, the man.

105
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,340
- Director.
- I know.

106
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,380
I know you don't do something
unless you have a reason.

107
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,110
You must have a reason for doing this.

108
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,220
Like how I had a reason to join Mingang.

109
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,150
Ms. Lucia.

110
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,350
Don't take a path
with an obvious dead end.

111
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,990
What if you must go all the way
to see what happens?

112
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,860
Whatever choice you make,

113
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,760
you will lose something.

114
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,700
If I make a choice despite that,
that will be because...

115
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,270
I want something so desperately
that I'm willing to take the chance.

116
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,750
Did you leave
at the crack of dawn to avoid me?

117
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,120
Why did you cut your hair?
Are you protesting?

118
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,860
Wouldn't it be nice to go with the flow?

119
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,730

"Go with the flow?"

121
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,900
Since when did you allow
just anyone into our house?

122
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,840
Despite her best efforts,
you never let Soo Jung's mother move in.

123
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,680
Our house.

124
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,110
It was my late mother's dream house.

125
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,310
You were busy at work,

126
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,050
so she picked out every brick
and every pane of glass.

127
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,850
She built the house
she wanted to grow old in.

128
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,160
She just died before her time.

Who else do we have issues with?

137
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,190
You should go.
The chairman wants to see you.

Why haven't you approved
the contract Lucia brought us?

139
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,460
I don't think Legal can sign off on it.

Why not?

I'm not being negative.

148
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,510
I don't understand how someone like you
could trust her so completely.

149
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,280
There's no way I can't trust her.

She comes to the rescue
whenever the company is in peril.

But Ms. Min is so against the idea.

152

She has much more to learn
when it comes to judging people.

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,090
You don't know what this is about.
I owe her, and that's why I'm doing this!

181
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,990
Since when did you care
about owing others?

182
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,730
Go home!

183
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,940
How dare you treat my visitor like this?

184
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,220
Don't be like this already.

185
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,320
Pretty soon, your sister
will play dead if I tell her to.

186
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,600
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

187
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,670
Number 27, please come in.

188
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,740
- This is your table.
- Welcome.

189
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,310
You can sit here.

190
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,110
- And you here.
- Thanks.

191
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,650
Dear valued customers.
Nothing is more important than our health.

192
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,620
Health equals money,
and it also equals making money.

193
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,150
You're making money by eating our food.

194
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,390
Enjoy the goat soup and become rich.

195
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,590
- Excuse me.
- Yes. I'm Oh Pan Sool,

196
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,930
and I look to be 29
because I only ate what was good for me.

197
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,160
Can I help you?

198
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,400
Do you have anything for children?

199
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,530
We do. We have a whole list of that.

200
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,070
Take a look and order all you'd like.

201
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,470
Hey, there are lots of customers.

202
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,040
Father?

203
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,350
- Hello.
- Mom, Dad.

204
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,580
Why are you here
when you should be at work?

205
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,360
So your father did this?

206
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,330
Is that it?

207
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,090
Yes.

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,330
Have some soup.

209
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,600
You'll need something to soothe
your stomach if you drank all night.

210
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,110
This is so nice and refreshing.

211
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,350
We served some other things too.
Try them all.

212
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,760
He might feel bad for you later on.

213
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,690
Do you think he'll call you back?

214
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,060
- My gosh.
- Hey, don't.

215
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,900
I know the food is good,
but stop eating and start talking.

216
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,100
Were you starved?

217
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,840
Ja Kyung. Or my beautiful wife.

218
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,970
My fingers keep curling into a fist.
Will you straighten them for me?

219
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,770
- You...
- Stop it.

220
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,140
Here.

221
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,890
(Public telephone)

222
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,600
I'll die before my time
if I don't do something.

223
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,360
Let's see...

224
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,840
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

225
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,110
Hello?

226
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,450
Is that Moon Tae Kyung's phone?

227
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,550
Yes, speaking. Who's this?

228
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,780
It's Jo Pil Doo.

229
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,190
I was afraid you'd changed your number.

230
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,130
Do you think we could meet up today?

231
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,260
Yes, sure.

232
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,200
I'll come over after work.

233
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,110
(Samcheonri Briquette)

234
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,420
Aren't you worried
I might disappear again?

235
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,920
Why wouldn't I worry?

236
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,420
I'm thinking of tying you up right now
so you can't run away.

237
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,230
You would.

238
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,400
I'm at your mercy.

239
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,370
I know what I did wrong.

240
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,270
Why didn't you go
where I'd never find you?

241
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,640
Why did you call me?

242
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,610
I never slept peacefully...

243
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,940
a day in my life because of Min Doo Sik.

244
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,810
He chases me even in my dreams.

245
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,850
Do you think...

246
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,150
you could take me in and keep me safe?

247
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,820
I live on the street,

248
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,420
and he might kill me without a trace.

249
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,030
I know I shouldn't, but I called you...

250
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,900
because I had no other option.

251
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,240
I enjoyed our last meal together.

252
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,070
What will you buy me this time?

253
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,880
We can eat a bit later.

254
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,550
Take this first.

255
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,690
Did you think I'd call you my girlfriend
and not do anything else?

256
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,760
Open it.

257
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,740
It belonged to my late wife.

258
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,710
Hello, Chairman Jung.

259
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,720
I'm still looking into that.

260
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,190
There aren't any issues.

261
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,350
I can't help it if you don't want it.

262
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,890
I didn't think you'd reject it right away.

263
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,100
You scared me.

264
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,210
No one has ever kept me on my toes
the way you do.

265
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,110
Were you nervous?

266
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,010
You almost had me.

267
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,110
I was worried you'd say no.

268
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,820
Why would I?

269
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,250
I'm yours now.

270
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,330
Did you find out anything else
while working at Mingang?

271
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,000
No.

272
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,400
Why not hire someone to mess him up?

273
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,770
Why are you just watching what happens?

274
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,510
It's not personal revenge I'm after.

275
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,640
I want Min Doo Sik
to pay for his crimes in court...

276
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,280
so my parents can be cleared.

277
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,420
I'll quit drinking and go to rehab.

278
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,080
When I become a credible witness,

279
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,490
I'll testify in court.

280
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,390
Do you think you could take me in...

281
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,200
until then?

282
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,470
The design is outdated,

283
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,410
but it'll cost a lot
because it's a real diamond.

284
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,480
It's how you feel that's more important.

285
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,080
Where did you get the idea
to give me this?

286
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,180
Most men don't care enough about details.

287
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,580
I'm pretty sensitive like that.

288
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,460
I'll come clean.

289
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,060
Soo Jung told me what to do.

290
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,570
If you've made up your mind,
you must make it known to her.

291
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,570
Women don't like men
who are nothing but talk.

292
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,140
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Lucia.

293
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,410
Give her a ring
if you want to call her yours.

294
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,980
You'll just call her that?

295
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,180
I'm too old
to go around shopping for a ring.

296
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,080
Don't get one at a random store.

297
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,680
They don't mean anything.

298
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,360
Your late wife's ring.
I think that would work.

299
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,030
Lucia deserves that ring.

300
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,730
She saved you and Se Ri.
You could give her something better.

301
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,770
I think she's charming, and I'm a woman.

302
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,300
I'd fall for her if I were a man.

303
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,910
Don't lose her and regret it later.
Grab her while you can.

304
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,480
Will you do as I say from now on?

305
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,980
Why won't you answer?

306
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,150
We took the long way round...

307
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,790
when there was a shortcut.

308
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,930
I was afraid I'd appear senile,

309
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,330
so I hid how I felt and lied about it.

310
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,700
I won't do that anymore.

311
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,750
What's this?

312
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,090
Is it...

313
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,520
Did he propose?

314
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,920
It belonged to his late wife.

315
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,760
Then it means even more.

316
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,030
Where did he get the idea?

317
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,400
Min Soo Jung coached him.

318
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,300
She did us a great favor.

319
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,100
I'm afraid of what she'd do to you
later on, though.

320
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,680
We must make them fight each other
before any of them comes after us.

321
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,040
I did some digging.

322
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,850
The board members are staunch protectors
of Min Kyung Chae.

323
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,390
Once I become a non-executive director,
I'll meet and befriend them,

324
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,150
but if something were to happen,

325
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,120
they'd be willing to vote in her favor.

326
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,660
Does that mean
she'll succeed the chairman?

327
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,930
We can't allow that.

328
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:44,000
Baek Sul Hee should take over Mingang,
not Min Kyung Chae.

329
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,800
That's only fair.

330
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,040
They must lose something precious too.

331
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,880
It boils down to whether
we can control the board.

332
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,180
Every one of them has issues
with women, money, or kids.

333
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,910
No one is squeaky clean.

334
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,820
Min Kyung Chae
solves all their problems for them.

335
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,420
They'll be extra tight
if that's how involved they are.

336
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,290
That won't last.

337
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,760
I just have to dangle
something more alluring in front of them.

338
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,050
Is that why you called?

339
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,750
How could I not call when I was worried?

340
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,560
You were humiliated in the lobby
with people watching.

341
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,660
Were you really worried about me?

342
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,460
I was. A wounded heart
hurts more than a wounded body.

343
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,400
What if your ego took a hit?

344
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,500
You'd lose self-respect in no time.

345
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,600
Why are you different from other people?

346
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,270
What do you mean?

347
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,710
Other people ask for money
around this time.

348
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,480
That's what the woman
who said she was my mom did as well.

349
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,920
You saved my life.

350
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,790
Not once but twice.

351
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,920
My dad would give you
all the money you want if you asked.

352
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,240
You're more precious than money.

353
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,110
I'm precious?

354
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,610
Then...

355
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,680
did you mean what you said?

356
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,650
You told the man not to touch me
because I was your daughter.

357
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,990
You said you were my mom.

358
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,590
How could I say that if I didn't mean it?

359
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,930
I was always serious
when it came to you, Se Ri.

360
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,500
Why would you care about
a troublemaker like me?

361
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,240
Everyone blooms
if they're given enough love.

362
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,170
You may feel like a weed,

363
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,140
but things change if someone
waters you and cares for you.

364
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,280
Then...

365
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,980
can I change too?

366
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
Of course you can.

367
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,650
I'll help you.

368
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,330
Are you crying?

369
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,930
Why would I cry?

370
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,470
I'm not a child.

371
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,070
I'll call you back.

372
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,280
Don't come to the office again.

373
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,880
I won't put up with you
bringing that woman a packed lunch.

374
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,890
Shouldn't you worry
and ask how I feel first?

375
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,860
I was humiliated in public.

376
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,890
Don't you care what it did to my ego?

377
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,660
Don't act like you're in the right.

378
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,930
- If you visit that woman again...
- Stop calling her that!

379
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,330
She's a good person.

380
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,130
She's much nicer than you.

381
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,580
Where's Director Moon?

382
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,250
He'll be here soon.

383
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,450
Tell him to come straight to my office.

384
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,300
Why do you have this?

385
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,810
Why do you have it?

386
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,240
Ask the chairman.

387
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,350
He gave it to you?

388
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,050
Would I have stolen it?

389
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,290
Give it to me.

390
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,550
- What are you doing? Let go.
- Give it to me!

391
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,920
- Stop.
- Give it to me!

392
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,990
- Ms. Min.
- Let go of me!

393
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,260
Stop it!

394
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,760
- What's going on here?
- Let go!

395
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,430
Calm down.

396
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,700
What was that about?

397
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,370
It's none of your business,
so stay out of it.

398
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,010
No. I can't do that.

399
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,580
You can back off.

400
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,910
Aren't you the one who should back off?

401
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,580
Stay out of this woman's business!

402
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,780
I will get involved
because it involves her!

403
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,940
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

404
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,320
What happens now?

405
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,820
Will the chairman marry her?

406
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,490
We can't allow such a tragedy.

407
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,490
I won't leave that woman alone.

408
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,090
They could be having a private tea party,

409
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,530
acting like lovers.

410
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,930
You don't want me to notice?
Shall I stay out of it?

411
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,330
What's in there?

412
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,600
Leverage on Min Doo Sik.

413
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,700
A collar that, when tightened,
will take him straight to his death.

414
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,640
Who cares about the safe?
We can just steal it.

415
