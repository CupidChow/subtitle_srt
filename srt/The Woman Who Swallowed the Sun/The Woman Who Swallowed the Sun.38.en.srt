1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,310
I don't want to hurt your sister.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,750
I have no reason to.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,620
All I want is one sentence.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,180
For you to take off your mask...

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,990
and say, "I am Baek Sul Hee."

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,020
That's it.

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,530
Right now.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,970
Get rid of that woman.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,980
Who are you to threaten my sister?

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,950
Let her go this instant!

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,180
What did you say?
Did you say she was your sister?

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,950
You said she was your sister!

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,860
Hey. Let her go for now.

14
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,760
Why do you wear a mask you can't keep on?

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,060
You duped me?

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,370
You should've known you can
dupe the whole world but me.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,870
Baek Sul Hee.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,440
Do you know where you are?

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,840
Will you get revenge
where your daughter died?

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,680
I don't know who helped you...

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,480
get a new identity,

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,310
but you're done for.

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,820
One word from me,
and your helper goes down too.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,920
So what?

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,890
Do you want me to kneel and beg?

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,590
That's one option,

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,890
though I decide whether you live or die.

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,230
What's important
is that I got you cornered,

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,700
and your life is in my hands.

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,630
Remember that.

(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

32
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,690
Why won't she call?

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,670
How could she lie to me?

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,470
I was so happy to see her.

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,650
I was so pleased to meet her.

36
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,780
How could she con her own daughter?

37
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,220
Where is she hiding?

38
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,030
(Kyung Chae)

39
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,230
How could Kim Sun Jae go that far?

40
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,530
Is your sister all right?

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,730
I don't know.

42
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,840
She changed her number and address,

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,210
and I couldn't find her.

44
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,570
You looked for her for years,

45
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,180
and she has been waiting for you.

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,980
This is such a tragedy.

47
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,650
What should we do now?

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,180
Won't he do something
now that he knows who you are?

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,190
He'll expose me, our relationship,

50
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,460
and what we want to do to Mingang.

51
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,230
Why would he ruin our plan?

52
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,130
He can do his thing while we do our thing.

53
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,370
He must be up to something.

54
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,830
He serves Chairman Min loyally...

55
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,600
and grovels to CEO Min,

56
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,740
but he doesn't mean it.

57
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,310
I know him as well as he knows me.

58
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,210
He'll plan something
without any of the Mins knowing?

59
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,180
You can tell from the fact that he
sabotaged the partnership renewal.

60
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,380
Min Doo Sik put him...

61
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,720
in charge of everything legal.

62
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,890
That means he trusts him completely.

63
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,930
He must manage the chairman's
slush fund and window-dressed ledgers.

64
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,780
Why didn't you take my call?

65
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,490
Well...

66
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,850
I happened to miss it.

67
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,490
Were you crying?

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,230
I did not.

69
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,200
I rubbed my eyes because they were itchy.

70
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,130
What about the person
you wanted me to meet?

71
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,170
Never mind that, Kyung Chae.

72
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
You don't have to bother.

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,570
I shouldn't cause a hassle
when you're busy.

74
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,340
Who is it?

75
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,080
A friend of mine.

76
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,550
My friend got curious
and wanted to meet you.

77
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,350
That's so random.

78
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,180
Are you good friends?

79
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,780
From the academy?

80
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,720
What?

81
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,620
Yes. We met at the academy.

82
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,620
Arrange something for another day.

83
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,790
I'll make the time
to treat you to a nice meal.

84
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,600
Okay. Thanks.

85
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,170
Don't get into trouble.

86
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,200
It's just until the end of this year.

87
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,840
Then you get the right to vote.

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,140
You can attend shareholder meetings
and get involved in the business.

89
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,040
Do you know what I mean?

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,010
Why would I get into trouble?
Don't worry about that.

91
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,220
I'm not the Se Ri I used to be.

92
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,220
Good night.

Manager Gong.

94
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,810
- Yes?
- I'll take that.

95
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,980
Okay.

96
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,130
Do you know what this is?

97
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,300
Lucia left it for me.

98
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,840
She doesn't want anything.

99
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,270
She just wants me to be healthy and well.

100
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,280
I get that from a stranger,
while my kids don't care if I live or die.

101
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,880
She can do that because she's a stranger.

102
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,980
What?

103
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,650
She can say whatever you want to hear
because she's a stranger.

104
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,690
Why are you so twisted?
Accept her goodwill for what it is.

105
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,290
I'm being me.
You're the one acting out of character.

106
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,230
See?
You said you'd never mention her again.

107
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,860
You said it was done.

108
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,090
That was...

109
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,300
It is done.

110
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,030
Are you that upset I disapprove of her?

111
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,640
It can't be helped. This is what is right.

112
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,410
If you don't see her,
you'll forget about her.

113
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,910
What does that mean? What will you do?

114
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,450
What could I do?

115
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,180
You used carrots and whips...

116
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,980
to get me to leave my lover.

117
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,090
I have nothing to use on you.

118
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,100
How about some advice?

119
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,100
It might be a consolation.

120
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,040
It feels like you can't live without her,

121
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,370
and you might think you could die.

122
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,180
It becomes nothing once time passes.

123
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,010

My gosh.

126
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,110
You came in on time
after what happened yesterday?

127
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,610
Are you steel-minded
or just out of your mind?

128
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,180
Give me my sister's number.

129
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,480
Why are you asking me for it?

130
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,020
Isn't she in the US,
where you lived with her?

131
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,860
I have no time to waste with you,
so hand it over.

132
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,230
I want to see if she's safe.

133

I don't know what you're on about.

134

How come...

135
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,070
you're just the same
as you were 20 years ago?

136
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,040
What's this about? What 20 years ago?

137
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,610
Do you know me?

138
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,740
Did we meet 20 years ago?

139
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,480
Is this what you want?

140
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,650
Yes. I'm Baek Sul Hee.

141
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,820
What if someone hears?

142
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
Be quiet.

143
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,320
Let's keep it between us for now.

144
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,060
Why are you doing this? What do you want?

145
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,590
What do I want?

146
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,490
I don't know.

147
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,060
Do you know how I feel right now?

148
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,630
I feel like a lion who caught prey,

149
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,770
but doesn't feel hungry yet.

150
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,040
Do you know what predators do then?

151
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,570
They play with the trapped prey.

152
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,980
So you'll play with me?

153
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,450
You deceived the world and everyone in it.

When you need something, Sul Hee,

159
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,970
you must ask politely.

160
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,540
Why do you act like you have something...

161
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,270
when you're fully exposed?

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,190
I spoke to Kim Sun Jae, your lawyer,

165
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,530
but I thought I should inform you
of our official decision too.

166
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,230
We worked together for years.
It's a shame to lose a partnership.

167
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,930
It can't be helped.

168
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,970
I'm a businessman.

169

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,560
Do you have to?

173
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,160
Can't you reconsider?

174
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,970
It can't be helped, then. I understand.

175
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,940
Both Miyeon and Woojin
announced their decision.

176
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,810
They won't renew our deal.

177
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,410
It's official, then.

178
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,480
What do we do now?

179
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,490
I just got the call.

180
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,430
Miyeon and Woojin
won't work with us anymore.

181
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,000
They've worked with us for 30 years,
and they were like family,

182
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,900
but they left us.

Time will tell if competitors managed to
win them over with a better deal,

184
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,280
but right now,
it's a fact that we lost two partners.

185
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,480
I apologize.
So that shipping is not a problem,

186
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,480
I'll select new partners
to take over the contract.

187
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,920
That's a given.

188
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,350
You are responsible
for letting the deals fall through.

189
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,820
I will take full responsibility for that.

190
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,090
Okay, then.

191
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,930
Let's see how you do.

192
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,670
Help each other out.

193
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,370
You have amazing teamwork.

194
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,610
Don't you, Ms. Lucia?

195
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,580
Why are they flocking together?

196
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,510
Is something going on?

197
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,450
What's up?

198
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,350
We failed to renew the contracts
with our shipping partners.

199
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,590
I wasn't sure, but they actually refused?

200
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,220
It's really over?

201
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,530
You get paid a fortune.
Why did you let this happen?

202
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,800
I apologize. I'll take full responsibility
and sort out the issue.

203
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,770
There's something I didn't tell your CEO.

204
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,310
Think carefully before you answer.

205
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,150
The deal renewal with our partners.

206
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,920
There's talk that someone sabotaged it.

207
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,720
What do you mean by that?

208
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,520
They made
a preposterous offer to our partners...

209
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,430
and persuaded them
to sign with our competitors instead.

210
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,400
That's news to me.

211
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,340
Do you think I did that?

212
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,810
That would threaten my own position.

213
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,570
Why would I do that?

214
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,640
Who knows?

215
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,940
You might want to harm yourself...

216
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,850
to harm Mingang.

217
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,820
I would not drive myself to ruin
to harm someone else.

218
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,990
I would find another way instead.

219
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,790
"I have no reason to harm Mingang."

220
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,990
"Why would I do such a thing?"

221
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,830
That's what you should've said.

222
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,860
You'd find another way instead?

223
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,570
Don't you think that sounds weird?

224
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,410
Hey, things are bad.

225
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,750
The call came through.
Our partners ditched us.

226
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,950
They won't renew our contract.

227
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,690
Who will ship, then?

228
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,290
Orders will skyrocket
when the regular sale starts.

229
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,990
Who knows?

230
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,390
Our smart CEO Min will handle it.

231
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,030
Why did she make that fool a director?

232
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,900
If she'd put me in charge from the start,
I'd have done an amazing job.

233
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,200
A board meeting will be called, then.

234
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,440
Yes.

235
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,770
The punk didn't do anything in four years.

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,840
Did he improve sales or performance?

237
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,780
He did run things smoothly without issue.

238
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,680
His team got the Clean Business Award.

239
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,250
Hey, I could do that much.

240
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,850
That's nothing.

241
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,520
Is it your turn now?

242
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,650
Kyung Chae coddled that fool...

243
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,520
and only now seemed to get a grip.

244
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,390
I'm not coddling him.
I'm stating the facts.

245
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,630
Ji Seop.

246
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,830
Didn't you say
you'd never come to my office?

247
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,270
Me? Why would I say that?

248
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
You did.

249
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,470
I'm not the type
to make such extreme comments.

250
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,920
What is it?

251
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,780
Well,

252
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,390
the chairman said something odd.

253
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,490
He thinks someone
got between us and our partners...

254
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,560
and ruined our chances to renew.

255
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,830
How does he know that?

256
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,030
I don't know. He didn't say much,

257
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,430
only that he heard about it.

258
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,370
Why?

259
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,310
Did you know about that?

260
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,980
Someone I know told me.

261
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,280
Who would do such a thing?

262
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,280
Kim Sun Jae.

263
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,350
What? Kim Sun Jae? Our lawyer?

264
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,520
Why...

265
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,220
He wants to get you fired,

266
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,320
use that as an excuse
to dismantle our team,

267
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,990
and then get me out of his sight as well.

268
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,630
The problem is, there's no way to prove...

269
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,330
that he sabotaged the deals.

270
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,340
If this was really his doing,

271
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,910
we shouldn't let it drop.

272
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,310
He must pay for harming
our company and business.

273
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,090
If Kim Sun Jae
really did something like that,

274
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,130
they'd have come up with a story.

275
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,740
Tenant. You talk to my wife for me.

276
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,140
Me?

277
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,570
Is something the matter?

278
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,110
I'm the matter. I haven't eaten yet.

279
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,980
Don't you see my gaunt face?

280
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,820
If I miss just one meal,
the world spins, and I go hoarse.

281
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,220
Do you hear me?

282
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,620
My blood sugar is so low
that I might faint and die.

283
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,690
Oh, my gosh. Sir.

284
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,730
Why is your wife so upset?

285
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,330
She went on strike...

286
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,570
because I mistreated her sister's son.

287
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,670
She cares about her nephew
and doesn't care if her husband starves.

288
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,010
I don't think talking to her myself
will help.

289
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,480
If you say you're hungry, who knows?

290
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,010
Instead of trying to talk to her,

291
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,320
why don't I cook for you instead?

292
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,850
You?

293
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,420
I can cook ramyeon too.

294
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,430
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

295
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,600
Do you work in...

296
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,410
a hotel kitchen where there are
knives, boards, and pans?

297
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,340
I cooked all the time
when I lived alone in the US.

298
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,110
Not only is it expensive to eat out,

299
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,880
but I also had to save up to pay tuition.

300
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,050
Why? Didn't your parents
give you enough money?

301
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,680
It wasn't that.

302
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,290
I didn't want to ask them for money.

303
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,120
They put me through university.

304
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,220
It's okay to ask family for help.

305
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,990
You were too polite.

306
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,400
Sir.

307
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,770
There's something I'd like to tell you.

308
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,110
Go ahead and talk. I'll listen.

309
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,540
Okay.

310
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,910
Thirty years ago, my parents...

311
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,820
ran a business.

312
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,750
It might not be a business.

313
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,720
Call it a small factory.
That will be easier to grasp.

314
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,360
They were in the distribution business.

315
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,030
- Yes. Continue.
- Okay.

316
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,930
While managing that factory,

317
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,730
my father developed new ideas,

318
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,030
and he managed to come up
with something cutting-edge.

319
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,870
Oh Pan Sool. You have an appetite?

320
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,440
I'm eating a little at a time!

321
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,810
Stop it!
You've dragged this on long enough!

322
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,680
You're the worst punk there is.

323
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,550
You have no feelings or mercy!

324
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,020
You beautiful woman!

325
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,090
You just pushed the wrong button!

326
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,090
Calm down, sir.

327
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,720
Don't make things worse.

328
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,360
Let go of me! I'm full-on angry!

329
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,000
This woman needs to be taught a lesson!

330
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,870
My family turned their backs on me
after I married you,

331
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,200
and now the one nephew I have left
won't visit me, and it's your fault!

332
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,810
Did a hippo snap a bungee cord
on the way down?

333
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,470
Why is that my fault?

334
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,210
This will be the last day
you walk with both legs.

335
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,580
- Let go of me!
- Sir.

336
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,710
- Yes! Let him go!
- Oh, gosh.

337
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,480
Do you want to get beaten
with a drumstick?

338
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,680
- Come on!
- Sir, please.

339
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,860
How was your day?

340
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,730
Did Kim Sun Jae do anything?

341
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,230
No.

342
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,130
I don't get it.

343
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,240
I thought he'd broadcast everything
at work today.

344
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,870
He should've...

345
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,470
gone to the chairman and CEO
to kick up a fuss.

346
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,910
He'll have a lot on his mind right now.

347
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,150
He's trying to figure out
when to expose me...

348
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,510
to do me the most harm
and benefit him the most.

349
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,790
By the way, Chairman Min...

350
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,120
already knows someone
sabotaged our deal with our partners.

351
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,220
That was quick.

352
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,630
But then, he lasted this long
because he has his sources.

353
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,560
What can he do, though?

354
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,600
Kim Sun Jae knows the law,

355
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,700
and he'll have
cleaned his tracks expertly.

356
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,170
He'll have destroyed the proof...

357
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,740
and silenced the witnesses
with their weaknesses.

358
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,580
Did you find anything else on him?

359
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,710
Not yet.

360
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,580
I'm pretty sure
he hid Min Doo Sik's slush fund,

361
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,380
but I haven't found anything yet.

362
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,190
Ms. Se Ri. Sit up.

363
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,660
I don't want to eat! Leave me alone!

364
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,470
Why won't you eat
when you're not on a diet?

365
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,670
I don't feel like eating.

366
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,610
Will you all get out?

367
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,470
Stop this and get up.

368
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,180
I don't want to eat!
I don't have an appetite!

369
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,020
I don't want to see anyone!

370
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,420
Is something wrong?

371
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,830
Get out! Go!

372
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,130
Leave!

373
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,870
I'm in no mood to eat.

374
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,470
Summon an emergency board meeting.

375
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,010
- Okay.
- Let's figure out...

376
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,880
if Moon Tae Kyung was worth his pay...

377
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,710
over the four years
he's worked at Mingang.

378
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,550
If we can do without him,
send him packing.

379
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,490
That could cause some legal issues.

380
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,150
Lawyer Kim will take care of that.

381
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,620
I need the board to find Director Moon
responsible without a doubt...

382
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,230
and put pressure on him with proof.

383
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,830
CEO Min will do that.

384
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,630
You should do that. Who else can?

385
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,100
Don't worry. I'll handle it myself.

386
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
You should.

387
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,440
If you've used someone beyond their means,
you should cut them loose.

388
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,740
People should be used, not trusted.

389
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,980
Yes.

390
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,980
I never forgot what you taught me.

391
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,420
We're on the same page for once.

392
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,790
Sort things out. I'll be watching.

393
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,060
See how I do.

394
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,960
I'll clean it up completely.

395
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,530
What's up with you and the chairman?

396
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,270
There's no stopping my father
once he makes up his mind.

397
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,400
Is he ticked off about Director Moon?

398
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,270
He caught on that I'm getting rid of...

399
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,140
Director Moon so that I can
get rid of Lucia at the same time.

400
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,550
Then does he still...

401
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,950
He pretends not to because he promised me,

402
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,020
but my father's feelings...

403
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,560
Who can vouch for the loyalty
of a man who once fell for a woman?

404
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,390
I see why you hate that woman so much.

405
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,230
Even if it means
losing the director I hired myself,

406
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,300
I want to get rid of that woman.

407
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,340
(Searching for a missing person)

408
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,990
Surprise.

409
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,230
You seem to be in a great mood.

410
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,090
You know me well.

411
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,300
We do go back a long way.

412
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,660
We met and dated.

413
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,330
If we'd kept the baby that you carried,

414
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,770
as Mom and Dad.

415
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,010
How can you say that
as if it's nothing to you?

416
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,410
I wouldn't say that
if we hadn't met again here.

417
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,580
When your daughter died four years ago,

418
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,050
you came here,
caused a scene, then ran away.

419
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,190
If that were the last time we'd met,
I wouldn't have to bring it up.

420
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,190
You brought this upon yourself.

421
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,960
You caused everything, Baek Sul Hee.

422
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,930
Here's a tip.

423
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,330
If you came back to avenge her...

424
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,970
and take down the chairman and CEO,
wake up.

425
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,340
Those two
are much freakier than you think.

426
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,040
Did you think you'd get your way
when you saved the chairman's life?

427
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,310
Look at how he treated you.

428
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,120
They're not people you can take on,
so get a grip.

429
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,850
If you stop here and disappear,

430
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,060
I'll cover it all up.

431
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,890
If you keep pretending
and causing trouble,

432
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,090
the whole world will find out...

433
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,600
that you're Baek Sul Hee.

434
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,600
Remember that.

435
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,050
Hello?

436
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,160
Is it you, Yeon Ah?

437
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,390
Who are you, and how do you know my name?

438
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,400
Have you forgotten my voice already?

439
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,470
Are you...

440
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,800
Sul Hee?

441
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,560
How could you be so cruel?

442
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,400
How could you?

443
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,040
I thought you'd died somewhere.

444
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,710
Or that you were homeless or something.

445
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,780
Do you know...

446
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,950
how worried and anxious I was?

447
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,070
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,780
I'm sorry, Yeon Ah.

449
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,280
Let me look at you. Is it really you?

450
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,590
It is you.

451
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,920
My sister is back.

452
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,600
Why didn't you call...

453
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,240
when you were doing okay?

454
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,010
You'd changed your number,

455
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,940
and I couldn't find you.

456
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,480
They kept coming by to ask me...

457
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,110
where you were, and it was such a hassle.

458
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,380
So I changed my number and moved away.

459
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,050
I thought that was it.

460
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,060
It worked out for me in the end.

461
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,390
I thought finding you
would weaken my resolve.

462
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,200
What do you mean
it would weaken your resolve?

463
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,140
Yeon Ah.

464
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,110
I work at...

465
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,380
Mingang Distribution.

466
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,840
What?

467
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,250
Why would you work at that darned place?
