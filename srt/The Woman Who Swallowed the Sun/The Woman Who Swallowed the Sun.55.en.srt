1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,010
I'll call when we're done.

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,850
Lucia!

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,250
Who are you?

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
Get lost.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,620
Stay still!

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,860
Stay still.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
Lucia.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,670
Lucia!

9
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,150
Darn you!

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,790
Lucia.

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,990
Do you want her to die?

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,820
Drop the knife.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,160
As if I would.

14
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,660
I said drop it!

15
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,810
(Episode 55)

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,660
What if I hadn't checked on you?

17
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,390
Do you still want me to back away?

18
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,000
Should I still ignore what you're doing?

19
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,140
Those punks seemed like experts.

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,640
They were going to lock you up somewhere.

21
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,610
Who would hire them to do that?

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,950
Kim Sun Jae.

23
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,050
What?

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,380
My gosh.

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,120
How could he...

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,220
He'd do that to you?

27
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,760
There's nothing he won't do.

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,200
You knew that
and still said you'd take him on?

29
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,500
If he won't stop at anything,
you don't know what he'll do.

30
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,700
He's incapable of planning
something like this on his own.

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,700
Someone is pulling his strings.

32
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,810
That means...

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,880
this was the CEO's idea.

34
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,050
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

35
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,820
Where's Director Moon?

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,160
I don't know.
He has been gone for a while.

37
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,630
He left his desk
without telling his team where he'd be?

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,970
For a long time?

39
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,900
This attempt failed.

40
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,070
They'll plan something worse next.

41
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,480
They will.

42
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,850
If they think
someone will get in their way,

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,180
they'll kidnap and detain them...

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,580
and kill them in the end.

45
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,290
And they won't bat an eyelid.

46
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,490
Don't worry about me. I can handle myself.

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,400
You think I'll stop worrying
because you tell me to?

48
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,030
Watch your back.

49
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,540
Kim Sun Jae will do anything,

50
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,310
and the CEO's goal
is to get rid of you somehow.

51
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,580
Wait.

52
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,250
You should've said you were hurt.
You're such an idiot.

53
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,820
Oh, dear.

54
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,090
There must be a pharmacy nearby.

55
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,930
How did it go?

56
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,400
Did you get rid of her?

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,870
I hired some experts.
They'll have taken care of it.

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,740
"They will have?"

59
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,670
You don't know for sure, then.

60
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,140
Don't worry.

61
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,410
I can't reach them right now...

62
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,180
because they're driving
to the outskirts of Seoul.

63
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,980
Their phones must still work.

64
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,280
They'll be busy
holding her down and threatening her.

65
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,920
They can't take any calls.

66
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,520
Tell them to send photos.

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,660
You don't trust me at all?

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,030
It's not because I don't.
It's because I want to.

69
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,170
- Ask for some photos.
- Fine.

70
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,140
But locking up that woman
isn't a solution.

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,970
We can't keep her forever.

72
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,970
We can't kill her, though, can we?

73
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,710
You might be loyal to me,

74
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,110
but even you can't do that.

75
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,180
So why worry?

76
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,290
Tell them to hold her for now.

77
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,160
I'll think about what to do next.

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,960
- You can go.
- Shouldn't you give me...

79
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,800
what I want?

80
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,170
Isn't it me?

81
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,300
What you want.

82
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,970
Min Kyung Chae,
the CEO of Mingang Distribution.

83
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,050
Once she's taken care of,

84
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,850
you'll get your reward.

85
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,090
You're responding at last.

86
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,960
You took your time.

87
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,430
Do I owe Sul Hee for her help?

88
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,330
She wouldn't have
given in to my advances otherwise.

89
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,340
Why haven't these fools called yet?

90
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,310
What's going on with that woman?

91
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,750
What?

92
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,450
Darn it.

93
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,930
What do you mean you lost her?

94
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,660
Some fool got in our way.

95
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,960
We couldn't...

96
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,630
You let him get away with it?
You should've beaten him up.

97
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,900
There was quite a fight.

98
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,140
But he packed a punch.

99
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,040
He's hurt too, though.

100
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,470
That's not the point!

101
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,840
Where's the woman now?

102
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,850
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

103
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,500
It's no big deal.

104
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,070
Does it hurt badly?

105
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,600
A bit.

106
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,470
My gosh.

107
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,490
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

108
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,730
(Power Off)

109
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,000
The phone is turned off.

110
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,000
Connecting to voicemail.

111
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,430
You will be charged after the beep.

112
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,650
Why did you turn it off?

113
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,390
The person who is most important to me...

114
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,390
is the person I'm with right now.

115
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,680
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

116
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,550
I'll go into hiding so no one can find me.

117
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,480
What do you mean?

118
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,160
I'll reappear
when I think the time is right.

119
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,720
Cover for me at work.

120
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,490
Why should we do that?

121
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,860
That's how...

122
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,200
we can expose that Min Kyung Chae
was behind my abduction.

123
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,370
No one is here.

124
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,910
The phone is turned off.
Connecting to voicemail.

125
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,920
Where is she hiding
with her phone turned off?

126
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,590
I'll search the whole country
if I must and find you.

127
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,460
Wait and see.

128
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,720
Forget Min Kyung Chae.

129
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,090
I'm coming after you this time.

130
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,640
Director Moon.

131
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,540
There was quite a fight.

132
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,110
But he packed a punch.

133
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,140
He's hurt too, though.

134
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,950
Where were you at?

135
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,950
I went out to see someone.

136
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,120
Why ask?

137
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,620
He took Sul Hee somewhere?

138
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,790
You hurt your hand.

139
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,430
Were you in a fight?

140
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,200
Did you have to throw a punch
in broad daylight?

141
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,610
Where is she?

142
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,610
Where did you hide her?

143
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,080
Who do you mean?

144
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,780
You know who I mean.

145
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Darn you.

146
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,890
No. I don't know who you mean.

147
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,160
Why? Did you hire someone...

148
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,260
to kidnap someone in broad daylight?

149
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,530
What?

150
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,400
I can't believe people still try to do...

151
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,800
something like that in this day and age.

152
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,740
But then, you're a lawyer,

153
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,000
so you wouldn't do anything like that.

154
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,150
Oh, why don't you give me the name
of the person you're looking for?

155
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,320
Who knows? I might be of some help.

156
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,630
When will you learn to knock first?

157
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,540
It's such a shame.

158
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,170
You won't get the stepmom you want.

159
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,240
What are you on about?

160
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,080
That's what you're like.

161
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,550
You resort to such shallow tricks.

162
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,120
But then,

163
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,920
that's all you've learned,
so you can't do anything else.

164
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,060
Why come all the way here to pick on me?

165
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,660
I'm reminding you of our reality.

166
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,130
Kyung Chae.

167
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,690
We're not that close.

168
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,660
You're always scheming
to find a way to replace me.

169
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,440
We share a father, so here's some advice.

170
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,870
Wake up.

171
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,840
You'll never get what you dream of.

172
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,610
That's your destiny.

173
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
What?

174
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,900
That Lucia woman was back here?

175
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,130
Yes.

176
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,530
While Ji Seop and I visited my parents?

177
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,440
Yes. She came by and stayed for dinner.

178
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,010
Why would you cook for her?

179
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,470
I didn't cook for her.

180
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,510
She came with groceries
and cooked a full meal.

181
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,480
What did she cook?

182
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,950
Mock ritual bibimbap?

183
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,120
She cooked food for an ancestral ritual?

184
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,350
We don't do that.

185
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,620
That's not it.

186
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,060
It's a thing.

187
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,830
The chairman and Ms. Se Ri adored her...

188
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,230
and raved about the food.

189
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,870
I've never seen him like that
since I came here.

190
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,800
He always criticized my food.

191
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,170
That woman could cause some big trouble.

192
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,910
Our house isn't a public toilet
she can use whenever she wants.

193
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,940
She might walk right into
your father's bedroom next.

194
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,950
Don't say that. It's horrifying.

195
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,680
It's a matter of time.

196
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,220
You saw what she was like.

197
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Should I buy a talisman to get rid of her?

198
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,620
Hire a shaman to do a ritual?

199
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,320
Let's do both so it's more effective.

200
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,330
We must do everything we can
so your father becomes sick of her.

201
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Yes.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,800
Are you going out again today?

203
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,330
Yes. I have some things to take care of.

204
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,070
They say jobless people
die of overexertion.

205
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,540
Mr. Freeloader. Be as quiet as you can
while you live with us.

206
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,910
Get on my nerves,
and you're gone that very day.

207
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,450
Not again.

208
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,410
You'll be branded a bully of a landlord.

209
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,450
Have you heard of a guard dog
barking itself hoarse?

210
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,690
Am I bullying you?

211
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,120
Gosh, no. You're not.

212
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,790
You fool.

213
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,730
You brought it upon yourself.

214
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,260
I wouldn't have to be here
if you'd returned Mr. Han's papers.

215
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,330
"You fool. I just have to keep quiet."
Is that what you're thinking?

216
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,010
You have been talking to yourself...

217
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,280
while looking at me intently.

218
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,910
I don't do that.

219
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,580
I'll stop bothering you now.

220
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,950
Am I that good-looking?

221
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,850
He can't stop staring.

222
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,220
I bet it's because you look comical.

223
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,290
Yes. I look comically handsome.

224
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,860
You're unbelievable.

225
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,230
You take something negative
and make it positive.

226
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,630
You beautiful woman. Go set the table.

227
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,530
You ask for food
whenever you feel cornered. We just ate.

228
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,740
Then bring some fruit.

229
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,340
It's right here.

(Trustworthy Police, Safe Country)

231
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,210
Oh, no.

232
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,150
Darn it.

233
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,850
I won't leave even if you beat me up.

234
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,890
What do you have against me?

235
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,290
My grudge is with Mingang Distribution.

236
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,460
I have nothing against you.

237
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,060
Mingang Distribution?

238
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,560
Anyway, 30 years ago,
I was brought here...

239
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,860
and locked up for taking
a woman's underwear from a sauna.

240
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,000
I just need something to prove that.

241
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,400
How long will you go into hiding for?

242
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,440
It could be days or months.
It depends on Chairman Min.

243
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,040
Min Kyung Chae is going a bit too far.

244
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,180
I know she hates your guts,

245
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,350
but trying to kidnap you?

246
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,120
What about Sun Jae?

247
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,990
I've long considered him subhuman.

248
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
Where will you go?

249
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,890
I don't have to go anywhere.

250
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,390
No one will look for me here.

251
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,000
That's true.
Will you keep your phone turned off?

252
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,230
For a while.

253
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,570
Min Doo Sik will get worked up
if he can't reach you.

254
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm going to Mingang tomorrow.

255
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,470
To meet the other non-executive directors?

256
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,140
Yes. I'll see how things are...

257
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,910
and who could side with us in the future.

258
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,750

I couldn't reach her all day.

Manager Gong.

263
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,560
Manager Gong.

264
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,340
You called?

265
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,170
Tell Se Ri to come over.

266
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,980
You asked to see me?

267
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,350
Can you reach Lucia?

268
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,220
I didn't try.

269
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,920
Call her right now.

270
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,490

Her phone is turned off.

273
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,570
What's wrong?

274
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,000
I couldn't reach her all day.

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,270
You can go now.

276
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,210
Goodness...

277
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,190
Where are you coming from?

278
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,520
Dad's room.

279
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,420
He made me call Lucia.

280
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,330
Did you talk to her?

281
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,330
No. Her phone is turned off.

282
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,600
Dad said he couldn't reach her all day.

283
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,410
I guess Sun Jae did as he was told.

284
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,650
About Lucia.

285
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,220
I meant to tell you.

286
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,220
It's fine.

287
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,050
I know you did well this time.

288
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,650
What do you mean?

289
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,790
You did such a great job...

290
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,790
that even my father is looking for her.

291
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,530
He couldn't reach her, and he's concerned.

292
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,230
Is he?

Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

299
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,810
I'll go into hiding so no one can find me.

300
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,580
I'll reappear
when I think the time is right.

301
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,980
Cover for me at work.

302
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,480
Why should we do that?

303
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,980
That's how...

304
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,450
we can expose that Min Kyung Chae
was behind my abduction.

305
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,460
She's not here?

306
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,930
Can't you tell?

307
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,670
That's odd.

308
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,570
No one has seen her since yesterday.

309
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,580
You're her superior,
and she disappeared without a trace...

310
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,510
and without saying where she'd go.

311

You don't seem worried.

00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,550

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,970
How dare you, Lawyer Kim?
I thought you were a polite young man.

345
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,140
You should schedule an appointment.

346
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,210
How could you follow me
and barge in without an invitation?

347
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,670
Where is she hiding?

348
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,770
Tell me.

349
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,180
Get out this instant...

350
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,290
before I call the police on you!

351
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,960
She must be in there.

00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,800

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,980

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,770

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,840
He'll watch the hotel morning and night.

362
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,810
He won't give up.

What's up with him?

366
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,700
I don't know.

367
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,600
Why did he come home during the day?

368
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,370
He seems to be unwell.

369
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,670
Why don't you go see your doctor?

370
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,380
Yes, Father. I'll go with you.

371
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,080
If you don't want to go,
shall I tell Doctor Kim to come?

372
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,650
Would you prefer that?

373
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,950
Why are you all pestering me
when I already have no energy?

374
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,790
Why don't you have any energy?

375
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,930
You don't have a fever.

376
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,960
Are you upset about something?

377
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,000
Are you feeling depressed?

378
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,770
Why would he be depressed?

379
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,900
Men can feel down too, you know,
if they don't get to see...

380
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,670
someone they miss.

381
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,040
What are you talking about?

382
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,940
Are you saying he's lovesick or something?

383
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,810
You never know.

384
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,310
What if he's sulking because things
aren't working out with her?

385
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,310
My gosh.

386
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,920
Stop yapping and get out!

387
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,460
Goodness.

388
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,620
Oh, dear...

389
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,170
How is it, Tae Joo?

390
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,840
Sun Jae is watching the hotel
from nearby, isn't he?

391
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,740
It's worse than that.

392
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,310
He checked into the suite next door.

393
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,880
That's scary.

394
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,910
How can he be so obsessive?

395
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,280
He loses everything if Min Kyung Chae...

396
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,750
finds out he doesn't have me.

397
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,380
He's doing all he can.

398
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,050
So he decided to stay in the same hotel?

399
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,190
The villain is both smart and diligent.

400
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,460
That's a bad combination.

401
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,590
What should we do?

402
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,860
You can't leave the suite
with him so close by.

403
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,910
Going on a hunger strike
won't bring her back.

404
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,550
Give up.

405
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,220
She told me everything before she left.

406
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,260
Told you what?

407
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,160
Everything.

408
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,900
That she approached you,

409
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,570
knowing you were Mingang's chairman.

410
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,910
When you gave her a ring
and invited her home,

411
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,770
she thought
she was about to become your wife.

412
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,750
Her plan was to marry you,
get a stake in the company,

413
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,250
and make a fortune.

414
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,880
That's nonsense.

415
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,520
She's not that kind of person.

416
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,290
Why else would she
turn off her phone and disappear?

417
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,330
I found out her plan and berated her.

418
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,660
I told her to leave you alone.

419
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,670
You had surgery not long ago.
What if you were...

420
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,530
to pass out again with an aftereffect?

421
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,800
- I asked her that, and she said...
- What did she say?

422
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,570
She said she didn't care.

423
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,160
You almost got taken down
by a gold digger. Get over it.

424
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,960
Isn't it fortunate
that she got lost when she did?

425
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,870
Here.

426
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,410
Go on, eat.

427
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,780
Love it or hate it, we're family.

428
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,280
Family is more important than a passerby.

429
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,280
I had to call a board meeting
because of the scandal.

430
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,720
I wasn't going to make you step down.

431
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,690
I was so worried the board...

432
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,320
would vote to dismiss you.

433
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,890
You know how I feel.

434
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,560
I respect you more than anyone.

435
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,230
Come on.

436
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,650
Sir. It's me.

437
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,350
If someone is there, just listen.

438
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,350
I'm sorry you couldn't reach me
for a while.

439
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,390
I had my reasons.

440
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,690
What reasons?

441
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,090
I was...

442
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,230
kidnapped.

443
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,760
I was lucky enough to get away.

444
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,030
What do you mean?

445
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,000
Who would do such a thing?

446
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,470
It was Min Kyung Chae.

447
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,690
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

448
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,850
Now that he knows
Min Kyung Chae had you kidnapped,

449
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,580
things will get a bit crazy.

450
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,690
The identity is just too perfect,
and I wonder if it's fake.

451
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,660
How do you know something
that no one else knows about?

452
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,320
What are you saying?

453
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,890
There's a possibility
that Lucia will stab us in the back?

454
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,130
This is when we say the rat is trapped.

455
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,500
You showed up.

456
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,670
