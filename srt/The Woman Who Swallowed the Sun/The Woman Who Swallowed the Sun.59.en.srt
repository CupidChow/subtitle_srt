00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,710
(Episode 59)

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,750
You called for me?

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,620
I thought you wouldn't come in today.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,920
I came in later than usual
just to talk to you.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,590
The recording you played for me.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,920
That made me think
I should never see Lucia again.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,930
But I changed my mind.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,460
Why would you do that when I helped
confirm the truth about her?

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,870
Because the truth came afterward.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,870
You dare deceive me?

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,310
How could you resort to trickery?

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,510
You think highly of yourself
because you handle my ledgers.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,850
You have something on me, yes.
Do you think I have nothing on you?

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,890
Why you had to quit practicing as a judge.

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,220
All the trouble you got up to then.
Shall I recite what I know?

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,990
You could end up criminally liable.

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,890
You must know that,

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,300
seeing that you know the law
better than anyone.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,270
Do you get it now?

20
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,470
I can bury a nobody like you, no problem.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,840
I apologize, sir.

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,040
I forgot my place.

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,510
Please, forgive me.

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,380
Nothing like this will happen again.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,110
If you'll forgive me,

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,080
just this once, then...

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,250
No.

28
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,890
You should ask for forgiveness
from someone else.

29
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,870
Why won't you beg?

30
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,040
Go on, beg.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,220
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,260
Forgive me.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,810
Hello, CEO Jo.

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,610
I'm a bit cautious about that.

35
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,920
Baek Sul Hee.

36
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,820
Good for you.

37
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,960
How did you turn things around?

38
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,630
Did you think
you could beat me that easily?

39
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,130
So you'll marry
Mingang Distribution's chairman?

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Because that's the only way
to get rid of scum like you.

41
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,500
You can marry the chairman,
but you can't take me down.

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,870
You know who I am.

43
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,970
You're that great,
and you still asked for my forgiveness?

44
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,940
You can take me down,
but do you think I'll go down alone?

45
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,250
No. I'll take you with me.

46
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,350
You know you're on the way down, then?

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Why you...

48
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,530
Sir.

49
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,460
Lawyer Kim feels terrible for what he did.

50
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,030
He offered to go on his knees.

51
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,270
You could and should do more than that,

52
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,970
considering all that you did.

53
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,540
Kneel down.

54
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,450
You heard me.

55
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,040
Don't do anything
to upset the chairman further.

56
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,880
You're excused.

57
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,700
Baek Sul Hee.

58
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,370
Baek Sul Hee!

59
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,100
Darn you!

60
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,610
Wait and see.

61
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,340
If I let you get away with this,
I give up on being human!

62
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,350
Darn it!

63
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,250
He's a useful nuisance.

64
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,060
He's trouble to keep around,

65
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,660
but cut him loose,
and he could be bigger trouble.

66
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,960
You mean Kim Sun Jae?

67
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,400
He won't bother you again, though.

68
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,930
I'll watch him with both eyes wide open.

69
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,300
That's so reassuring.

70
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,770
I promise to make you feel much safer.

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,170
I'll shelter you so no one can harm you.

72
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,180
You faced obstacle after obstacle,
but the end is in sight at last.

73
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,220
This is just the beginning.

74
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,390
Once I get married,
I'll start dismantling Mingang.

75
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,560
Yes.

76
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,730
A company built on the sweat and tears
of others should come down.

77
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,100
Not just come down,
but it should crash and burn.

78
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,800
You said Min Kyung Chae
didn't know about your son's death.

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,970
I think so. I doubt even she knows
how evil her father is.

80
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,610
Enough to harm his daughter's lover.

81
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,280
That could cause a rift
between father and daughter.

82
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,050
It could.

83
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,560
(Yeon Ah)

84
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,100
I asked to meet to tell you something.

85
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,530
I quit the side dish store
and do something else now.

86
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,800
You do? That's great.

87
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,410
Kim Sun Jae knows all about you now,
so it's great that you moved on.

88
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,440
What do you do now?

89
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,380
Someone I know offered me a job,

90
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,280
so I work as a cashier.

91
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,680
Good for you.

92
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,120
I actually...

93
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,760
have something to tell you too.

94
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,700
It looks like...

95
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,530
I'll marry Min Doo Sik.

96
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,370
What? You'll marry him?

97
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,810
Why would you marry someone...

98
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,640
we should stone to death?

99
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,580
I have no choice.

100
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,880
It's the only way to bring Mingang down.

101
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,780
Yeon Ah.

102
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,220
Do you get why I'm doing this?

103
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,520
What should I do with poor you?

104
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,200
(Company Share Waiver)

105
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,580
It's been a while, Lawyer Park.

106
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,740
Hello, sir. To what do I owe the call?

107
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,550
I need a favor.

108
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,950
Can you get a document notarized for me?

109
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,780
What about your own legal team?

110
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,650
Sun Jae is an expert at that.

111
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,420
I need you to do this, not him.

112
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

113
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,510
I thought you'd ended it with that woman.

114
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,510
Who? Lucia?

115
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,780
Can I ask why she was here?

116
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,220
Why? Are you spying on me for Kyung Chae?

117
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,590
No. I personally would like to know.

118
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,230
Don't ask. You'll find out soon enough.

119
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,000
How could you come by and not even see me?

120
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,800
Sorry. I'd dropped by
just to talk to the chairman.

121
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,500
Kyung Chae.

122
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,270
You don't even knock now?

123
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,480
Hang up. We need to talk.

124
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,440
I have nothing to say to you.

125
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,880
You won't talk to me forever?

126
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,550
You're the one who trashed my office.

127
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Why are you angry
when you're in the wrong?

128
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,650
You caused the problem.

129
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,620
It's because you kidnapped Lucia.

130
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,230
Whose side are you on?

131
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,700
We're not kids. There are no sides.

132
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,530
Hang up so we can talk.

133
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,540
I told you. I'm as good as a mom to you.

134
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,740
You're my sister, not my mom.

135
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,510
I did more than a mom could.

136
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,610
You can't do this to me.

137
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,810
Get out of my room!

138
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,550
Don't you see I'm on the phone?

139
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,220
You really...

140
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,260
Sorry.

141
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,760
My big sister barged in.

142
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,200
It's fine.

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,770
Why don't we meet up?

144
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,630
Let's eat something nice and chat.

145
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,970
I'd love that.

146
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,540
(Mingang Distribution)

147
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,000
Director.

148
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,740
Yes. You have something to say?

149
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,310
I actually want to talk to you as well.

150
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,950
You go first.

151
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,310
Okay.

152
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,650
I told you the only witness
to my parents' death...

153
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,990
came to see me.

154
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,220
The man who ran away then reappeared.

155
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,530
He has been staying with me.

156
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,100
I think he might get a retrial.

157
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,900
Does that mean
your parents' case might get reopened?

158
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,070
Yes.

159
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,910
It's great news,
and I wanted to share it with you first.

160
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,980
I'm happy for you.

161
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,810
You told me...

162
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,550
I couldn't rely on the law to make people
like Chairman Min pay the full price.

163
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,290
I don't think one trial will be enough.

164
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,720
But this is the beginning.

165
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,090
I think...

166
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,230
there's still time...

167
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,460
for you to turn back.

168
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,430
No.

169
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,200
There's no going back now.

170
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,340
I know what path you're about to take,

171
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,680
and I can't let you.

172
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,510
No. I just can't do that.

173
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,150
Whatever others say...

174
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,520
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

175
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,810
Why did you call?

176
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,570
It's not done and dusted
because I proposed.

177
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,310
What else is there to do?

178
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,980
There are things to prepare.
The ceremony, gifts, and dowry.

179
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,480
I don't need anything like that.

180
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,120
We can skip the ceremony too.

181
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,220
I just want to be with you.

182
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,590
I should marry in secret?

183
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,860
Did you tell your family?

184
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,930
Why should I report to them?

185
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,730
You should tell them.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,030
They'll be shocked
to find out from other sources.

187
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,300
Forget it. I hate them all.

188
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,470
I just need you.

189
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,420
Will you go with whatever I decide
when it comes to the wedding?

190
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,250
As long as it's not over the top.

191
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,190
Go with it even if it is, okay?

192
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,890
- I will.
- That's that, then.

193
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,530
I have another call. See you tomorrow.

194
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Hello?

195
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,000
Is this Chairman Min Doo Sik?

196
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,900
Who's this?

197
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,370
Hello, sir. It's Park Man Ho.

198
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,770
We met many years ago. Do you remember?

199
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,650
I did a few errands for you.

200
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,210
Corporal Park.

201
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,520
I remember you.

202
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,420
How did you get my number?
I'd changed it since then.

203
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,290
Tracing people is my job.

204
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,490
And I'm a sergeant now.

205
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,560
Why are you calling me?

206
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,300
We had nothing to do
with each other for a long time.

207
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,430
That's true.

208
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,340
But something came up
to bring us back together.

209
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,900
What does that mean?

210
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,740
You know a Jo Pil Doo, don't you?

211
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,010
He came to the police station I was at.

212
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,880
He wants to reveal the true culprit
of CEO Han Kyung Soo and his wife's death.

213
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,490
He'll apply for a retrial.

214
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,590
What shall I do?

215
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,820
What?

216
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,090
Here.

217
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,200
Why did you buy fried chicken?

218
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,000
I can't drink now that I'm in rehab,

219
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,670
so I thought we should eat together
instead of drinking together.

220
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,670
I haven't had this in a while.

221
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,280
It looks good. Thanks a lot.

222
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,580
The truth is, I'd like to...

223
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,020
ask for your forgiveness.

224
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,020
Goodness.

225
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,960
What are you doing?

226
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,000
I wronged you in so many ways,

227
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,860
and you still took me in after all that.

228
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,370
I need to do this
to make myself feel better.

229
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,540
Don't be silly. Get back up.

230
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,840
- No, I...
- Get up.

231
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,240
You don't have to do this.

232
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,180
I forgave you long ago.

233
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,350
You'll be blessed one day
because you live with that attitude.

234
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,880
Wait and see.

235
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,590
The truth behind your parents'
wrongful death will come out,

236
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,520
and Min Doo Sik will pay the price.

237
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,060
That's only right.

238
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,590
The heavens and deities
exist for a reason.

239
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,900
Not long from now, we'll see Min Doo Sik
get taken away in handcuffs.

240
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,030
That fool Jo Pil Doo
went to Detective Park?

241
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,340
That means I have two blackmailers.

242
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,510
I can pay off one fool,

243
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,110
but not the other?

244
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,910
Then the other must be dealt with.

245
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,450
This is pretty tasty.

246
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,290
Is it mine?

247
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,700
It's Detective Park.

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,030
It's pretty late, Detective.

249
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,470
Is that true?

250
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,540
Thank you so very much.

251
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,440
Yes, of course.

252
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,340
Call at any time,
and I'll come to meet you.

253
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,710
Okay.

254
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,620
My gosh.

255
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,580
Was it the detective?

256
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,150
Yes. He confirmed my alibi 30 years ago.

257
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,820
He'll apply for the retrial...

258
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,060
and will reopen your parents' case too.

259
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,060
Is that true?

260
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,300
I don't believe this is happening.

261
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,900
I owe this to you.

262
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,600
You've been through a lot yourself.
Thank you.

263
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,810
Mr. Jo.

264
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,780
Why are you crying on such a good day?

265
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,020
I don't know why I feel like crying.

266
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,860
Mr. Jo.

267
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,930
Let's make Chairman Min pay
and then get on with our lives.

268
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,400
You won't ditch me afterward?

269
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,870
Why would I? We should remain close.

270
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,300
Why would I ever ditch you?

271
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,770
Oh, gosh. Thank you.

272
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,720
No. Don't.

273
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,720
What is she dreaming about?

274
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,860
I'm sorry, Mother.

275
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,060
I'll do the cleaning and the laundry.

276
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,530
Mother. No, Mother.

277
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,640
Honey. I had the weirdest dream.

278
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,310
Was it a stupid one?

279
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,580
No.

280
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,680
That woman. Your father's ex-girlfriend.

281
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,050
I dreamed that they'd gotten married...

282
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,550
and she'd become my mother-in-law.

283
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,020
That's a nightmare.

284
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,930
They say the opposite happens.

285
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,760
No. I have a bad feeling about this.

286
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,170
You should visit the office
and check on her.

287
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,000
Why should I do that?

288
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,840
They're supposed to have broken up.

289
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,070
Isn't it weird that she came here
to see the chairman?

290
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,380
Oh, come on. Are you serious?

291
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,080
Do you have to make such a fuss?

292
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,610
I never did great in school,

293
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,680
but my dreams told the future.

294
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
No, wait.

295
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,420
Let me get changed.

296
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,660
Watch yourself.

297
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,930
Ms. Ja Kyung.

298
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,860
I'm really serious.

299
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,530
If you won't help with the housework...

300
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,900
That's the least of our problems now.

301
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,400
I found another side dish place
and placed an order.

302
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,800
Don't worry about that.

303
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,040
What if the chairman were to find out?

304
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,040
He can't tell
if we season the food to his liking.

305
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,310
You'll see that I'm right.

306
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,050
Why are you worried
about side dishes in this dire situation?

307
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,780
What situation are we in?

308
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,320
I had a terribly ominous dream.

309
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,650
It must be nothing but a dream.

310
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,220
If it becomes reality...

311
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,230
Oh, no.

312
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,090
What did you dream of?

313
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Where are you going?

314
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Ms. Se Ri.

315
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,010
Can you be away from work at this hour?

316
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,810
It's near the office.
I have to get back soon, though.

317
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,710
I called because I kind of missed you.

318
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,350
I didn't think you'd come.

319
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,520
Why would I say no to you?

320
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,860
It's awesome to see you.

321
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,630
I feel the same.

322
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,660
I'll make a quick trip to the restroom.

323
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,130
Okay.

324
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,140
I hope you work it out with your sister.

325
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,210
Family is all one has,
if you think about it.

326
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,680
Others leave if they have no use for you,
but family remains.

327
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,120
Family is something no money can buy.

328
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,160
(Mingang Distribution)

329
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,710
(New message)

330
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,620
(Kyung Chae)

331
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,220
Come to Malevich at 7 p.m.

332
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,560
I have an out-of-office meeting,
but I can be there by then.

333
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,460
You must come.

334
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,830
I'll wait until you do.

335
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,100

(1 message selected)

338
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,620
Se Ri. I can't stay long
because I should be at work.

339
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,460
How about we meet up later at Malevich?

340
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,830
At around 7 p.m.?

341
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,400
- You mean that?
- Yes.

342
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,700
Okay.

343
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,780
What's up, Lawyer Park?

344
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,180
I wasn't sure if I should tell you.

345
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,250
What's this about?

346
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,320
Your chairman asked me
to get something notarized.

347
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,060
I called in case there was a reason
he skipped you to give the job to me.

348
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,520
What document is it?

349
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,860
Jung Lucia's company share waiver?

350
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,960
That's a prenup of sorts.

351
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,870
Send me a copy.

352
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,400
Thanks.

353
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,710
Baek Sul Hee.

354
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,680
That's what you did?

355
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,490
You'll give up the right...

356
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,020
to Min Doo Sik's assets
and the stake in the company?

357
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,930
Why would you go that far
just to marry the chairman?

358
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,730
You can't take down either him
or the company if you don't have anything.

359
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,240
Baek Sul Hee. What are you up to?

360
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,610
Why are you giving me that look?

361
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,510
You're smiling?

362
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,410
Do you want to kneel again?

363
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,290
What's going on here?

364
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,070
What's up with him?

365
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,740
The chairman found out
the recording had been tampered with...

366
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,240
and called Kim Sun Jae to his office.

367
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,380
So he's picking on you
because you're easier prey?

368
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,910
He'll do that to the very end.

369
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,680
My presence alone makes him antsy.

370
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,880
That's why you must stand fast.

371
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,690
You can't lose to him of all people.

372
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,920
I noticed how you're nice
to everyone else,

373
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,030
but you're really nasty to Kim Sun Jae.

374
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,130
I pick and choose who I'm nice to.

375
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,640
So Ji Seop went to the company to check?

376
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,110
Darling, I think that's going too far.

377
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,540
All daytime nap dreams are silly.
I should know they don't mean anything.

378
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,310
No, Dad. The dream was too real.

379
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,920
Father married that woman,
and she gave me the worst time.

380
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,490
Oh, my gosh.

381
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,850
Calm down.

382
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,420
Your father-in-law...

383
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,460
is crazy about women.
He can't be without one.

384
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,630
What is it?
Is the chairman getting married?

385
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,830
Will you be quiet? I'm on the phone.

386
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,570
Don't worry about it. I know the man.

387
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,670
Keep your naps short.

388
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,310
Hang up. Bye.

389
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,840
Didn't the chairman end it with her?

390
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,880
Yes, but was there more to it?
What got Ja Kyung so upset?

391
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,720
The fortune teller said Ja Kyung
would never have a mother-in-law.

392
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,520
Hey, Soo Jung.

393
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,520
What got you so frantic this time?

394
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,630
Did you see the notice
on our in-house network?

395
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,260
Father is getting married.

396
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
What?

397
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,040
What's going on?

398
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,040
Hey. Slap me right here.

399
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,810
Slap me so I can see
if I'm dreaming or not.

400
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,150
Did you have to hit that hard?

401
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,090
Se Ri.

402
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,060
The chairman and I set a date.

403
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,000
You set a date?

404
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,440
You're really getting married?

405
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,780
That's great.

406
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,580
Congratulations.

407
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,010
Thanks.

408
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,080
I'm marrying the chairman,

409
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,620
but I'm so pleased
I'll get to see you every day.

410
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,750
Same here.

411
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,390
Kyung Chae.

412
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,830
Did you get my text?

413
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,860
No. I didn't get anything from you.

414
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,100
- What is it, Ji Seop?
- Why was your phone turned off?

415
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,640
I was in a meeting. What's this about?

416
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,240
Did you see the company announcement?

417
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,180
Father and Lucia are getting married.

418
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,120
What?

419
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,060
Are you marrying the chairman?

420
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,330
I asked if you're marrying my father!

421
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,870
Yes.

422
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,540
We'll be family now.

423
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,970
I hope we get along.

424
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,160
Are you insane?

425
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,830
Are you okay, Mom?

426
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
What?

427
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,400
"Mom?"

428
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,690
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

429
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,870
There are things you just shouldn't do!

430
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,980
I might be a stubborn troublemaker,
but even I know that much.

431
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,080
This is too much.

432
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,010
How could you think of marrying her?

433
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,310
This wedding can't happen.

434
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,420
If you say one more thing about Lucia,

435
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,350
know that I'll kick you out immediately.

436
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,190
I plan to deal with him today.
How does that sound?

437
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,190
You chose a great day.
It'll be a memorable one.

438
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,630
I like you a lot,
not as Jung Lucia but as Baek Sul Hee.

439
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,100
This moment is the last one
for you to turn back.

440
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
