1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,840
A stepmother my own age.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,840
(Episode 87)

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,850
And a former subordinate, at that.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,610
Wasn't becoming
the lady of the house enough...

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,180
after seducing the old chairman?

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,390
Now you want us to treat you
as our mother?

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,920
You're far too greedy.

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,310
I've put up with you until now
for Father's sake.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,550
But I don't have to do that anymore.

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,350
Because, as of today, this is my seat,

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,960
which means you're nothing now.

12
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,130
That's enough. Please go upstairs.

13
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,400
Mom, you should get inside, too.

14
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,340
What in the world is going on?

15
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,910
I know our family tree is a mess,

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,810
but to do this at the dinner table...

17
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,150
Tell me about it.

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,950
Kyung Chae and the stepmother
are really going at it.

19
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,150
Did you see that just now,
when they threw that glass of water?

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,120
I thought stuff like that
only happened on TV.

21
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,800
I think they're planning
to kick me out of the house.

22
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,130
They've confined Chairman Min,
and now they're trying to get rid of me.

23
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,140
We have to find Chairman Min
before it's too late.

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,570
Actually, I just saw something strange.

25
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,940
I saw Kim Sun Jae
secretly meeting with Driver Kim.

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,810
So you're saying Driver Kim is involved
in Chairman Min's disappearance?

27
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,950
It's just a hunch,
but why else would they meet in secret?

28
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,120
What connection could those two
possibly have?

29
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,690
Then I guess we'll have to find out
for ourselves.

30
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,900
Mr. Kim. Can I have a word with you?

31
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,500
I need you to check the dashcam
from the chairman's car.

32
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,240
Why, all of a sudden?

33
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,050
You didn't already delete or dispose of
the footage from a few days ago, did you?

34
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,220
As far as I know, the policy is to keep it
for at least a week.

35
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,320
That's true, but...

36
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,520
You didn't give the footage
to someone else, did you?

37
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,260
No, Madam. I mean, CEO Jung.

38
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,960
Why would I ever do something like that?

39
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,700
Then there's no reason
you can't show us, is there?

40
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,530
I said, let's check it.

41
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,170
It's just...

42
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,710
You'd better tell the truth.

43
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,980
Or I'll have no choice but to report you.

44
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,910
As a witness and an accomplice
to the chairman's disappearance.

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,450
I was wrong.

46
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,250
I didn't mean to,

47
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,890
but Lawyer Kim Sun Jae threatened me,
so I had no choice.

48
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,940
CEO Min.

49
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,480
We're in big trouble.

50
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,110
Madam Jung has summoned Lawyer Kim.

51
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,610
Why, all of a sudden?

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,050
She found out that I wasn't the one
who drove the chairman's car that day.

53
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,990
And I think she's going
to grill the lawyer about it.

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,790
I told CEO Jung everything.

55
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,260
You told her that?

56
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,900
You should have denied it
until the very end!

57
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm sorry!

58
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,900
She threatened to report me...

59
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,280
If you tell me where the chairman is now,
I can be lenient.

60
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,350
But if you keep resisting,
my hands are tied.

61
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,520
I'll have to punish you
according to the law.

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,820
Did you say "the law?"

63
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,690
You dare lecture me about the law?

64
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,460
Do you think you know the law
better than I do?

65
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,990
If you want to pursue legal action,
you need to bring me proof to back it up.

66
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,260
- You can't just accuse me without proof.
- The proof...

67
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,670
is the fact that the chairman vanished
without a trace.

68
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,240
- That's the proof.
- Are you kidding me?

69
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,240
You just dragged me in here...

70
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,770
and are now accusing me
of kidnapping the chairman.

71
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,240
Haven't you heard of
"innocent until proven guilty?"

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,010
What kind of nonsense is that?

73
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,850
There are criminals who leave no evidence.

74
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,220
Then what's a conscience for?

75
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,750
Conscience, you say.

76
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,590
It's completely useless in a courtroom.

77
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,530
Don't you know
it's not even worth a penny?

78
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,160
Your conscience might not
be worth a penny,

79
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,630
but some people would die to keep theirs.

80
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,330
If you continue to illegally hold
the chairman captive...

81
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,000
Watch your mouth!
Who's illegally confining anyone?

82
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,410
The two of you really have a knack
for cornering someone.

83
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,240
If you accuse me one more time
without any proof, I won't let it slide.

84
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,750
I'll have you both thrown
in jail for defamation.

85
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,210
You!

86
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,790
As of today, you're fired.

87
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,990
What?

88
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,220
Did you not hear me?

89
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,860
I said you're fired, effective today.

90
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,130
As CEO of Mingang Distribution,

91
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,930
I'm relieving Kim Sun Jae,
head of the Legal Team,

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,400
of his duties as of today.
Is that clear enough for you?

93
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,270
Can you really do this
just because you're the CEO?

94
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,870
You kidnapped and imprisoned someone,
but you don't want to get fired for it?

95
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,810
I can't have someone like you here.
Who knows what else you might do?

96
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,280
Get out now!

97
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm afraid
I can't approve that termination.

98
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,090
Regarding the termination of Kim Sun Jae,
head of the Legal Team,

99
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,030
I'm exercising my right to veto.

100
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,830
Veto?

101
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,630
What gives you the right?

102
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,270
I believe this gives me
all the right I need.

103
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,830
Check the chairman's will.

104
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,310
See who he designated as Acting Chairman
in his absence.

105
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,840
How did you know this was going to happen?

106
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,040
Driver Kim gave me a call.

107
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,910
You saw that, didn't you?

108
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,910
Lucia is putting on a real show
as CEO of Mingang Distribution.

109
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,280
She can try, but that won't work on me.

110
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,050
As I understand it, I don't need approval
from the board of directors,

111
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,320
so I can assume my duties immediately
after the will is read, correct?

112
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,790
Of course.
Legally, you are now the acting chairman.

113
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,360
Finally, it feels like
Mingang is getting back on track.

114
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,990
We have a lot of work ahead of us.

115
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,630
We have to properly deal with
the board members who betrayed you.

116
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,170
And we need to oust Lucia
from the CEO position,

117
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,470
and get rid of Moon Tae Kyung
while we're at it.

118
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,510
That's right.

119
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,010
There's more to do than I thought.

120
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,080
What are you doing here?

121
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,850
Weren't you fired?

122
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,620
What are you doing
in the chairman's office?

123
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,060
What's all this about?

124
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,730
I've called you both here...

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,270
to reveal a part of the chairman's will.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,270
Dad's will?

127
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,440
Is that legally possible
without him present?

128
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,740
Under normal circumstances, no.
But this is an emergency.

129
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,710
That's why we are only revealing a portion
of the will, not the entire document.

130
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,510
I'm doing this as the lawyer
who notarized the will.

131
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,820
Why the big rush?

132
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,890
Revealing the will isn't the priority
right now, is it?

133
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,190
Finding Dad should come first.

134
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,960
It's been more than a day or two,

135
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,130
don't you think this is
a pretty serious situation?

136
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,930
So, you're saying we should just leave
the chairmanship vacant?

137
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,500
Who would that benefit?

138
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,530
As if being CEO wasn't enough for Lucia,

139
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,700
do you really want to see her become
Acting Chairman too?

140
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,000
Absolutely not.
She never should have been CEO.

141
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,340
Exactly. That's why we need to
make the will public to see...

142
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,780
who Father designated as Acting Chairman
if his position becomes vacant.

143
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,410
Aren't you curious?

144
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,980
Fine. Let's just open
that darn will already.

145
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,920
Just hurry up and do it. Come on, open it.

146
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,190
Very well. I will now disclose
the chairman's will.

147
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,460
"I, Min Doo Sik,"

148
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,900
"in the event of a prolonged absence
due to personal matters or illness,"

149
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,330
"or any other unavoidable reason..."

150
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,500
"that prevents me
from performing my duties,"

151
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,440
"I hereby appoint
as my Acting Chairman..."

152
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,770
"Min Kyung Chae."

153
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,590
Then we're completely stuck.

154
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,030
Min Kyung Chae is running things
as Chairman.

155
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,060
It takes effect immediately
upon revealing the will,

156
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,700
with no need for the board's approval.

157
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,630
Min Doo Sik, where on earth could he be?

158
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,040
If those two just play dumb
and stay quiet,

159
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,400
there's no way for us to find out.

160
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,470
If this continues to drag on,

161
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,540
in the worst case,

162
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,410
we can't guarantee
Chairman Min Doo Sik will survive.

163
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,750
She wouldn't go as far as
killing her own father, would she?

164
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,580
They're the kind of people
who'd do anything to cover their tracks.

165
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,190
I can't believe this is happening.

166
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,590
A part of me wishes he was locked
in a secret room...

167
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,730
and would just die a miserable death.

168
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,560
Now we have to find and save that bastard
with our own hands.

169
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,870
How ironic.

170
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,140
First, let's try to figure out
where they might have hidden him.

171
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,710
If Kim Sun Jae
orchestrated the kidnapping,

172
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,140
it's highly likely
he mobilized the people...

173
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,480
he normally uses as informants.

174
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,710
We might not be completely in the dark.

175
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,950
Really? How so?

176
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,790
In the vase in the chairman's office,

177
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,590
I planted a small bug.

178
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,790
So that's why you were always
in his office arranging flowers.

179
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,700
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

180
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,940
What an eyesore.

181
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,380
Secretary Kim, get this vase
out of the chairman's office...

182
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,920
Let's go. I made dinner reservations.

183
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,460
Cancel them. I'm not in the mood.

184
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,530
Dinner was just an excuse.

185
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,430
There's something I really need
to discuss with you.

186
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,500
About our marriage.

187
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,900
- Do we have to talk about it now?
- Yes, I think we really do.

188
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,540
You know our marriage was the condition...

189
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,940
to stop the chairman
from changing the will.

190
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,140
Backing out now goes against our deal.

191
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,040
Our "deal?"

192
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,550
- It's strange to call marriage a "deal."
- And why is that?

193
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,890
Are you still hung up on the man
who painted your portrait?

194
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,720
I told you not to bring that up.

195
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,590
Do you still have feelings for him?

196
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,030
I don't care.

197
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,400
You can spend your entire life
thinking about and missing him.

198
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm big enough to handle that.

199
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,270
But you should really think about this.

200
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,970
Think about the value of me, Kim Sun Jae,

201
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,740
and not about some childish crush.

202
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,640
I was planning to propose
at a nice restaurant,

203
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,680
but doing it here in the chairman's office
seems more fitting.

204
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,580
After all, the ultimate goal
for both of us...

205
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,950
is this very seat, isn't it?

206
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,330
What? Should I get down
on one knee or something?

207
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,260
What's this?

208
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,390
Did you get proposed to?

209
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,230
Who was it?

210
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,060
Lawyer Kim Sun Jae.

211
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,400
Are you really going to marry him?

212
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,570
Does the chairman's absence have anything
to do with this marriage?

213
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,850
My hunch is right, isn't it?

214
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,510
Lawyer Kim has the chairman
locked up somewhere, doesn't he?

215
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,080
I told him to do it.

216
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,220
What on earth are you thinking?

217
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,620
It's my only way to get the chairmanship
and protect our company.

218
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,330
What if getting
too involved with Lawyer Kim...

219
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,190
lands you in deeper trouble later?

220
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,330
Manager Gong,

221
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,330
you're the only one who knows
Se Ri is my daughter.

222
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,970
At this point, you knowing one more secret
won't change a thing.

223
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,870
Taking over Mingang is impossible
without Lawyer Kim's help.

224
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,540
Ms. Kyung Chae...

225
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
I know exactly what kind of man he is.

226
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,980
Spending the rest of my life
married to him...

227
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,620
will probably be more horrifying
than I can imagine.

228
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,350
It could end up being
a total disaster for both of us.

229
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,520
Then why are you doing this?

230
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,190
I told you why.

231
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,190
I need him to get my hands on Mingang.

232
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,490
I'll handle this, so don't you worry.

233
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,030
Just go and prepare a meal for our guest.

234
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,830
Lawyer Kim will be coming over
to be formally introduced.

235
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,640
Wait, so Kyung Chae is taking over
the chairmanship instead of your father?

236
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,570
That's what the will says. What can we do?

237
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,210
What? So your stepmom is the CEO,
and your sister becomes the chairman,

238
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,580
and you're the only one left with nothing!

239
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,690
Father is unbelievable!
Seriously, what the heck is he up to?

240
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,550
How could he write a will like that
and just disappear?

241
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,190
Seriously, where is he?

242
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,160
He's probably hiding to test all of you,
just like he did with that dementia scare.

243
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,360
What's left for him to test?

244
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,700
These endless tests are ridiculous!

245
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,130
How should I know?

246
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,170
Anyway, your father's disrespect
for you makes me sick.

247
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,380
What's the point
of having all that money...

248
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,810
- if he treats his only son like this?
- Exactly.

249
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,050
When you add up all Father's assets,
how much is it all worth?

250
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,220
What is he planning to do
with all of it? Seriously!

251
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,930
Open the door, you bastards!

252
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,100
Do you have any idea how much I'm worth?

253
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,540
The day I get out of here,
you're all dead men.

254
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,180
I'll use my money to wipe you off
the face of the earth.

255
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,980
Open this door
while I'm still asking nicely!

256
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,380
Open the door, you bastards!

257
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,890
Are you seriously going
to serve as the acting chairman?

258
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,430
I thought that was already settled
at the company.

259
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,860
If the chairman returns tomorrow...

260
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,000
and learns you opened the will
without consent...

261
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,170
and took his seat, he won't let it slide.

262
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,540
Don't you know how he is?

263
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,240
That's something I'll deal with
if Father returns.

264
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,040
You make it sound like
you don't expect him to come back.

265
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,310
Is that how it sounded to you?

266
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,810
I can't help what you hear.

267
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,800
It's nice having just the Min family here
for a change.

268
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,200
What's so nice about it? Dad's missing.

269
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,300
- Is anyone even worried?
- He'll probably be back soon.

270
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,610
And what if he doesn't?

271
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,070
Then there's nothing we can do.

272
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,910
Kyung Chae!

273
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,310
Sit down.
Making a scene won't change anything.

274
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,450
Does anyone else think this family
is seriously messed up?

275
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,720
How come no one is worried
even though Dad is missing?

276
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,890
Your father does have a history
of pulling stunts like this.

277
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,260
This isn't the first or second time
he's deliberately tricked us.

278
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,860
Even so, he's still missing.
Shouldn't we be looking for him?

279
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,430
- Don't worry. We are looking for him.
- Did you file a missing person report?

280
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,000
What about Mingang's stock price?

281
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,770
Are you suggesting
we announce his absence?

282
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,940
I've hired private investigators
to find him.

283
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,410
Even now, you're worrying
about the company’s stock price, right?

284
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,610
This is infuriating.

285
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,090
(Mingang Distribution)

286
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,120
There's nothing of interest.

287
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,720
Absolutely nothing that could be a clue
to Chairman Min's whereabouts.

288
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,130
Then what should we do?
I was counting on this.

289
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,560
There's nothing we can do.

290
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,260
We'll put this back,

291
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,600
and wait until those two
let something slip...

292
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,840
on Chairman Min Doo Sik.

293
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,690
What are you doing in here?

294
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
What does it look like?

295
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,600
Since the chairman isn't here,
let's get rid of that.

296
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,370
He'll be back soon.
Don't you dare touch it.

297
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Leave it.

298
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
He was fond of it.

299
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,410
You're his daughter.

300
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,420
Now that your father's gone,

301
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,120
shouldn't you cherish his things
so much...

302
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,890
that you can't bear to touch them?

303
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,160
So why are you in such a rush
to throw it out?

304
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,560
Is it not just the chairman you find
to be an eyesore, but his things as well?

305
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,030
Watch your mouth.

306
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,400
Why would I consider the chairman
an eyesore?

307
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,060
Then don’t you dare lay a finger
on any of this.

308
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,800
If you get rid of it on your own whim,

309
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,670
I'll take it
you're not hoping he'll return.

310
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,170
And that you're treating him
like he's gone for good.

311
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,770
Who do you think you are to say that?

312
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,580
Just put up with me for one month.

313
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
One month.

314
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,950
If the chairman isn't back within a month,
I'll leave on my own.

315
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,420
From both the house and the company.

316
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,620
You can take his seat at the table,
take over his office, and live your life.

317
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,830
Then we won't have to throw water
on each other again.

318
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,830
As you said before,
with the chairman gone,

319
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,760
I'm nothing anyway.

320
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,430
One month, you say?

321
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,270
Don't you dare go back on your word.

322
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,510
I won't.

323
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,950
- What can I get for you?
- I'll have the goat soup, please.

324
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,090
- One goat soup!
- Yes, please.

325
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,090
Come on, gather around, everyone.
Before the real cold weather sets in,

326
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,560
you should have some black goat extract
to stay healthy.

327
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,430
This is the real deal, an extract we brew
right here in our store.

328
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,840
A health tonic like this
would make a perfect gift.

329
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,470
- Right? Should I get you one?
- Yes, please.

330
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,970
Nice choice.

331
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,140
- I'd like to pay for this.
- Thank you.

332
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,320
Here you go. I hope this brings you
a long and healthy life.

333
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,920
- Thank you.
- Look at you, you're on a roll.

334
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,760
I'm so sorry. I feel bad
making you work on your day off.

335
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,200
Not at all. I'm excited
to see all these customers too!

336
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,700
Yes, thank you.

337
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,700
- Enjoy it in good health!
- Thank you so much.

338
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,670
- Great.
- Ta-da!

339
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,900
We're here, Father, Mother.

340
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,740
Welcome, come on in! Now you're here,
you have to drink this down.

341
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,880
It's a fresh batch. It'll taste good.

342
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,180
Don't leave a single drop. Bottoms up!

343
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,950
This is potent.

344
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,950
I can feel myself
getting stronger already.

345
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,720
So that's what you use to make it.

346
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,790
That's right.

347
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,030
You see those jars of medicinal herbs?

348
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,230
Honey, should we buy one of these
for your father?

349
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,530
What's the point?
Dad's not even home to receive a gift.

350
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,570
What in the world are you talking about?
Why wouldn't he be at home?

351
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,970
He's gone missing.

352
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,480
"Missing" is a bit of a strong word.

353
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,210
I think he's just taking
a break somewhere.

354
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,480
He'll be back soon.

355
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,680
Why would he go somewhere else to rest
when he has a huge house?

356
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,350
The older you get,
the more you should be with family.

357
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,370
(Mingang Distribution)

358
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,040
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

359
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,510
If the chairman isn't back within a month,
I'll leave on my own.

360
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,810
From both the house and the company.

361
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,150
Go ahead, try and find him
if you're so clever.

362
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,720
You won't find him in a month,
or even a lifetime.

363
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,700
You wanted to see me?

364
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,970
Are you happy now?

365
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,710
Come to my house tonight.

366
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,510
It's time you met my family.

367
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,010
I guess we should book
a wedding venue, then.

368
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,410
If we're doing this,
we may as well get it over with...

369
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,510
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

370
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,750
Let's just have an engagement party.

371
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,080
An engagement party?

372
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,450
But if we're going to do it,
why not just get married?

373
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,750
The timing is bad.

374
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,320
To the public, Father is missing.

375
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,360
Should I be holding a wedding right now?

376
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,360
What would people think?

377
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,990
But an engagement party is just...

378
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,700
We might as well get married
while we're at it.

379
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,870
Don't argue with me. Just do as I say.

380
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,670
We'll get married once I can drop
the "Acting" from my title...

381
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,510
and I'm officially the chairman.

382
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,010
And for that to happen,

383
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,710
you'll have to sign over...

384
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,580
your Mingang Distribution shares
to me, won't you?

385
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,450
That's not a problem.

386
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,820
As long as I have your word
that we'll get married.

387
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
What did you want to see me about?

388
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,320
Don't you think it's weird?

389
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,060
Kyung Chae read the will
right after Dad vanished,

390
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,220
as if she was just waiting for it.

391
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,230
Come on. She said it's because
the chairmanship can't be left vacant.

392
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,430
You really don't think Dad's disappearance
and her revealing the will are connected?

393
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,330
If Dad were still here,
she never would've become Acting Chairman.

394
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,640
Are you saying Kyung Chae
did something to Father?

395
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,570
She would know best, wouldn't she?

396
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,640
Now that you mention it, it is suspicious.

397
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,050
But we don't have any proof.
You can't just make accusations like that.

398
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,980
It always comes down to proof, doesn't it?

399
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,730
What are you thinking about?

400
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,560
About Dad.

401
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,460
I told you, he's fine. Don't worry.

402
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,700
Do you know where he is?

403
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
How would I know?

404
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,140
I just have a feeling he's okay.

405
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,140
Worrying about him won't change anything,
so just try to relax.

406
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,280
And come downstairs in a bit.

407
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,610
We're having a guest.

408
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,710
A guest? Who?

409
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,120
Listen...

410
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,880
How would you feel if I got married?

411
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,620
Where is this suddenly coming from?

412
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,630
I'm just wondering how you'd feel
if I told you I was getting married.

413
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:00,130
Because he would become your new dad.

414
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,130
What's gotten into you?

415
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,130
And what's all this about a guest?

416
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,170
Don't tell me...

417
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,440
Are you getting married?

418
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,740
Manager Gong, when is dinner tonight?

419
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,120
She's been preparing for a guest all day,
is it still not ready?

420
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,550
A guest?

421
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,520
The guest will be here any minute.

422
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,550
Who's this guest?

423
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,520
The man I'm going to marry.

424
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,860
Wait, you're doing what?

425
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,100
She said she's getting married!

426
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,630
Oh my! Are you getting married?

427
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,730
- With whom?
- He's on his way.

428
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,540
So you're just going
to introduce your fiancé to us?

429
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,810
But what kind of lunatic would actually
want to marry an ice queen like you?

430
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,910
Is that guy out of his mind?

431
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,450
Come on. But who is it?

432
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,980
What does he do?

433
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,190
How old is he? Is he handsome?

434
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,410
Allow me to introduce myself.

435
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,840
My name is Kim Sun Jae,
and I'm going to marry Min Kyung Chae.

436
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,050
I'm sure I need no further introduction.

437
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,250
I look forward to getting
to know you, brother-in-law.

438
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,360
And to my new sisters-in-law,
I hope we get along.

439
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,700
And...

440
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,430
you as well, Mother.

441
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,100
I've always heard that a good son-in-law
is a treasure to his mother-in-law.

442
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,470
I hope you'll grow very fond of me.

443
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,440
Mother.

444
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,930
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

445
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,980
Min Se Ri
is Min Kyung Chae's real daughter.

446
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,550
She had her in secret 20 years ago...

447
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,150
and passed her off
as Chairman Min Doo Sik's own child!

448
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,920
Then what would you do
if something were to happen to Se Ri?

449
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,650
I couldn't live
if anything happened to her.

450
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,860
And I'd never forgive the one responsible.

451
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,160
You were always so perfect
and untouchable.

452
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,230
But now I've finally found your weakness.

453
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,860
I would give whoever gets me
out of here...

454
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,570
all of Mingang Distribution
without a second thought.

455
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,130
I don't care who it is.
