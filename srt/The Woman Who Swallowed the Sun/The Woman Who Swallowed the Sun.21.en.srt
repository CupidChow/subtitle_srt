(Episode 21)

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,080
Welcome. I couldn't wait to see you again.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,850
Hello.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,420
(Mingang Distribution)

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,950
You asked to see me?

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,260
This is lawyer Kim Sun Jae,
head of our Legal Team.

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,100
This is Jung Lucia.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,500
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,210
I'm Jung Lucia.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,750
Come on, Lawyer Kim.

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,150
Right.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,020
Yes.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,220
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Sun Jae.

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,370
What is that woman doing here?

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,400
And who is Jung Lucia?

17
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,310
Mingang Distribution...

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,380
runs a chain store
and an online platform separately.

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,520
People say two companies share one roof.

20
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,290
We launched the online business
four years ago, and I quit...

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,490
the chain store to focus on it.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,120
I thought it had a chance.

23
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,130
I heard you have experience in logistics.

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,530
And that you have great skill.

25
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,030
How about...

26
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,100
you join our online business team?

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,340
Are you offering me a job?

28
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,710
I was told you moved here permanently.

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,810
You must need a job.

30
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,950
Let's work together.

31
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,250
I think we met for a reason.

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,420
Meeting someone I need
at the perfect timing.

33
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,820
It can't be a coincidence, can it?

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,660
I have a feeling we'll get along great.

35
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,330
That we could be good partners.

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,350
Who was that woman?

37
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,490
Didn't I introduce her to you?

38
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,490
You called her "Jung Lucia."

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,390
Is that right?

40
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,190
What about it?

41
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,060
She's not Baek Sul Hee?

42
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,330
What is it?

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,170
Is there a problem?

44
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,740
How could that face not be Sul Hee's?

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,010
Lawyer Kim? What's on your mind?

46
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,840
Oh, it's nothing.

47
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,150
What got into him?

48
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,120
Do you think you can work at Mingang?

49
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,390
I must.

50
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,360
It won't be easy.

51
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,030
Not only must you fend off Kyung Chae
and her father Min Doo Sik,

52
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
but you'll have to face
Kim Sun Jae every day.

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,570
I don't care.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,770
He has been dead to me for 20 years.

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,640
Then you should have no qualms.

56
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,810
Let's follow our plan.

57
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,320
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

58
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,520
Hello, Madam.

59
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,330
Lucia seems to think very highly of you.

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,990
Does she?

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,530
She asked me for a special favor.

62
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,030
That I help you out
because she thinks you're a decent person.

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,670
I'll put you in touch
with people at the fund.

64
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,770
Thank you so much.

65
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,040
How should I make it up to you?

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,910
Pay me back for years to come.

67
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,910
Now we have an actual relationship.

68
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,980
Yes.

69
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,550
I didn't think we'd end up
doing business together.

70
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,320
I hope this relationship
lasts to the very end.

71
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,430
We don't want it to turn sour.

72
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,330
Why would it turn sour?
Ours will be a happy ending.

73
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,300
A happy ending?

74
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,400
Oh, when should I tell Lucia
to start at Mingang?

75
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,610
Any time works for me.
I welcome her with open arms.

(Business Strategy

77
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,360
What the heck is this?

78
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,260
There's nothing special to it.

79
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,660
What is it?

80
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,030
Do you have something to say?

81
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,640
- Yes?
- No. Not at all.

(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

83
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,280
What is it?

84
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,790
I secured the funds
for the online business.

85
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,360
Tell the team not to worry.

86
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,820
How did you manage that?

87
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,560
I found an investor.

88
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,300
We'll get enough money to pay off
the outstanding accounts and bills...

89
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,200
and still have a lot left over.

90
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,000
Where did you suddenly get...

91
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,540
It can't be from a financial institution.

92
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,400
I didn't go to a bank,

93
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,070
but I took care of it, so don't worry.

94
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,740
Oh, and I hired someone special
to join your team.

95
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,140
This was my personal hire,
so teach them well.

96
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,050
You might not have to teach anything
since they're that competent.

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,950
Do your best to work together.

98
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,330
The financial worries are over.

99
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,300
I found an investor,
and we'll get the money soon.

100
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,030
From where and how?

101
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,700
Do I have to tell you that too?

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,470
I solved the problem,

103
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,810
so stop telling me
to scrap the online business.

104
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,580
You established Mingang Distribution
with your blood and sweat,

105
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,410
but it's not special to just you anymore.

106
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,250
I guess you found some cash
that had no other use.

107
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,760
Did they agree to invest
knowing your poor sales figures?

108
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,820
You bet.
I didn't hide or lie about anything.

109
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,330
Don't let your mistakes
threaten the chain store.

110
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,360
That won't happen. Don't worry.

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,600
And don't ever say
you'll make Soo Jung CEO either.

112
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,970
You don't care whether someone is
half-related to you or an utter stranger,

113
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,670
but no one will love Mingang
as much as I do.

114
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,740
Did you forget what I gave up...

115
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,310
in the US 20 years ago to come back here?

116
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,250
I won't promote Soo Jung for a while.

117
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,020
I won't share...

118
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,320
Mingang Distribution,
and I won't lose it to anyone.

119
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,470
Everyone. I have some good news.

120
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,010
We secured the necessary funds
to keep operating.

121
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,580
You don't have to worry.

122
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,210
Is that true, sir?

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,010
Is our team safe now?

124
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,520
Yes. We got an investment,

125
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,190
and you'll have no problem
running sales now.

126
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,790
That's great.

127
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,360
I'd been tiptoeing around
the Home and Mart team...

128
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,820
in the cafeteria at lunchtime.

129
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,260
Me too. We work together,
but we're the worst of rivals.

130
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,160
They brag and glare at us
because they're doing better.

131
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
I can't stand it.

132
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,340
Oh, and one more person
will join our team.

133
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,010
Just a moment. Who signed off on that?

134
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,110
Mingang Distribution
isn't some corner store.

135
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,240
We have an annual hiring process.

136
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,610
You can't hire someone out of the blue.

137
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,250
I strongly dislike it when people high up
pull strings to give someone a job.

138
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,190
I don't think you should complain
when that's how you got here.

139
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,230
And it wasn't me.

140
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,060
Our CEO hired someone.

141
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,840
I really don't like that punk.

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,320
Hey, Lawyer Kim.

144
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,620
Have you heard?

145
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,230
My team got an investment.

146
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,230
Yes. The CEO signed a deal
with a Macau-based fund.

147
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,030
How did she do that?

148
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,130
She has no profits to show for.

149
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,830
That's why she's so good.

150
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,370
Are you crazy, or do you want to be crazy?

151
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,510
How can you have a crush
on someone like her?

152
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,850
What's that?

153
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,750
I don't know.

154
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,550
It's a file Director Moon
threw in the trash in a fury.

155
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,390
He threw this in the trash?

156
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,400
Yes.

(Mingang Distribution Inc.)

159
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,940
He dared to refuse to do what I ordered?

160
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,280
Shall I call him here right now?

161
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,250
Let him be. I'll sort him out myself.

162

That's all the documents you asked for.

163
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,630
When will you start work?

164
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,660
Right away. I shouldn't have to wait.

165
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,730
Don't you wonder about her?

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,670
I do sometimes.

167
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Who do you mean?

168
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,270
The Min family's youngest.

169
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,140
Min Kyung Chae's favorite sibling.

170
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,580
We'll meet again soon.

171
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,280

I'm bored sick.

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,360
What should I do now
that I've stopped going to the academy?

174
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,140
You don't have class today either?

175
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,410
I told you I have no class for a while
because the instructor is taking a break.

176
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,510
You should enroll somewhere else, then.

177
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,110
Shall I call the academy to ask?

178
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,320
No. I'll take care of it myself.

179
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,820
It's best to stick with
the same instructor.

180
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,450
You don't know anything at all.

181
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,520
Ms. Se Ri. I trust in you.

182
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,730
Don't worry about me.

183
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,690
I'll take the CSAT and go to university.

184
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,870
Do you think I'm pretending to study
when I quit the academy?

185
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,170
Doubting someone too much is an illness.

186
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,710
You'll find out later on...

187
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,470
if I was lying or not.

188
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,180
Okay. Prove your hard work
with good results.

189
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,490
See how it feels
to get stabbed in the back.

190
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,890
I just have to sell my shares
and leave the country before then.

191
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,260
I won't ever come back.

192
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,700
I wish I could meet my mom.

193
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,800
Is she dead or alive?

194
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,370
Where is she?

195
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,540
She won't even look for me?

196
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,870
Am I the only one who cares?

197
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,080
It's so annoying.

198
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,920
Why didn't I think of that?

199
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,420
I can look for her that way.

200
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,730
Lucia, can I use your skin toner?

201
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,330
My skin toner?

202
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,310
Here you go.

203
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,510
Lucia.

204
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,610
It's okay to let it show.

205
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,950
- What?
- If you miss someone,

206
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,920
it's okay to let it show.

207
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,220
It's hypocritical to pretend you're okay.

208
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,290
No.

209
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,230
Maybe later.

210
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,460
Right now, I have work to do.

211
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,930
Will you get actively into things
now that...

212
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,300
you start work tomorrow?

213
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,700
How about the funds?

214
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,110
Can you hand them off
to Kyung Chae right away?

215
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,610
That's not the hard part.

216
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,180
The real challenge
is getting our hands on Mingang stock.

217
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,110
Funding their business...

218
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,150
doesn't mean we get a stake.

219
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,690
Becoming a powerful shareholder...

220
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,820
is a must if we're to shake Mingang.

221
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,620
I didn't think the businesses
would be kept separate.

222
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,830
Min Doo Sik seems to have
thought of everything.

223
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,530
Don't worry.

224
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,500
I'll bring Mingang down myself.

225
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,000
However the father and daughter react,

226
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,840
I will do it.

227
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,640
(Mingang Distribution)

228
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,740
(Mingang Distribution)

229
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
The doors are opening.

230
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,900
Going up.

231
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
The doors are closing.

232
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,140
It's your first day at work.

233
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,440
Yes.

234
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,110
Perfect.
We can drop by the office together.

235
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,730
Meet Jung Lucia, your new colleague.

236
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,430
Nice to meet you. I'm Jung Lucia.

237
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,830
She studied in the US...

238
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,640
and was an MD
at a logistics company over there.

239
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,440
I hope you work well together.

240
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,640
Good luck.

241
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,650
I brought a copy of my diploma,

242
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,880
proof of work experience,
and the portfolio from my previous job.

243
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,950
You're to hand those in to HR.

244
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,890
I'll hand them in for you.

245
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,220
No, I'll do that myself.

246
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,330
Can you take my bag instead?

247
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,880
Ms. Jung Lucia?

248
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,020
Yes?

249
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,360
You know me, don't you?

250
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,120
We met in the CEO's office.

251
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,060
I know you.

252
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,260
Lawyer Kim Sun Jae from Legal.

253
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,130
We aren't hiring right now,

254
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,040
so you're a special hire.

255
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,800
Who was it?

256
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,010
Was it our CEO?

257
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,780
How did you pull that off?

258
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,650
Ask the CEO yourself
if you'd like to know.

259
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,210
Goodbye.

260
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,580
Why do you feel so familiar?

261
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,560
I must have a common face.

262
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,390
No, it's not that.

263
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,660
I think I know you.

264
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,670
Is Jung Lucia your real name?

265
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,500
Yes, it is.

266
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,070
Have you heard the name "Baek Sul Hee?"

267
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,310
No. I've never heard that name before.

268
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,580
You can dupe anyone else but not me.

269
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,250
We were pretty close.

270
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,830
Honey. I'm sorry I'm late.

271
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,330
Welcome home.

272
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,000
You must be hungry.
Sorry I didn't cook anything.

273
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,070
It's not like you sit around
doing nothing.

274
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,140
You work two jobs.
You don't have any spare time.

275
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,910
But you study all day long.
You need to eat well.

276
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,780
This is enough for me.

277
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,750
I'll pour the hot water for you.

278
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,550
- No, let me.
- What?

279
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Okay.

280
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,660
It's hot!

281
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,660
Are you okay?

282
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,190
I'll get some ice.

283
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,070
I'm sorry it'll leave a scar.

284
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,870
Don't mind that at all.

285
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,600
It's no big deal.

286
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,970
This isn't a scar. It's a badge of honor.

287
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,270
When you pass the bar...

288
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,510
and become a prosecutor or judge,

289
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,340
we can look at this
and remember the old days.

290
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,650
I'm actually grateful I'll have the scar.

291
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,880
It's proof that you and I
are getting through the hard times.

292
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,390
It's a prize of sorts.

293
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,660
Ms. Lucia.

294
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,700
Yes?

295
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,530
Hello.

296
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,200
Director Moon sent me after you.
He said you might get lost.

297
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,640
HR is on another floor.

298
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,670
Okay.

299
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,110
Come with me.

300
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,090
Call Ja Kyung before you go.

301
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,920
The in-laws aren't a fan of you already,
and if you go with no appointment,

302
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,090
they'll like you even less.

303
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,330
How many times must I say this?

304
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,760
I wanted to go last time,
but the side dishes distracted me.

305
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,500
Don't you blame the food.

306
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,970
You wouldn't let the delivery lady go
because she was from your hometown.

307
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,900
Food is all the same.

308
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,740
You made a fuss over nothing.

309
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,110
You sound like an engine on a paper plane.

310
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,570
Not all food is the same.

311
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,580
Some food tastes better than others.
Let your conscience admit it.

312
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,750
I'm on a perpetual weight loss program
because of your food.

313
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,080
Okay, fine.

314
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,580
Call Ja Kyung first,

315
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,190
and give Ji Seop a hint too.

316
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,020
Why should I drop hints
when I'm offering to fund their business?

317
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,890
I'm saying you should
make calculations before you move.

318
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,890
You ignored them for weeks
while they struggled.

319
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,700
Offering to invest now
if they promote Ji Seop...

320
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,200
will look shallow.

321
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,870
Who cares if that's shallow?

322
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,640
We should be transparent.

323
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,600
I'll let anyone see through me.

324
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,640
I'll do anything
if it'll help Ji Seop's career.

325
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,210
My only regret is that
I must leave pretty you home alone.

326
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,680
Don't be pretty without me.

327
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,450
I brought the side dishes you asked for.

328
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,190
- Hello.
- Hello, ma'am.

329
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,760
I took some food to your parents.

330
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,790
They liked it, didn't they?

331
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,300
Yes. They're both lovely people,

332
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,660
and are kind too.

333
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,000
You know how to sweet-talk.

334
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,000
I know my parents,
and they're not lovely or kind.

335
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,910
Take them only the best food
since she put you in touch with them.

336
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,340
And as I said before, don't spread gossip.

337
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,110
I won't do that.

338
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,610
Oh, and I made...

339
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,080
some palace-style tteokbokki...

340
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,250
because you said
you wanted some last time.

341
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,250
See?

342
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,720
You know how to win people over.

343
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,730
You asked to see me, sir?

344
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,470
Someone found this in the trash
and brought it to me.

345
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,750
You tossed something
I gave you in the trash?

346
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,520
What does that mean?

347
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,160
It means I cannot do as you said.

348
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,490
What?

349
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,260
I apologize. I can't do it.

350
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,830
Why not?

351
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,160
You know why not.

352
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,670
Jogeon Logistics is a small company.

353
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,900
It's run by a couple...

354
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,770
and four or five workers
they consider family.

355
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,970
So what?

356
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,710
Stealing a system they worked on
for years to develop...

357
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,050
is not something
any human being should do.

358
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,750
Are you worried
I'll hold you responsible later on?

359
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,320
You know Lawyer Kim
will handle the legal stuff.

360
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,450
Do you know the law better than he does?

361
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,060
How dare you decide what you can't do?

362
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,720
You almost ran
the new business into the ground,

363
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,290
and you're not worth your pay.

364
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,130
Quit complaining and do as I say.

365
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,300
I can't, sir.

366
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,260
I won't do anything
that will make others weep.

367
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,070
You care too much about others.

368
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,340
We must turn someone's crisis
into our opportunity.

369
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,940
We must climb over them to get higher.

370
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,710
You claim to be a director
when you can't even do that?

371
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,450
My parents died 30 years ago...

372
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,750
because your greed
couldn't allow them to live.

373
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,790
I can't watch you do the same thing.

374
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,890
I gave you a chance to make up
for your shortcomings, and you refused?

375
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,330
I'm sorry, sir.

376
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,430
Get out!

377
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,600
Director Moon.

378
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,170
Your contract mentions
that not only must you turn a profit,

379
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,740
but if we find out you sabotaged Mingang,

380
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,370
we'll sue you for damages
and annul your contract.

381
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,840
You should keep that in mind.

382
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,430
Whatever happens,

383
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,300
I won't create more victims like myself.

384
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,470
Wait and see.

385
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,940
Whatever it takes,

386
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,910
I will stop you.

387
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,650
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

388
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,010
- Hello?
- It's Min Kyung Chae.

389
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,180
You don't have my number saved?

390
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,710
I'll save it now.

391
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,750
Why did you call?

392
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,480
Come over to my office.

393
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,080
Let's have a cup of tea.

394
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,690
I'm working right now.

395
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,250
This is about work.

396
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,790
Come over right away.

397
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,570
Welcome. Take a seat.

398
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,080
I forgot to tell you something important.

399
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,380
You're a special hire
with work experience,

400
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,850
so you can't be an ordinary employee.

401
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,580
You should head a team.

402
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,320
What do you think?

403
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,350
What if people talk about
the radical hiring in a bad way?

404
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,960
It's not radical.

405
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,990
I saw the documents you handed in to HR.

406
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,830
You did much better than I imagined.

407
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,600
Don't flatter me.

408
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,300
I needed your help
with something else at first,

409
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,740
but now I need your help
running the business.

410
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,970
I did transfer the smartest people
to work on the online business team,

411
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,980
but Director Moon doesn't have
an equal to partner with.

412
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,510
You could be that partner.

413
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,490
This needs sorting out pretty soon.

414
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,900
Who are you?

415
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,230
She's my team's special hire.

416
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm Jung Lucia.

417
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,240
I'm Director Min Soo Jung
in charge of Home and Mart.

418
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,780
Who hired you?

419
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,250
CEO Min did.

420
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Did she?

421
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,950
Go over it once more before moving ahead.

422
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,870
Ms. Jung?

423
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,040
Can I have a word?

424
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,970
What about?

425
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,610
Follow me.

426
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,260
Why do you think I asked to see you?

427
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,530
I don't know.

428
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,760
You must be pretty special
if my sister hired you herself.

429
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,700
What's your relationship like?

430
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,200
We're not that close.

431
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,140
We met not long ago.

432
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,270
That can't be.

433
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,880
My sister doesn't open up to just anyone.

434
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,050
But that doesn't matter.

435
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:46,220
I'd like you
to get really close to my sister...

436
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,790
so that nothing can get in the way.

437
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,660
Close enough that you even share secrets.

438
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,530
And then I'd like you to share...

439
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,400
those secrets with me.

440
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,930
Not for free, of course.

441
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,630
You will be compensated.

442
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,070
Do you know what I'm saying?

443
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,740
What?

444
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,680
You didn't expect things to be like this?

445
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,410
Don't you watch TV?

446
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,880
You must know how members
of the owner's family fight.

447
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,820
I didn't expect what happened on TV
to happen in real life.

448
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,920
What you see on TV
is the watered-down version.

449
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,190
Reality is much worse.

450
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,260
So what? Will you be my spy or not?

451
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,130
I'll think about it
if the pay is worth it.

452
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,570
I'm glad you're the realistic sort.

453
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,270
Think about it, then.

454
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,420
It's not fair.

455
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,520
I'm so angry, and it's driving me crazy!

456
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,900
You said people who did wrong
would be punished.

457
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,030
That's how the world works.

458
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,300
That's what you told me.

459
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,340
You said everyone paid for doing wrong.

460
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,180
So why... Why won't they be punished?

461
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,910
Are the rich allowed to get away with it?

462
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,350
I'm sorry, Mom.

463
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,430
Mi So!

464
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Ms. Lucia.

465
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,710
Ms. Lucia!

466
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,510
Ms. Lucia.

467
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,150
Ms. Lucia. Wake up.

468
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,510
Ms. Lucia!

469
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,020
Ms. Lucia. Wake up!

470
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,990
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

471
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,070
The online business will take off now.

472
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,970
Stay alert and do your jobs.

473
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,340
I don't think my dad is asking too much.

474
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,680
It's a revolution of sorts.

475
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,150
It could look like sabotage.

476
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,580
What about Jung Lucia?

477
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,980
Why don't you see...

478
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,750
just how skilled she really is?

479
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,790
Is there a secret I don't know of?

480
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,060
Does that mean we're a team now?

481
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,120
Do you do everything the CEO says?

482
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,690
Even if it means hurting the innocent?

483
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,830
You're Jung Lucia?

484
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,160
No. Whatever others say,
to me, you're Baek Sul Hee.
