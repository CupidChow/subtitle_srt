00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,040
(Episode 36)

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,050
Goodness...

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,320
Where were you all this time?

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,690
Now you finally show up.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,630
Jo Pil Doo!

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,690
What the...

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,100
Why did you run away?

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,370
Why on earth?

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,780
Why?

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,190
Oh, no. Your fist...

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,890
My gosh.

12
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,670
Shouldn't you get your hand checked out?

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,540
It'll be fine.

14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,880
I know I'm a dirtbag coward,

15
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,180
but I had no choice.

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,680
I'm so scared of him.

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,520
He's not someone I can take on.

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,450
I said you wouldn't get hurt.

19
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,420
I told you I'd keep you safe.

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,660
You don't know what you're saying.

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,860
Ever since Min Doo Sik
saw me at the hospital,

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,100
I've been followed by men
I'd never seen before.

23
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,200
Wherever I go to hide,
they find me in no time.

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,840
Why do you think I live on the street...

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,300
when I have a home?

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,140
You can't live like this forever.

27
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,410
Wouldn't it be better
to testify in court and start over?

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,650
I'd love to do that,

29
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,720
but I can't because I'm an alcoholic.

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,050
I can't testify. I can't do anything.

31
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,050
What about my parents who were wronged?

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,520
There's nothing I can do...

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,590
if you won't testify in court for me!

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,560
Can't we just let it go?

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Why bring it back up after so many years?

36
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,300
How can you say that?

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,640
Listen. I'm really sorry.

38
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,110
I may live on the street,
but at least I'm alive.

39
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,680
I don't want
to get dragged off somewhere...

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,280
and killed off in secret.

41
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,620
Pretend you didn't see me.

42
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,890
Think of me as a dead man.

43
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,520
If I testify,
Min Doo Sik will kill me off.

44
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,490
Let me live. I want to live.

45
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,730
I want to live until I go senile.

46
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,230
Can't you help me out this once?
Let me go, please.

47
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,600
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,110
Go.

49
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,710
Get lost!

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,320
I'll go, then.

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,890
I'm really getting lost.

52
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,190
Who was that man?

53
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,060
Someone important to me.

54
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,530
The only witness
who can prove that my parents...

55
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,730
were wrongfully killed.

56
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,810
You gave up on the only way...

57
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,810
to prove your parents were killed.

58
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,150
I don't get it.

59
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,250
Neither do I.

60
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,060
I don't understand...

61
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,260
what I just did.

62
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,430
Are you going to give up?

63
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,160
I can't do that.

64
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,840
Not when I know how my parents died.

65
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,300
Then why...

66
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,810
That man said...

67
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,540
he wanted to live even if it meant...

68
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,850
being homeless.

69
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,780
That's how bad he wanted to live.

70
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,850
He begged me for his life.

71
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,690
I didn't know what else to say.

72
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,930
Are you up against...

73
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,430
someone so powerful that testifying...

74
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,930
could endanger his life?

75
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,670
They're powerful enough...

76
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,440
to turn the victim into the assailant.

77
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,550
(Mingang Distribution)

78
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Where did you two get back from?

79
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,730
Did you make up a fake business trip?

80
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,600
Shut your mouth.

81
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,600
It's none of your business.

82
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,270
- What?
- Shall I say it again?

83
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,940
You're not welcome to comment.

84
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,480
Can't you tell
the director is in a foul mood?

85
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,080
But then,
what would the likes of you know?

86
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,150
"The likes of me?"

87
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,390
Every person...

88
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,490
has an invisible line
that no one should cross.

89
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,430
When someone is suffering already,
leave them alone.

90
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,430
You talk as if he worked his butt off
and got the deals renewed...

91
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,100
when he lost all our partners.

92
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,530
Stop it already.

93
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,270
I used to know a man exactly like you.

94
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,710
I don't think he'll ever do well in life.

95
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,850
He lived a nasty,

96
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,450
cowardly life.

97
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,150
He thought he was smart and calculative,

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,420
but people like that...

99
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,120
are bound to fall into their own trap.

100
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,000
I wish I could just...

101
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,270
Even Min Doo Sik dumped you.

102
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,570
Should I expose who you are?

103
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,180
If the Min family were to find out...

104
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,480
you came back, they'd crush you to dust.

105
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,520
Don't you know I'm being nice to you?

106
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,950
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

107
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,500
I have a question,
and I'd like an honest answer.

108
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,670
There's a reason
you must stay at Mingang, isn't there?

109
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,610
I'm right, aren't I?

110
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,340
Your parents' death.

111
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,180
You must work here to solve the secret.

112
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,180
Yes.

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,490
I joined the company
because I thought I could find a clue.

114
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,190
That's why I accepted CEO Min's job offer.

115
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,830
Unfortunately, though,

116
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,630
I haven't found anything yet.

117
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,830
Nothing at all.

118
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,340
Then you must stay
until you find something.

119
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,340
You can't go,
even if you're being forced out.

120
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,040
That's true,

121
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,080
but I might not have a choice...

122
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,610
if things don't work out.

123
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,860
Welcome. I think I know why you're here.

124
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,390
Am I right?

125
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,800
(Director Min Soo Jung)

126
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,470
I'm glad you're here.

127
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
Promise that you will do what you said.

128
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,540
You have to keep
your side of the bargain too, then.

129
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,610
It'll be much harder for you.

130
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,410
I just have to...

131
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,610
make a few calls
to get people to vote how I want,

132
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,410
but you have to get rid of Min Kyung Chae.

133
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,820
And before that,

134
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,950
you must become the chairman's lover.

135
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,790
I keep whatever promise I make.

136
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,930
Make sure that Director Moon...

137
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,830
keeps his job and doesn't get replaced.

138
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,730
Okay.

139
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,130
I know my father well.

140
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,200
He struggles to give up on someone
he once opened up to.

141
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,070
There must be a reason he pushed you away,

142
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,810
and I'm pretty sure my sister is involved.

143
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,980
The chairman is a romantic.

144
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,710
Once he thinks someone is on his side,
he never gives up on them.

145
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,420
I'll bet on it.

146
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,520
I'm curious, though.

147
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,220
If the chairman were to fall for me,

148
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,360
that wouldn't be good for you either.

149
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,330
That's for us to fight out later on.

150
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,700
Once we get what we want right now.

151
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,110
What were you doing in there?

152
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,710
Let's have a chat.

153
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,820
Are you and Soo Jung up to something?

154
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,520
Why would we be?

155
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,320
You had better not.

156
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,860
I don't think I could take it if you were.

157
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,860
Don't you know...

158
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,200
I'm trying hard to hold back?

159
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,870
My patience is limited.

160
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,500
Anyone who goes too far gets hurt.

161
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,440
You can go.

162
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,720
What did you want with her?

163
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,090
I saw her leaving Soo Jung's office.

164
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,890
Director Min's office?

165
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
It's not a good sign.

166
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,200
Anything Soo Jung gets involved in
gets messed up.

167
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,500
Summon a board meeting.

168
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,970
Hold Director Moon responsible
for losing our partners...

169
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,040
and use that as an excuse to renew
the Online Business Team.

170
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,680
You can send Lucia...

171
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,950
to another department or another region.

172
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,520
We'll hear from the partners
in a few days.

173
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,550
Then Father will find out too.

174
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,590
He must attend the board meeting.

175
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,770
What did you say to Lucia?

176
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,970
What would I say?

177
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,910
I have no business with her.

178
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,710
You can be so weird.

179
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,980
You're the one who hired
both her and Director Moon.

180
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,980
Almost everyone disapproved
of Director Moon's appointment.

181
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,990
You convinced Father too.

182
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,160
Oh, and Lucia. She was your special hire.

183
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,060
I'm glad you said that.

184
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,560
Since I hired them both,

185
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,100
you shouldn't care what I do with them.

186
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,570
You.

187
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,340
Know your place
if you want to stay a director.

188
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
Keep quiet and work.

189
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,910
I'll make you pay if I catch you scheming.

190
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,720
The sisters are really something.

191
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,590
They're so much alike.

192
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,460
People would think they were full sisters.

193
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,660
I'll side with Min Soo Jung...

194
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,830
and help Director Moon.

195
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,160
You should.

196
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,100
It may look like the sisters
are fighting over the company,

197
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,940
power, and influence,

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,870
but there's a much more serious
underlying issue.

199
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,310
Something more serious?

200
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,080
Min Soo Jung's birth mother.

201
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,010
You know she was a famous escort, right?

202
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,450
And about her relationship
with Min Doo Sik.

203
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,150
Yes, I heard.

204
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,990
Everyone knows about Director Min's birth.

205
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,060
Then, do you know her birth mom...

206
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,660
killed herself?

207
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,360
She took her own life?

208
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,730
That's what the police concluded.

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,340
The problem is,
it wasn't a simple suicide.

210
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,300
She was killed off.

211
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,680
- By whom?
- Who do you think?

212
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,410
That's why Min Kyung Chae
and Min Soo Jung...

213
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,380
can be nothing but sworn enemies.

214
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,050
It's not just about
who takes over the company.

215
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,160
That would infuriate Director Min.

216
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
It would.

217
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,860
We can use it as a hidden card to cause...

218
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,330
a serious rift between them.

219
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,200
Side with Min Soo Jung for now...

220
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,130
and prevent Moon Tae Kyung
from being penalized.

221
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,040
Let's think of what to do next afterward.

222
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,380
To what do I owe
this late-night call, Chairman Cha?

223
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,210
I called out of concern.

224
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,180
Everyone is talking, you see.

225
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,050
No one has any reason
to gossip about Mingang.

226
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,250
Miyeon and Woojin are strong companies
that have survived the test of time,

227
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,790
and they're almost like family to you.

228
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,130
Losing partners like them
to companies younger than yours...

229
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,300
will make you look bad,
and I almost feel sorry for you.

230
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,430
People do love to talk...

231
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,370
when nothing is official yet.

232
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,940
It's good to hear you're still relaxed.

233
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,840
I called because I was so worried.

234
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,040
My company values morals
as much as it does tradition,

235
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,410
and we can't respond
to every cheap dig from a competitor.

236
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,310
What can I do...

237
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,980
if a competitor bribes someone
to sign with them?

238
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,450
Losing such partners
will still hit you hard.

239
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,090
You know me. I have a plan for everything.

240
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,060
How about a round of golf one day?

241
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,030
Bye, then.

242
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,500
Darn him.

243
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,830
Did he call to console me or aggravate me?

244
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,870
Goodness.

245
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,170
It might be for the better.
I can get rid of Moon Tae Kyung...

246
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,770
and take back the shares he got.

247
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,810
Darn it.

248
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,720
Pretend you didn't see me.

249
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,820
Think of me as a dead man.

250
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,260
If I testify,
Min Doo Sik will kill me off.

251
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,700
Let me live. I want to live.

252
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,930
I want to live until I go senile.

253
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,140
Can't you help me out this once?
Let me go, please.

254
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,780
I shouldn't have let him go.

255
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,650
Will I never get to take...

256
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,680
Min Doo Sik to court?

257
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,840
Where are the others?

258
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,010
None of them has an appetite,
and they won't join you.

259
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,470
Why did they
suddenly lose their appetites?

260
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,780
I don't know.

261
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,450
Do you think they can't stand
seeing you sit in Father's spot?

262
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,050
Why can't I take a vacant seat?

263
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,190
They're all spoiled, rude brats.

264
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,220
Can't they see I'm doing this
just to feel better?

265
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,460
Yes. They both rank above you at work,
and this is your only chance...

266
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,860
to sit at the head of the table.

267
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,370
Don't let them intimidate you.

268
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,400
Do whatever you want while Father is away.

269
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,270
It suits you amazingly.

270
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,610
Does it? Do I look good?

271
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,240
Totally.

272
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,610
It's such a shame.

273
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,110
You'd look good behind the desk
of a CEO or a chairman...

274
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,280
if only you were given a chance to sit.

275
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,780
Exactly.

276
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,390
Director Moon.

277
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,560
I just got the call.

278
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,560
Neither of the partners
will renew their contracts.

279
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,800
What will you do now?

280
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,170
Distribution is paramount
to a company like ours.

281
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,140
If we can't deliver on time,

282
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,240
orders mean nothing,
and you must know that.

283
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,080
Their contracts with us
haven't expired yet...

284
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,280
Are you relaxed with a plan
or lost without one?

285
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,450
Shouldn't you have had
a solution in place...

286
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,280
in case this happened?

287
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,850
Not only could you lose your job,
but your whole team could be broken up.

288
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,890
Hey, what are you talking about?

289
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,460
Lawyer Kim.
Why would our team get broken up?

290
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,800
Without the most important partners,

291
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,130
your team will be unable to function.

292
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,370
Naturally,
someone will be held responsible.

293
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,480
I only just got a job at the head office.

294
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,080
Will you say something?

295
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,390
I heard too.

296
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,190
And I called to confirm it.

297
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,730
Let's find a company to replace them with
from the list I gave you last time.

298
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,630
They're still small,
but if you trust them with...

299
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,470
It's not that simple an issue.

300
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,500
There are many options out there.

301
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,670
So many that we're spoiled for choice.

302
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,710
That's why we must pick a few now...

303
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,470
so our business won't be disrupted.

304
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,910
The real issue...

305
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,810
is the fact that we lost
two important business partners.

306
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,880
We made Miyeon and Woojin
what they are today,

307
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,150
and all that investment was for nothing.

308
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,520
What would happen
to Mingang's reputation...

309
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,620
if that were to end up in the news?

310
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,430
Our competitors lured them away
by offering too much money,

311
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,400
but you should've done something
to keep them with us.

312
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,430
They know our system and process
better than anyone.

313
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,800
As I told you before,

314
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,270
I don't want to respond
by using the same tricks.

315
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,570
I admire your principles.

316
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,880
But don't you forget
that such principles...

317
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,610
come with consequences.

318
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,850
I have such wicked debtors.

319
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,320
Look at the collateral
they didn't collect.

320
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,330
If you'd wanted to die,
you should've repaid me first.

321
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,830
And where did you disappear to
instead of paying me back?

322
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,900
When will you people
come back to your senses?

323
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,840
What's this?

324
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,900
Why is this still here?

325
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,740
Hang on.

326
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,650
I knew it.

327
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,580
Yang Mal Sook. You beauty!

328
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,080
Yang Mal Sook!

329
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,620
You beautiful woman!

330
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,420
- What?
- Take a look at this.

331
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,560
The money Sun Jae borrowed
to fund his studies.

332
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,330
What are you on about?

333
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,030
You made him cough up every single cent.

334
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,830
I thought so too,
but he still owes us some change.

335
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,870
See?

336
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,640
My gosh. You want to make him pay
the last few dollars and cents?

337
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,840
Now? Years later?

338
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,440
Even if the calculator is wrong,
the math must be done right.

339
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,140
Tell him to come over.

340
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,480
That's too much.

341
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,910
He's my older sister's only son.

342
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,020
The money I lend is my child.

343
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,350
I'll call if you won't.

344
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,190
Fine.

345
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,990
Hi, Sun Jae.

346
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,260
Who's this?

347
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,500
It's your aunt. Save my number, will you?

348
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,670
You always ask who I am.

349
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,100
Get right to the point.

350
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,640
Drop by if you're free after work.

351
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,370
What for?

352
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,670
Let's have dinner together.

353
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,910
I haven't seen you in a while.

354
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,080
Give me that.

355
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,510
Sun Jae, I believe some money
is yet to change hands between us.

356
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,980
Come over and pay me the rest. Bye.

357
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,490
Hi. What's up, Mom?

358
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,930
For real?

359
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,670
No one can stop Dad.

360
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,070
Don't be too upset.

361
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,140
Shall we go shopping tomorrow?
I'll cheer you up.

362
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,670
A daughter can do that much.

363
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,680
Okay. See you tomorrow.

364
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,720
Why are you looking at me like that?

365
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,790
You're close to your mom.

366
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,060
Do you have secrets too?

367
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,730
Why would we?

368
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,230
Forget secrets. We're the best of friends.

369
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,900
Like soulmates.

370
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,400
That's how moms and daughters are.

371
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,870
What's yours is mine,
and what's mine is yours.

372
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,050
(Certificate of Deposit,
Bearer Check, One Million Dollars)

373
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,790
It's Se Ri.

374
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,700
Let's meet tomorrow.

375
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,300
Do you think giving the CEO...

376
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,840
a list of candidates will solve anything?

377
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,310
Who can say they'll do
as well as Miyeon or Woojin?

378
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,510
We all start out as nobodies.

379
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,310
How we help and trust someone
changes the outcome.

380
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,080
That's how you'll avoid penalization?

381
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,020
I won't avoid penalization.

382
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,850
I won't resort to the same...

383
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,920
immoral tricks our competitors pulled.

384
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,690
The same goes for the partners
who chose money over loyalty.

385
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,600
You're so glib-tongued.

386
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,430
Look what your lofty philosophy
did to your team...

387
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,400
in the past four years.

388
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,140
Who cares how you reach your destination?

389
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,170
No.

390
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,640
We must follow the right path
even if it takes us to a different place.

391
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,710
That is what is right.

392
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,650
Let's wait and find out...

393
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,820
if my lofty philosophy
is nothing but pointless talk.

394
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,720
I strongly believe...

395
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,020
that what is right prevails,
whatever happens.

396
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,700
Why are you doing this?

397
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,940
Why are you always after him?

398
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,610
Tell me honestly. What do you want?

399
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,180
What I want?

400
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,950
Yes. What you want.

401
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,890
What I want is the truth.

402
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,730
I could even help Moon Tae Kyung
if you tell the truth.

403
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,830
It's not that grand a truth, either.

404
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,840
One sentence is all it takes.

405
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,710
"I am Baek Sul Hee."

406
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,210
Say it.

407
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,920
You can't say it, can you?

408
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,560
Stay in your place, then!

409
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,610
He listed a few possible companies
to sign with.

410
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,450
It's all down to the contract.

411
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,050
They can't proceed
if we don't approve the contracts.

412
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,190
I have the upper hand on Moon Tae Kyung.

413
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,920
They won't see sense
until their business stalls...

414
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,860
because they can't move anything.

415
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,130
Director.

416
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,900
Where were you at?

417
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,340
Let's visit the companies
you listed as possible partners.

418
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,770
Right now?

419
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,210
Let's visit them all today...

420
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,280
and prepare the contracts, just in case.

421
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,280
Separate versions for Legal and CEO Min.

422
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,450
Why do you want to do that?

423
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,820
Do you think Legal
will do something with the contracts?

424
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,420
I think so.

425
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,860
They'll nitpick
a few of the clauses to stall,

426
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,190
so our team will suffer
and get in trouble.

427
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,930
There's no way...

428
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,230
we can visit every company in one day.

429
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,070
I don't mind working all night.

430
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,340
Are you sure about this?

431
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,280
I'm sorry for the sudden order.

432
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,550
It's fine.
You're expecting a sudden visitor.

433
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,020
I did my best to make some good stuff,

434
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,550
but I don't know if you'll like it.

435
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,350
Everything you make is delicious.

436
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,660
I'll get going, then.

437
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,720
Okay.

438
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,190
Goodness.

439
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,230
Oh, my dear. Welcome.

440
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,470
How long has it been?

441
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,800
Let's see your face.

442
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,850
You look nicer with time.

443
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,050
Ji Seop looks worse each time I see him,
I fear he'll wither away.

444
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,250
You must have a cushy job.

445
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,550
I put in a little extra.

446
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,390
Goodbye.

447
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,630
Yes, goodbye.

448
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,060
Why don't you stay for dinner?

449
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,930
I got a lot of your favorites.

450
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,230
No, thanks. I've already eaten.

451
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,730
As if you ate.

452
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,740
You live alone and work all day.
You can't be eating well.

453
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,310
If I'd known this would happen,

454
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,680
I should've told you to marry
the girl you dated as a student.

455
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,150
She was sweet and pretty.

456
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,180
What was her name again?

457
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
I should go.

458
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,390
No, wait. Sun Jae!

459
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,120
Darn you.

460
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,540
Check, check, check, check.

461
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,310
The rich are even worse.

462
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,840
He put in a little extra?
The only extra is the envelope.

463
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,240
He must make a fortune as head of Legal.

464
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,850
How could you not even let him sit?

465
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,880
He didn't even get to sit at the table.

466
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,850
What kind of uncle are you?

467
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,350
Yang Mal Sook! Freeze!

468
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,460
Don't you move.

469
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,360
If you rip that,
I will rip your life apart.

470
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,460
No!

471
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,630
Oh, my gosh. My checks.

472
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,800
I'm sorry, dear checks.
Let me apologize instead.

473
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,610
What the heck?

474
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,380
Why would she mention the person
who came back to ruin my life?

475
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,180
Darn it.

476
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,700
Have you lost your mind?

477
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,330
I'm sorry, sir.

478
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,430
I'm sorry.

479
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,440
What the heck?

480
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,010
(Searching for a missing person)

481
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,620
(Baek Sul Hee,
Date of Birth, September 7, 1985)

482
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,690
Baek Sul Hee.

483
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,030
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

484
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,180
Baek Sul Hee.
I don't care why you joined Mingang.

485
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,180
You can't do anything now.

486
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,450
- Hello?
- What do you mean?

487
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,220
Does someone want you
to leave the company?

488
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,420
You have no memory of my dad,
so forget about him,

489
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,120
but you should meet my oldest sister.

490
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,930
Your oldest sister?

491
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,530
Moon Tae Kyung could face the board.

492
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,900
We must follow the board's vote.

493
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,100
We have no choice
if we're to get rid of Lucia.

494
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,870
We must eliminate the director
to sort out both of them.
