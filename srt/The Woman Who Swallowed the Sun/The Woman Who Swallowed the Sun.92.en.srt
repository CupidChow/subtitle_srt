(Mingang Distribution)

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,480
(Episode 92)

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,350
How convenient. You're both here.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,210
I won't beat around the bush.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,780
You need to step down from your position.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,220
And Director Moon Tae Kyung,

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,090
you're fired as well.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,460
What is the meaning of this?

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,700
Wait, regardless of the reason,
you can't just fire us like this.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,660
After causing that affair scandal?
You have no shame.

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,770
When you're told to get out, you get out!

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,900
Wait, Director Jeong.

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,810
You're crossing a line.

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,940
Did you even bother to check the facts?

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,680
We have photos of you at a motel.
What more proof do you need?

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,320
Don't tell me you're denying it
because we didn't catch you in the act.

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,090
You can't keep your position
after pulling something like this.

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,620
This makes us look bad
for approving you as CEO.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,860
This scandal drags more than
just your name through the mud.

20
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,330
Did Min Kyung Chae,
the acting chairman, put you up to this?

21
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,630
Told you to storm my office and remove me?

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,770
We're not Min Kyung Chae's puppets.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,670
We're acting on our own. Satisfied?

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,040
- The directors will take care of it.
- They'd better.

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,750
They only sided with her back then because
they feared Father learning their secrets,

26
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,380
but the situation's different now.

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,450
Let them get rid of those two.

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,350
We can just wait and see what happens.

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,890
We should.

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
If you're not doing this
on someone's orders,

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,560
that's even worse.

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,130
At least I could've felt sorry for you
if you were.

33
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,260
Look here. Your affair photos
are all over the company,

34
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,700
so where do you get off being so defiant?

35
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,170
Address her with respect.
Who are you to speak to the CEO like that?

36
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,840
This is just embarrassing.

37
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,900
Are you seriously defending her?

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,170
It's a relief the chairman is away.

39
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,180
He'd be devastated if he saw this mess.

40
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,020
I'm glad you mentioned him.
We went there because of the chairman.

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,390
Don't be ridiculous!

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,960
Why would you go to a motel
because of the chairman?

43
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,230
It's clear you'll only hear what you want
and insist you're right.

44
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,430
It's clear you'll get your way,
so I'll save my breath.

45
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,900
But the truth will come out soon enough.
Now, all of you, please leave.

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,200
I will handle this myself.

47
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,910
Who do you think you are, a mob boss?

48
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,350
Sending your minions
to do your dirty work?

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,010
Enjoying playing the boss?

50
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,350
This all could've been avoided
if you'd just stepped down.

51
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,920
Why make things so difficult for everyone?

52
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,220
You're just the acting chairman,
not the official one.

53
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,420
I, on the other hand, was approved
by the board of directors.

54
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,090
So you refuse to step down?

55
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,330
I have no reason to.

56
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,200
Then you leave me no choice.

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,270
I'll call for an official board meeting
and process your dismissal there.

58
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,140
And what if I veto the call
for a board meeting?

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,340
As the convener, I refuse.

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,980
Go ahead and try without my permission.
And if you want to kick me out,

61
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,720
shouldn't you become
the official chairman first,

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,220
instead of just the acting one?

63
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,560
The acting chair telling me to step down?
How absurd.

64
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,370
I used my veto power to block her
from calling a board meeting.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,670
Does that mean we're in the clear now?

66
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,480
For Min Kyung Chae to have me dismissed,
she must be the official chairman first.

67
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,950
For her to be inaugurated as chairman,
she needs the board's approval.

68
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,120
I'm sure the board's approval is a given.

69
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,820
It'll be approved
the moment a meeting is convened.

70
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,260
Look at the chaos they're causing already.

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,960
That's why I used my veto power to stop
the board meeting from being held at all.

72
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,260
Veto power? That's what she said?

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
What, did she go
to law school or something?

74
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,200
She acted like she knew her stuff.

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
What's wrong?

76
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,840
Never mind. It's nothing.

77
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,210
Don't worry.
Go ahead and call the board meeting.

78
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,710
Once you've been officially approved
by the board and take the chairman's seat,

79
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,080
then you can move to have her dismissed.

80
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,850
But I told you,
she said she'll veto the meeting.

81
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,350
There's absolutely no way
she can use that veto power.

82
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,920
Just trust me,

83
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,520
and convene the board meeting
as soon as possible.

84
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,600
Honestly,
I never liked her from the start.

85
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,440
Come on. It's not some Cinderella story.
She started as a regular employee,

86
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,310
and then became the chairman's wife?
Does that even make sense?

87
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,710
Tell me about it.

88
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,010
That's more like a rocket ship to the top.

89
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,780
Look at the situation now. My husband,
the chairman's son, is being sidelined.

90
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,350
And yet, that woman is the CEO,
throwing her weight around.

91
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,660
By the way, do you think she's having
an affair with Director Moon Tae Kyung?

92
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,690
Why else would there be pictures?

93
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,930
At a motel in broad daylight, no less.

94
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,670
What's wrong? Are you upset
that I'm dissing your precious stepmother?

95
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,380
You shouldn't be acting like this either,
you know.

96
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,150
I don't care how much
she has you under her spell.

97
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,380
You're supposed to be
on your family's side.

98
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,780
When are you going to stop defending her?

99
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,050
For your information, I'm not
on my stepmother's side this time.

100
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,990
My gosh! What's gotten into you?

101
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,370
Are you going to keep avoiding me?

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,270
Right now, I don't really want to.

103
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,880
So that's why
you weren't answering my calls.

104
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,750
I suppose I haven't been
a very good mother to you.

105
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,050
I never thought you'd jump
to conclusions so easily.

106
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,990
Sweetheart, I was there with Director Moon
for something else.

107
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,520
To save your father.

108
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,330
To save Dad?

109
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,130
(Chairman Min Doo Sik: Lucia, it's me.
I need you to come save me.)

110
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,150
Fancy seeing you here after work.

111
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,180
This is practically my home now, isn't it?

112
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,690
Where's Ms. Kyung Chae?

113
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,590
She'll be right in. She stepped out
into the garden to take a call.

114
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,830
You seem to know a thing or two
about the law, Mother-in-law.

115
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,300
I hear you gave Kyung Chae
a little legal lesson.

116
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,670
What, did you major in law or something?

117
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,170
I used to have a boyfriend
who was studying for the bar exam,

118
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,940
and I just picked up
a few things from him.

119
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,510
I don't know him, but he sounds brilliant.
This boyfriend of yours.

120
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,180
I bet he passed the bar
with flying colors...

121
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,620
and is living a very successful life now,
don't you think?

122
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,120
But it seems you only know half the story.

123
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,890
Didn't your boyfriend teach you that part?

124
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,160
Allow me to teach you instead.

125
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,960
Commercial Act, Article 390, Paragraph 2.

126
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,540
If the convener refuses to call a meeting
of the Board of Directors,

127
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,970
with a majority vote of the directors,

128
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,110
they can convene
a board meeting themselves.

129
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,380
You didn't know that, did you?

130
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,680
Mother!

131
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,950
I can expect
the special son-in-law dinner, right?

132
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,790
I'm looking forward to
your famous home cooking!

133
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,530
She's got some nerve.

134
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,710
I expected the directors to turn on us,
but this is all happening too fast.

135
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,940
How long has Min Kyung Chae
even been the acting chairman?

136
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,540
They're just jumping ship.

137
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,710
If they had any decency, they'd be worried
about the chairman who vanished.

138
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,450
They should be trying to find him.

139
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,250
They're all scrambling
to save their skins.

140
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,220
It's a complete dog-eat-dog world.

141
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,260
It's a feeding frenzy, with everyone
trying to tear each other down.

142
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,960
By the way, did you settle up
with Oh Pan Sool for his earnings?

143
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,870
Yes. He was grinning from ear to ear.

144
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,440
His head is probably about
to explode by now.

145
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,670
The math is simple,
and his greed is endless.

146
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,010
He can't resist
selling his Mingang shares...

147
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,780
to get his hands on a big pile of cash.

148
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,550
Gosh, she has this strange ability
to just mesmerize people.

149
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,320
Her face, her figure, her feminine wiles,

150
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,450
even the way she speaks.

151
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,620
She acts like one of the big shots,
but she's not vulgar in the slightest.

152
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,260
Her investment skills?
Don't get me started.

153
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,630
Ten out of ten. Absolutely perfect.

154
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,800
Should I just trust her and go all in?

155
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,400
What's the use of hoarding money?
You can't take it with you when you go.

156
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,370
The Grim Reaper
will just take it all anyway.

157
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,370
Right. If Mal Sook finds out,
she'll never let up.

158
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,210
So I have to do it on the sly.

159
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,050
What are you in such a hurry to hide?

160
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,550
Hiding what? There's nothing here.

161
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,330
I smell money.

162
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,760
First your eyesight starts to go,
and now your sense of smell is going too?

163
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,630
Gosh, that's just my stinky feet. Here.

164
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,970
No, it's not.

165
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,870
This smells like cash
rolled up in a newspaper.

166
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,310
I can smell the ten-dollar bills.

167
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,410
And that's the 50-dollar bills.

168
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,250
My darling wife, my feet actually smell...

169
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,250
- like money. Here, smell!
- I don't think so.

170
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,390
- Scoot over.
- What for?

171
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,620
No way. I'm not moving. I can't.
I like it right here.

172
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,290
I'm staying right here until bedtime.

173
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,060
Oh Pan Sool, you're acting suspicious.
I said, move aside right now.

174
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,200
Not even if I die.
I'll die right here in this very spot.

175
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,170
You're not messing
with the stock market again, are you?

176
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,070
You'd have to be inhuman to forget that...

177
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,100
you lost our house on Yeonpyeong Island.

178
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,670
- I told you, it's not that.
- Just get up already!

179
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,710
I won't!

180
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,780
Oh my!

181
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,850
What are you doing again?
Are you trying to give Ja Kyung a sibling?

182
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,850
- Fine, let's do it! Let's go for it!
- No, stop!

183

(Mingang Distribution)

184
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,220
Hey, Soo Jung!
I've been doing some thinking.

185
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,330
I don't think Father is just missing.
I have a feeling a crime is involved.

186
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,260
Ji Seop, don't you think
you're going a little overboard?

187
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,170
But still...
Despite his history, this feels different.

188
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,440
So you think someone kidnapped him?
Who in the world would do that?

189
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,370
Obviously, it'd be whoever benefits
the most from Father being gone.

190
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,640
Then it's Kyung Chae.

191
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,110
She's the acting chairman
while Dad's away.

192
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,680
Or it could be Lucia. She has a lover,
so Father is just a thorn in her side.

193
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,890
It's either one of them, or both.

194
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,490
Don't you know those two
hate each other's guts?

195
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,260
If I have to pick one,

196
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,690
- I say Kyung Chae.
- Then I say Lucia.

197
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,460
Seriously?
How can we find him if we can't agree?

198
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,630
We can figure that out later.
Let's just focus on finding Father first.

199
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,470
Once we find Father,
we'll solve it all in one go. Right?

200
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,880
What is it? What's the favor?

201
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,550
You've got a lot of sources, right?

202
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,020
I need to borrow them.

203
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
What for?

204
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,160
I'm going to look for Father.
It's been ages since that old geezer left.

205
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,960
And you think you're going to find him?

206
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,260
That's why I'm asking
to borrow your sources.

207
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,230
We can't just rely on Kyung Chae.

208
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,900
Just let her handle it. Stay out of it.

209
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,270
I'm busy, so don't drag me out here
for this kind of thing again.

210
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,070
Gosh, to hear you talk, anyone would think
you run the company single-handedly.

211
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,540
Because I am doing it all myself.

212
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,670
I have to call an emergency board meeting,
and I have a mountain of work to do.

213
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,580
Hey, Sun Jae!
Come on, hear me out. Just lend me a few.

214
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,150
What are friends for? Please.
Seriously, just hear me out.

215
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,920
- Give it a rest!
- Sun Jae, wait!

216
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,990
What were you and Lawyer Kim
talking about?

217
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,630
Gosh, you're nosy.
I told him I'll find Father. So what?

218
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
And what did he say to that?

219
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,300
He told me not to bother.
Said that Kyung Chae has it under control.

220
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,470
He said he's busy calling a board meeting.
Are we done here? Darn it.

221
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,950
They're calling a board meeting soon.
And at the meeting, Min Kyung Chae...

222
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,650
will be officially appointed as chairman.

223
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,820
Once the board of directors convenes,
it's just a formality.

224
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,690
I didn't realize my veto power
could be rendered this useless.

225
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,590
The law is the law.

226
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,330
Then, before the board of directors
is convened,

227
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,700
we have to find Chairman Min Doo Sik,
no matter what it takes.

228
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,700
Who's looking for Father?

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,570
It's just Ji Seop. You know how he is.

230
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,040
He's an expert at spinning his wheels.

231
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,940
You mentioned moving Father last time.
What's the status on that?

232
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,080
We can't risk Ji Seop snooping around
and accidentally finding Father.

233
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,650
We're already planning to move him
to the outskirts of Gyeonggi Province.

234
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,580
Shinyul Hospital...

235
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,120
has a busy intersection out front.

236
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,050
It's too easy for someone
to spot him there.

237
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,960
Besides, who would know about
the side road...

238
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,560
from the intersection to the highway?

239
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,530
Anyway, Lawyer Kim, you take care of it.

240
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,330
The vice director said
he'd find Chairman Min,

241
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,700
and he was told not to.

242
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,100
Is he worried the vice director
might actually find the chairman?

243
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,270
Those two want to make sure no one
can find Chairman Min.

244
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,480
Since he escaped once before,
they must be looking for a new place.

245
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,110
And since the vice director said
he's taking action now, they'll hurry.

246
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,920
I think they'll move him
in the next day or so.

247
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,220
Then they'll definitely talk about it
in the chairman's office.

248
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,320
The chairman's office is the perfect place
for those two to plot.

249
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,890
Perfect.

250
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,330
If we check the bug in the vase,
we'll know for sure.

251
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,130
Let's go check now.

252
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,930
Then call for a board meeting tomorrow,

253
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,500
and move Father.

254
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,670
Will do.

255
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,810
Lawyer Kim, just make sure
there are no complications.

256
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,510
What kind of complications?

257
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,280
Unless the chairman himself shows up
and crashes the board meeting.

258
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,250
- Is that even possible?
- Exactly my point.

259
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,050
The chairmanship is a sure thing now,

260
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,480
so don't worry.

261
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,330
What is it? Ever hear of knocking?

262
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,400
It's nothing.

263
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,030
Let's go.

264
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,370
What was that about?

265
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,040
Thank goodness. The vase was still there.

266
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,740
Let's come in early tomorrow morning...

267
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,450
and retrieve the bug.

268
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,620
What? What's this?

269
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,050
Ta-da!

270
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,060
Oh, my, what is all this?

271
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,960
I felt bad for being mean the other day,
so I ordered this with my allowance.

272
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,530
Go on, try some. Hurry.

273
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,130
Should I?

274
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,370
This looks so good.

275
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,180
- You have some too, Se Ri.
- Okay.

276
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,360
It's good, right?

277
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,030
This is all the rage with kids these days.

278
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,340
It's sweet and a little spicy.

279
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,540
It's so good.

280
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,010
You're right.
It's got this addictive spicy kick,

281
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,280
so all my stress just melted away.

282
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,650
Right?
I told you, you can't stop eating it.

283
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,950
But...

284
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,620
I thought you didn't believe me.

285
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,860
That you didn't want to understand?

286
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,660
Honestly, I was disappointed
when I first saw the picture,

287
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,300
but I know you.
You'd never do something like that.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,540
I don't know who sent it, but that person
is the one who's in the wrong.

289
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,810
Thank you, sweetheart.
For believing in me.

290
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,050
Eat up! This is delicious.

291
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,020
Look at you two enjoying your chicken.

292
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,960
You seem to be in a good mood,
given the situation.

293
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,700
Is there any reason not to be?
I'm having a cozy snack with my daughter.

294
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,700
Eat up. Don't mind her.

295
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Okay.

296
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
Fine.

297
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,510
Enjoy it while you still can.

298
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,790
Go ahead, enjoy it all you want.

299
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,460
Once the board approves
my chairmanship tomorrow,

300
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,990
you'll be the first one I get rid of.

301
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,970
What?

302
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,440

304
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,510
If they had gotten rid of the vase,
it would be here.

305
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,870
Where in the world did it go?

306
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,790
Are you looking for something?

307
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,790
Excuse me, did you happen to clean
the chairman's office?

308
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,260
- I did.
- Did you see the vase on the desk?

309
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,440
- Here it is.
- Oh, gosh.

310
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,940
The chairman told me to throw it out,
so I took it.

311
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,880
It was so pretty,
so I wanted to take it home.

312
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,340
Did I do something wrong?

313
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,580
No, you did the right thing.

314
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,780
Thank you. Thank you so much.

315
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,120
- Did you find it?
- Right here.

(Mingang Distribution)

317
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,110
Anything about Chairman Min?

318
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
Not yet.

319
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,980
They must have.

320
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,510
Let's listen a little longer.

321
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,750
There we go.
They're talking about Chairman Min.

322
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,860
We're already planning to move him
to the outskirts of Gyeonggi Province.

from the intersection to the highway?

326
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,200
Anyway, Lawyer Kim, you take care of it.

327
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,840
I've got it. I know where Chairman Min is.

328
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,440
Really? That's great.

329
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,210
We have to move fast.

330
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,820
If we're too slow,
they'll move him before we get there.

331
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,530
What's going on?
Why are they in such a rush?

332
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,900
I know, right? They're not headed to
a motel again, are they?

333
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
What?

334
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Yes, Director Oh.

335
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,640
An emergency board meeting?

336
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,780
I wasn't notified.

337
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,480
According to the other directors,

338
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,820
it's to approve Acting Chairman
Min Kyung Chae's promotion to Chairman.

339
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,190
I'll call you back.

340
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,360
An emergency board meeting?
What's that all about?

341
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,190
So she's really taking advantage of Dad
being gone to make her move.

342
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,430
Once the board of directors meets
this afternoon,

343
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,940
you'll become the second chairman
of Mingang Distribution.

344
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,740
How do you feel?

345
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,940
What's there to say?

346
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,040
It feels like I took the long road back
to where I belong.

347
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,710
I guess we can start planning
our wedding now.

348
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,680
That's after I'm officially the chairman,

349
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,150
and after I've cleaned house
at the company.

350
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,550
But surely,

351
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,090
you're not going to
back out on me now, are you?

352
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,690
- You really don't trust me, do you?
- I was just afraid you might forget.

353
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,200
Let's not forget who handled the chairman
and called for an emergency board meeting,

354
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,070
who ensured you were officially appointed
chairman without a single hitch,

355
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,670
who volunteered to be the bad guy
and spearheaded this whole operation.

356
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,770
Just don't forget it.

357
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,240
Don't worry.

358
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,940
I haven't forgotten.

359
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,050
I think this is the place.

360
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,920
Let's go in.

361
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,990
The emergency meeting is this afternoon.
We must find Chairman Min before then...

362
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,400
and stop the board from approving her.

363
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,830
Wait a minute.

364
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,300
This looks like a regular hospital.

365
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,340
Something feels off.

366
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,970
You're right.
It does feel different, doesn't it?

367
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,780
But I'm sure the chairman
is in here somewhere.

368
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,750
Lucia wouldn't do that to me.

369
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,620
But what if I'm wrong?

370
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,290
What if they're having an affair
behind my back?

371
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,830
I thought she would come if I waited.
Was that just wishful thinking?

372
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,500
I thought Lucia would come find me.

373
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,310
Anyone but Lucia...

374
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,540
There are so many rooms.
It's going to take a while to check them.

375
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,380
I wish the chairman would spot us first.

376
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Lucia?

377
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,350
In here!

378
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,160
Someone is in here!

379
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,490
Lucia!

380
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,260
Lucia, I'm in here!

381
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,600
- Chairman.
- Lucia? Is that really you?

382
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,030
- Is it really you standing before me?
- Yes, it's me.

383
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,670
I had no idea you were in here.

384
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,310
Just a moment. I'll get this door open.

385
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,050
Chairman, are you all right?

386
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,790
Lucia, is it really you?

387
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
It's really you?

388
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,430
I'm here to save you, Chairman.

389
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,360
I knew it. I knew you'd come for me.

390
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,330
I'm so glad you're safe, Chairman.

391
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,070
Director Moon Tae Kyung
helped me find you.

392
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,040
Your eldest daughter made it
hard to find you,

393
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,570
so the family couldn't step in.

394
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,440
When I had no one else to turn to,

395
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,940
Director Moon Tae Kyung
stepped in to help.

396
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,440
He said we had to find you
before it was too late.

397
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,420
That punk, Lawyer Kim,
is the one who brought those.

398
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,260
I didn't believe it.
I knew it couldn't be true.

399
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,030
You two are the only people
in this world I trust.

400
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,000
We need to get out of here now.
They'll be here any minute.

401
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,230
Your daughter called
an emergency board meeting...

402
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,870
to appoint herself
as the official chairman.

403
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,140
It's about to start.

404
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,740
What? How can she,
when I'm still alive and well?

405
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,910
She's making herself chairman?

406
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,740
Not on my watch.

407
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,340
We have to stop her.

408
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,620
- Be careful.
- Let's go.

409
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,600
I don't know how you got in here,

410
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,330
but you're not getting out so easily.

411
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
Get them.

412
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
What should I do?

413
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,220
The board meeting is about to start.

414
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,930
Director Min?

415
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Vote for her.

416
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,870
Are you sure that's a good idea?

417
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,900
If Acting Chairman Min Kyung Chae
officially becomes chairman,

418
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,170
what happens to you
and your people, like me?

419
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,810
We're not...

420
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,010
going to get fired, are we?

421
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,610
Don't worry.

422
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,080
I have another card
I can play against her.

423
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,820
Another card?

424
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,690
Se Ri.

425
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,690
If my hunch is right...

426
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,530
Wait, Se Ri?
What does she have to do with this?

427
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
You'll see.

428
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,040
We are here to appoint
our acting chairman, Min Kyung Chae,

429
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,700
as the new official chairman.

430
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,540
I would now like to ask the directors...

431
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,940
to please state your opinions
on the matter.

432
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Why drag this out? The outcome is obvious.

433
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,080
I couldn't agree more.

434
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,250
The directors have all been
on the same page for a while now.

435
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,890
Let's just skip to the vote.

436
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,360
That's the clearest way to show
where we stand.

437
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,060
If that's what the board members want,

438
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,490
we will proceed immediately.

439
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,900
(Mingang Distribution)

440
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,700
It's finally over.

441
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,130
Once I'm chairman,
no one will be able to take Mingang,

442
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,540
or my Se Ri, away from me.

443
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,340
Just you watch, Father.

444
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,610
Once I take control of Mingang,

445
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,080
I'll make you
pay for all the humiliation...

446
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,940
you've put me through.

447
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,110
(Mingang Distribution)

448
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,550
Then let's proceed with the vote.

449
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,520
All in favor of
Acting Chairman Min Kyung Chae...

450
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,790
as the next chairman,

451
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,490
please raise your hands.

452
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,450
It's unanimous.

453
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,950
Very well. By unanimous decision,

454
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,650
Acting Chairman Min Kyung Chae...

455
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,590
is hereby appointed as the next chairman.

456
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,900
Not so fast!

457
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,070
Who says she's chairman?

458
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,910
Father, how did you get here?

459
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,720
(Mingang Distribution)

460
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,860
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

461
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,510
You were the child I trusted the most.
Get out! Right now.

462
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,680
Get out of my company and out of my house.
I never want to see your face again!

463
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,120
- She got a concussion from the fall.
- So what?

464
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,180
Does she need brain surgery?

465
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,990
It's dissociative amnesia from the shock.

466
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,220
Amnesia?

467
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,660
Do I know you?
I don't think we've ever met.

468
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,500
