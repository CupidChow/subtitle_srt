1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,710
Stop right where you are.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,750
My Madam Baek told me to fight injustice.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,950
"Madam Baek?"

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,890
Who's that?

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,320
It's the person I like and respect
the most in the whole world.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,960
My mom told me
not to put up with people like you!

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,140
Darn you.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,870
Don't fight.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,780
Stop it. What the heck are you doing?

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,380
What are you doing in my store?

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,480
Get out this instant.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,150
Get out right now.

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,390
What happened? Are you two okay?

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,590
She's a psycho.

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,530
Sir. Let's sue her.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,330
For disrupting your business and assault.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,100
Mi So. You really are my best friend.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,840
What would I have done without you?

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,610
That was nothing.

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,010
It wasn't nothing.
It was a great show of friendship.

21
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,280
I was so touched.

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,390
What if she comes back
and causes more trouble?

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,750
She looks like the type to hold a grudge.

24
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,690
She has a nasty temper.

25
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,090
Security cameras aren't for show.
They caught everything.

26
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,400
If she comes back,
we'll take the footage to report her.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,470
You're drenched.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,540
Darn it. Wait and see.

29
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,410
I won't let you get away with this.

30
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,590
- Come on. Let's hurry.
- You're addicted.

31
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,020
- See you.
- Bye.

32
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,620
Take care.

33
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,270
I had a horrible dream last night.

34
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,440
The psycho showed up...

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,570
and harassed you to get revenge.

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,110
I slept so well.

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,040
You're pretty gutsy.

38
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,340
It's courage, not guts.

39
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,810
Why should I cower
when I did nothing wrong?

40
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,480
You have a point.

41
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,550
- Let's go.
- Okay.

42
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,460
- No way.
- That's it.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,890
Is this your mom's birthday present?

44
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes. Tomorrow is her birthday.

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,830
- She'll look nice in that.
- Won't she?

46
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,030
My Madam Baek never dresses up,

47
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,500
but she looks incredible when she does.

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,010
Where do you think I got my looks from?

49
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,910
Yes, of course you got it from her.

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,780
She must be happy
to have a daughter like you.

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,020
But I'm happy too,

52
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,190
to have a friend like you.

53
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,590
What? That's so touching.

54
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,830
- Isn't it lovely?
- Yes. It's beautiful.

55
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,460
Get Se Ri a plane ticket
and send her back.

56
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,200
Sending her back won't solve it.

57
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,200
If she were to give up on life
and get into drugs...

58
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,140
There would be no helping her then.

59
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,440
Should we let her be, then?

60
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,910
What if we leave her at the hotel
and the chairman finds out?

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,810
The chairman will never find out.

62
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,850
We just have to keep her from your sister.

63
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,750
From France to Australia.

64
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,250
Then Canada and the US.
Every school expelled her.

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,920
Where should we send her now?

66
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,420
Where can she go to settle down?

67
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,760
I searched the world
for the best schools...

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,760
and hired a counselor, tutor,
and even a psychiatrist for her.

69
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,400
Who must I hire next
to get some sense into her?

70
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,500
Who could calm her crazy mind?

71
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,300
Don't worry.

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,140
Ms. Se Ri...

73
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,050
Can you approve my proposal?

74
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,770
What's going on?

75
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,040
Did you find Moon Tae Kyung already?

76
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,010
Is that why you're keeping quiet?

77
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,510
No. If you'd found him,
you'd have told the chairman.

78
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,420
It's not about that.

79
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,550
What is it about, then?

80
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,020
My sister makes that serious face
about just two issues.

81
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,530
When her business takes a hit...

82
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,960
and when Se Ri is in trouble.

83
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,100
She's not doing anything
that would affect her business.

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,430
Is it Se Ri?

85
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,400
Just so you know,

86
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,070
I won't be a double agent.

87
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,640
If you won't be a double agent,
work for me instead.

88
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,810
Team up with me.

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,050
We'll make an amazing duo.

90
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,150
No, thanks.

91
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,380
Why? Why will you
work with Kyung Chae but not me?

92
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,520
Why did you tell me...

93
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,090
when to be at the airport?

94
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,930
Was it because my threat worked?

95
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,560
Is that what you're like?

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I suddenly wondered if I was...

97
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,230
really in the grey area.

98
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,330
But...

99
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,670
thanks to you, I realized I'm not.

100
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,380
(Dabitnuri Hospital)

101
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,520
Hello, Detective.

102
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,390
What? Is that true?

103
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,030
Yes. If you get me that info,
I'll take it from there.

104
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,170
Find Jo Pil Doo for me
and I'll owe you forever.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,840
Okay, thanks. Bye.

106
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,510
Hello.

107
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,680
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

108
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,380
What are you doing with your top off?

109
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,450
Don't turn around just yet.
Stay as you are.

110
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,690
- Goodness.
- Hang on.

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,860
I'm getting discharged.

112
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,930
Just like that?

113
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,930
Your fracture won't have healed yet.

114
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,230
It will heal in time.

115
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,000
It doesn't show and I feel fine.

116
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,930
Did you get some good news?

117
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,200
Your face is much brighter.

118
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,410
Did you get a call...

119
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,910
about the person you were looking for?

120
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,310
Well...

121
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,380
Not yet.

122
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
But I think I can find him.

123
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,520
That's great news. I'm happy for you.

124
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,990
Why are you so rushed
when you haven't found him yet?

125
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,960
You're more impatient than you look.

126
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,390
Drink this up.

127
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,200
Beef bone soup? Wait.

128
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,070
I rested way longer than I needed to.

129
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,600
So what?

130
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,070
You haven't found the guy yet.

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,910
I get that you're impatient,

132
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,380
but what difference does a day make
when you've waited for 25 years?

133
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,180
Stay here, then leave
when you have his whereabouts.

134
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,220
I need to see you get
a clean bill of health, whatever happens.

135
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,490
Then I can concentrate on my job.

136
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,320
My gosh.

137
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,630
You're so stubborn.

138
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,430
It's a philosophy, not stubbornness.

139
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,100
I always finish what I start.

140
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,800
I brought you here against your will,
so I'll get you...

141
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
discharged myself.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,470
Okay. I'll respect your philosophy.

143
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,150
So...

144
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,080
What's your name?

145
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,290
Since we crossed paths like this,

146
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,890
can't we ask each other's names?

147
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,160
I'm Mi So's mom.

148
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,990
Okay. Mi So's mom.

149
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
What's your name?

150
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,870
That's my name. I'm Mi So's mom.

151
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,370
Goodness.

152
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,610
I like that title more than anything.

153
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,150
Why do people call you "Gi Cheol's mom"
instead of your real name?

154
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,350
Because "Gi Cheol's mom"
is the best name in the world.

155
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,890
My mom said the same.

156
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,690
She preferred...

157
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,200
being called my mom to her own name.

158
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,240
Moms are like that.

159
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,470
Their kid's name is their name,

160
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,370
and their kid's life is their life.

161
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,510
I cooked this with sweat, care,
and effort, and it's nice and rich.

162
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,950
Drink it up, get stronger,
and find the guy you're after.

163
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,950
Okay? I wish you good luck.

164
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,490
Thanks.

165
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,960
- Enjoy the food.
- Thanks.

166
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,060
Eat lots.

167
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,630
Hey, Hee Soo.
I haven't seen you in a while.

168
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,830
How are you?

169
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,940
She has been waiting for ages...

170
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,570
and she has been sighing all along.

171
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,910
Why? What's wrong?

172
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,010
You know I have a YouTube channel, right?

173
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,280
I do.

174
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,610
I'm a subscriber
and I click like all the time.

175
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,480
My mom won't let me post
and she took my laptop.

176
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,550
That's because it takes time
to edit a video...

177
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,050
and put it up.

178
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,120
She's worried
it's disrupting your studies.

179
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,260
Keeping a channel going
takes up a lot of time.

180
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,330
Doesn't it?

181
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,400
Why don't we eat something first?

182
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,930
You feel less grumpy on a full stomach.

183
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,370
Yeon Ah. Bring us some fried stuff,
fishcakes, and tteokbokki too.

184
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,240
- Okay.
- I don't have any money.

185
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,180
Forget it. I don't need your money.

186
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,810
Eat and cheer up.

187
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,510
The world still turns.

188
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,520
You can talk it out with your mom.

189
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,820
There's no talking to my mom.

190
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,850
You can't say things like that.

191
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,490
Your mom scolds and nags...

192
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,360
so you'll do better.

193
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,830
She's worried about you.

194
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,260
My mom's not worried about me.

195
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,130
Why would you say that?

196
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,600
To a mom,
a child means more than her life.

197
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,840
Whether it's for a minute or a second,
we never stop worrying.

198
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,380
- Hurry up.
- Okay, it's all here.

199
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,610
- Enjoy.
- Let's eat.

200
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,550
Come on. Eat up.

201
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,980
- Have some tteokbokki.
- Thanks.

202
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,450
Shall we toast our tteokbokki?

203
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,990
(Mingang Distribution)

204
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,690
Are you that worried?

205
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,460
I can't find a solution.

206
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,030
If I can't find the best solution,
I wish there were a second best.

207
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,870
I can't find anything.

208
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,640
What on earth...

209
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,970
is Ms. Se Ri to you?

210
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,040
What does that mean?

211
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,480
You were always direct and level-headed.

212
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,180
Enough to know the answer
before you ask the question.

213
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
But...

214
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,480
you're not like that
when it comes to Ms. Se Ri.

215
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,090
What's your point?

216
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,890
Stop beating around the bush
and ask what you want to know.

217
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,590
I'll ask just one thing, then.

218
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,430
Both your younger sisters.

219
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,160
Aren't they the same to the chairman?

220
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,230
They're both illegitimate,
yet you treat them differently.

221
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,700
I don't know how to understand that.

222
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,910
Soo Jung may cause trouble,
but she doesn't get herself hurt.

223
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,380
She hurts others.

224
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,310
But Se Ri causes trouble
not knowing she's hurting herself.

225
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,610
That's how foolish she is.

226
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,780
She doesn't calculate the risks.

227
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,550
She's impulsive and emotional.

228
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,660
I'd rather she be sly and conniving.

229
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,890
Since she's no threat to you,

230
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,360
you'd rather be her guardian?

231
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,230
Is that it?

232
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,370
It's something like that.

233
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,140
Is that the only reason?

234
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,000
Should there be another reason?

235
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,180
My mom told me
not to put up with people like you!

236
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,070
You do anything for money, right?

237
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,640
- Hello.
- Hi.

238
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,570
Did you sell a few today?

239
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,740
- Not really.
- No?

240
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,410
- I wish things would get better.
- Yes.

241
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,010
How are your kids doing?

242
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,210
They go to university now.

243
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,220
- Do they? Already?
- Yes.

244
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,820
- I can't believe...
- You ate enough.

245
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,890
Is that tasty?

246
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,950
- It is.
- It doesn't look tasty.

247
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,690
- It is tasty.
- I don't think so, Son-in-law.

248
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,360
Why are you here, Father?

249
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,340
Those bananas...

250
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,110
You must pay first.

251
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,980
My Ja Kyung ages because of you.

252
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,810
She was a shiny pearl,

253
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,980
but now she's a shriveled orange.

254
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,050
Why can't you fend for yourself?

255
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,850
What are you doing here
when there's a fancy head office?

256
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,820
I'm sorry, Father.

257
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,890
Stop apologizing all the time...

258
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,430
and do something
you won't feel sorry about.

259
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,460
I'm in no position to do that, Father.

260
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,700
I know the many projects...

261
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,570
your father gave you flopped.

262
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,640
That's why I don't have
the justification to ask for help.

263
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,040
Put that justification aside...

264
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,270
or leave it with me for a while
for safekeeping.

265
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,470
Do you have to take that so seriously?

266
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,840
He'll give me a position
in the head office in due time.

267
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,220
That sounds less probable
than an octopus getting its legs tangled.

268
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,880
Don't you know what your father is like?

269
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,920
Parents feed a crying child.

270
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,060
If you keep your mouth shut
and don't say a thing,

271
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,590
you'll end up saying goodbye forever.
Sayonara. Zaijian.

272
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,860
Goodbye, take care

273
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,100
He wouldn't do that.

274
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm his son.

275
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,930
Don't worry too much.

276
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
And...

277
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,270
pay for this first.

278
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,980
If that fool were my son...

279
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,980
(The Bank of Korea, 10 Dollars)

280
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,120
Cash, money...

281
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,990
Did you talk to Ji Seop?

282
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,490
It was like talking to a wall.

283
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,520
Why? He wouldn't listen?

284
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,160
I don't know if he was born a loser...

285
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
or if he's intimidated by his sisters.

286
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,130
Shall we hire a shaman?

287
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,970
If we hold a crazy rite for him,
it might knock sense into him.

288
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,940
I heard there's something
that changes a man completely.

289
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,410
- What? There is?
- Yes.

290
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,540
But you were baptized.

291
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,210
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.

292
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,220
No. The more deities
we call on, the better.

293
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,750
Let's ask a shaman.

294
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,590
You were a great worker.

295
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,560
I paid you a little extra.

296
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,760
Thank you.

297
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,590
I should thank you for working hard.

298
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,400
It's not bye forever, is it?

299
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,000
Of course not.

300
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,370
I'll be back as a customer,
and you must hire me if you need help.

301
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,340
Let's do that.

302
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,940
I'll spend this well.

303
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,810
- Promise to visit often.
- I will.

304
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,240
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

305
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,940
Hey, there.

306
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,510
Who? Me?

307
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,650
Yes, you.

308
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,450
What do you want?

309
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,990
Who are you?

310
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,320
- What are you doing?
- Keep walking.

311
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,690
- What's this about?
- Shut up.

312
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,460
Let me go. Let go of me!

313
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,060
- Be quiet.
- Let go!

314
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,260
Shut your mouth!

315
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,410
You're the girl...

316
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,180
Yes, it's me.

317
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,420
Aren't you pleased to see me?

318
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,020
I'm pleased to see you.

319
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,060
(Diner)

320
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,530
- Did you get him to...
- Yes.

321
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,160
I hired him.

322
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,230
Why?

323
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,770
I paid him.
Do you have a problem with that?

324
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,300
I have nothing to say to you.

325
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,640
You're not going anywhere.

326
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,680
I have something to say,
so you're staying here.

327
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,780
You were in the wrong that day.

328
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,820
You poured water on my innocent friend...

329
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,850
- and caused a fuss in...
- That day...

330
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,850
It was a rotten day for me.

331
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,060
I needed to relieve some stress.

332
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,160
I needed to beat someone up
to feel better,

333
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,130
and your friend
was the first person I noticed.

334
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,960
She became a target.

335
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,470
It was just her luck.

336
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,870
What?

337
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,640
How can you say that?

338
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,600
Wouldn't your mother be ashamed?

339
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,710
Does she know what you're up to?

340
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,940
You went right for my trigger word.

341
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,590
You can't escape this place.

342
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,660
I was going to let you go
if you begged on your knees,

343
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,930
but I changed my mind.

344
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,560
Hey.

345
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,830
"Mom" is the one word
I hate the most in the world.

346
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,770
People always talk about their moms.

347
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
What a joke.

348
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,810
Is your mom that special?

349
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,280
Why is she so special?

350
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,050
If she's that great, ask her to save you.

351
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,050
Darn you.

352
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,360
Hey.

353
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,540
You can't leave this place.

354
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,710
If you run, you'll get brought back.

355
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,880
If you run again,
you'll get brought back again.

356
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,920
Why are you back?
I was about to join you at the bar.

357
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,430
I had something to take care of.

358
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,530
Is Mi So not back yet?

359
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,260
What are you hiding behind you?

360
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,530
It's nothing.

361
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,940
- It's something. Let's see.
- It's nothing.

362
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,170
- Give me that.
- Oh, shoot.

363
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,170
What's all this?

364
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,380
It's for your birthday feast.

365
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,350
I told you not to bother.
Why would you plan a feast?

366
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,780
I did what your daughter asked.

367
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,020
All I did was buy the stuff on her list.

368
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,220
Mi So said she'd cook you breakfast.

369
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,420
She can't cook anything.

370
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,460
She'll just burn the rice cooker.

371
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,360
Don't you appreciate the sentiment?

372
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,960
You're a blessed mom.

373
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,200
Girls like Mi So are rare.

374
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm so blessed I might explode.

375
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,680
(Diner)

376
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,050
No.

377
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,020
Goodness.

378
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,950
What's this weird dress?

379
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
"Happy birthday, my dear Madam Baek."

380
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,970
"Madam Baek?"

381
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,400
My Madam Baek told me to fight injustice.

382
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,570
It's the person I like and respect
the most in the whole world.

383
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,440
My mom told me
not to put up with people like you!

384
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
I get it.

385
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,780
This is your awesome mom's
birthday present?

386
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,560
No!

387
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
Darn it.

388
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,560
Let go of me!

389
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,230
Hey, you!

390
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,500
Why act out...

391
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,700
and make things worse for yourself?

392
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,070
You don't even know who I am.

393
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,710
Let me go!

394
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,080
Goodness.

395
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,320
Oh, dear.

396
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,390
Someone is missing again today.

397
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,360
Ms. Kyung Chae is meeting someone.

398
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,400
She'll be back after dinner.

399
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,060
Who is she meeting?

400
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,530
Is it for work?

401
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,730
You know...

402
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,500
she never tells me anything.

403
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,470
Kyung Chae wouldn't tell me
even if a war broke out.

404
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,340
I don't care what you're like at work,
but don't be like this at home too.

405
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,180
You're each other's only sister.

406
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,180
You might be rivals at work,

407
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,080
but must you fight at home too?

408
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,150
Father.

409
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,320
They aren't the only sisters.
There's Se Ri too.

410
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,690
Whatever.

411
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,160
I have three kids
and none of them are to my liking.

412
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,430
Father. You have four kids, not three.

413
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,930
There's Se Ri too.

414
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,070
Yes. There's Se Ri too.

415
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,240
Fine, four.

416
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,040
She has been quiet for a while.

417
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,740
Have you heard from the US?

418
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,850
I don't appreciate all the trouble,

419
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,410
but I'd like to know
if she's dead or alive.

420
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,280
Don't worry about Se Ri.

421
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,220
Kyung Chae cares so much about her.

422
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,150
You'd think she's her mom.

423
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,990
Why the heck would you say...
That could start a rumor.

424
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,560
She's not even married yet.

425
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,330
She's talking about
how much Kyung Chae cares for Se Ri.

426
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,200
Trust me.

427
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,130
From now on, as the eldest,
I'll watch over my sisters,

428
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,830
and that includes Se Ri too.

429
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,440
I'd rather you take care of your own self.

430
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,300
Do you think Kyung Chae is seeing someone?

431
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,010
She eats dinner at home most of the time.

432
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,780
If she were to meet someone in secret,
wouldn't it be a lover?

433
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,950
Kyung Chae?

434
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,350
She doesn't care for men.
They freak her out.

435
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,920
Has she never dated in her life?

436
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,590
As far as I know,
she never had a serious boyfriend.

437
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,430
She's more of a workaholic than Father.

438
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:45,930
Darling.

439
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,070
There's something I wondered about
ever since I moved in here.

440
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,040
Who is Se Ri's birth mom?

441
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,240
Se Ri's mom? I wouldn't know.

442
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,640
Who would know if you don't?
No one knows the answer.

443
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,280
Even Manager Gong...

444
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,550
who knows all about the family
won't say a thing.

445
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,780
Father must know.

446
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,580
He must know who he made a child with.

447
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,590
Don't try to find out.
That's a banned topic around here.

448
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,860
If you let your curiosity take over...

449
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,560
This will happen.

450
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,530
Where were you at?

451
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,110
I went out for some air.

452
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,980
Come and sit down.

453
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,490
I wish you'd do
just half of what Soo Jung does.

454
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,130
Protect what's yours...

455
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,230
and take just a little from others.

456
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,070
I don't want to live like that.

457
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,300
I'll live in luxury like I do now.

458
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,570
How exactly?

459
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,270
You'll keep causing trouble?

460
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,380
Don't you irritate me too.

461
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,280
I'm still jet-lagged
and I'm in a bad mood.

462
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,990
I'm sick of cleaning up your mess
behind Father's back.

463
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,220
How much longer must I clean up your dirt?

464
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,060
Shouldn't you be potty-trained by now?

465
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,230
You're old enough.

466
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,700
Father took me to meet other entrepreneurs
when I was your age.

467
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,730
Do you think I don't know
how great you are?

468
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,370
You're perfect from head to toe.

469
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,770
Your life is flawless.

470
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,040
How would you understand
someone as flawed as me?

471
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,450
I actually prefer Soo Jung.

472
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,950
- What?
- She doesn't look down on me.

473
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,690
- She uses you.
- Whatever!

474
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,920
You look down on me!

475
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,520
You think I'm pathetic!

476
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,890
I wouldn't if you did better.

477
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,360
If you did what you should
and didn't cause trouble.

478
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,100
As soon as I turn 20
and can do what I want with my shares,

479
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
I'll give everything to Soo Jung.

480
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,800
Don't you have someone better
to side with?

481
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,770
Soo Jung and I are in the same boat!

482
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,200
We're both illegitimate kids.

483
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,240
We're not like you or Ji Seop.

484
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,040
I'd prefer it if Soo Jung
were to succeed Dad.

485
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,510
I want her to take over the company.

486
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,750
My life would be much better then.

487
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,920
She doesn't tell me what to do!

488
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,990
There are things you should never say.

489
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,330
How dare you say
you'll side with her in my presence?

490
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,960
How dare you say you'll walk over me?

491
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,530
After all I did to keep things going.

492
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,470
After all I did to get here!

493
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,300
You...

494
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,400
You crossed the line.

495
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,540
What you did in the US isn't the issue.

496
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,170
Your presence itself is the problem.

497
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,580
Fine. Do whatever you want.

498
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
I won't interfere or care anymore.

499
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,580
Live in hotels until the day you die,

500
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,490
get caught and beaten up by our father,

501
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,050
or return to the US!

502
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,320
No. Even if you go into outer space,
I won't care from now on.

503
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,430
Kyung Chae.

504
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,830
Don't call me that.

505
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,800
You're no longer my sister.

506
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,580
- Sul Hee.
- Yes?

507
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,150
Shouldn't Mi So be back by now?

508
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,520
You're right.

509
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,230
The person you called is unavailable.

510
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,230
She won't pick up?

511
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,730
- No.
- Connecting to voicemail.

512
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,580
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

513
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,060
To be honest, isn't a troublemaker
like Se Ri a burden to you too?

514
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,570
I warned you not to mind Se Ri.

515
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,730
Keep him under control.

516
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,870
If something goes wrong,
you're out too, CEO Min.

517
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,540
Wake up, Mi So!

518
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,170
Mi So!

519
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,010
Walk out as if nothing happened...

520
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,940
with a smile on your face.

521
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,650
Is that true? You really have his address?

522
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,980
Where on earth is Moon Tae Kyung?

523
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,650
Can we have a short chat?

524
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,580
The accident that happened
at Mucheon Roundabout.

525
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,820
I'm the son of the deceased couple.
