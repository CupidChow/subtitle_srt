1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,880
Why are you doing this to me?

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,580
What did I do to deserve this?

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,520
You're wrong for lying to your kids.
Why am I the one being punished?

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,290
Let go! Get off me!

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,920
Take a good look at yourself.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,390
Before you blame your children,
you need to take a good look at yourself.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,530
I will never let that woman
take the CEO position.

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,730
Over my dead body!

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,170
Let go!

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,940
I said, let go! Get off me!

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,710
Let go!

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,310
I said, let go!

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,350
Let me go. I said, let go, you jerks!

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,550
Let go!

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,350
- Let go of me!
- Get your hands off her this instant.

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,170
Ma'am.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,570
You can all go now.

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,880
Please, calm down. Let's not do this here.
Everyone is watching.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,720
Hey, Soo Jung!

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,460
You will not believe what I just saw.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,020
What? What did you see?

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,930
Kyung Chae was dragged from her office.
It was a complete madhouse.

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,860
Who had her dragged out?

24
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,700
Who do you think?
I knew this would happen from the notice.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Dad?

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,340
Did he really have to go that far?

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
I guess it just shows
how determined he is.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,310
I'm sure
the directors on her side protested,

29
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,450
but he's bulldozing it through anyway.

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,220
So he's really going
to make Lucia the new CEO?

31
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,190
That's what Dad wants. What can we do?

32
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,860
Be patient.

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,070
You have to be patient for now.
Fighting back now will only backfire.

34
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,540
So you're telling me I should just work
as a regular employee?

35
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,640
The Chairman posted an official notice.
Doesn't that show he won't back down?

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,880
Aside from the Chairman testing you
by faking his illness,

37
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,650
the fact is, he has something on us.

38
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,620
Think about it.

39
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,220
If he'd have you dragged from your office,
there's nothing we can do about it now.

40
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,360
But the board is against it.

41
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,860
Sure, the board might help.
But they can't call a meeting right away.

42
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,030
- Then what am I supposed to do?
- Now is the time to lie low.

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,800
I promise I'll do whatever it takes
to get you your CEO position back,

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,470
so for now, you just have to bear with it.

45
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,850
Do you think Kyung Chae will be fired
and that woman will take her place?

46
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,390
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,190
Come on. Yesterday, Kyung Chae
got wasted and yelled at her father.

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,490
She asked if he was happy giving it all
to "that woman."

49
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,700
She's going to hear you
if you keep calling her "that woman."

50
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,900
So what? She's not even here.

51
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,170
Come on, people badmouth anyone
when they're not around.

52
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,700
Anyway...

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,910
The way things are going,
it's like this is her kingdom.

54
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,940
At this rate,

55
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,950
I wouldn't be surprised
if he gives her the Chairman's seat too.

56
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,210
He wouldn't.

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,820
Kyung Chae won't be forced out as CEO,
so don't you worry.

58
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,560
As if anyone could change his mind.

59
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,160
I never thought I'd see the day.

60
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,030
I should've been there to see Kyung Chae
get dragged out with my own two eyes.

61
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,970
What a satisfying sight that must've been.

62
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,070
It still needs the board's approval.
It won't happen overnight.

63
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,810
That's just a formality.
What can they do if he forces it?

64
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,380
It's not like
Lucia isn't qualified, either.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,050
Once Chairman Min's shares
are officially transferred to me,

66
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,150
then it'll be a different story.
For now, I'm just going to wait and see.

67
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,760
If I make a move now,

68
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,230
it will only make the directors
on CEO Min's side bolder.

69
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,590
Good thinking.

70
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,230
But how much of his shares do you think
Min Doo Sik will give you?

71
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,940
The size of the stake you're getting
is going to change things for us.

72
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,370
I'm not sure.

73
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,440
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

74
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,380
To put her in the CEO's chair,
I have to give her enough to justify it.

75
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,150
But if I give her everything,

76
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,020
those brats of mine will band together
and stand in my way.

77
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,360
Every single one of those brats...

78
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,930
Soon, my shares will be transferred
to your account.

79
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,370
I'd give you more, but it's not a lot.
Only about seven percent.

80
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,070
That's more than enough. Why so much?

81
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,540
It's not too much at all.

82
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,580
You'll need at least that much leverage
when you take over as CEO.

83
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,650
Are you really going to make me CEO
instead of your daughter?

84
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,450
Did you think I was joking?

85
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,520
Someone who's always scheming for my job
doesn't deserve to be in that position.

86
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,790
She won't be able to handle going from CEO
to a regular staff member overnight.

87
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,360
If she can't handle it, then so be it.

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,060
She made her own bed.

89
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,570
You're just getting in?

90
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,110
Where's my father?

91
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,140
In his room.

92
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,590
I'll do as you say.

93
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,930
Let's just say this makes up for
what I did to you.

94
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,130
I'm willing to start over from the bottom.

95
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,500
Oh, you're doing me a favor now?

96
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,670
The brat who tried to throw her own father
in a nursing home now wants to negotiate?

97
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,540
Then what do you want from me?

98
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,170
Will you hold this over my head forever
and never see me again?

99
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,240
- I'd like nothing more.
- Do you really have to say it like that?

100
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,010
Do you know what it's taking for me
to give up the CEO position?

101
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,850
You should take her offer.

102
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,020
How can a father not see his own child?

103
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,090
Especially when she's willing
to go this far.

104
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,160
The bond between a parent and child
is sacred, no matter how angry you are.

105
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,560
You shouldn't try to break a bond
that's meant to be.

106
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,670
You're the one ruining that sacred bond.
The one between my father and me,

107
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,940
and the one between me and Se Ri.

108
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,910
Who do you think is causing all of this?

109
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,820
Fine, have it your way.

110
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,920
I'll start over from the bottom.

111
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,150
So, Father, you can drop it now.

112
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,890
How brazen...

113
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,590
Darn it.

114
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,840
- Why are you pretending I'm not here?
- Because you were talking nonsense.

115
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,410
What did I say?

116
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,110
You don't even remember.

117
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,310
Then again, I'm not surprised.

118
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,490
Never say something so ridiculous again.
It's disgusting.

119
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,160
What's with her?

120
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,090
Oh, come on, hurry...

121
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,660
You messed up with Se Ri last night.

122
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,560
Why would you say something like that?

123
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,600
What did I say?

124
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,670
That you're her birth mother.

125
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,000
It's not like you were claiming to be
the Queen of Joseon.

126
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,310
I said that?

127
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,140
You were so drunk, she probably thinks
you were rambling.

128
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,080
Luckily, she didn't seem
to take it too seriously.

129
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,780
Actually, this might be a good thing.

130
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,680
I'll use this chance
to tell her everything...

131
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,250
and get Se Ri away from that woman.

132
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,090
You've kept it a secret for so long.
Why do this now?

133
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
Is stepping down as CEO
the end of the world?

134
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,190
You have to get it back.

135
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,230
You can't afford a single weakness.

136
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,000
They could use your past against you
to stop you from making a comeback.

137
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,230
This isn't the right time.

138
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,250
I don't care how drunk you were.
What kind of nonsense was that?

139
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,180
Don't you ever say that again.

140
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,520
How could you say
that you're Se Ri's birth mother?

141
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,220
She came to me so upset.

142
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,720
And why is that so nonsensical?

143
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,030
Do you know how disappointed and shocked
Se Ri is with you right now?

144
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,660
She's disappointed in me?

145
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,200
You tried to put her father in a home.
Of course she's disappointed.

146
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,300
How much longer are you going to be
sleeping in her room?

147
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,210
She can't sleep without me.

148
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,450
She's fragile and needs looking after.
Otherwise, she'll get into trouble.

149
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,650
And why does that someone have to be you?

150
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,420
It's not my choice. It's what Se Ri wants.

151
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,220
How can you still be so clueless
about everything?

152
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,200
(Official Notice: Min Kyung Chae Dismissed
as CEO, Demoted to a Staff Position)

153
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,120
You made the right choice.

154
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,120
It's best to wait out the storm.

155
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,860
Now is the time to lie low for a while.

156
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,930
Just stay out of the way for now
and plan your next move.

157
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,930
I'm telling you, don't be so upset.

158
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,300
You'll be back before you know it,
so don't worry.

159
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,370
I'm just stepping away for a bit,

160
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,440
so don't let anyone take my seat.

161
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,770
Of course.

162
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,810
It's your seat. Who would dare?

163
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,680
You think I would just stand by
and let that happen?

164
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,230
Did everyone see the official notice?

165
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,960
You think CEO Min
is really going to join our team?

166
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,600
Come on. No way.
CEO to staff overnight? It's insane.

167
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,570
If they posted an official notice,
it has to be true, right?

168
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,440
- Vice Director Min, what's going on?
- How am I supposed to know?

169
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,810
Still, demoting the CEO
to a staff member is going too far.

170
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,410
That's what I was thinking.

171
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,480
Really? I thought it was real.
Then why put up the official notice?

172
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,790
All right, that's enough chitchat.

173
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,220
Do you think CEO Min will work
as a staff member? She has too much pride.

174
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,330
She'd sooner quit.

175
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,490
If what you guys are saying is true,

176
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,660
then the CEO would leave her office
and come slinking in here like some...

177
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,780
She actually showed up.

178
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,840
What are you gawking at?
Am I an animal at the zoo?

179
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,150
Get back to work!

180
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,990
CEO Min, my mistake.

181
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,030
Today, Kyung Chae...

182
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,130
joins the Online Business Team
as a staff member, right?

183
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,970
She reports to you, so train her properly.

184
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,010
I will accept your special order.

185
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,810
However, a transfer that breaks procedure
could be problematic.

186
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,780
Don't worry.
I'll follow the procedures from now on.

187
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,610
Don't favor her because she was CEO.
Work her hard.

188
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,920
She has to earn her keep.

189
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,150
In that case, what if she leads
the live commerce project?

190
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,560
Do what you want.

191
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,790
All she's ever done is
give orders from behind a desk.

192
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,690
She's never had
to get her own hands dirty.

193
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
It's your call.

194
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Very well.

195
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,430
So, will the CEO's position
remain vacant for the time being?

196
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,900
It won't be empty for long.

197
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,300
I intend to fill it soon.

198
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,180
All right, everyone.
I have a directive from the chairman.

199
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,110
Our newest team member, Min Kyung Chae,

200
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,420
will be taking an active role
in all aspects of our team's work,

201
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,650
so I expect all of you
to assign her tasks without hesitation.

202
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,490
Are you ready for that?

203
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,030
Also, the person in charge
of our new live commerce launch...

204
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,800
has been selected,
and that person is Min Kyung Chae.

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,730
So I'll need everyone's cooperation.

206
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,470
Livestreams on a distribution platform...

207
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,410
requires a different approach
than traditional home shopping.

208
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,480
And one more thing.
We have a team tradition here.

209
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,350
The new hire picks the lunch spot
and handles tea time.

210
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,620
Just so you know.

211
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,190
And...

212
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,630
Why aren't you responding?

213
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,660
Am I supposed to answer
every single thing you say?

214
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,430
Of course you are.
If your boss asks a question, you answer.

215
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,970
That's how corporate life works.

216
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,610
- What can I get for you?
- Two goat soups, please.

217
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,880
Two goat soups!

218
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,320
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

219
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,850
Look at everyone enjoying the food.

220
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,890
Eating well is what it's all about.
Enjoy the soup and keep your strength up!

221
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,260
I'm glad business is booming, but...

222
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,660
But what?

223
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,730
For business to be this good
in a recession like this,

224
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,370
you should be thanking your lucky stars.
What's there to complain about?

225
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,400
That's just human nature, isn't it?

226
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,110
You earn a little,
and then you want to earn a lot more.

227
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,240
Is that old itch of yours acting up?

228
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,950
You're just looking
for your next big investment,

229
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,950
getting all wide-eyed again,

230
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,780
What a mouth on my beautiful wife.
A wife is the earth, and I'm the sky.

231
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,120
Oh, please. The sky's high, but worthless.
Land is what's expensive these days.

232
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,820
What kind of crazy talk is that?

233
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,120
Have you ever seen land without a sky?

234
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,860
Oh, whatever.

235
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,560
Don't even think about investing.
Now, opening another store is different.

236
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,570
We can open another store and invest.

237
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,830
Why not do both?

238
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,940
You'll get obsessed with it and ruin us.
You don't even know what you're doing.

239
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,170
Besides, you already have those shares
in Mingang Distribution.

240
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,880
A measly 2 percent? Come on.
You have to trade to make real money.

241
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,650
Oh, honestly! Ja Kyung told you before.

242
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,090
She said to hold onto the company shares
to help Ji Seop when he's in need.

243
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Excuse me.

244
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,360
- Oh, yes.
- I'm ready to order.

245
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,320
We're just not on the same level.

246
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,830
That's why I keep thinking
about Ms. Stella.

247
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,400
We're a perfect match in sophistication.
And she could be my business partner.

248
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,170
We could build a friendship.
And once that friendship builds,

249
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,170
affection starts to build.
And once affection builds, well...

250
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,570
I'm not sure what happens next.

251
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,540
Director Moon.

252
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,950
I think we're due for a caffeine run.

253
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,810
Oh, is it?

254
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,080
New hire, what are you doing?

255
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,290
Aren't you going to get the coffee?

256
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,460
Are you asking me to do that?

257
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,390
Well, who else would do it?

258
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,700
The director said it earlier.
On this team, the newest member...

259
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,270
gets it.

260
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,140
Oh, here's the card.

261
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,410
Everyone can just get their own coffee,
or don't, if you don't want any.

262
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,980
Why are we acting like children?

263
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,480
We're not acting like kids.
This is how you build team chemistry.

264
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,020
That's right.
We all did it when we were new.

265
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,820
Do you really think I'm the same as you?

266
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,020
Come on, why is everyone acting like this?
Give it to me. I'll go get it.

267
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Hang on a second.

268
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,960
This is a task for the new hire.
Why can't you do it?

269
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,730
And what exactly makes you so different
from the rest of us, Ms. Min?

270
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,270
Please hurry. Everyone's waiting.

271
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,290
So you're saying the Chairman already
transferred the shares to her account?

272
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,960
It looks like it was gifted immediately
on his special orders.

273
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,190
So if she takes the CEO position,

274
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,990
she'll have a stake in the company
as part of the owner family,

275
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,060
and become a legitimate executive.
Darn it!

276
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,430
Don't worry too much.

277
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,600
It's not like a huge part
of the shares was transferred.

278
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,500
Maybe, but you never know
when that geezer will change his mind.

279
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,110
Okay, I get it.

280
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,970
(Mingang Distribution)

281
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,180
What do we do?

282
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,280
A portion
of the Chairman's shareholdings...

283
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,920
has been transferred to Lucia.

284
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,690
So he's already transferred shares to her?

285
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,130
Then all that's left is
for him to make her CEO.

286
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,960
What the heck are the directors doing?
Those idiots.

287
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,730
Why did those directors
rush into the chairman's office...

288
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,130
when they couldn't even stop him?

289
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,180
If you have 7 percent,

290
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,610
your stake is the same
as Min Soo Jung and Min Ji Seop's.

291
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,950
Even so, it won't be a major threat
to Min Kyung Chae.

292
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,720
But Min Doo Sik will pressure the board
and the shareholders...

293
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,290
to put you in the CEO's seat.

294
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,290
The board and the shareholders
will never accept me.

295
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,160
You never know about that.

296
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,000
There's the Helena Louise contract.

297
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,400
It's clear you've made major contributions
since you were on the online team.

298
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,070
Do you think that will be enough?

299
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,070
I feel I need one decisive achievement
to win over directors and shareholders.

300
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,780
Why isn't Min Kyung Chae back yet?

301
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,550
She left to get coffee a while ago.

302
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,920
I'm not sure.

303
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,380
Maybe she got lost?

304
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,190
Why are you empty-handed?

305
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,690
What happened to the coffee?

306
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,260
I'm not in the mood
to be running coffee errands.

307
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,130
So you just came back without it?

308
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,200
Quiet down. I need to think.

309
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,740
- Hey, Min Kyung Chae.
- I said, be quiet.

310
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,980
Excuse me! Did you just yell at me?

311
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,550
Why do you keep addressing me so casually?
Are we friends or something?

312
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,950
What are you doing now?
Is it okay to disrupt the office this way?

313
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,720
Can't you see they're the ones
ruining the atmosphere, not me?

314
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,420
Ms. Min, were you such an amateur...

315
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,360
with no sense of hierarchy or structure?

316
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,790
What did you just say? Amateur?

317
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,030
Are you done?

318
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,730
If a lone wolf who can't work with a team
isn't an amateur, then what is?

319
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,640
Let's have a word.

320
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,510
What is your problem?

321
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,380
Now that you're on our team, you need
to at least try to adapt and fit in.

322
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,450
I have no reason to adapt
and no need to fit in.

323
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,050
I'll be getting my CEO position back
soon enough.

324
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,660
Should I repeat myself?

325
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,700
I'm going to be CEO again soon,
so don't you dare underestimate me.

326
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,230
Even if you do get your old job back,
don't forget you work for me right now.

327
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,240
If you keep this up,
I can't guarantee a good review.

328
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,910
- You're threatening me with that?
- It's a warning.

329
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,210
And just so you know,
this team has a three-strikes rule.

330
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,810
Three warnings and you're out.

331
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,450
Keep that in mind.

332
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,100
What are you up to?

333
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,600
Just thinking.

334
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,940
Are you still upset about
what Kyung Chae said?

335
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,610
It was just a drunken rant.

336
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,050
I don't think
it was just the alcohol talking...

337
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,180
You're nothing like her.

338
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,090
If anything, you take after me.

339
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,720
- Me?
- Yes.

340
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,130
You know how when we smile,
our eyes and mouths look just alike?

341
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,790
And that's not all.

342
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,560
We're always on the same wavelength, too.

343
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,230
I guess you're right.

344
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,340
And the clincher is,
you have a seafood allergy, right?

345
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,170
So do I.

346
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,840
We were probably mother and daughter
in a past life.

347
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,850
That must be why we get along so well.

348
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,680
So just forget what your sister said.

349
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,460
At this rate, all my hard work
will be for nothing.

350
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,160
After everything I did to take in Se Ri...

351
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,230
and how I saved that helpless newborn
when she was dying.

352
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,170
I'm sure...

353
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,740
she has ulterior motives
when it comes to Se Ri.

354
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,310
Director Moon.

355
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,010
It's time to go home.

356
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,820
Is it that time already?

357
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,250
All right, everyone, pack up and go home.
Great work today.

358
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,890
- Good work today.
- You too.

359
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,920
- Have a good night.
- I'm heading out.

360
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,030
I'm heading out now. Good work today.

361
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,740
Where do you think you're going?
You're not even halfway done.

362
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,370
You need to finish it before you leave.

363
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,110
Are you telling me to stay here
and finish this all by myself?

364
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,250
If you'd worked like everyone else did,
you wouldn't be behind.

365
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,250
Even if you have to pull an all-nighter,

366
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,980
you're finishing this before you leave.

367
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Nicely done.

368
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,340
What time did you leave last night?

369
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,110
I stayed behind and worked by myself
until the sun came up.

370
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
See?

371
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,380
These dark circles.

372
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,490
Go get this approved by Director Min.

373
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,300
For your approval.

374
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,240
I'm not signing this.

375
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,140
What?

376
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,180
If you want my approval, do it right.

377
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,010
Go back out and knock first.

378
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,850
What do you think you're doing?

379
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,580
Min Kyung Chae.

380
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,390
This is a workplace.

381
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,750
What?

382
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,460
"Min Kyung Chae?"

383
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,490
People only sucked up to you
when you were the CEO.

384
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,860
How dare a mere staff member
talk that way to the Director?

385
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,400
A vacant CEO position looks bad,
and it creates a gap in our operations.

386
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,610
And with the online team's livestream
about to launch,

387
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,610
we need someone to sign off on things.

388
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,120
The board won't approve it.
They'll say it's a unilateral decision.

389
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,980
Who are they to refuse my decision?

390
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,090
I'm the owner, and I'm the chairman.

391
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,090
But this is a corporation. You can't just
do whatever you please, sir.

392
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,760
They can easily object if you try
to install someone unqualified.

393
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,630
You were a team leader
when you first joined this company.

394
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,770
You stopped working when you got married,
but you never officially resigned.

395
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,100
That's only because
you've been so gracious.

396
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,810
If I approve of you,
then so will everyone else.

397
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,280
I'll handle the board.
You just accept the new CEO position.

398
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,320
Sure.

399
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,120
(Mingang Distribution)

400
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,730
Didn't I tell you last time?

401
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,940
Forgiveness is what the powerful
give the powerless.

402
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,270
Come in.

403
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,920
- Let go of me!
- Wait.

404
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,390
I insist on returning what I get.

405
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,040
Let me go!

406
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,910
This is where it all started.

407
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,510
If you had just sincerely apologized
back then,

408
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,110
if you had felt any remorse for
what you did to my Mi So,

409
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,120
I wonder where we'd be now.

410
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Ma'am.

411
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,190
Let me take care of this.

412
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,160
You should go get some rest.

413
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,730
You look exhausted.

414
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,860
Tell me about it. I'm exhausted.

415
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,670
I should report him
to the Ministry of Labor.

416
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,340
That Director Moon Tae Kyung
is a real piece of work.

417
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,850
What are you doing here?

418
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,720
You should have apologized properly
back then.

419
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,220
You have a daughter of your own.

420
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,150
Would you have done the same...

421
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,890
if something had happened to Se Ri
instead of my Mi So?

422
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,690
I asked you what you're doing!

423
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,060
This is going to be my office soon,

424
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,060
- so I'm getting a feel for it.
- Who said this is your office?

425
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,000
Get out. Now.

426
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,840
I said, get out!

427
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,640
I think you're the one
who's going to have to leave, not me.

428
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,090
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

429
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,440
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

430
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,320
Set your personal feelings aside, sir.
You'll damage your hard-earned reputation.

431
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,260
You really expect me to compete
with that woman?

432
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,090
It's the surest and quickest way,
isn't it?

433
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,630
You have to hurry.
Se Ri is getting closer to that woman.

434
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,370
I'm a nervous wreck just watching it.

435
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,540
So you're saying you'll compete with her
for the CEO position?

436
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,740
Is there any reason I shouldn't?

437
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,770
I'm going to expose exactly who this Lucia
you trust so much really is.
