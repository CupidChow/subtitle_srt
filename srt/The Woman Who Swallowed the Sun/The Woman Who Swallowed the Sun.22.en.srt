00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,970
(Episode 22)

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,580
Is she really all right?

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,240
I administered first aid,

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,050
and her pulse and breathing are stable,
so you don't have to worry.

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,780
Why did this happen to her?

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,750
I'd say it was a panic attack
caused by some kind of shock.

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,220
Hyperventilation and stiff limbs...

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,990
are typical symptoms of PTSD.

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,390
Post-traumatic stress disorder?

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,390
Yes.

11
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,300
We're not sure, so when she wakes up,
tell her to see a doctor.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,500
There's a limit to what I can do here.

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,270
Okay. Thanks.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,030
You're awake at last.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,970
Online Business Team's
Director Moon brought you here.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,840
You passed out on the rooftop.

17
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,280
Did the director go somewhere?

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,850
He left on business.

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,820
Oh, and he told us
to tell you to leave early today.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,340
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

21
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,970
I'm fine.

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,070
Shall I get you some medicine?

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,410
I'm fine, Tae Joo.

24
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,510
I was given an IV drip.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,580
Okay, then. Rest is best.

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,050
Try to get some sleep.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,620
Tae Joo and I will be out late today.

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,730
She passed out already,
before we even got started.

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,340
It would be a shock
to find herself at where it happened.

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,040
I'd wonder if she weren't human
if she didn't have a reaction at all.

31
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,310
I couldn't go to where Ho Se died...

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,510
because my legs gave way.

33
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,680
Lucia will do fine.

34
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,150
I'd hope so.

35
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,390
I suffered the torment...

36
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,760
for 20 years too.

37
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,500
The online business will take off now.

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,830
Stay alert.

39
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,330
You especially.

40
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,900
Do your job as vice director.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm doing my job pretty well already.

42
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,370
If you'd actually cared
and worried about Mingang,

43
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,810
when your team was at the brink
of being shut down for lack of funds,

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,910
you should've asked
your father-in-law for money.

45
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,880
Were you unable to,
or did you not even think of it?

46
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,690
Who knows?

47
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,450
Maybe you asked him to promise...

48
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,390
not to lend Kyung Chae anything.

49
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,530
You can't stand the idea
of her doing well.

50
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,460
How could you say that, Father?

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,930
Should I be relieved...

52
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,400
if his only demand
is that you be made director?

53
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,410
He freaks me out when he does that.

54
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,980
Do you think he's psychic?

55
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,210
He's like a fortune teller.

56
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,450
I know, right?

57
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,320
How did he know we told your father...

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,590
not to loan Kyung Chae anything?

59
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,620
That's not all.

60
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,220
How did he know
we considered using the investment...

61
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,220
as leverage to make you a director?

62
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,960
What's that about?

63
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,390
My dad was going to
make a deal with Kyung Chae...

64
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,560
to put you...

65
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,400
in Director Moon's place.

66
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,200
Mom called to tip me off.

67
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,840
Is that true?

68
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,670
Father-in-law is the only person
who cares about me.

69
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,940
If only Father cared for me half as much.

70
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,680
Think about whether
we should keep Director Moon around.

71
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,950
The sales numbers are out of his control.

72
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,150
It's a shame...

73
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,390
that his performance is unsatisfactory,

74
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,960
but now we have the funds to...

75
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,520
That's not what I'm talking about.

76
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,030
I told him to do something,
and he refused point-blank.

77
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,060
Director Moon said no?
He wouldn't do that.

78
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,330
The more I get to know him,
the stranger I feel.

79
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,470
I can't tell what he's thinking.

80
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,500
What did you tell him to do?

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,670
It's something...

82
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,040
I did myself 30 years ago.

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,750
(Mingang Distribution)

84
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,320
Thank you for helping me out yesterday.

85
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,890
You took me to see the in-house doctor.

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,230
Yes.

87
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,990
Do you feel better?

88
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,960
You could've taken today off.

89
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,070
No, I'm fine now.
And I should get to work.

90
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,600
Did I do anything
bad or strange yesterday?

91
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,710
Like talking in my sleep or something.

92
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,980
No.

93
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,080
You didn't.

94
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,140
Mom is sorry.

96
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,170
My dear daughter.

97
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,480
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

98
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,390
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

99
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,620
Moon Tae Kyung speaking.

100
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,990
The CEO wants to see you.

101
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,390
The chairman told me.

102
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,400
You said you couldn't do... No.

103
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,900
You wouldn't do as he said.

104
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,430
I was unable to do it.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,440
I don't think my dad is asking too much.

106
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,910
I apologize.

107
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,580
Don't refuse without justification
or practical interest.

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,410
It's an insubordination of sorts.

109
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,780
It could look like sabotage.

110
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,890
I'm pretty sure
I was a lenient superior until now.

111
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,190
I can...

112
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,690
justify my decision.

113
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,990
Let's hear it.

114
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,990
I refuse to do the despicable things
your father did...

115
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,960
that will create victims like me.

116
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,200
I didn't think it was moral.

117
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,270
Yes, it's true
that Jogeon Logistics is small...

118
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,200
and has very little capital.

119
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,370
They know the situation they're in,
which is why...

120
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,410
they worked hard
to develop new technology.

121
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,280
And they're just about to
reap the benefits.

122
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,320
Approaching them
disguised as an investor...

123
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,850
with the malicious intent to steal?

124
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,890
I thought that would
drive them to their demise.

125
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,290
Why should we worry about others...

126
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,590
when we're struggling too?

127
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,460
Have you forgotten?

128
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,630
If we hadn't secured an investment,

129
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,500
we'd be in that exact same situation.

130
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,800
But those people...

131
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
I get your point.

132
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,900
I got it. You can return to your office.

133
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,150
Why say you can't do it
when my team had everything sorted out?

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
It takes almost no effort to take down
a company as small as that.

135
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,930
I can make it legal.

136
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,030
It all depends on
how you interpret the law.

137
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,330
Using loopholes to steal technology...

138
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,970
that others worked on
for years to develop.

139
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,940
Doesn't that make you feel bad?

140
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,870
Someone else will do it if we don't.

141
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,610
A new technology that
a penniless company happened to create.

142
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,140
It makes them an ideal prey
for large, well-funded companies.

143
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,410
Don't think the world is that simple.

144
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,050
If you keep taking what isn't yours,

145
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,520
you're bound to pay the price one day.

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,590
My goodness.

147
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,290
He thinks he's above everyone else.

148
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,830
He and his boring principles.

149
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,600
Morals, one's conscience, stuff like that.

150
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,670
That is Director Moon's weakness.

151
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,140
The law of the jungle
rules the business world,

152
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,410
and his mindset is way behind the norm.

153
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,050
Father never gives up
what he sets his mind on.

154
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,620
You know how stubborn he is.

155
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,620
That's not stubbornness. It's wisdom.

156
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,090
If we can get Jogeon's technology,

157
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,650
we can save millions...

158
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,490
on labor and transportation costs.

159
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,830
Yes. It might not be of any use right now,

160
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,200
but if we can incorporate that
into our new system...

161
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,930
That's why we must go for it.

162
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,230
If Director Moon won't do it,
tell someone else to.

163
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,640
Do you have someone in mind?

164
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,570
What about Jung Lucia?

165
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,610
Didn't you scout her
for her great skill set?

166
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,540
Why don't you see...

167
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,010
just how skilled she really is?

168
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,720
Can you use my DNA to find my birth mom?

169
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,960
I'd be out there looking
if I knew where she was!

170
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,600
I don't know her name or anything.

171
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,230
I'll have my DNA tested first,
then look for her.

172
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,100
A women's shelter might know of her,
or there might be a missing person's file.

173
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,480
Okay. I'll come over today.

174
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,550
Once I find my mom,

175
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,350
I'll sell my Mingang shares...

176
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,350
and cut ties with this whole family.

177
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,090
Where are you going?

178
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
To the academy.

179
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,630
Are your classes back on now?

180
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,800
I'll be late. I'll take a taxi back,
so don't send Mr. Kim with the car.

181
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,670
Is she going somewhere?

182
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,900
To her academy.

183
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,210
I find that hard to believe.

184
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,110
She has a long record of lying.

185
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,010
To be honest, I feel more uneasy
when she's quiet and docile.

186
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,650
That was when she was a teenager.

187
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,380
She has grown up now.

188
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,890
I have a feeling you might get
stabbed in the back for trusting her.

189
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,360
(Mingang Distribution)

190
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,600
Madam Jang.

191
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,960
I dropped by on my way...

192
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,400
to an appointment nearby.

193
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,500
I didn't even call your secretary
because I wanted to surprise you.

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,240
Am I disrupting your busy schedule?

195
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,670
Not at all.

196
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,110
You look different
when you're in your office.

197
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,850
I trusted you when I put you
in touch with the Macau fund.

198
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,850
Don't let me down.

199
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,620
I won't. You have nothing to worry about.

200
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,090
I know how competent
a businesswoman you are.

201
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,090
It was a temporary financial issue,
and there are no other problems, right?

202
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,960
That's right. And you put me
in touch with a great backer.

203
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,860
A backer?

204
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,900
Oh, you mean Lucia?

205
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,170
The chairman is
trying to set a project in motion.

206
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,570
I might put Lucia in charge of it.

207
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,510
Good afternoon.

208
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,650
Son-in-law. I'm in the lobby.

209
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,090
Why? To see your face...

210
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,090
and discuss some meaty business ideas.

211
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,360
Come on down.

212
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,470
- Father!
- Son-in-law.

213
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,880
I meant to call you.

214
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,280
- My wife told me...
- I know what you'll say.

215
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,910
I was waiting for your sister
to die on her own...

216
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,820
because she couldn't get any funding,

217
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,320
but that's too one-dimensional.

218
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,820
It would be better to offer a loan
in return for your promotion.

219
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,220
That would've been great,
but Kyung Chae found an investor already.

220
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,060
What? I feel like I pooped my pants
when I just wanted to fart.

221
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,200
She got the funds? When? How? From whom?

222
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,770
I have no idea.

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,230
She has some skills.

224
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,570
She has been so haughty
since she got the funding.

225
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,940
Does that mean you and I both
got excited for nothing?

226
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,910
It's great for the company
that she found an investor,

227
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,950
but it's not good for me at all.

228
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,030
Oh, my gosh.

229
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,910
Father?

230
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,340
Keep quiet.
I want to look for a while longer.

231
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,380
Who is...

232
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,520
that beautiful,
elegant, intellectual woman?

233
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,150
I don't know. Is she someone's visitor?

234
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,460
She cleansed my eyes and my soul.

235
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,990
If there were a human air purifier,
that would be her.

236
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,230
The air around her is so clear.

237
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,470
What?

238
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,200
I have fallen in love

239
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,810
Son-in-law. I feel so very dizzy.

240
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,210
Father. You can't faint out here.

241
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,620
- I just can't stay standing.
- Father.

242
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,390
You seemed to like our food,
so I brought you some more.

243
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,390
You don't have to pay for it.

244
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,390
You're so sweet and thoughtful
for your age.

245
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,630
I bet everyone loves you.

246
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,230
Did your husband go out?

247
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,700
To see our son-in-law.

248
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,270
They say a woman
loves her son-in-law the most,

249
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,970
but it's the other way round
in our household.

250
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,040
You're back. Did you see our son-in-law?

251
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,350
- How are you?
- How are you back?

252
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,150
- I should go.
- Thanks a lot.

253
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,690
Goodbye.

254
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,790
Bye.

255
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,390
Did you talk to Ji Seop?

256
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,660
Goodness...

257
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,300
Why the weird face?

258
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,900
Did you see something you shouldn't have?

259
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,870
I'm looking at something
I shouldn't right now.

260
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,740
How can the difference be so striking?

261
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,540
One is like a shimmering silk scarf
from a high-end store.

262
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,480
The other is like a worn nylon stocking.

263
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,380
What are you talking about?

264
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,120
You're lovely and all,
but you lack something.

265
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,590
Class and intellect.

266
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,650
I don't have that, and neither do you.

267
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,990
Why don't we have that?

268
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,970
You asked to see me?

269
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,540
I have a special task for you.

270
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,610
What is it?

271
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,210
You can tell, can't you?

272
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,280
You won't be on it on your own.

273
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,380
Our lawyer Kim Sun Jae will assist you.

274
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,290
Ms. Lucia.

275
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,960
Did the CEO fill you in?

276
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,260
We must work on this together.

277
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,330
It's not a difficult job.

278
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,670
There will be a legal struggle,
but I'll take care of all that.

279
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,170
I just need someone to be in charge.

280
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,840
Someone to lead the whole project.

281
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,280
It's not exactly a job
for the Online Business Team,

282
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,210
so I can't force you
to accept the task if you're against it.

283
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,920
Why do we need to do this?

284
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,720
It might look unrelated at the moment,

285
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,260
but it will benefit Mingang
in the long run.

286
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,860
If that's the case, it must be done.

287
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,960
Is something wrong?

288
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,830
No.

289
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,470
You're Jung Lucia, not Baek Sul Hee?

290
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,740
No.

291
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,780
Whatever others say,
to me, you're Baek Sul Hee.

292
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,950
I hope we can work well together.

293
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,480
Oh, and I apologize
for how I acted last time.

294
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,290
You look so much like someone I know.

295
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,590
That's fine.

296
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,660
Bye, then.

297
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,440
Why do you have that file?

298
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,840
CEO Min put me in charge.

299
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,410
The project she gave you...

300
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,150
involves a very small company
called Jogeon Logistics.

301
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,490
Yes, I know that much.

302
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,790
No. You must know every detail.

303
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,760
The end goal...

304
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,860
is for Mingang Distribution
to take over the company.

305
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,340
They haven't changed at all.

306
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,570
But that's what Min Doo Sik is like.

307
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,280
What do you mean?

308
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,610
As far as I know,

309
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,250
something similar happened 30 years ago.

310
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,520
Mingang Distribution wasn't as big then
as it is now.

311
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,090
They had a lot of capital,

312
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,760
but they didn't have
a well-organized system.

313
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,660
Min Doo Sik then found out
that a small company...

314
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,600
had developed a distribution system
that he desperately needed.

315
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,600
The greedy man homed in on them.

316
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,700
You can tell what happened.

317
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,440
He approached the small company
pretending to be an investor...

318
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,410
and took everything they had.

319
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,180
I don't think the word of what happened
actually got out.

320
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,680
Things didn't work out ideally.

321
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,620
To think that it got covered up...

322
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,320
Min Doo Sik will be hard to handle.

323
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,220
Not only is he stubborn,

324
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,860
but he doesn't let anyone close.

325
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,830
He distrusts everyone
and is always on edge.

326
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,530
The hardest part of getting to people
like that is to make them open up.

327
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,270
I think I might be able to do something
by using Director Min Soo Jung.

328
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,450
(Mingang Distribution)

329
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,120
My gosh, sir.

330
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,630
We meet yet again.

331
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,160
I can't believe it.

332
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,760
Neither can I.

333
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,800
I'm with the Online Business Team here.

334
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,670
What are you doing here
this early in the day?

335
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,240
Are you here to see someone?

336
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,510
You could say that.

337
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,110
Going up.

338
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,750
The doors are closing.

339
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,120
The chairman's office is on that floor.

340
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,450
Are you here to see the chairman?

341
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,620
You could say that.

342
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,690
I haven't met him yet,

343
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,830
but my colleagues say he's like a boulder.

344
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,100
They say he's stubborn
and not at all flexible,

345
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,940
but I took that to mean
he's firm and consistent.

346
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,070
A man in charge of a large company...

347
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,270
should be like a boulder and not a pebble.

348
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,580
Oh, right.

349
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,050
I should return this to you.

350
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,090
I should think positively
about my boss, right?

351
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,820
The doors are opening.

352
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Goodbye.

353
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,000
(Mingang Distribution)

354
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,160
The doors are closing.

355
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,200
You said a third meeting meant bad karma.

356
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,740
It's not. It's natural and reasonable.

357
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,410
The heavens bring together
people who are naturally...

358
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,580
meant to be by forcing coincidences.

359
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,150
If we are naturally meant to be,

360
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,150
we'll meet again, won't we?

361
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,590
Goodbye, sir.

362
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,690
The doors are closing.

363
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,210
Bring me the personnel cards
of everyone on the Online Business Team.

364
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,460
I thought about what you said last time.

365
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,930
Oh, that?

366
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,230
Is there a secret about the CEO
that I don't know of?

367
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,940
Did you come to fill me in?

368
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,670
Does that mean we're a team now?

369
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,940
No, I don't know the CEO's secrets.

370
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,310
I just joined, and I barely had
enough time to figure out my job.

371
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,020
But even if I did hear something,

372
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,020
it would be wrong for me to tell you.

373
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,320
Why are you here, then?

374
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,030
I came here to get some advice.

375
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,530
What about?

376
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,660
The CEO seems to plan...

377
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,300
to take over a small company
called Jogeon Logistics.

378
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,270
And she put me in charge.

379
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,070
The thing is, Lawyer Kim and Director Moon
have conflicting opinions.

380
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,610
I'm torn.

381
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,310
Take over the company.
What could be the problem?

382
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,250
What does the company do?

383
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,790
The chairman himself
wants us to take over the company.

384
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,920
If all goes well,
I could gain his recognition,

385
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,960
but I myself am not sure
if I should go for it.

386
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,160
It's a project that my dad wants done?

387
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,380
Will you actually do it?

388
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,250
Even after what I said yesterday?

389
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,220
It won't get in the way
of whatever you're doing.

390
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,390
What I meant was...

391
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,130
I'm not worried
that this will disrupt our other tasks.

392
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,760
Not only was this the CEO's order,
but I'm also just an employee.

393
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,400
I have no reason to refuse.

394
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,670
Do you do everything the CEO says?

395
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,870
Even if it means hurting the innocent?

396
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,570
Is that what an employee does?
Do you really think so?

397
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
Fine.

398
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,410
I'm well aware
that I can't force you to do anything.

399
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,450
But...

400
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,380
I hope you will do what's right.

401
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,860
Can we meet to talk this evening?

402
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,290
Did you hire someone with experience?

403
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,400
For the Online Business Team.

404
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,330
Did you look into it carefully?

405
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,730
She's competent and can be trusted.

406
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,870
There's no such person.

407
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,440
You shouldn't even trust yourself.

408
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,010
I couldn't have gotten the investment
if it hadn't been for Lucia.

409
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,010
She has proven herself in a sense.

410
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,810
Still, don't trust her with everything.

411
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,110
I'm as picky as you
when it comes to judging people.

412
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,180
I looked into her background,

413
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,920
and I even checked if her ID,

414
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,050
diploma, and portfolio were forged.

415
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,050
They weren't.

416
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,390
Good, then.

417
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,490
Why did you ask about her?

418
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,030
Is something bothering you?

419
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,330
It's nothing.

420
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,460
What will you do about Jogeon Logistics?

421
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,000
Director Moon doesn't seem
to want to do anything.

422
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,570
Don't worry.

423
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,670
We'll get what we want.

424
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,280
- Have a drink.
- No, thanks. I prefer water.

425
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,550
I am your superior,
but I can't tell you what to do.

426
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,650
Even more so if the CEO told you to do it.

427
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,290
Then why did you ask to see me...

428
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,660
away from work to dissuade me?

429
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,290
I told you. I want you to do what's right.

430
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,700
I want to hear the real reason.

431
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,860
What you want to say...

432
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,930
that you're keeping inside.

433
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,000
That's what I want to hear.

434
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
There was this boy I knew.

435
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,390
His parents owned and ran a small factory,

436
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,820
and he grew up happily, wanting nothing.

437
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,060
In his free time,
the boy's father developed...

438
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,330
an automated distribution system.

439
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,100
The patent was to be granted soon.

440
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,870
The problem was, they couldn't
afford to commercialize the idea.

441
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,340
Around that time,

442
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,780
a company approached them
and offered to invest.

443
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,580
Was that investor
a large company we'd know?

444
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,890
But...

445
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,660
instead of investing,

446
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,190
they stole the technology...

447
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,360
and framed the boy's parents.

448
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,870
They were made to look like thieves
who had stolen from the large company.

449
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,800
The boy's parents refused to give in.

450
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,270
They fought the company to the end, but...

451
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,310
They were killed in a car crash...

452
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,380
that was made to look like an accident.

453
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,690
He lost both parents overnight.

454
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,260
Where is that boy now?

455
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,330
He's sitting opposite you.

456
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,500
Sorry.

457
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Hello?

458
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,240
Yes, hello.

459
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,280
What? Is that true?

460
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,880
Okay. I'll be right there. Bye.

461
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,850
I'm sorry, but I must dash.

462
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,060
Something urgent came up.

463
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,790
You're not going to drive, are you?

464
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,990
Well...

465
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,630
Darn it.

466
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,700
Where to? I'll drive you.

467
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,320
Mr. Jo.

468
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,020
Do you recognize me?

469
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,960
Do you remember me?

470
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,930
Do you know how we met...

471
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,770
and how you ended up here?

472
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,510
It's okay.
I don't mind if you don't remember.

473
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,780
I'm grateful
that you regained consciousness.

474
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,390
I remember...

475
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,060
whose son you are.

476
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,650
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

477
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,300
I promise to find out...

478
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,970
who killed my parents too.

479
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,940
I think she approached me
under the guise of a coincidence.

480
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,540
I guess I was a fool
and believed it was fate.

481
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,380
I think you could become
an ally and a friend.

482
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,480
That's how I feel.

483
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,640
I feel let down.

484
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,780
How well do you think you know me
that you'd feel let down?

485
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,010
They must struggle a bit...

486
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,650
so that you can get involved.

487
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,650
Someone knows about the accident.

488
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,950
Who knows what happened?

489
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,520
Director Moon Tae Kyung.
