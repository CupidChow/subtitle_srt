00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,840
(Episode 43)

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,880
Se Ri!

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,750
Se Ri!

4
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,540
What are you doing?

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,110
Let go of me!

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,810
How dare you walk into the sea?

7
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,980
Do you want to die? Why?
Because you fought your sister?

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,020
Does your life mean that little?

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,890
You don't know anything!

10
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,160
We can both die, then.

11
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,990
I don't think I can live in my right mind
after seeing someone die.

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,230
Let's go.

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,800
Let go of me! What are you doing?

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,370
You psycho!

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,870
If you want to die, you must.

16
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,640
What? Did you get scared
when I tried to drag you in deeper?

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,310
That's how everyone feels...

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,180
when they try to take their own life.

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,350
Didn't you know how it would feel
to let go of something that precious?

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,190
Do you know...

21
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,390
how it feels to live
only because you can't die?

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,590
What would you know?

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,630
There are people...

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,040
who want to live more than anything,

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
but can't because they were
pushed over the edge.

26
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,080
You took the life
of someone who wanted to live.

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,550
Now you must live even if you wish to die.

28
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,880
Live.

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,780
You must live.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,990
Live even if you don't want to.

31
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,620
Live.

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,690
And look back and see if you hurt anyone.

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,360
See if you caused anyone harm.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,630
Suffer the consequences...

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,870
until your body aches,

36
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,870
and struggle with the remorse
until you wither away!

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,410
I hope you feel like your flesh melts off.

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,080
That's how you must live.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,530
Yet again, you saved the life
that deserves to be lost.

40
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,070
How many members of that family
have you saved already?

41
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,680
You must feel dreadful.

42
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,650
You lost the daughter
you wanted to save more than anything,

43
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,450
and now you saved
multiple of your sworn enemies.

44
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,020
By the way. That girl.

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Who does she take after
that she's such a mess?

46
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,060
I've known her for one day,
and the stress...

47
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,290
My gastritis almost came back.

48
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,740
Is it true that Se Ri walked into the sea?

49
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,310
Yes.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,510
The crazy thing
wants to die before her dad?

51
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,920
Where is she? Bring her over.

52
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,720
Let her be. She must be in shock.

53
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,350
Must I put up with suicide attempts now?

54
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,520
Who saved her anyway?

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,630
Her identity would've gotten out
if you'd called for help.

56
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,200
If a tabloid catches wind...

57
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,800
Don't worry. I was at the scene.

58
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,370
You saved her?

59
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,270
Why won't you answer?

60
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,370
Who did it if not you?

61
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,510
Pretend you don't know.

62
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,980
We don't know what she'll do
if you scold her too.

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,980
I think she's acting out
because she's ashamed she got conned.

64
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,480
I don't believe this.

65
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,750
A kid blackmails
her own family with her life?

66
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,550
My gosh.

67
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,060
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

68
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,960
It's medication that calms nerves.
Give it to your youngest daughter.

69
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,730
She'll be in shock.

70
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,300
I know you must've taken good care of her,

71
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,100
but I'm still worried.

72
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,970
You were there too?

73
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,780
- Yes.
- Did you...

74
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,480
save Se Ri?

75
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,780
I won't answer.

76
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,750
It's nothing to brag about.

77
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,980
Tell me.

78
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,420
Did you save her life?

79
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,460
Why do you want to keep it a secret?

80
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,030
You saved my life and now my daughter's.

81
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,700
Ms. Min could get the wrong idea,

82
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,330
and if the word were to get out...

83
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,270
If what she did
were to end up in the news...

84
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,270
No, forget the news. If...

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,770
I just...

86
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,410
feel so sorry for her.

87
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,880
Why did she...

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,490
want to die when she's just peaking?

89
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,350
If just one person...

90
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
had spoken to her warmly...

91
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,200
and held her hand,
none of that would've happened.

92
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,100
She's grown up,
but inside, she's still a child.

93
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,370
If she had a mother figure
to hold her and console her,

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,440
she would come around.

95
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,610
(Mingang Distribution)

96
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,900
What are you so deep in thought about?

97
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,300
Lucia.

98
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,840
She saved Se Ri's life this time.

99
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,340
Does the chairman know about it?

100
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,340
Not yet.

101
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,150
I fear what he'd say if he did.

102
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,080
He's forcing himself to ignore her now...

103
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,020
because of our promise and what he said.

104
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,420
You know what old people are like.

105
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,790
They can't tell pity,
compassion, and love apart.

106
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,160
They just want to take
whatever it is all the way.

107
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,330
The chairman wouldn't...

108
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,760
He's a man, isn't he?

109
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,300
It's easy to fend off gold diggers
who have a motive and a plan.

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,800
Lucia is a tough one.

111
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,270
Whether it's a coincidence or not
doesn't matter anymore.

112
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,210
I'm worried she'll be hard to get rid of.

113
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,550
Do you know what I regret?

114
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,980
Bringing her in myself.

115
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,890
Keeping her
within the chairman's line of sight.

116
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,430
You saved the youngest daughter this time?

117
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,840
Gosh, you're doing so many great deeds.

118
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,700
First, it was the chairman,
and now it's his youngest.

119
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,940
I wonder who or what you'll save next.

120
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,180
Our country's future?

121
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,810
Don't you mind what I do.

122
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,750
I wish I didn't have to,

123
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,050
but the CEO is bothered.

124
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,620
Why would she fear someone like me?

125
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,490
There are omens or signs.

126
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,890
The sick feeling
that something bad will happen.

127
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,560
That's what you are.

128
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,490
Your existence, you as a person.

129
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,200
Whether I attack the family
to get revenge or save them all...

130
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,570
is my business.

131
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,770
You go and take care of yours.

132
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,610
Go and guard your master.

133
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,380
You said that's what dogs do.

134
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,510
Sul Hee.

135
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,050
I don't see why
we should go against each other.

136
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,950
Whose fault is it
that Mi So died four years ago?

137
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,290
You did the dirty work
for the Min family and cleaned it up.

138
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,630
The fake news and the witch hunt.

139
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,060
Whose fault is it that she ended up
falling from the rooftop?

140
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,270
If you hadn't stopped her from going to...

141
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,300
the international school
that was her dream...

142
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,070
You don't see why
we should go against each other?

143
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,380
You can side with me, then.

144
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,150
Are you on something?
Why would I side with you?

145
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,120
You never know what will happen.

146
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,550
Just like we didn't know
we'd meet again here.

147
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,550
Who knows?

148
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,490
I could become the chairman's lover...

149
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,530
and control your future.

150
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,460
They say pillow talk means a lot to men.

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If I were to date the chairman,

152
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,540
and your future
were to depend on what I tell him,

153
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,670
you might regret not siding with me then.

154
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,410
Do you dream when you're awake?

155
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,780
What? I think it would be great fun.

156
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,680
This masked dance of mine is extra fun...

157
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,150
now that you're involved.

158
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,680
Are you sure you gave me the right number?

159
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,150
Yes.

160
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,580
Why won't she call back?
I texted her ages ago.

161
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,820
Give it time. She can't reply right away.

162
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,450
She has stuff to do.

163
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,290
Are you sure you're in charge
of the promotions for this sale?

164
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,730
I am!

165
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,300
The director told me himself.

166
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,900
I'm a bit worried to hear...

167
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,600
you're in charge of it all.

168
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,540
You're becoming a lot like Kyung Chae.

169
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,700
She thinks she's better than anyone,

170
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,040
and that's one person too many
for me to handle.

171
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,740
I'm awesome when I work.
It's just a rare occurrence.

172
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,650
Will she ignore my text forever?

173
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,620
Hello, madam. It's me.

174
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,990
I was waiting to hear from you.

175
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Right now?

176
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,190
Why would Mingang's prince wish to see me?

177
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,630
What is this about?

178
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,900
What? "Prince?"

179
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,970
If it weren't for your two greedy sisters,

180
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,070
you'd be your father's heir right now.

181
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,800
My gosh.

182
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,240
It has been a while since I met someone
who sees me for what I am.

183
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,550
You want the exclusive rights
to sell Helena Louise's products in Korea?

184
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,380
I heard you know
one of the executives well.

185
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,680
Just because I know them
doesn't guarantee you get the deal.

186
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,790
You just have to arrange a meeting.

187
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,760
I'll take care of it from there.

188
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,220
And also...

189
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,200
A token of my feelings. Please accept it.

190
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,870
Oh, gosh. "Your feelings?"

191
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,630
Yes, my feelings.

192
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,300
In other words, my heart.

193
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,810
Why the sudden team dinner?

194
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,920
Because we have something to celebrate.

195
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,290
You'll all faint with shock
if I tell you...

196
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,350
what I talked about with Ms. Jang today.

197
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,390
Will she help you get the exclusive deal?

198
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,030
You'll hear soon
even if you don't want to,

199
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,390
so that's enough.

200
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,630
Listen up. This is on me.

201
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,230
So order whatever you want.

202
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,870
Undo your belts and stuff.

203
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,340
I love this bar's retro interior.

204
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,110
How did you find this place?
You have great taste.

205
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,880
This bar is famous...

206
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,310
for its cheap but good-quality snacks.

207
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,980
They serve beer in iced glasses.

208
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,180
This is the perfect summer drink.

209
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,390
Shall we all have that?

210
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,690
Nice call, Director.
How did you know this was popular?

211
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,390
What's wrong with you?

212
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,600
This is my treat. I'm paying.

213
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,570
Who cares who pays
as long as we enjoy ourselves? Right?

214
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,140
- Right!
- Right!

215
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,910
Let's toast.

216
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,670
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

217
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,450
It's nice and cold.

218
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,420
Slow down. We might run out of food.

219
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,130
Order more, then. It's cheap.

220
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,630
Excuse me!

221
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,960
Can we have the menu?

222
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,070
I'm so glad we ordered this beer.
It tastes amazing.

223
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,270
You need to try this. It's so crunchy.

224
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,780
The best thing to eat with beer
is dried stuff. It's incredible.

225
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,310
Goodness.

226
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,650
It's so good.

227
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,790
Min Ji Seop is so transparent.

228
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,330
He thinks a cash envelope opens doors.

229
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,630
What will you do?

230
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,760
I'll stick to the plan.

231
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,100
Of course, Min Ji Seop
will be responsible for the disaster.

232
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,710
Director Moon is worried
our plan will cause collateral damage.

233
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,310
Life gets extra hard
if you're too upright.

234
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,910
He wants to stay at Mingang
because of his parents.

235
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,120
That means something happened,
and it involves Min Doo Sik.

236
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,620
He has no choice
but to do whatever he can.

237
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,290
He must bite and never let go.

238
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,630
He's a good man.

239
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,960
He is.

240
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,360
Don't fall for him, though.

241
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,800
What? Does that upset you?

242
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,440
It can't be helped.

243
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,310
We have a long way to go and a lot to do.

244
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,820
Father. Mother.

245
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,890
That day has come round again.

246
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,160
It comes once a year,

247
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,830
and yet...

248
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,070
I feel different each time.

249
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:10,450
Cash... Money...

250
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,520
(The Bank of Korea, 10 Dollars)

251
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,290
What are you doing, sir?

252
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,190
This is the hottest spot in our home.

253
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,090
Chanting my mantra
and looking up at that heals my soul.

254
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,300
Isn't it a joy to the eyes?

255
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,230
No landscape in the world
could be as beautiful.

256
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,330
This is more beautiful than
the most beautiful mountain.

257
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,040
Where should I look
if not ahead or behind?

258
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Look at money, and it'll make you happy

259
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,840
You seem to have something to say.

260
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,640
Well, yes.

261
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,210
I want to ask you a favor.

262
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,620
I dislike people
who ask favors for nothing in return.

263
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,920
What is it?

264
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,120
Actually, the death anniversary...

265
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,830
of my parents is coming up,
and I'd like to hold a ritual.

266
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,360
I hope you won't mind.

267
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,260
Your parents' death anniversary?

268
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,970
Aren't they alive and well in the US?

269
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,400
They are my adoptive parents.

270
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,070
My birth parents are dead.

271
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,670
Oh, dear.

272
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,310
That's why you have sad eyes.

273
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,140
Sad eyes? You look worse from behind.

274
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,810
You said he looked bright and happy.

275
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,450
When did I say that?

276
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,020
He has the face of an exam answer key...

277
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,320
with all the correct answers.

278
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,750
All the wrong answers.

279
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,320
You should show your respect.

280
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,360
A child should remember
their dead parents.

281
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,130
Give me the date,
and we'll get out of your way.

282
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,200
Are you a mayfly
that wants to mourn its father?

283
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,600
This isn't your home.
Why are you being so generous?

284
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,140
Don't be like that. He wants to
remember his parents, of all things.

285
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,380
Why don't we rent his room
and give him the master bedroom?

286
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,440
Tenant.
It's good to do your duty as a son,

287
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,050
but I don't want unknown ghosts
to visit my home.

288
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,180
Cash, money.

289
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,990
Goodness.

290
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,260
Prepare for the anniversary rite.

291
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,990
Give him a few bills,
and he'll be a happy man.

292
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,160
I see...

293
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,800
No one can say no
to an envelope full of cash.

294
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,600
The stupidest people
in the whole world are those...

295
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,670
who try to appeal to emotions
when money is all they need.

296
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,880
Is it a done deal?

297
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,540
I'm 80 percent there.

298
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,650
I'll make this sale a hit,

299
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,980
get Moon Tae Kyung out of the way,

300
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,380
and then go after Kyung Chae's spot.

301
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,620
I like your plan at last.

302
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,590
You should've done this long ago.

303
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,120
After your father dies
and your siblings argue over the shares,

304
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,790
my mom, dad, and I...

305
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,330
will give you all we own, so don't worry.

306
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,830
Isn't that too far off?

307
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,600
Who knows when Father will die?

308
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,800
Well, I'm not saying
that's what I wish for,

309
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,570
but you never know.

310
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,570
He could pass out again at any time.

311
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,240
We must have hope, is what I'm saying.

312
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,650
Is it hopeful if Father were to pass out?

313
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,050
Anyway, I want and need to watch you
become Mingang's chairman.

314
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,890
That must happen, no matter what.

315
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,930
Why did you do that?

316
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,960
There are things you should never do.

317
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,600
Don't do it ever again.

318
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,630
Do you know how worried we were?

319
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,240
I think Kyung Chae killed my mom.

320
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,940
What?

321
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,270
My birth mom.

322
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,070
I think Kyung Chae got rid of her.

323
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,610
That's nonsense.

324
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,080
Don't say anything like that again.

325
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,430
Ms. Se Ri said something odd,
and it worries me.

326
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,160
What did she say?

327
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,600
She said something about her birth mom.

328
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,000
That you killed her.

329
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,570
Talk to her
so there's no misunderstanding.

330
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,440
You don't want her
to think that of you of all people.

331
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,790
What did you say to Manager Gong?

332
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,420
Do you really think I harmed your mom?

333
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,760
You didn't?

334
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,690
You said my mom was dead.

335
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,930
That was because...

336
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,370
Yes.

337
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,800
Let's say I killed her.

338
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,570
Your mom is dead,

339
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,810
so stop whining and get a grip.

340
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,680
Don't fall for cons
about your birth mom again.

341
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,150
Stop changing the subject
and tell me what happened to my mom!

342
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,050
Did you really do something to her?

343
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,790
I won't see you again if you did.

344
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,620
I'll report you to the police.

345
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,330
How can you say that to the person
who cared for you for 20 years?

346
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,760
Exactly! Tell me the truth!

347
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,060
Stop it!

348
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,630
I'm getting sick of you now.

349
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,500
This is what you're like.

350
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,040
You wanted my shares.

351
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,710
You need my shares to become chairwoman.

352
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,110
That's why you were nice to me, right?

353
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,780
I'm tired of having to explain.

354
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,810
Think whatever you want.

355
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,930
Hello, madam. It's me.

356
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,870
I'm so sorry, Ji Seop.

357
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,170
The Helena Louise people said
they're not interested.

358
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,240
Are you sure?

359
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,380
I feel terrible.

360
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,250
That's all I have to say. Goodbye.

361
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,350
Is something wrong?

362
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,090
Did the exclusive deal fall through?

363
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,930
It did not!

364
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,560
Everything works out when I'm involved.

365
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,960
Don't try too hard
if you don't think it'll work.

366
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,300
Come up with something else while you can.

367
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,840
That would be best.

368
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,340
There are so many other things
you could do to boost sales.

369
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,810
What is wrong with you people?
Do you think that little of me?

370
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,180
I do what I set my mind on, okay?

371
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,740
You asked to see me?

372
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,740
What will you do about Se Ri?

373
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,170
What do you mean?

374
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,870
Don't you know what I mean?

375
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,680
Will you leave her as is?

376
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,510
Why do you worry now?

377
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,680
She was always like that,
so she can cause trouble until she dies?

378
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,050
Why do you suddenly care?

379
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,680
It's not sudden.

380
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,150
I'm worried she might actually
go too far if we don't do something.

381
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,920
When was that?
A girl jumped from our rooftop.

382
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
You remember, don't you?

383
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,760
Who's to say Se Ri won't do that?

384
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,230
Father!

385
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,960
She ran into the sea.

386
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,970
She can run up onto the rooftop.

387
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,500
I'll hire someone if need be.

388
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,500
Don't bother. I found someone already.

389
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,310
Leave it to Lucia.

390
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,570
To whom?

391
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,810
Why ask when you heard it the first time?

392
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,510
She shed a tear as she told me...

393
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,380
she felt sorry for Se Ri.

394
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,790
That Se Ri would come around
if she had a mother figure to help.

395
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,360
So what?
Did she offer to be the mother figure?

396
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,390
How bad do you think she felt
for her to say that?

397
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,160
She's a great woman,

398
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,860
and she can only be good for Se Ri.

399
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,470
This is good for you.

400
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,670
What does that mean?

401
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,200
You know what it means.

402
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,570
Why don't you see how sincere she is?

403
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,210
She's sincere?

404
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,210
What makes you think so?

405
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,440
Would she save two people
if she didn't care?

406
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,010
Not even you could.

407
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,150
She has earned the recognition.

408
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,980
Why do you dislike her so much?

409
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,420
She won over the old man.

410
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,460
The chairman will really let her
look after Ms. Se Ri?

411
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,230
He doesn't know what she's like.

412
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,260
What is she like?

413
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,930
You speak as if you know well.

414
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,800
Is there something I don't know about?

415
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,770
No, there isn't.

416
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,620
You never know what will happen.

417
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,190
Who knows?

418
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,120
I could become the chairman's lover...

419
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,190
and control your future.

420
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,730
That...

421
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,400
won't actually happen, will it?

422
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,940
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

423
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,110
How dare she?

424
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,380
You will be charged after the beep.

425
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,620
It's me.

426
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,320
Se Ri is home, isn't she? Put her on.

427
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,620
She's not home.

428
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,490
Where did she go?

429
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,630
The chairman called her to his office.

430
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,200
What?

431
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,670
Greet her properly. She saved your life.

432
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,040
Goodness...

433
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,550
She will teach you everything
but your schoolwork.

434
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,820
How to think, speak, and live.

435
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,290
What do you mean?

436
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,720
She's your tutor
who will teach you about life.

437
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,230
Go home.

438
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,770
How dare you interrupt
when I'm not done yet?

439
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,430
You'll leave Se Ri with her?

440
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,570
Forget it.

441
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,010
I'll hire an expert
to talk sense into her.

442
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,740
You're leaving.

443
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,110
I'll do it, Dad. I'll do whatever you say.

444
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,210
What's wrong with you?

445
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,950
I said I'd hire someone.

446
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,590
I like this auntie.

447
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,020
No, are you more of a sister?

448
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,990
What? You said you were sick of me.

449
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,760
That means you don't care
what happens to me.

450
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,800
Se Ri!

451
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,210
Don't get me wrong.

452
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,910
I acted like that to mess with my sister.

453
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,510
This is such a frustrating mess.

454
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,050
Shall we go to the rooftop?

455
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,720
You might feel better up there.

456
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,060
There's nothing to see here.

457
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,230
I have a question.

458
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,970
When we were in the sea,
you told me to live.

459
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,940
Did you mean that?

460
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,940
Yes.

461
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,240
Liar.

462
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,850
I spoke with the heart of a mom.

463
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,580
A mom? What a joke.

464
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,020
Why are you so mean to her?

465
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,420
What about you?
Why are you so accepting of her?

466
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,630
She's a good person.
Consistent and unchanging.

467
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,760
You can do anything if you have a goal.

468
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,460
Se Ri is my daughter!

469
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,600
Why do you get involved
with what I do with her?

470
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,270
She's not even yours!

471
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,640
Father!

472
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,910
You want to impress my dad, don't you?

473
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,910
What happens once you do that?

474
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,610
Do you get promoted?

475
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,310
Get a bonus?

476
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,750
Shall I help you win points with my dad?

477
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,200
I'll jump from up here.

478
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,860
Come up and save me
with the heart of a mom.

479
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,110
It's not fair.

480
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,980
I'm so angry, and it's driving me crazy!

481
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,850
Mom.

482
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,990
Mom.

483
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,190
I'm sorry, Mom.

484
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,790
I'm sorry.

485
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,800
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

486
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,680
You're sacrificing your team
to keep your position.

487
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,780
Aren't you ashamed?

488
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,750
I won't say much.
Give the job to someone else.

489
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,320
If this is what you say,
I have other plans.

490
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,120
You won't be CEO forever, okay?

491
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,420
Let him get into trouble.

492
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,490
You said you'd cheer for me whatever I do.

493
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,490
Who's that with you?
It sounded like a man's voice.

494
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,920
You'll own more of Mingang than anyone,

495
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,230
second only to the chairman.

496
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,800
