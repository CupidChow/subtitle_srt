00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,710
(Episode 71)

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,810
What's the matter, Chairman?

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,150
Who do you think I am?
How dare you serve me this?

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,150
Darn it.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,790
This filth.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,460
You all can eat this trash!

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,790
You all can eat this trash!

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,700
Eat this trash!

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,730
- Eat this trash!
- Oh my!

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,070
You expect me to eat this trash?

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,400
You vile creatures, eat it all!

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,070
Eat it all!

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,410
What do you mean, trash?

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,940
It's pan-fried beef, your favorite.

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,850
My foot! It's not beef pancakes.
It's trash!

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,580
You rotten jerks!

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,950
- You all can eat this trash!
- What's wrong, Father?

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,090
Who are you calling Father?

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,090
Who are you people?

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,760
Who are you to lock me up in here?

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,330
Where am I?

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,600
Where am I?

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,840
- Chairman, please go inside. Go on.
- Where am I?

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Goodness.

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,560
They're trying to make me eat trash.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,990
Okay. Please calm down, Chairman.

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,160
Those jerks. They all deserve to die.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,630
Who do they think
they're feeding trash to?

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,600
You'll feel better
once you take the sedative.

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,980
Who are you, by the way?

31
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,120
Why are you here?

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,820
- Aren't you going home?
- It's me, Manager Gong.

33
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,590
Don't you recognize me?

34
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,060
I don't know. I'm sleepy.
I'm going to bed.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,830
Goodness.

36
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,740
What is going on?

37
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,310
Honey, try slapping me.

38
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,050
What on earth is wrong with Father?

39
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,220
Anyone can see that's dementia.

40
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,520
Do you know anything about this?

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,060
What would I know?

42
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,420
What about you?

43
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,900
- How would I know any different?
- But how could this happen so suddenly?

44
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,560
How can a person change
like that overnight?

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,500
Dementia can come on just like that.

46
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,600
Did you think it comes
with a movie trailer first?

47
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,340
Dad has dementia?

48
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,940
Nothing's for sure yet, so don't worry.

49
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,140
How can you say that
after seeing him like this?

50
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,950
Oh, right.

51
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,920
After Father's brain surgery,

52
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,550
they said dementia was a possibility.

53
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,550
Oh, you're right.

54
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,520
That's what Doctor Kim said.

55
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,460
What are we going to do about Father?

56
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,230
This is no small matter.

57
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,430
It's already this bad. It must be serious.

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,500
I know. It's only going to get worse.

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,340
Has anything been unusual at home?
Any signs or anything?

60
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,740
No, of course not.

61
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,480
Otherwise, I would have said something.

62
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,380
How has he been at the company?

63
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,350
He's been fine at the company too.

64
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,590
He took a sedative and is sleeping.

65
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,290
He's just stressed because of you guys.

66
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,220
It's nothing serious, so don't fuss.

67
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,490
You think a little stress causes dementia?

68
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,900
Who said it's dementia? Watch your mouth!

69
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,730
Then why is he acting like that?

70
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,930
Stop denying it. We must accept reality.

71
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,570
We all saw him.

72
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,710
Don't you dare discuss things unconfirmed.
They say you can speak things into being.

73
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,840
You should all reflect on your actions.
Just think how bad things must be for him.

74
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,150
All of you children are giving him grief.
Even I would lose my mind.

75
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,250
Watch your mouths and make sure
not a word of this gets out of the house.

76
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,060
Chairman will be fine,
so stop overreacting.

77
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,430
No matter what,
I'll be the one to protect the chairman.

78
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,840
Listen to the devoted wife.
Who is she to "protect" Father?

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,700
She hasn't even been in our family
for that long.

80
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,580
What if he becomes incontinent
and needs diapers and everything?

81
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,320
(Mingang Distribution)

82
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,490
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

83
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,900
Something's wrong with my father.

84
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,870
He's showing signs of dementia.

85
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,680
We'll need a doctor's diagnosis, but...

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Dementia?

87
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,080
- It started last night.
- So suddenly? How is that possible?

88
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,090
So, what does this mean for the future?
Can he continue to serve as the chairman?

89
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,220
We'll have to wait and see.

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,030
If it really is dementia,
the chairmanship will be vacant.

91
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,100
Shouldn't we convene the board
and create an emergency system led by you?

92
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,800
It's too soon for that.

93
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,970
Besides,
he hasn't been officially diagnosed yet.

94
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,800
Still, we need to prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

95
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,510
Better than wasting time now
only to panic later.

96
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,150
Yes!

97
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,420
So things are turning out like this?

98
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,260
Okay, so if Chairman Min Doo Sik
has dementia,

99
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,390
then CEO Min will take over,

100
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,200
and if she eventually becomes
the chairwoman?

101
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,870
This is the chance of a lifetime for me.

102
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,570
- I said I'm going home!
- Chairman!

103
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,740
- Come on.
- Gosh.

104
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,340
But this is your house, Father.
Where are you trying to go?

105
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,410
Let go of me, you witch!

106
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,650
- This is driving me crazy!
- Darn it.

107
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,480
I'm telling you, this is your house!

108
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,050
Chairman!

109
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,720
Look, I have to go home.
This isn't my house, is it?

110
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,990
Please let me go home, ma'am.

111
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,790
Ma'am?
Father, it's me, your daughter-in-law.

112
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,830
Let go! I said I have to go home!

113
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,200
Ma'am, I'm telling you, I have to go home.

114
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,000
Dad, what's wrong?
Where are you trying to go?

115
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,370
Please calm down.
This is your home, Chairman.

116
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,010
I want to go home. Let me go home.
Send me home. Ma'am, please?

117
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,710
Dad, I'm telling you, this is your house.
Snap out of it!

118
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,080
- Darn it.
- Chairman.

119
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,920
I can't get through to him at all. Gosh!

120
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,280
- Please just let me go home.
- Dad.

121
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,350
Hey, honey.

122
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,720
How's Father doing?

123
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,420
What do you think?
It's absolute chaos here.

124
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,990
He packed up his clothes,

125
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,860
and now he's trying to run away from home.

126
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,560
What did you say?

127
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,670
But why on earth is he doing that?
What's gotten into him?

128
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,710
What's going on?

129
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,080
I have no idea! Why is he doing this?

130
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,320
He's completely lost his mind. My gosh.

131
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,450
Oh my!

132
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,790
Honey, what's wrong?

133
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,090
My head!

134
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,530
Your father hit me.

135
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,030
Oh, for crying out loud.

136
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,400
Why would he hit you on the head?
What if your empty head gets even emptier?

137
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,040
And what is that woman up to?

138
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Isn't she home?

139
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,740
Can you believe she went out
at a time like this?

140
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,240
Is it that serious?

141
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,940
It appears to be.

142
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,980
Hiding his medical appointments
is suspicious enough,

143
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,750
but wouldn't it be best to confirm
with his personal doctor?

144
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,460
His doctor is a longtime friend of Min's,
and he's also indebted to him.

145
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,460
So, he's not going to tell us the truth.

146
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,290
Chairman Min likely told him
to keep quiet.

147
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,200
Then what do we do?

148
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,370
If Min Doo Sik is really like this,
what happens to our plan?

149
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,640
If it really is dementia,

150
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,610
the entire plan falls apart.

151
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,310
That's ridiculous!
After all we've done to get this far.

152
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,280
You're saying it all ends for nothing?

153
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,350
If it's dementia,
we can't even get him to stand in court,

154
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,250
and as he can't legally give his shares,
it'll be hard to bring down Mingang.

155
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,360
That man really is my worst enemy.

156
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,260
Dementia? Why now, of all times?

157
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,030
You heard from Kyung Chae, right?

158
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Heard what?

159
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,400
Come on.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

160
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,800
I should be asking you the same thing.

161
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,340
You're not giving me any context.

162
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,440
If, by some chance, Father steps down
as chairman because of dementia,

163
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,910
you seem to think it'll be
Min Kyung Chae's world.

164
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,710
That's where you're wrong.

165
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,050
My brother and I won't just stand by
and let that happen.

166
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,750
If we children divide Father's shares
and exercise our voting rights,

167
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,390
it won't be easy for Kyung Chae
to become the chairwoman.

168
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,060
On top of that,
my sister-in-law and her family...

169
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,530
will probably give their shares
to my brother.

170
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,560
Things will get more complicated then.

171
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,930
If you want to look at it that way,
the CEO has more friendly shares.

172
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,740
You're well aware of which board members
are on the CEO's side,

173
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,440
and on top of that, she has me.

174
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,980
So, does that mean...

175
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,840
you'll stick with my sister
to the very end?

176
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,510
I don't know what the chairman's
current condition is,

177
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,750
but don't you think you're getting
way ahead of yourself?

178
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,020
The CEO is beside herself with worry
over the chairman right now.

179
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,630
And you expect me to believe that?

180
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,690
Whether you believe it or not
is up to you,

181
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,200
but that's a fact.

182
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,410
I heard you haven't eaten all day.

183
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,980
You need to eat.

184
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,880
You can't take medicine
on an empty stomach.

185
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,850
Just five spoonfuls. Please?

186
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,020
Then I won't ask you to eat anymore.

187
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,950
Come on.

188
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,860
I don't want to eat.

189
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,840
Are you okay?

190
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,870
Dad, seriously, what's gotten into you?

191
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,210
I'm fine, so don't yell.

192
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,240
You'll just startle him and make it worse.

193
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,190
Could he really have dementia?

194
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,700
Slow down. You can even choke on water.

195
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,170
What were you saying on the phone earlier?
What happened to your father-in-law?

196
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,940
I must have misheard you, right?
I mean, dementia...

197
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,440
It's not something that just happens
to anyone overnight.

198
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,950
You heard me right.
Father-in-law has lost his mind.

199
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,450
What in the world are you babbling about?

200
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,920
- So your father-in-law has dementia?
- That's what I'm saying.

201
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,390
Chairman Min Doo Sik, the living legend
of the Korean distribution industry?

202
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,760
I'm telling you, yes!

203
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,360
The man who started from scratch
and conquered the distribution industry?

204
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,870
That's right!

205
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,440
My goodness, what a bolt out of the blue.

206
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,710
Wait, so does this mean he'll never be
in his right mind again?

207
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,210
Pretty much.

208
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,880
He called me "ma'am." Can you believe it?

209
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,280
- He asked me to take him home.
- My goodness!

210
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,680
Soon, he'll be playing with his own poop
like it's clay.

211
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,850
Wait, if your father-in-law has dementia,
who becomes the next chairman?

212
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,090
Does your older sister-in-law
get to take over?

213
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,560
Well, probably. It's not like my husband
is even in the running.

214
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,770
He's just no help at all, is he?
What bad timing for him to lose it.

215
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,300
Ji Seop was just reinstated,
and now he decides to lose it?

216
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,770
Good grief.

217
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,890
You saw
the chairman's scans earlier, right?

218
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,500
He's been in that state since the surgery.

219
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,370
So you're saying the dementia symptoms
are no coincidence?

220
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,970
That's why I warned him...

221
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,470
to be careful.

222
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,040
Then there's no room for doubt.

223
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,310
Please issue a medical certificate.

224
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,950
A medical certificate might be difficult,

225
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,080
but I can write up my medical opinion.

226
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,190
But is that really what's important
right now?

227
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,820
The patient is what matters,
not some piece of paper...

228
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,260
It's important to us.

229
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,260
The chairman isn't just anybody.

230
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,430
With him collapsing so suddenly,
the family is extremely worried.

231
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,270
Everyone needs to know
exactly what my father's condition is.

232
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,170
And the company is bound to notice
the chairman's absence,

233
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,970
so we need to be prepared, don't we?

234
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,880
They say karma is slow, but sure.
He's just getting what he deserves.

235
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,380
If the chairman has dementia,

236
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,980
this isn't the justice I wanted.

237
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,680
What have we been fighting for?

238
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,150
To put Chairman Min Doo Sik on trial...

239
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,890
and make him face real consequences.

240
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,720
For him to be declared legally incompetent
and escape legal punishment...

241
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,090
I don't want that either.

242
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,100
There's definitely something else
going on here.

243
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,400
It can't have progressed this quickly.

244
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,270
You can never tell
what that man is thinking.

245
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,370
What if, by some chance,

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,810
he has some other motive?

247
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,010
Has anything happened recently...

248
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,650
that could have affected
Chairman Min Doo Sik's state of mind?

249
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,220
From what I've heard, he's been stewing
over his children lately, but that's all.

250
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,620
Oh, wait!

251
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,290
Do you know how Min Kyung Chae
dealt with Min Soo Jung's birth mother?

252
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,330
Dealt with her?

253
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,230
She had her thrown
into a lockdown nursing home,

254
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,000
no different than a mental asylum,
and left her there to die.

255
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,870
According to Lucia,
Min Doo Sik was furious when he found out.

256
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,500
Hold on. So then,

257
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,810
you're saying Chairman Min Doo Sik
is disappointed in Min Kyung Chae?

258
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,610
To see his eldest daughter's true colors,
the one who's most like him...

259
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,150
It's no wonder he's disappointed.

260
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,630
That's how it is with parents.

261
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,560
One moment, you're glad your child
takes after you,

262
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,730
and then you're horrified
for the very same reason.

263
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,400
Even a cold-blooded man
like Min Doo Sik...

264
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,270
is shocked to see his child's true colors.

265
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,480
Then could he use this as an excuse
to hand the company to another child?

266
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,710
Those aren't exactly
appealing options either.

267
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,580
As you know, Min Soo Jung
wasn't his legal wife's daughter,

268
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,350
so it'd be hard for her to build support
within the company.

269
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,420
And don't even get me started
on Min Ji Seop.

270
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,290
Then whether he likes it or not,

271
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,930
the only heir left is CEO Min Kyung Chae.

272
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,300
What on earth is he planning?

273
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,340
Chairman. You can't just starve yourself
all day.

274
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,240
You'll waste away.

275
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,380
Chairman, I know you can't think
or remember anything right now.

276
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,650
But you can't just lose your grip
like this.

277
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,230
Get out! How dare you come in here!

278
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,100
Even when you're not in your right mind,
why do you hate me so much?

279
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,070
They say the person you hate the most
when you've lost your mind...

280
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,310
is the one you cherished the most
when you were sane.

281
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,510
You rotten witch.
You'll be the death of your own father.

282
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,780
You were always so proud
that I was the one most like you.

283
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,290
I've handled business and people
just as you taught me.

284
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,020
So why are you acting like this now?

285
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,090
You told me to discard people
once they were no longer useful.

286
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,560
Father, if you keep this up,
you'll no longer be of any use to me.

287
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,100
And you know what happens after that,
don't you?

288
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,170
Stop it, can't you?
Even in his state, he can feel your hate.

289
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,300
You should only say kind things to him
as it is.

290
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,970
Aren't you the devoted one?

291
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,770
Well, I guess...

292
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,440
you need some justification to stay here,
don't you?

293
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,610
What did you just say?

294
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,120
If you want to stay here as his caregiver,
you'd better work hard.

295
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,160
I met with Doctor Kim today.

296
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,990
He confirmed Father has dementia.

297
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,330
And he said it's only going to get worse.

298
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,100
How could he make a diagnosis like that...

299
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,230
without even seeing the patient?

300
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,700
Father secretly went to the hospital
not too long ago,

301
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,770
and he had a brain scan
and was examined for dementia.

302
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,740
This is the doctor's written opinion.

303
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,840
So it's real.

304
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,940
Then there's no denying it.

305
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,750
Oh, my. What are we going to do?

306
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,750
So, all of you, watch your mouths.

307
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,850
What happens in this house
stays in this house.

308
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,520
You think we can just keep this quiet?

309
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,290
People have a right to know.

310
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,490
What, you want me to post it
on the company intranet?

311
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,860
If so, the stock price will drop.
Will you take responsibility for that?

312
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,270
How am I supposed to take responsibility
for that?

313
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,540
That's why I'm telling everyone
to keep their mouths shut.

314
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,440
If anyone breathes a word of this,
I won't let them get away with it.

315
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,580
But look at her now.
She's acting like she owns the place.

316
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,360
The problem is Ms. Se Ri.

317
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,860
She hasn't spoken to you lately, has she?

318
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,030
I have a feeling
Lucia is putting her up to it.

319
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,710
Ja Kyung, come out here a minute.

320
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,480
Are you going somewhere?

321
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,450
Just stepping out for a bit.

322
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,120
What about Father?

323
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,090
- You're here, aren't you?
- You want me to watch Father?

324
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,660
Well, who else is there?

325
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Whatever it is, can it be that important?

326
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,500
Not when Father's in this condition.

327
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,500
This isn't the time to be going out.

328
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,570
It's urgent and important.

329
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,710
Manager Gong will be back from the store,
and Se Ri is here too.

330
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,710
What if he tries to run away
from home again like last time?

331
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,490
There. That should do it, right?

332
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,200
Gosh, you're ruining my whole look.
What is this?

333
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,330
Do you have any idea how expensive
this outfit is?

334
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,540
Keep a close eye on your father.

335
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,100
(Mingang Distribution)

336
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:02,070
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

337
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,150
It suits you.

338
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,250
Lawyer Kim, what brings you here?

339
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,620
I just had a feeling you'd be here.

340
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,190
I guess we're on the same wavelength.

341
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,590
It's true. The chairman has dementia.

342
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,090
I confirmed it with his primary doctor.

343
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,330
I see. That's good for us.

344
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,800
You need to hurry
and take over as chairman.

345
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,070
There are more than a few people
who will try to stand in your way.

346
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,240
What do you mean?

347
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,210
I'm talking about the portrait that was
delivered to your office.

348
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,480
You see,
I've seen it somewhere else before.

349
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,750
Where did you see it?

350
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,520
In Stella Jang's room.

351
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,650
In Madam Jang's room?

352
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,220
She denied it,
so there was no way to confirm,

353
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,220
but I'm positive I saw it there.

354
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,060
That's impossible.

355
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,560
How could it have been there?

356
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,500
Honey, you won't believe the mess I'm in.

357
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,000
What are you talking about?

358
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,140
Lucia left me to look after Father
and went out.

359
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,580
What?

360
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,810
Wait, she left Father with you?

361
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,610
What are you going to do
if he causes a scene again?

362
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,950
I'm so nervous.

363
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,290
He's dead quiet for now.

364
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,460
But who knows
when he'll have another episode?

365
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,790
What about Manager Gong?

366
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,560
She's at the supermarket.
She said she'd be back soon, but is late.

367
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,600
So, honey,

368
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,430
you should hurry home.

369
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,270
Can't you leave work early?

370
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,010
What's wrong, Father?

371
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,250
Oh, wait!
Father, hold on! What are you doing?

372
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,620
- What's gotten into you, Chairman?
- Gosh, help me!

373
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,250
Calm down! What's wrong?

374
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,590
- Dad, what's wrong now?
- Chairman!

375
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,390
- I want to go home.
- What's wrong with you, Chairman?

376
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,860
- Gosh, Chairman.
- Please let me go home.

377
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,060
- Dad!
- What's wrong, sir?

378
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,700
- Wait! Goodness.
- I'm leaving. I'm going home.

379
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,860
But this is your home, Chairman.

380
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,530
(Mingang Distribution)

381
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,210
So, Lawyer Kim, you think...

382
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,610
that Madam Jang is a relative
of the victim?

383
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,050
It's just a hunch,
so I can't say for sure.

384
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,280
That's why I told you to act confident
in front of Stella Jang for now.

385
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,150
Because it seems she's hoping
that painting will rattle you.

386
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,660
But why on earth?

387
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,090
Even if Madam Jang is tied to that person,
why would she do that to me?

388
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,200
But that's not what's important now.
Think about it carefully.

389
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,370
The owner of that painting is Stella Jang,

390
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,210
the one who moved it was Moon Tae Kyung,
and the one closest to both of them is...

391
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,910
Jung Lucia.

392
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,710
Basically, the three of them are one team.

393
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,580
Assuming that's the case,

394
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,780
the chairman's recent illness
will be a godsend for you.

395
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,750
What can a legally incompetent person do?
They have no legal standing.

396
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,760
The generation shift you mentioned
will just happen that much faster.

397
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,290
Once you're in the chairman's seat,
you can handle those three as you wish.

398
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,830
In fact,

399
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,500
if you become the chairman,

400
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,600
those three might just leave on their own.

401
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,380
What are you all doing
in a room without its owner?

402
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,180
Flowers? At a time like this?

403
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,250
You sure seem relaxed.

404
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,090
The chairman will be fine and come back,
so I have to maintain his room.

405
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,190
If you have no business here,
you can all leave.

406
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,920
Are you hurt anywhere?

407
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,920
Don't even ask.

408
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,290
I almost threw out my back.

409
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,490
I can't believe how strong he is!

410
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,230
Gosh, this is a disaster.
What are we going to do?

411
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,100
You're going through so much trouble.

412
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,370
Honey, does your father have to stay
at home?

413
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,070
What's that supposed to mean?

414
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,140
I mean, can't we send him to a facility?
One of those places for dementia patients?

415
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,140
I'm telling you, this is killing me.

416
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,510
Gosh.

417
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,580
I want to go home. Please let me go home.

418
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,160
Chairman, what's wrong?
Look at me. Do you know who I am?

419
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,290
Do you recognize me?

420
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,330
I want to go home. Please?
I want to go to my house.

421
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,500
Please let me go, ma'am.

422
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,400
Chairman, please calm down
and pull yourself together.

423
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,110
I said I want to go home.
Ma'am, please, just this once.

424
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,160
Yes, Nurse Jung, it's me.

425
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,830
I heard about Jo Pil Doo's accident.

426
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,860
You must be so heartbroken.

427
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,030
I'm sure he's in a better place.

428
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,670
Thank you. I hope so.

429
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,240
Actually, I was hoping I could ask
for a favor.

430
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,740
I heard that Chairman Min Doo Sik
was diagnosed with dementia...

431
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,470
from his doctor there.

432
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,380
Could you look into the details for me?

433
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,610
There's just something about it
that doesn't sit right with me.

434
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,490
You said this back then, didn't you?

435
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,630
That if you were to become the chairman,

436
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,800
you wanted me
to give you all of my shares.

437
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,830
But I believe I mentioned
there was a condition?

438
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,670
That's right. That's how you make a deal.

439
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,740
I'll side with you and get you everything.

440
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,840
In return,

441
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,780
on the day you become chairman,

442
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,550
- you will make me CEO.
- But at Mingang,

443
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,720
we don't make anyone CEO
unless they're part of the family.

444
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,590
Are you saying, Lawyer Kim...

445
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,700
You'd be getting both.

446
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,700
A spouse...

447
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,830
and a loyal subordinate.

448
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,070
No matter what it takes,

449
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,740
- are you sure you can make me chairman?
- Of course.

450
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,010
To do that,

451
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,110
you can't keep the chairman at home.

452
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,020
If I don't keep him at home?

453
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,190
Send him to a nursing home.

454
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,460
That's the only way you'll have a reason
to kick Lucia out of the house.

455
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,230
If the chairman stays at home,

456
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,960
that woman will use taking care of him
as an excuse to stick around.

457
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,700
That's true.

458
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,100
Why didn't I think of that?

459
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,700
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

460
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,980
We have to carry out our plan
without anyone knowing.

461
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,480
Understood. Our plan.

462
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,390
What if he tries to find the nursing home
where they can stash Min Doo Sik?

463
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,690
Once I become chairman
and get that woman, Lucia, out of there,

464
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,860
it'll be the perfect happy ending.

465
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,030
While you're still lucid,
you should take the easy way out.

466
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,930
That's the only way to escape
the tragic fate that awaits you.
