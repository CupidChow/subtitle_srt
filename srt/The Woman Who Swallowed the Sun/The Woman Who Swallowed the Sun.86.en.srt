1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,510
Let go of me, you punks!

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,540
Let go!

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,250
Where are you taking me this time?

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,320
It'd be in your best interest
to come quietly.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,020
If you make a scene, you'll get hurt.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,820
Do you really think
you'll get away with this?

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,750
Let's just go quietly.

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,960
- See that he gets there safely.
- Yes, sir!

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,890
You punk! Get your hands off me!

10
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,330
You punk!

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,010
You're going to lock me up in here,
is that it?

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,880
You jerk. I'll just...

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,520
Consider this a time for reflection.

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,350
Or a chance to look back on your life.

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,090
Reflecting on the life you've lived
with regret and repentance...

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,430
might be a meaningful way
to spend your time.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,430
I regret entrusting an important position
to a scumbag like you,

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,400
and I'll spend my time repenting
for ever trusting you.

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,230
Well, that's not a bad place to start.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,940
Who put you up to this? Was it Kyung Chae?

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,870
If you two cooked this up together...

22
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,470
That's not important.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,110
What's important is that from now on,

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,750
you're going to lose the chairmanship
of Mingang Distribution.

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,850
You think I'm going to let you
get away with this?

26
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,420
The day I get out of here,
you're all dead.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,090
That's not going to happen.

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,890
You'll live out
the rest of your days here,

29
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,260
and this is where you'll die.

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,760
What did you say?

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,800
You punk! Let me go!

32
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,060
Let go!

33
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,170
Kim Sun Jae, get back here!

34
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,900
Stop right there!

35
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,640
Get back here, you punk!

36
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,140
Do you think I'll let you
get away with this?

37
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,840
Stop, you punk!

38
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,910
You punk! Let me go!

39
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,820
The chairman is late tonight.

40
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,690
You haven't heard from him, have you?

41
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,590
He didn't say anything.

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,230
Besides, I'd think you'd know his schedule
better than anyone, Ms. Kyung Chae.

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,160
Manager Gong has a point.

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,670
The person Father trusts the most
in this family ought to know.

45
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,340
What would the people he's cast aside
possibly know?

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,010
Did you do something to upset him?

47
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,640
Could it be about changing his will?

48
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,380
Are you suggesting it's my fault
the chairman is late and hasn't called?

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,790
Come on. Not this again.
Dad's allowed to have a private life.

50
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,220
He can be late sometimes.

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,090
He's right, you know.

52
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,030
I've found that men have a private life
that women don't know about.

53
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,300
Looks like he'll be late,
so let's start to eat.

54
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,270
I have documents to review anyway.

55
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,340
- Still, we can't. The chairman...
- Let's just start to eat.

56
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,770
You should eat something.
I heard you skipped lunch.

57
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,260
What's going on?

58
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,830
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

59
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,670
Yes?

60
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,180
It seems the chairman isn't coming home.
Should I lock up for the night?

61
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,050
He's not one to stay out all night
without calling.

62
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,820
Has this ever happened before?

63
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,420
Yes, quite often before you were married.

64
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,390
Really?

65
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,090
Leave the main gate unlocked.
He might still come home late.

66
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,700
What did you just say?

67
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,930
You locked up my father?

68
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,600
So that's why
he didn't come home last night...

69
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,270
I told you...

70
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,570
that I'd do whatever it took
to make you the acting chairman.

71
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,840
But you didn't have to do it like this.

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,880
The means don't matter. Only the results.

73
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,110
As long as he's there,
the chairman can't change the will or...

74
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,180
destroy it.

75
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720
But to be imprisoned like this...

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,820
means he was dragged off
without knowing where.

77
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,420
Don't be a hypocrite.

78
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,590
You tried to have him put away
for dementia.

79
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,100
That was because I really thought
he had dementia.

80
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,170
The nursing home was a last resort,

81
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,970
but this is completely different!

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,240
Fine. Should I let the chairman go?

83
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,310
If I do, he'll just change the will,

84
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,980
and you'll never get the chairmanship.

85
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,050
You punks...

86
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,780
Hey! You punks, open this door!

87
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,420
Do you have any idea who I am?

88
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,960
I'm Min Doo Sik!

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,590
The chairman of Mingang Distribution,
Min Doo Sik!

90
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,260
You think I'll let you get away with this?

91
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,100
If you want to live, open this door!

92
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,810
Gosh, you're loud, you old geezer.

93
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,210
You punks.

94
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,740
When I get out of here,
you're all going to pay.

95
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,880
Who do you think you're messing with!

96
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,350
Just you wait.

97
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,290
I'll make you regret this
for the rest of your lives.

98
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,260
Looks like the old geezer's sleep-deprived
and talking nonsense.

99
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,760
Let's let him get
a few more hours of rest.

100
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,790
Good idea.

101
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
You punks...

102
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,900
What do you think you're doing?

103
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,270
Let go!

104
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,070
What do you think you're doing?

105
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,500
Let go of me!

106
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,050
What did you give me?

107
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,290
I said, what kind of drug is this?

108
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,820
You punks, I'll just...

109
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,080
If you don't care about the chairmanship,

110
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,520
then I'll let him go right this second.

111
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,590
And then there's Lucia.

112
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,360
She started at Mingang with nothing
and clawed her way up to become the CEO.

113
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,430
The chairman is just itching
to give her more power.

114
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,240
Just look at your own situation.

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,770
You've been forced out of the company
and you're jobless.

116
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,140
You're in no position to worry about him.

117
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,450
But still...

118
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,450
I have to...

119
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,690
see for myself.

120
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,970
What's wrong with him?

121
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,510
- Is he sick or something?
- He's just out from a sleeping pill.

122
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,850
I had no idea you'd go this far.

123
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,090
(CEO Jung Lucia)

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Hello?

125
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,300
(Mingang Distribution)

126
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,560
What's going on?

127
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,970
Your father didn't come home last night.

128
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,040
Why is this about?

129
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,680
She called us here because
Father stayed out all night.

130
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,180
Gosh, I thought it was something serious.

131
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,110
Try calling him then.

132
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,680
I can't reach him. His phone is off.

133
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,050
Does anyone have any idea what happened?

134
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,690
Disappearing is my father's specialty.

135
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,690
After his brain surgery,
he switched hospitals without a word.

136
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,490
He really freaked us out.

137
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,700
And honestly,
so what if he stays out for one night?

138
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,630
I was thinking it was a big deal.

139
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,800
Shouldn't you handle this yourself
instead of talking to us?

140
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,470
Strictly speaking, it's a matter
between you and your husband.

141
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,880
Exactly! It's a marital problem!

142
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,610
Speaking of which,
is there trouble between you two?

143
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,510
There's always a reason
when our father does something like this.

144
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,160
Anyone who sees you might think
you're off to have an affair.

145
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,990
You got all gussied up
just to go to the office.

146
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,760
My lovely wife.
I'm a non-executive director.

147
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,060
I must look the part.

148
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,660
Go to the meeting and come straight home.

149
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,000
You know what'll happen
if you stray, right?

150
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,670
What kind of crazy talk is that?
Get sidetracked? Me?

151
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,010
Am I a leaky bucket?

152
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,110
That woman from our in-laws' wedding,
that "Stainless" woman, or whatever,

153
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,880
I'm telling you not to meet up with her
and get all flirty.

154
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,380
It's not Stainless, it's Stella.
Madam Stella.

155
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,390
That Stella woman is
also a non-executive director, isn't she?

156
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,060
Don't you two dare
get up to anything funny.

157
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,820
Up to anything? What?
You have a vulgar mind!

158
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
We’re not in that kind of relationship.

159
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,070
"We?" Since when are you
and that woman a "we?"

160
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a collective term.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Like "our customers," "our citizens,"
"our people."

162
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,240
And besides, she's not just some "woman."
She's Madam Stella.

163
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,510
Madam, my foot!

164
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,580
Just remember that the only "we"
that includes you, Oh Pan Sool,

165
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,610
is me, Yang Mal Sook. Don't you forget it.

166
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,380
Or else I'll have my way,
you handsome old geezer.

167
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,950
No violence now, you sexy old thing.

168
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,650
Violence is forbidden!

169
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Knock, knock.

170
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
Madam Stella. Knock, knock.

171
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,230
Might I be so bold as to ask
what the rest of your schedule is today?

172
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,440
I told you to call me just Stella.
That way, I can call you Pan Sool.

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,140
I'd be too embarrassed.

174
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,170
Well then... Ms. Stella.
I mean, just Stella.

175
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,640
The meeting's over,
so where are we off to now?

176
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,350
My schedule is clear.
How about you, Pan Sool?

177
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,720
I am also very free.

178
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,290
Then would you like to get
a cup of tea with me?

179
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,920
Sounds great.

180
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,060
In fact, let's go all out
and have ten cups.

181
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,090
I know a place with great cappuccinos.

182
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,860
A little tea time just for the two of us,
shall we say?

183
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,800
Just the two of us in the whole nation?

184
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,270
Yes, just the two of us.

185
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,940
That's a killer wink.

186
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,580
All right, let's go.

187
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,180
All right, coming through!
Make way for Madam Stella!

188
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,860
The ambiance is nice, the coffee's great,

189
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,800
and the company is even better.

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,400
And having you here, Stella,
makes it the best.

191
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,670
Maybe it's because I'm all alone,
with no husband or children,

192
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,380
but when I meet
someone wonderful like you,

193
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,080
you don't feel like a stranger at all.

194
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,380
Does that mean...

195
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,380
that I'm a special special person?

196
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,850
My heart's about to pound
right out of my chest.

197
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,420
It's pounding like this.

198
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,330
That reminds me.

199
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,330
Are you planning to keep your stake
in Mingang Distribution?

200
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,700
It's not like holding it is going
to make you rich.

201
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,100
My daughter and son-in-law told me
to hold onto it for dear life.

202
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,340
I sold my Mingang stake,

203
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,640
invested elsewhere, and made a killing.

204
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,950
A killing, you say?

205
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,710
Just how much did you make?

206
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,850
Could you tell me specifically?
Like, down to the exact cent?

207
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,360
I'll go anywhere you need me.

208
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
Anywhere.

209
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,100
I'm so enchanted
I can't hear a single word.

210
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,370
Don't stop talking.

211
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,480
So sweet...

212
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,680
Your whispering tickles.

213
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,780
So does this mean Oh Pan Sool...

214
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,250
is going to entrust his Mingang stake
to you?

215
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,420
I've laid the bait,
but there's no telling if he'll take it.

216
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,600
Forget that. What's this
about Min Doo Sik not returning home?

217
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,070
I know, right? The fact
that we can't reach him all day...

218
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,430
is bothering me.

219
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,870
What's with him all of a sudden?

220
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,410
He's done so many terrible things
that maybe the devil came to collect?

221
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,810
Right before he changes the will...

222
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,610
and has found out about
Kim Sun Jae's double-entry ledger,

223
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,410
he just went off the grid.
Don't you find it strange?

224
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,490
The timing is suspicious, I'll admit.
Everything's fine, then suddenly this.

225
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,260
If Chairman Min Doo Sik doesn't show up,

226
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,030
Min Kyung Chae or Kim Sun Jae
has something to do with it.

227
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,170
Part of me hopes he was dragged off
to be held captive until he dies.

228
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,270
But if that happened,
it would interfere with our plans.

229
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,800
So, like it or not,
we have to find Min Doo Sik.

230
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,780
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

231
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,010
Charges may apply after the beep.

232
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,790
The chairman still hasn't come home.

233
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,760
Do you happen to know where he is?

234
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,200
Why are you asking me?

235
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,440
Shouldn't his precious little wifey
know that?

236
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,810
If you know something
and are just playing dumb,

237
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,940
I won't let it slide.

238
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,210
Hey.

239
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,810
I mean, Stepmother.

240
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,520
You must feel great after kicking me out
of the company.

241
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,750
Can you even spare a thought for Father?

242
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,560
I kicked you out of the company
because you had it coming.

243
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,990
If you feel you were wronged,

244
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,390
you should look
at what you did to earn it.

245
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,260
Besides, who will take care
of the chairman if not me?

246
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,030
Especially since his so-called children
are worse than strangers.

247
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,640
And who do you think made us that way?

248
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,540
Who drove a wedge between us
and pitted us against each other?

249
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,780
I'll ask you one more time.

250
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,150
You don't know where the chairman is?

251
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,210
I believe I already told you.

252
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,380
I said I don't know.

253
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,170
The chairman is unreachable.

254
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,010
Do you happen to know where he is?

255
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,110
Unreachable?

256
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,610
What? How did that happen?

257
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,710
So you didn't know?

258
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,080
Of course. How could I possibly know?

259
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,320
What would a nobody like me know?

260
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,720
I've been completely cut loose.

261
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,620
As you well know,

262
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,460
I've been living with my tail
between my legs lately.

263
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,200
He probably just went off somewhere
to get some fresh air.

264
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,600
Our dear CEO has so much to worry about.

265
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Aren't you getting on?

266
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,750
Then I'll go ahead.

267
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,460
(Mingang Distribution)

268
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Hey.

269
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,200
There's something suspicious
about Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae.

270
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,070
I met with Madam Jang yesterday,
and we talked about the same thing.

271
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,010
You don't think...

272
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,210
they've locked Chairman Min up
somewhere, do you?

273
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,910
If it were to stop him
from changing his will,

274
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,920
it's a possibility.

275
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,950
Besides, if Kim Sun Jae's
double-entry ledger was found out,

276
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,650
he'd be completely cornered.

277
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,260
Where on earth could they
have hidden Chairman Min?

278
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,190
If they want to make sure
he's never found,

279
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,600
it won't be anywhere nearby.

280
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,830
Our only option is
to trace Chairman Min's last movements.

281
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,870
The last footage of the chairman leaving,

282
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,380
and all the CCTV footage
in front of the company.

283
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,540
The footage should still be there
since it was a few days ago.

284
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,680
The chairman leaving the building...

285
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,150
Here it is.

286
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,460
It shows he dismissed his aides
and left work by himself.

287
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,160
What about the CCTV cameras out front?

288
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,030
We can confirm that the chairman
got in his car and drove off.

289
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,970
Wait, are you saying...

290
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,600
he left in the car
driven by his chauffeur, Mr. Kim?

291
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,040
I assume so.

292
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,240
It's caught in the camera's blind spot,

293
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,910
so I can't confirm who the driver is.

294
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,350
So there's no proof
that Mr. Kim was the one driving?

295
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,020
Exactly. We can't know for sure.

296
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,430
So it might not have been Mr. Kim driving,

297
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,030
but someone else was behind the wheel.

298
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,170
To pull that off, they'd have to know
the CCTV camera's blind spot well,

299
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,070
which ultimately means
it was an inside job.

300
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,450
Is it true no one's heard from Dad yet?

301
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,220
You think someone would know
where he is and not say anything?

302
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,290
It's just so weird.
Why would Dad just disappear?

303
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,220
Does this make any sense at all?

304
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,260
Your father doesn't have
much common sense.

305
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,860
Remember that whole dementia incident?

306
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,030
Would a sensible person act like that?
Wouldn't you agree, Manager Gong?

307
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,270
I couldn't say.

308
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,240
That's because you and Ji Seop
put him through so much.

309
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,800
Dad had no choice but to act that way.

310
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,140
Se Ri, we only let it slide
because he's family.

311
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,510
But your father is a strange man.

312
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,250
No matter how strange he is,
how could he vanish overnight like this?

313
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,990
Come on, he's probably just
cooling his head off somewhere nice.

314
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,690
It's not like he's short
on money or anything.

315
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,390
He's probably enjoying fine dining
with a killer view.

316
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,730
You’ll see. I’m right about this.

317
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,520
You expect me to eat this dog food?

318
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,020
You eat this crap!

319
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,060
Darn it!

320
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
These punks!

321
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,230
Kyung Chae doesn't know
where Dad is either?

322
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,240
How would she know?

323
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,340
If anyone were to know,
it would be his wife.

324
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,540
That's true.

325
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,910
A wife should know what's going on
with her husband.

326
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,250
But your stepmother looked like
she was completely in the dark.

327
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,850
I guess their marriage is on the rocks?

328
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,320
Maybe that's why he left home.

329
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,720
Why? Where are you going?

330
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,560
I'm going to go ask Kyung Chae myself.

331
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,190
Come on. She hasn't slept a wink in days.

332
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,330
She just finally managed
to get some sleep.

333
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,600
Please, just let her be.

334
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,240
I think she's had insomnia
ever since she lost her job.

335
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,840
She went from being the boss
to nothing overnight.

336
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,800
How did you get here?

337
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Why are you so surprised?

338
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,110
What? You look like you've seen a ghost.

339
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,810
This wasn't me.

340
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,480
I didn't even know you were there, Father.
It was Lawyer Kim...

341
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,820
If you knew Lawyer Kim locked me in there,

342
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,220
how could you, my own daughter,
pretend you didn't know?

343
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,950
I was going to let you out anyway.

344
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,960
You're the one who tried
to throw me into a nursing home...

345
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,160
the minute you thought I'd lost my mind.

346
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,360
And now you expect me to believe that?

347
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,730
Do you think
I'll just let you get away with this?

348
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,570
You were probably hoping
I'd just die locked up in there.

349
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,900
When I die, I'm not going down alone.

350
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,640
I'm taking you with me.

351
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Just you watch.

352
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,910
I can't speak for the others,

353
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,580
but I'm definitely taking you down
with me.

354
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
Where are you going?

355
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
Father.

356
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,110
You viper.

357
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,540
How dare you call me Father?

358
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,110
Why?

359
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,480
Did you come to gawk
at the pathetic state your father is in?

360
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,450
Did you come to see
if I was dead or alive?

361
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,990
And you call yourself my daughter?

362
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,130
Aren't you afraid of what will come?

363
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,830
The second I get out of here,
you're out of my house.

364
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,240
I will never let you get away with this!

365
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,240
You brought this all on yourself.

366
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,280
You deceived and tested your children.

367
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,980
Why couldn't you have just acted
like a father in the first place?

368
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,980
This is exactly why I was trying
to change my will.

369
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,020
If you become the chairman and take over
Mingang as the will states,

370
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,990
I've finally seen what a disaster
this company would become.

371
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,130
Over my dead body...

372
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,300
will you ever own Mingang.

373
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,000
I will never let you
have the chairman's seat.

374
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,830
Go ahead and try.

375
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,440
But that's assuming
you ever get out of here.

376
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,310
Do you really think
you can get out of here, Father?

377
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,480
What? Are you saying...

378
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,880
This is the last time.

379
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,450
I'm never coming back here again.

380
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,790
Because even if it's over your dead body,
I will become chairman of Mingang!

381
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,590
You little brat!

382
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,190
Get back here!

383
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,530
Min Kyung Chae, stop right there!

384
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
You little brat!

385
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,070
Stop!

386
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,400
We haven't heard
from the chairman in days.

387
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,640
We can't just keep waiting like this.

388
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,370
If we can't let this go on, then what?

389
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,310
Are you suggesting we form a search party?

390
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,640
We should file a missing person's report.

391
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,950
And what about Mingang's stock tanking
the second you do?

392
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,920
And you call yourself CEO?
Didn't you even consider that?

393
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,790
Who cares about the stock price right now?

394
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,150
We don't know
what could've happened to him.

395
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,190
If something had happened to him,
we would've heard.

396
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,560
If he were in a car accident,

397
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,260
a hospital or the police
would have called.

398
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,330
Hey, Soo Jung has a point.

399
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,300
We would've gotten
an emergency call by now.

400
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,610
Let's just wait a little longer.
Dad might've just gone off the grid.

401
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,010
How does that make any sense?

402
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,910
What's so unbelievable?

403
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,710
He's just relaxing and will be back soon.

404
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,050
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

405
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,050
It's just making things tense around here.

406
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,420
Hey, Manager Gong, what's for dinner?
I'm starving.

407
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,250
I've already set the table.

408
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,120
It is?
What's everyone waiting for? Let's go eat.

409
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,860
Everyone, get up! Let's go eat!

410
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,660
What are you all doing? Come on, hurry up.

411
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,230
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

412
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,340
Unbelievable.

413
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,650
How can you all eat at a time like this?

414
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,280
I'm having no problem at all.

415
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,750
Don't be like that and eat something.
Starving yourself only hurts you.

416
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,590
He's right. You can't face trouble
on an empty stomach.

417
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,890
Hey, come on. Se Ri, you eat up too.

418
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,030
It's not like Father's going to care
if you starve yourself.

419
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,330
You're all unbelievable.
What kind of family acts like this?

420
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,770
You're his children.
Does his empty seat mean nothing to you?

421
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,180
What do you think you're doing?
How dare you sit there?

422
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,690
It's an empty seat.
What's the big deal if I sit here?

423
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,960
Go sit in your own seat.

424
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,390
Leave that for the chairman
when he comes home.

425
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,790
And who says the chairman is coming back?

426
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,960
What's that supposed to mean?

427
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,100
Forget about the chairman who isn't here,
and start worrying about yourself.

428
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,040
With the chairman gone, who in this house
do you think is on your side?

429
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,080
Are you going to kick me out
now that the chairman is gone?

430
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,550
If you don't want to get kicked out,
watch your step.

431
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,680
This is my house.

432
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,920
Legally, you're all registered under me.

433
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,590
I am your mother.

434
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,700
What's so funny?

435
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,070
I was wondering
what we did to deserve a mother like you.

436
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,080
What did you just say?

437
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,280
A stepmother my own age.

438
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,880
And a former subordinate, at that.

439
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,420
Wasn't becoming
the lady of the house enough...

440
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,650
after seducing the old chairman?

441
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,520
Now you want us to treat you
as our mother?

442
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,290
You're far too greedy.

443
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,620
I've put up with you until now
for Father's sake.

444
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,190
But I don't have to do that anymore.

445
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,720
Because, as of today, this is my seat,

446
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,530
which means you're nothing now.

447
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,220
