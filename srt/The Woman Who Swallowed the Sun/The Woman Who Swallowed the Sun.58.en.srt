00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,280
(Episode 58)

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,680
Lucia. Marry me.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,150
Goodness.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,050
Take shelter under my wings, darling.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,990
No.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,060
Let's...

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,500
live happily together under one roof.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,900
My gosh.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,470
I can't believe I'm doing this at my age.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,740
Goodness.

11
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,700
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,010
Why would you sit there?

13
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,570
You're waiting for Lucia, right?

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,780
How do you know that?

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,210
I also know what this dinner is about.

16
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,650
Then get up and leave.
She'll be here soon.

17
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,880
Lucia will be a bit late.

18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,190
Do you think I'm okay with you
because I didn't do or say anything?

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,190
Some things shouldn't be done
even if your boss gave the order.

20
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,590
How dare you kidnap someone?

21
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,930
What if things had gone really badly?

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,870
Do you take me for a fool
because I didn't say a word?

23
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,240
I held back because I didn't want to
cause trouble before a happy event.

24
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,240
Know your place.

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,640
If you got that, get out of my sight.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,140
I can't do that.

27
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,050
Why don't you just fire me?

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,220
I'll leave the company if you want.

29
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,720
What got into you?

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,470
What's this about?

31
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,870
You can go in a bit later.

32
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,610
Step aside.

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,580
You heard me.

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,720
It won't take long.

35
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,150
Stay here quietly with us,

36
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,290
and we'll make sure you don't get hurt.

37
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,930
I'll return this when we leave.

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,870
Did Kyung Chae send you?

39
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,770
You trust her that little?

40
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,240
How can I trust her?

41
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,610
You're just as bad as she is.

42
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,050
You're just waiting for a chance
to take me down.

43
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,920
How much do you trust Lucia?

44
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,890
I set up Mingang on my own
while you were still in diapers.

45
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,390
Don't you lecture me.

46
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,260
I'm a great judge of character,
so don't act like you're better than me.

47
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,660
I trust Lucia, and I chose to be with her.

48
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,680
Keep quiet until we let you go.

49
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,790
Let's see if your trust remains firm
even after you hear this.

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,600
Yes. I approached Min Doo Sik
for his money.

51
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,400
Did you think I'd actually fall for a man
old enough to be my father?

52
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,740
I want to become the chairman's wife
and enjoy a good life.

53
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,250
I'll take as many shares as I can
and get a say.

54
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,820
Now do you see what she's really like?

55
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,750
This is why I tried to kidnap her
to get rid of her for you.

56
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,000
The rest is up to you. I did my part.

57
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,100
The decision is yours.

58
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,770
Do you choose Mingang or that woman?

59
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,920
The old man must be in shock.

60
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,860
Let her go in a few minutes.

61
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,420
The phone is turned off.

62
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,430
Connecting to voicemail.

63
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,900
You will be charged after the beep.

64
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,140
So nothing happened?

65
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,910
If he left this behind,
it means something went badly wrong.

66
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,110
I don't know why, though.

67
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,720
Someone got involved and messed things up.

68
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,390
Do you think it was Kim Sun Jae?

69
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,690
It could be no one else.

70
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,760
That punk...

71
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,230
Confirm it at work tomorrow.

72
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,340
Yes. I approached Min Doo Sik
for his money.

73
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,580
Did you think I'd actually fall for a man
old enough to be my father?

74
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,290
What did you tell the chairman?

75
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,920
Why can't I reach him?

76
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,190
That's great news.
You might as well ditch him.

77
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,530
Why try so hard
when you're not a great match?

78
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,030
Tell me what you did.

79
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,770
Did you think I, Kim Sun Jae, would let...

80
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,270
the likes of you marry Mingang's chairman?

81
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,340
I could never. Over my dead body.

82
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,680
Did you think you were almost there?

83
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,850
That you had the old man in the bag?

84
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,620
Who knows? Perhaps you've already
celebrated victory with Stella Jang.

85
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,060
Too bad, though.
I can't stand watching you succeed.

86
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,200
(Recording 17555)

87
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,840
Yes. I approached Min Doo Sik
for his money.

88
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,010
Did you think I'd actually fall for a man
old enough to be my father?

89
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,080
I want to become the chairman's wife
and enjoy a good life.

90
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,780
I'll take as many shares as I can
and get a say.

91
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,590
Would he propose to you
after he heard that?

92
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,490
He's not senile.

93
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,560
So wake up.

94
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,630
You're still stupid Baek Sul Hee,

95
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,430
and you can never be anyone else.

96
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,630
Now do you see why I dumped you?

97
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,580
When did he record that?

98
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,650
Was it that day?

99
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,220
I have one last question.

100
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,290
"One last question?" What does that mean?

101
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,630
The chairman is going to propose.

102
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,930
- Says who?
- That's not important.

103
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,630
Will you become a chairman's wife, then?

104
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,800
If you get that, stay away.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,640
And stop coming here to harass me.

106
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,610
You're just a gold digger.

107
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,240
You must be planning to use the old man
to take over the company.

108
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,010
Do you think you'll get your way?

109
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,520
Yes. I approached Min Doo Sik
for his money.

110
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,750
Did you think I'd actually fall for a man
old enough to be my father?

111
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,060
I want to become the chairman's wife
and enjoy a good life.

112
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,530
I'll take as many shares as I can
and get a say.

113
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,230
That seems to be what you want to hear.

114
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,630
I'm sorry, I didn't mean any of that.

115
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,100
Kidnapping me wasn't enough,
so now you're testing me?

116
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,640
You're disgusting.

117
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,880
If you toy with me once more,
I'll fight back and make you pay.

118
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,780
Okay.

119
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,720
Good luck.

120
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,690
Darn it.

121
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,290
That was it.

122
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,290
Shoot.

123
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,360
Darn.

124
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,910
What is it?

125
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,610
Is something wrong?

126
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,980
I think Kim Sun Jae did something.

127
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,850
What did he do now?

128
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,920
He made you say what he wanted to hear,

129
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,990
then played just the problematic part
of the conversation?

130
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,830
I think so.

131
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,860
He's doing all sorts of things now.

132
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,070
This is bad.

133
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,600
If the truth doesn't come out,

134
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,610
the CEO and Kim Sun Jae
will threaten you with it.

135
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,380
I don't know how to prove my innocence.

136
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,850
If what you heard
was the edited recording,

137
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,290
Kim Sun Jae must have
the original somewhere.

138
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,840
Why won't you go to work?

139
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,780
I can do what I want.
Do I need your permission?

140
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,450
I'm worried, that's all.

141
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,950
Don't worry.

142
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,250
Are you upset about something?

143
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,590
I'm not, so get out.

144
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Manager Gong.

145
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,070
Why did Father skip work?

146
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,270
It must be nice to be a chairman.

147
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,670
He can skip work
if he doesn't feel like it.

148
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,780
That's why everyone wants the title.

149
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,250
But really, what's up with him?

150
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,350
I don't know.

151
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,820
He's feeling down,
but he won't say much about it.

152
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,690
Ms. Ja Kyung. Can we talk in private?

153
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,560
With me?

154
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,360
What is it this time?

155
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,030
Help me prepare some side dishes.

156
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,530
We must serve a decent meal
since the chairman is still home.

157
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,970
You're so frustrating.
I said I didn't want to help.

158
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,340
Why don't we call the side dish girl?

159
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,710
We can't. She quit working there.

160
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,810
Hang on.

161
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,950
You know me, don't you?

162
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,190
Of course I do. Why wouldn't I know you?

163
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,190
- Is it my Ja Kyung?
- Yes.

164
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
What's up?

165
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,060
Our table is so empty,
and no one feels like eating.

166
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,870
We might all end up with malnutrition.

167
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,500
There are many other stores
to choose from.

168
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,140
We don't like the food from anywhere else.

169
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,770
Everyone is so picky.

170
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,840
Could you bring us food again?

171
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,510
I might have to cook myself.

172
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,720
What? You have to do the cooking?

173
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,350
Did I just hear a duckling chirp?

174
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,850
Ja Kyung is cooking?

175
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,190
I married her to Ji Seop
so she wouldn't have to do any chores.

176
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,060
She has no choice
because the chairman is home.

177
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,970
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

178
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,770
I can't help.

179
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,740
Yes. I'm sorry about that.

180
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,080
What's the chairman doing at home
when he should be at work?

181
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,380
What about the company?

182
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,850
He shouldn't be at home.

183
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,980
I was thinking of going to his office
to see him.

184
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,650
What for?

185
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,720
To make a deal with him
so I can be a non-executive director.

186
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,620
What are you talking about?

187
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,820
What's a non-executive director anyway?

188
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,390
My dear wife with a smooth brain.

189
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,430
You're married to me
when you don't even know what that is?

190
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:52,200
You should thank every deity you know
that you married me.

191
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,540
You owe it to Jesus
and Buddha and the lot.

192
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,340
Dear deities. Can I swap her out?

193
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,840
Hallelujah, thank you, Buddha, Amen.

194
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,710
I'd love a change right away. Please?

195

(Mingang Distribution)

196
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,450
What the...

197
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,620
- Oh, my gosh.
- Darn it.

198
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,530
Lady.

199
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,300
This happened because you were
carrying that around at work.

200
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,170
What will you do about my suit?

201
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,470
I'm so sorry, sir.

202
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,040
Don't touch me! This suit is expensive.

203
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,640
Why not go to the men's room
and rinse it out?

204
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,880
Darn it.

205
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,650
- Thank you.
- Here.

206
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,340
The password?

(Incorrect PIN. Try again.)

209
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Darn it.

210
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,610
What is it?

00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,550
(Kim Sun Jae)

212
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,550
(Incorrect PIN. Try again.)

213
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,020
This is insane.

214
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,860
What is it?

215
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,740
April 24. It's a historic day
in Kim Sun Jae's life.

216
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,170
The day you passed the bar?

217
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,610
It can't be.

218
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,040
The day he passed the bar?

219
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,380
Zero, four, two, four.

220
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,390
(Mingang Distribution)

221
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,730
Darn it.

222
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,870
How dare she pour that
on my expensive suit?

223
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,170
My laptop.

224
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,050
Oh, dear.

225
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,420
Goodness.

226
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,150
What are you...

227
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,190
Sorry.

228
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,960
What are you doing?

229
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,260
Can I get inside?

230
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,660
Get out of my way.

231
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,200
You're that upset when we happened
to move in sync just a few times?

232
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,300
"We happened to?"

233
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,500
You're in on it together.

234
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,110
You're in on it too, aren't you?

235
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,780
How much did they pay you?

236
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,220
How dare you mess with me?
Do you know who I am?

237
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,120
I'm head of the Legal Team.

238
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,620
I can fire someone like you, no problem.

239
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,360
What is this about?

240
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,420
Did she tell you to do it?

241
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,560
Where is it? Who put you up to it?

242
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,800
Tell me!

243
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,870
What are you doing?

244
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,440
I caught you three plotting together.

245
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,440
Where's my laptop?

246
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,780
It seemed important, so I kept it safe.

247
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,990
He scared you, didn't he?
I'm sorry to make you do this.

248
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,290
Don't be. You were so nice to me.

249
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,640
I think this will be enough
to prove the truth.

250
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,240
If he was willing to go this far,

251
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,170
I'm more worried about what he'll do next.

252
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,510
I must end it before that.

253
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,580
What do you mean, "end it?"

254
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,650
(Director Min Soo Jung)

255
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,460
The chairman skipped work
and turned off his phone.

256
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,490
What if the marriage gets called off?

257
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,830
The deal we made...

258
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,970
Don't worry. It won't get called off.

259
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,300
It had better not.
Do you think I'll let you off?

260
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,940
Whatever happens,
I'll work it out with the chairman,

261
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,680
marry him as planned,
and get the shares I'm entitled to.

262
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,680
You know our deal isn't fulfilled
until you hand me those shares, right?

263
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,080
I know that.

264
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,550
Why else would you have
betrayed your family...

265
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,790
to side with someone like me?

266
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,790
I didn't betray my family.

267
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,330
I just want to get rid of Kyung Chae.

268
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,160
Whatever the reason,
our deal still stands,

269
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,960
and I'll prove it to you, so don't worry.

270
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,410
I won't have to see her again
once I get the shares.

271
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,680
I'll get rid of her...

272
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,610
long before Kyung Chae gets a chance.

273
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,550
The phone is turned off.

274
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,690
Connecting to voicemail.

275
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,120
You will be charged after...

276
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,960
He still won't answer?

277
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,660
He's reeling with shock.

278
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,330
I knew how crafty and underhanded
Kim Sun Jae was,

279
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,240
but I didn't think he'd go that far.

280
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,070
Everything he's planned
will be for nothing...

281
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,210
if I end up marrying the chairman.

282
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,780
If you were to marry Min Doo Sik...

283
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,350
and he were to marry Min Kyung Chae,

284
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,950
that would make you his mother-in-law.

285
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,320
What kind of tragedy is that?

286
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,890
I can explain the situation
now that I have the original recording.

287
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,030
The problem is convincing the chairman...

288
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,430
that I'm not interested in his shares.

289
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,530
A verbal agreement won't be enough.

290
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,370
He'll need documentary evidence.

291
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,710
It's all done.

292
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,010
The detective said
he'd take care of everything for me.

293
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,350
I wonder who the guy is.

294
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,680
Did he tell you his name?

295
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,750
Detective Park.

296
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,290
He's a good guy.

297
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,020
That means he, too,
knows Chairman Min is the actual culprit.

298
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,560
You bet.

299
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,700
Why? Does it bother you?

300
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,860
No, it's not that.

301
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,570
I'm afraid he might go to the chairman
and mess things up.

302
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,870
He'd never do such a thing.

303
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,040
I'm a good judge of character,

304
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,410
and he's a blessing to both you and me.

305
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,240
Wait and see.

306
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,510
Okay.

307
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,190
For someone like Min Doo Sik,

308
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,290
a past like that coming out
would cause quite a stir.

309
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,230
He'd do anything to put a stop to it.

310
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,100
This could be quite the payout.

311
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,700
He'll be working on a plan
to go after Min Doo Sik.

312
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,540
I told him how Min Doo Sik
was connected to your parents' death,

313
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,350
and how he framed it all on me
and got away scot-free.

314
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,720
He was more upset about it than I was.

315
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,780
Okay.

316
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,450
It would be great if he were a good guy,

317
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,690
but what if...

318
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,460
he happens to have other plans?

319
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,500
I know what you're worried about,

320
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,860
but we can trust him.

321
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,370
He said he'd call once he forms a plan...

322
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,870
on how to get Min Doo Sik
so he can't squirm his way out.

323
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,940
Let's wait.

324
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,580
Even the great Min Doo Sik
doesn't stand a chance this time.

325
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,480
- It's fine.
- Okay.

326
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,950
- We'll get there.
- Yes.

327
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,360
You asked to see me?

328
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,130
I was hoping to discuss next week's...

329
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,900
I don't need you to accompany me.

330
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,860
What do you mean?

331
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,300
Are you still angry?

332
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,640
I apologized,

333
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,170
and I promised to stop Lucia...

334
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,770
from marrying the chairman.

335
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,280
You and your empty promises.

336
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,350
I don't need you anymore.

337
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,780
Ms. Min!

338
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,490
Why did you want to see me?

339
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,020
Are you free next week?

340
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,530
When exactly do you mean?

341
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,600
The entrepreneurs' event
scheduled for the weekend.

342
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,760
Can you accompany me?

343
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,600
Everyone who's anyone
in our field will be there.

344
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,440
It's the perfect chance to network.

345
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,080
That seems like something
Mr. Kim used to do.

346
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,850
It's your job from now on.

347
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,650
I'll take that to mean you'll join me.

348
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,250
You can go now.

349
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,930
I get that you're angry with me,

350
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,400
but did I mean this little to you?

351
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,440
You make things worse for me
at every important moment.

352
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,970
I'm sorry you didn't see it.

353
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,480
Why are you here without an appointment?

354
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,220
I'm here to see the chairman.

355
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,760
He's resting. Come by another time,
and make an appointment first.

356
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,270
What are you doing here?

357
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,510
Why are you avoiding me?

358
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,410
Did the recording Lawyer Kim played
bother you that much?

359
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,250
You know what he's like,
and you still suspect and doubt me?

360
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,550
Anyone could tell it was your voice,

361
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,060
and it showed you
denying our relationship.

362
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,330
Why did you prepare this
if you didn't trust me at all?

363
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,360
You don't trust your own girlfriend.

364
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,230
Am I just a plaything to you?

365
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,200
Why would you say that?
Is that what you think I'm like?

366
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,910
If I meant something, you should've
ignored what you heard and asked me.

367
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,210
You should've trusted me
before trusting him.

368
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,540
- That was...
- That's what I'd have done.

369
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,110
If someone tested how I felt about you,

370
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,150
I'd have checked with you first.

371
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,050
I wouldn't ignore your calls
and make things worse by overthinking it.

372
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,250
Are you angry with me?

373
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,960
I am angry, and I am criticizing you.

374
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,100
- Boo.
- My goodness.

375
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,840
What are you doing over there?

376
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,070
We have a guest.

377
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,540
Who is it?

378
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,410
- Her.
- "Her?"

379
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,140
You mean Lucia?

380
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,910
Why is she back here?

381
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,120
Didn't they break up?

382
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,520
Why are you all out here?

383
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,350
That woman is back.

384
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,790
Who?

385
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,990
Lucia?

386
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,790
Why are you so happy to hear that?

387
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,030
It's as if a dead mom came back to life.

388
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,830
I'm rooting for her and Dad.

389
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,800
- They look great together.
- What?

390
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,270
Don't keep saying that.
It might come true.

391
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,140
Yes, Se Ri.
You should never say things like that.

392
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,810
What if they actually get married?

393
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,210
That would be a disaster.

394
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,780
If you hear this, you'll realize...

395
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,250
just how far
Kim Sun Jae will go to deceive you...

396
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,650
and break us up.

397
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,330
Yes. I approached Min Doo Sik
for his money.

398
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,440
Did you think I'd actually fall for a man
old enough to be my father?

399
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,140
I want to become the chairman's wife
and enjoy a good life.

400
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,680
I'll take as many shares as I can
and get a say.

401
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,320
That seems to be what you want to hear.

402
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,690
I'm sorry, I didn't mean any of that.

403
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,820
Kidnapping me wasn't enough,
so now you're testing me?

404
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,390
You're disgusting.

405
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,060
If you toy with me once more,
I'll fight back and make you pay.

406
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,640
He edited the original recording
and played the worst part for you to hear.

407
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,480
What's this?

408
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,980
(Company Share Waiver)

409
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,580
You...

410
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,590
I thought only of myself so far,

411
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,220
when you must have much more to consider.

412
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,230
You're enough for me.

413
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,400
I don't care about the company
or its shares.

414
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,800
If I can be with you,
I'll have all I want.

415
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,500
So don't push me away.

416
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,340
You will make my future brighter.

417
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,980
I can't stand not seeing you.

418
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,150
You make me feel ashamed.

419
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,950
The more you love someone,
the bigger the disadvantage.

420
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Will you...

421
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,620
marry me?

422
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,930
Don't you take that from me too.

423
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,900
Will you marry me?

424
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,670
I will.

425
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,260
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

426
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,440
You dare deceive me?
How could you resort to trickery?

427
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,480
I can bury a nobody like you, no problem.

428
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,850
Wait and see.
If I let you get away with this,

429
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,280
I give up on being human!

430
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,890
I told you. I'm as good as a mom to you.

431
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,520
You're my sister, not my mom.

432
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,420
There's still time for you to turn back.

433
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,890
There's no going back now.

434
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,230
I can pay off one fool, but not the other?

435
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,430
Then the other must be dealt with.

436
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,670
