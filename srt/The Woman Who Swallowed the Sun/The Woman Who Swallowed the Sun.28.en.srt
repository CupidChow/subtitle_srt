00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,510
Chairman.

3
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,510
Chairman.

4
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,680
Chairman! Wake up!

5
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,910
Chairman!

6
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,940
I need help.
The chairman passed out in the stairwell.

7
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,640
- The chairman?
- Call 911 right away. Hurry.

(Mingang Distribution)

9
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,880
Will you come with him?

10
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,680
I'll call his family.
Don't tell anyone about this.

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Okay.

12
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,100
I can't let her go on like this.

13
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,340
Soo Jung will become
a bigger obstacle later on.

14
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,640
The problem is the person who recognized
her greed and ambition...

15
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,140
and used that to prompt her.

16
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,210
You're saying that's Lucia?

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,280
Think about it.

18
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,450
If no one
had gotten in the way of the deal,

19
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,750
CEO Jo wouldn't have made that call.

20
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,020
He's just not capable
of toying with others.

21
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,320
You think...

22
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,530
someone coached him from the sidelines?

23
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,130
Why would he suddenly go
from wanting to sign the deal to refusing?

24
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,230
He has been...

25
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,400
going between you and Director Min
for a while.

26
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,270
That's when someone got in the way.

27
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,340
Director Min was a victim too, in a way.

28
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,010
Someone toyed with both Soo Jung and me?

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,110
Expecting us to fight each other?

30
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,750
Think about it carefully.

31
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,220
There's more to Lucia than you see.

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,120
She's Stella Jang's acquaintance,
but all we have is a rumor.

33
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,390
Only those two know
what's really going on.

34
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,490
They're working as a team
in some other way?

35
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,330
It's very possible.

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,860
It must mean something that Jang...

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,830
put you in touch with the Macau fund,
then demanded you hire Lucia.

38
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,990
What's up with the chairman?

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,660
He always calls if he's running late.

40
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,200
The phone is turned off.

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Connecting to voicemail.

(Operating Theater Center)

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,790
You always do as Mom says, don't you?

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Walk out as if nothing happened.

45
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,460
Can you do that?

46
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,660
Come out after the surgery
with a smile on your face.

47
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,370
I believe in you.

48
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,570
I trust you'll do that.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,310

(Operating Theater Center)

51
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,920
The surgery went well.

52
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,620
He'll recover soon. Don't worry too much.

53
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,900
Why are you back so late?

54
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,010
Why? Is something wrong?

55
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,340
The chairman is not back yet,
and he hasn't called.

56
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,980
Father is not home?

57
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,950
Not you too, Ms. Soo Jung.

58
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,650
Neither of you was home,

59
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,020
and Mr. Ji Seop is spending the night
at his in-laws' with his wife.

60
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,190
I was here all alone, worried sick,

61
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,990
while the chairman was missing
with his phone turned off.

62
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,460
Do you know anything?

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,430
How could I know something you don't?

64
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,170
Spying and stealing info
is your specialty.

65
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,140
I asked in case you knew something.

66
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,640
Then your specialty is ruining my future.

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,380
Not even a stranger would do that.

68
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,880
Would I do that if you knew your place
and didn't get too greedy?

69
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,180
I can never be your equal
unless I were to be reincarnated.

70
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,120
People say...

71
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,050
my birth is my only weakness.

72
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,590
That I'd be where you are
if only my mom weren't a mistress.

73
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,590
You've lost all sense of reason.

74
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,360
CEO Jo...

75
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,100
was never going to accept your offer.

76
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,630
Don't you get that?

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,470
Will you both stop it?

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,700
Stop blaming each other.

79
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,370
We must find the chairman.

80
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,610
I hope he wasn't in some accident.

81
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,150
(Daemyung Hospital)

82
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,450
Get up.

83
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,590
I can't let you die like this.

84
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,290
Live and pay the price.

85
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,960
You must pay for what you did to Mi So.

86
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,860
I won't stop now.

87
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,800
You can't die yet.
Not when I haven't even started.

88
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,180
Ms. Min.

89
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,080
You heard, right?

90
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,450
About what?

91
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,720
The chairman
was rushed to the ER last night.

92
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,360
He passed out in the stairwell...

93
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,720
Why are you telling me that now?

94
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,730
Ms. Lucia from the Online Business Team
said she would call the family...

95
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,330
and told me to keep quiet.

96
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,440
I think this is the chairman's.
I found it on the floor.

97
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,980
Hey.

98
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,810
What's up with her?

99
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,980
The chairman
was rushed to the ER yesterday.

100
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,350
What? The chairman was what?

101
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,020
- Hello.
- Good morning.

102
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,790
Where's Ms. Lucia?

103
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,760
She's not here yet. What's this about?

104
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,980
Knock first, please.

105
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,550
Forget knocking...

106
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,310
Do you know Father just had brain surgery?

107
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,950
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,490
He passed out yesterday.

109
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,690
He was taken to the ER,
where he had emergency surgery.

110
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,720
What?

111
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,430
Father passed out?

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,500
- Yes.
- Since he was sent...

113
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,430
straight to the ward after surgery,
his condition mustn't be too bad.

114
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,000
I just took care of urgent business
and was about to head over there.

115
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,170
I'll come too.

116
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,070
- You too?
- I'm his daughter too.

117
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,910
Why make a big fuss?

118
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,610
I'll go as a representative.
You two can stay here.

119
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,210
That's nonsense.

120
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,120
You might be the CEO of Mingang,
but you can't represent the family.

121
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,750
If we're not all there
when Father wakes up,

122
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,290
he'll brand us for being unfilial.

123
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,860
That's what you care about?

124
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,290
We can all go.

125
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,560
Why move separately
when it's an emergency?

126
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,940
Father!

127
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,140
He's still unconscious.

128
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,910
Fortunately, though,
the surgery went well.

129
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,140
It was an emergency,
so I signed the consent form.

130
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,680
How did he end up passing out
there of all places?

131
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,920
He was in the stairwell?

132
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Yes.

133
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,860
That's odd. Why did he
take the stairs and not the elevator?

134
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,890
And what were you doing there at the time?

135
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,230
You have a point.

136
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,030
Was this a planned accident
disguised as a coincidence?

137
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,170
Did you set it up?

138
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,870
What are you saying?

139
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,400
You did your part. You can leave.

140
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,080
You can't let her walk off.
We must find out what happened.

141
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,780
Do you want me to torture her?

142
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,420
There are no cameras in the stairwell.

143
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,750
We don't have the proof to question her.

144
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,590
Darn it.

145
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,530
Okay. Take good care of him.

146
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,000
Sure. Bye.

147
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,770
Manager Gong.

148
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,310
Did you hear what happened?
I still don't believe it.

149
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,210
Me neither.

150
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,340
Is that why he said that?

151
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,450
Why? What did he say?

152
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,450
He said out of the blue...

153
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,790
that he'd written a will
so that everything would be in order...

154
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,290
even if he were to drop dead.

155
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,790
He couldn't have said that
knowing this would happen,

156
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,760
but it bothers me.

157
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,800
He said that?

158
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,030
Did he mention the contents?

159
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,770
What?

160
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,870
Just in case.

161
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,870
You're his most trusted employee.

162
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,610
I wondered if he told you stuff
he didn't tell his own children.

163
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,310
Where are you going on a day like this?

164
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,120
Didn't Ms. Kyung Chae call?

165
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,990
I know what happened. I'll be back soon.

166
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,630
I wanted to...

167
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,160
write a bucket list
of things to do with you.

168
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,400
I can't anymore.

169
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,030
Why not?

170
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,740
Let's do that bucket thing.

171
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,670
Do you need money to do it?

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,440
Dad just had surgery.

173
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,580
He passed out. He needed brain surgery.

174
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,050
My word.

175
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,320
Chairmen actually do pass out
like they do in TV dramas.

176
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,890
So I can't stay out for long today.

177
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,160
Okay.

178
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,400
Brain surgery is a big deal.

179
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,210
Se Ri, you need to
keep your wits about you.

180
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,440
You must stake your claim
on what's yours when the chairman dies.

181
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,650
Sibling ties mean nothing
when money is involved.

182
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,310
My dad won't die.

183
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,620
We can pray for him to,
and he still won't.

184
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,650
I didn't say I'd pray for him to die.

185
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,720
No amount of praying will help.

186
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,990
I'm on your side, whatever happens.

187
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,760
Discuss everything with me, okay?

188
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,860
Promise.

189
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,930
Come on.

190
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,580
Let's seal the deal.

191
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,080
I'm so proud of you, darling.

192
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,020
I got the security guy to sign an NDA,

193
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,320
and the employees who were
in the lobby were sworn to secrecy.

194
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,220
Good.

195
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,320
Busam Construction's stock crashed
when their chairman was hospitalized,

196
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,060
and rumors spread that he'd died.

197
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,130
Because they didn't silence their staff.

198
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,830
No one outside the company
knows the chairman passed out.

199
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,340
They say Lucia found him
and took him to the hospital.

200
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,270
Is that true?

201
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,510
Apparently. It just had to be her.

202
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,010
Does the chairman know?

203
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,310
Not yet.

204
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,450
He will when he wakes up.

205
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,050
I wonder how he'll treat...

206
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,520
the woman who saved his life.

207
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,090
Is that true?

208
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,660
How is the chairman doing?

209
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,790
We need to wait and see.

210
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,560
The surgery was a success,
but he's still unconscious.

211
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,700
I can't believe it.

212
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,470
Are you all right?

213
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,610
You didn't fall down the stairs with him,
did you?

214
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,470
I'm fine.

215
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,610
Vice Director Min asked...

216
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,720
what I was doing there at that exact time.

217
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,850
If it was planned and not a coincidence.

218
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,560
Why would he say such nonsense?

219
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,890
Do you know
what I was doing on the stairs?

220
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,860
You said I'd reach the rooftop...

221
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,930
if I took my time
and climbed step by step.

222
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,210
Why won't you ask
why I fear the rooftop so much?

223
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,510
You must want to know.

224
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,580
I can't ask everything I'd like to know.

225
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,480
Everyone has a scar or two,

226
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,550
because I also am riddled with them.

227
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,460
Ms. Lucia.

228
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,090
Head to the CEO's office.
She wants to see you.

229
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,610
Your expression tells me
you know everything.

230
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,880
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

231
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,280
About what?

232
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,510
He's the figurehead of our company.

233
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,050
We don't want people to gossip
that he's poorly.

234
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,550
Our stock would crash.

235
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,320
I have no idea what you're on about.

236
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,860
Then continue not knowing
what I'm on about.

237
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,230
If you act like you know when you don't,

238
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,200
it won't do you any good.

239
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,770
I only focus on my work
and things related to it,

240
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,100
unlike someone
who goes around digging things up.

241
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,640
"Digging things up?"

242
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,110
People do that
out of loyalty to their employer.

243
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,880
In other words, it's called
"sucking up" and "brown-nosing."

244
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,520
Why didn't you call
after taking the chairman to the hospital?

245
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,360
You told security not to tell anyone.

246
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,390
He was rushed into surgery
as soon as we arrived,

247
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,130
and I had no time to call you.

248
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,370
I told security to keep quiet
to prevent word from getting out...

249
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,770
and causing havoc.

250
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,400
You did what you did
for Mingang and the chairman's sake?

251
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,810
Why not?

252
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,840
That's fine, then.

253
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,550
What if Min Doo Sik
doesn't regain consciousness?

254
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,620
What if I can't take him to court?

255
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,790
No. I can't let that happen.

256
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,260
I'm leaving early on personal business.

257
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,800
You can leave when it's time.

258
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,530
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

259
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,710
Did you look into what I asked you about?

260
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,880
I made some calls after you asked.

261
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,850
No one knows where Oh Pan Sool lives.

262
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,290
Did you get a phone number
when you got the loan?

263
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,590
I'd have given it to you if I had.

264
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,660
There was always a middleman.

265
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,630
You don't know anyone
who has his number or address?

266
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,640
What he does isn't exactly legal,

267
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,670
so he doesn't leave a trace.

268
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,380
How can I find him, then?

269
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,710
Why are you looking for Oh Pan Sool?

270
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,350
You can't be in need of a private loan.

271
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,390
I must find him...

272
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,790
in order to correct what went wrong
many years ago.

273
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,630
Money's rolling in, rolling in like crazy.

274
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,470
It's rolling in endlessly
from all directions.

275
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,270
I'm attracting cash like a magnet.

276
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,680
I'm absorbing cash like a black hole.

277
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,680
Anything and everything in the world
that looks like cash...

278
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,150
is rolling into my lap.

279
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,680
Those delinquent debtors.

280
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,790
They act like they'll give me anything
to borrow money.

281
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,790
I hope they get hit by a truck
trying to avoid a car.

282
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,890
No one brings me the money
to reclaim what they left as collateral.

283
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,930
Honey.

284
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,860
Yang Mal Sook. How dare you come in here?

285
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,870
Get out of this room immediately!

286
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,570
I'm your wife, not some stranger.

287
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,100
And nothing in there
is worth anything to me.

288
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,470
This is Pan Sool's secret room,
and in here, you're a stranger to me.

289
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,140
You have no business being here.

290
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,980
Throw away the outdated stuff.

291
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,280
Why do you keep things
that are decades old?

292
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,520
A safe is where you keep gold bars,
not sheets of paper.

293
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,290
I'd rather watch a rabbit
break its teeth biting into a pork rib.

294
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,690
This is all money.

295
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,960
I need these to get my money back.

296
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,090
You need the debtor to be alive.

297
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,590
Give me that.
Whose is this? "Han Kyung Soo?"

298
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,700
Doeun Industries?

299
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,700
It's his, isn't it?

300
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,130
How old is this envelope?
Isn't it over 20 years old?

301
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,000
Why do you have this when he
and his wife died at the same time?

302
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,340
You're digging your grave
with a spoon, woman.

303
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,040
The couple left behind a son.

304
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,780
He vanished after his parents died.

305
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,910
So what?

306
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,050
You'll find the son
and make him repay his father's debt?

307
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,250
You don't know anything.

308
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,120
This contract is a huge deal.

309
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,790
It has an uncomfortable...

310
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,460
but beautiful connection
with our daughter's very own in-laws.

311
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,220
"Uncomfortable but beautiful?"

312
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,090
- What's that?
- Hush.

313
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,760
Don't ask more than three questions a day.

314
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,660
Talk less and look at
your handsome husband instead.

315
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,830
No. Leave this room immediately.

316
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,500
Get out this instant!

317
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,070
Out!

318
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,800
The great Min Doo Sik passed out?

319
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,930
Yes.

320
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,440
He's the root of all evil,

321
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,800
and I hate him with all my heart,

322
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,710
but I had to take him to a hospital.

323
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,540
Well done.

324
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,580
You waited four years.
You can wait a bit longer.

325
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,750
We didn't start out
just to take down Min Doo Sik.

326
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,390
I climbed those stairs...

327
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,950
thinking of my Mi So.

328
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,330
I know how much she meant to you.

329
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,470
Even wild animals
appreciate people who save them.

330
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,030
The cold-hearted Min Doo Sik...

331
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,540
can't ignore you now.

332
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,610
Wait and see.
This will become an opportunity.

333
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,980
I asked around.

334
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,380
The surgery alone isn't risky,

335
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,720
but there can be aftereffects.

336
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,390
Like what?

337
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,290
Amnesia, facial palsy,

338
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,690
and he could even become demented.

339
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,930
Dementia means
he could be ruled legally incompetent.

340
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,660
What about his position, then?

341
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,630
That's why
we must find his will before then.

342
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,770
We need to know what it says
if we're to plan ahead.

343
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,810
Lawyer Kim
had to have gotten it notarized.

344
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,540
We never know the future.

345
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,480
Who knows what will happen to your father?

346
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,450
He has been unconscious for days already.

347
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,780
It's weird how he still hasn't woken up...

348
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,350
when the surgery supposedly went well.

349
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,920
Exactly.

350
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,290
They say people live to be 100 nowadays,

351
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,460
but you never know how long he'll live.

352
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,530
Search Father's office tomorrow
and see if you can find the will.

353
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,770
Where did he put it?

354
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,370
It's a will,
so it wouldn't be hidden away.

355
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,280
And he wouldn't have left it with someone.

356
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,850
It's either in Father's room
or his office.

357
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,090
What's this?

358
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,030
You're in Father's office now?

359
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,900
What? What do you think I did?

360
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,760
Leaving a talisman
in my office wasn't enough?

361
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,030
Isn't that what you're doing?

362
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,400
No. I go to church now.

363
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,370
What about you?
Why are you here when Father is not?

364
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,840
(Mingang Distribution)

365
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,580
Hey, wait right there.

366
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,380
I called the hospital this morning
to ask about Father.

367
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,250
The nurse said he was still unconscious.

368
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,890
What do you think that means?

369
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,520
What does it mean?

370
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,930
It means it's possible
he might never wake up.

371
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,560
Let's say he dies as is.

372
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,570
Kyung Chae reaps all the benefits.

373
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,240
After Father,
who do you think owns most of Mingang?

374
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,120
What happens to the company
if he doesn't wake up?

375
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,490
Min Kyung Chae will become chairwoman?

376
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,860
I must accept that?

377
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,960
Says who?

378
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,370
I rushed over as soon as you called.
Is this urgent?

379
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,840
I need to ask you a favor.

380
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,310
You said the elderly mother
of one of your regulars passed out.

381
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,380
And she recovered after eating
some invigorating meals you prepared.

382
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,980
Yes, she did. Why do you ask?

383
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,620
Our chairman underwent emergency surgery.

384
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,420
Oh, my gosh.

385
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,260
Is he seriously ill?

386
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,760
No, but could you make us
some food to bring him back to health?

387
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,300
Yes, of course I should.

388
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,570
I can cook anything you need.

389
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,300
I just hope the chairman gets well soon.

390
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Goodness.

391
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,210
Hello, sir.

392
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,940
(Jogeon Logistics)

393
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,640
I did some thinking.

394
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,610
Rather than looking for Oh Pan Sool,

395
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,220
how about you ask the broker...

396
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,790
to arrange a meeting,
saying you need a loan?

397
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,720
Oh, yes. That could work.

398
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,960
I didn't think of that.

399
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,630
I owe you one.

400
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,960
Can you do that for me?

401
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,800
Okay. I'll be in touch.

402
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,370
Bye.

403
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,300
Director Moon.

404
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,270
Have you decided to extend
the suppliers' contracts?

405
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,910
My team can't clear the documents...

406
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,010
until your team hands them to us.

407
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,510
You'll get them soon.

408
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,250
They've done business with us for years.

409
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,890
Don't stop at just extending the contract.
Why not adjust the conditions too?

410
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,490
I'll take care of that. Don't you worry.

411
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,660
How can I not worry?

412
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,060
To be honest,
you're partially responsible...

413
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,530
for the chairman's condition, aren't you?

414
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,230
What kind of logic is that?

415
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,770
Your miserable sales and performance
put him under a lot of stress.

416
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,010
No wonder he was shocked.

417
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,040
Do you have to blame others...

418
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,910
and question them as if they're guilty
to make yourself feel better?

419
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,320
If you don't like that,
prove yourself with better results.

420
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,150
It's a fact that you haven't done anything
in the past four years,

421
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,790
and I wonder
why the CEO hasn't fired you yet.

422
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,410
How is the chairman doing?

423
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,350
Why are you asking me that?

424
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,580
Don't you know it's a secret?

425
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,620
That's why I asked when it's just us.

426
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,790
Is he awake?

427
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,460
Whether he is or not
is none of your business.

428
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,330
You didn't cross the line...

429
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,430
and visit him in the hospital
without me or the CEO knowing, did you?

430
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,670
That's crossing the line?

431
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,530
Don't even dream of trying to...

432
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,270
get something out of the chairman...

433
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,510
because you saved his life.

434
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,080
If you keep quiet, I might be
generous enough to give you a bonus.

435
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,880
If you go too far,

436
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,080
then CEO Min and I will come after you.

437
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,990
What's wrong?

438
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,660
Did he do something?

439
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,200
Not really.

440
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,370
Have you left?

441
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,470
I'm about to.

442
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,540
Do I have to stay there until you come by?

443
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,080
Yes, you bet.

444
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,710
I'll explain why later. Get over there.

445
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,950
I'm bored sick.

446
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,790
He should be off work by now.
Is he coming or not?

447
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,560
What took you so long?

448
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,260
I came straight from work. How is he?

449
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,230
He's still the same.

450
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,300
Why did you tell me to be here?

451
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,670
Think about it.

452
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,700
Who's here when he wakes up is a big deal.

453
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,740
If he lost his memory
as an aftereffect of the surgery,

454
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,370
I have to lie...

455
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,540
and say I carried him
all the way to the hospital.

456
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,910
As if your sisters would let you.

457
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,110
I just have to...

458
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,280
make him believe me,
no matter what they say.

459
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,350
I have skills.

460
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,490
What about that Lucia woman?

461
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,690
She's the one who found Father...

462
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,690
in the stairwell and brought him here.

463
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,890
Don't worry about that.
I took care of her.

464
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,200
Good, then.

465
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,730
Honey. Let's get a coffee.

466
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I need a caffeine boost.

467
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
- Do you?
- Yes.

468
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,570
Let's go, then.

469
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,090
Lucia saved my life?

470
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,500
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

471
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,910
If Father is ruled legally incompetent,

472
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,450
that will mean the worst for our family.

473
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,280
You want him to stay unconscious,
don't you?

474
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,780
You think you'll become chairwoman soon.

475
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,120
You got my father's will notarized,
didn't you?

476
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,450
That violates the Attorney-at-Law Act.

477
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,790
It could ruin my career.

478
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,620
He'll be here soon.
Are you sure about this?

479
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,530
Let's skip the greetings
since we're all busy people.

480
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,960
- Is this the guy?
- Too bad.

481
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,930
You saved the chairman's life,

482
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,230
and no one knows.

483
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,270
I remember everything now.

484
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,300
At last.
