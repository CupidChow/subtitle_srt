1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,210
Tell Director Moon
to come straight to my office.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,980
(Episode 49)

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,120
Why do you have this?

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,460
Why do you have it?

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,890
Ask the chairman.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,700
He gave it to you?

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,500
Would I have stolen it?

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,940
- Give it to me.
- What are you doing? Let go.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,000
- Give it to me!
- Stop.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,270
- Let go of me!
- Stop it!

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,080
- What's going on here?
- Let go!

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,550
Calm down.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,880
What was that about?

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,420
It's none of your business,
so stay out of it.

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,290
No. I can't do that.

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,920
You can back off.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,230
Aren't you the one who should back off?

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,360
Stay out of this woman's business!

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,660
I will get involved
because it involves her!

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
(Mingang Distribution)

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,070
Was that ring really from the chairman?

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,910
Do you see why I want her gone?

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,610
What happens now?

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,410
Will the chairman marry her?

25
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,320
We can't allow such a tragedy.

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,950
Do you think I'll let that happen?

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,890
I don't think it's just a concern.

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,960
It's slowly turning into reality.

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,320
That's why we must do
whatever it takes to stop them.

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,860
We left her alone because we didn't have
enough cause to fire her,

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,500
but now it'll become even harder
because the chairman will defend her.

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,900
That's not a good enough reason
to let her stay.

33
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,470
Regardless of what the chairman says,

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,240
I won't leave that woman alone.

35
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,740
There was a scuffle in the office.

36
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,550
Kyung Chae made a scene
trying to take Lucia's ring.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,120
What?

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,790
You need to make her yours officially
as soon as possible.

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,320
I felt bad when I saw it happen.
Lucia must feel devastated.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
That's why
I invited her over this weekend.

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,530
You don't have the right
to give away Mother's belongings.

42
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,440
And you have the right to keep them?

43
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,370
Mom will cry and turn in her grave!

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,410
You gave a woman like that
something she treasured in her lifetime.

45
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,380
"A woman like that?"
I told you to watch your language.

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,010
So you gave her Mom's ring.
Did that make you happy?

47
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,680
Why wouldn't I be happy?

48
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,520
Your mom owned it when she lived.
Not now that she's dead.

49
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,050
Why can't I give it
to someone who deserves it?

50
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,660
She deserves it?

51
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,530
Mother won't be able to rest in peace.

52
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,060
If she can't rest in peace,
it'll be because of you!

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,500
You're a grown woman,
and you're still so twisted.

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,770
I will never accept
or acknowledge that woman.

55
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,370
What right do you have to say that?

56
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,570
Father!

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,970
I have no use
for a child who goes against me.

58
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,710
What child tries to
one-up her father at every turn?

59
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,040
Get out! I'm sick of you!

60
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,490
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

61
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,300
What was that fight about?

62
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,570
You won't tell me?

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,540
I want to know. I need to know.

64
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,940
You don't want me to get involved?

65
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,940
Shall I stay out of it
like Lawyer Kim said?

66
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,680
Director.

67
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,950
Yes. Talk to me.

68
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,480
What I'll do from now on
will disappoint you.

69
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,750
You said that already.

70
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,690
Don't do what makes you feel bad.

71
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,220
There are always other options.

72
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,560
No. There is no other option.

73
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,360
That's why I'm so worried about you.

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,460
I fear you'll get involved
in what I'm about to do.

75
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,630
See?

76
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,300
Why can't I worry about you
when you worry about me?

77
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,170
Why must I turn a blind eye?

78
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,170
You have something to do for your parents.

79
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,210
That's why I'm reacting like this.
The way my parents taught me.

80
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,510
They said if I saw someone about to make
the wrong choice, I was to stop them.

81
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,880
Whatever choice you make,

82
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,520
I will stand close by and watch.

83
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,690
I'll get involved if I must,

84
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,820
and I'll worry
if it's worth worrying about.

85
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,460
Don't tell me to turn a blind eye.

86
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,980
Who'd have thought I'd end up like this?

87
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,720
That hurt.

88
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,020
How dare you pinch my nipple?

89
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,230
You can come out and have lunch.

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,500
I can? I was so hungry I thought I'd die.

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Darn it.

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,630
Darn you.

93
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,470
Let's eat.

94
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,480
I'll go and get some groceries.

95
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,750
We're expecting a guest this weekend.

96
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,490
Someone's visiting?

97
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,990
The chairman invited someone.

98
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,620
Who?

99
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,260
I don't know.

100
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,760
Tell us who it is.

101
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,560
It can't be a top secret.

102
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,630
I don't get you, Manager Gong.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,200
Wouldn't it be nice to discuss everything?

104
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,340
Think about Se Ri.

105
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,270
She wants to know about her mom.

106
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,110
If you know something, you could tell...

107
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,410
I don't want to know anymore.

108
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,150
What?

109
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,380
Father-in-law would say
that sounded like a goat eating a steak.

110
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,220
You wanted to know about your mom.

111
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,390
I used to, but not anymore.

112
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,330
Hey.

113
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,930
Did you figure out who your birth mom is?

114
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,530
- No.
- What's up, then?

115
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,270
Ji Seop. Do you think I can change?

116
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,410
Who, you? Forget it.

117
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,750
People never change.

118
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,780
Someone said...

119
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,350
I might be a weed now,

120
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,020
but if someone were to water
and care for me, I'd turn into a flower.

121
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,520
Who would say such nonsense?

122
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,520
How can a weed turn into a flower?

123
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,160
Do you think...

124
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,990
The whole family thinks
I am and always will be a weed.

125
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,200
I don't care anymore,

126
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,000
because I found someone
who thinks I'm a flower.

127
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,040
What was that nonsense about?

128
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,810
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,190
What do you want?

130
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,320
Shall I explain my actions
from this morning?

131
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,060
Do I have to know?

132
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,760
It wasn't the first time
I saw you mistreat Ms. Lucia.

133
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,130
The chairman put a ring on her finger.

134
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,400
What do you mean?

135
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,970
You're a man too.

136
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,970
You know what that means.

137
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,110
He might have called her to his office.

138
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,880
They could be having a private tea party,

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,680
acting like lovers.

140
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,420
Don't just say whatever you feel like.
Keep quiet if you don't know anything.

141
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,920
I will, but I'm sorry to say that
what I said about the ring was true.

142
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,830
Now do you see why our CEO was so angry?

143
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,730
Do you know why I'm telling you all this?

144
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,100
It looks like you have feelings for her.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,610
Do something about it.

146
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,340
The woman you're crushing on
could marry your big boss.

147
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,110
Don't miss out on your only shot.

148
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,500
Why are you standing over here?

149
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,310
Who were you just with?

150
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,810
Did the chairman...

151
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
Never mind.

152
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,350
Is something wrong?

153
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,990
No, nothing's wrong.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,170
If you meet the family, does that
officially make you Father's lover?

155
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,670
I'm more worried about the future.
You saw what happened this morning.

156
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,740
I'm not worried at all.

157
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,870
You fought fiercely to keep the ring.

158
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,950
Are you really okay with me doing this?

159
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,780
If this is my fate, I must accept it.

160
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,950
I'll back you up all the way. In return,

161
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,390
be prepared to keep your side of the deal.

162
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,390
You bet.

163
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,460
Let's get rid of CEO Min Kyung Chae.

164
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,100
That's reassuring to hear.

165
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,800
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

166
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,100
You said you would get involved
because it involved Lucia.

167
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,450
You can't seem to ignore anything
that involves her.

168
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,480
The chairman invited her to our home.

169
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,720
She'll meet our family this weekend.

170
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,060
It's the grown-up version
of meeting the parents.

171
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,070
See for yourself if you don't believe me.

172
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,720
Ms. Lucia.

173
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,790
Shall we meet up this weekend?

174
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,620
I have something to say.

175
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,460
Well, it's not exactly just to talk.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,360
I'd like to see you.

177
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,300
You're looking at me right now.

178
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,610
I want to see you over the weekend too.
Can you make it?

179
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm sorry. I have plans.

180
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,980
What plans?

181
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,190
You don't need to answer
if it's too personal.

182
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,490
I'm sorry. It's pretty important.

183
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,900
How important is it?

184
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,960
It's very important.

185
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,170
I looked forward to it for a long time.

186
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,770
I'm...

187
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,270
about to start something.

188
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,340
We're getting a lot of cash too.

189
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,380
There are many bills and too few fingers.

190
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,010
I should count with my toes too.

191
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,790
We're doing well,
but now Ji Seop is jobless.

192
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,590
Ja Kyung is stressed out beyond belief.

193
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,760
He has the face of a jobless fool.

194
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,690
I'm sure the chairman
will reinstate him soon.

195
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,660
I'm worried that's very unlikely.

196
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,060
You know what the chairman is like.

197
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,170
If he keeps belittling my son-in-law,

198
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll take him on, even if he's my in-law.

199
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,570
He doesn't know what's in my safe.

200
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,470
Since you brought it up, let me ask.

201
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,770
What's in there?

202
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,740
Leverage on the great Min Doo Sik.

203
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,010
A collar that, when tightened,
will take him straight to his death.

204
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,610
What does that mean?

205
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,120
Do you think it's safe
to leave the house empty?

206
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,890
Our tenant's uncle.

207
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,360
We said he could stay
because the tenant begged,

208
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,000
but it's getting crowded.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,430
What landlord lets a tenant's guest
stay for free?

210
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,300
Not again. You should speak the truth,
even if you're paralyzed on one side.

211
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,540
He's not staying for free.

212
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,570
The tenant is paying double the rent
and the interest on the loan.

213
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,310
You're a con artist.

214
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,580
Go back to counting the bills.

215
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,710
Cash... Money...

216
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,080
I'd rather watch a tortoise
jog down a highway.

217
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,180
How dare you call me a con artist?

218
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,020
Excuse me.

219
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,460
Is no one home?

220
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,500
Hi, Jo Pil Doo speaking.

221
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,940
Did you get in?

222
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,610
Oh, it's you. I was about to call you.

223
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,310
I told the landlord couple
that you were my uncle.

224
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,540
Did you? Thanks.

225
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,080
I know I ask too much of you.

226
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,250
I'll stay out of trouble.
Don't worry about me and work.

227
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,200
Hello, Ms. Min.

228
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,270
What brings you here?
You don't have an appointment.

229
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,500
I didn't make one,
thinking you'd welcome me more this way.

230
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
I hadn't heard from you.

231
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,780
Shouldn't you tell me
if you called a board meeting?

232
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,210
It's just a formality.

233
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,050
What's taking you so long to make me
a non-executive director?

234
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,120
Why do you want so desperately
to become one?

235
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,120
I just don't get it.

236
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,620
That almost hurts to hear.

237
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,990
You bowed to me and called me "Madam"
when you needed the money I could get you.

238
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,570
A non-executive director
has access to our company secrets.

239
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,870
Do you think I'd do something
to harm Mingang?

240
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,070
I want the company to do well.

241
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,270
I'm sure you do.

242
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,580
I'll be in touch.

243
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,480
I look forward to the good news.

244
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,030
I bet she hates
the circumstances right now.

245
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Once I become a non-executive director,

246
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,470
I get to see
every single thing they get up to.

247
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,670
She'll be worried.

248
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,370
Last time, you said that...

249
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,970
if the people on the board
voted in Min Kyung Chae's favor,

250
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,510
things would be tough for us.

251
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,040
Yes. What about that?

252
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,210
Does that mean she'll have
a bigger stake than the chairman...

253
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,610
and her siblings put together?

254
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,580
I'll have to do the math to be sure,

255
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,690
but what I do know is that
it would be much easier if we knew...

256
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,320
a shareholder
who isn't related to the Min family.

257
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,490
Oh, how about we ask Moon Tae Kyung?

258
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,100
He must've gotten a stock option
when he was hired.

259
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,570
Let's ask him to give it to us.

260
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,370
No. Let's not touch
anything of Tae Kyung's.

261
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,570
"Tae Kyung?"

262
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,910
Since when have you been calling him that?

263
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,210
I don't want to touch or take anything
that belongs to him.

264
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,780
He lost too much already.

265
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,320
It would be cruel
to ask him to hand over anything else.

266
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,820
Lucia.

267
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,360
Love is the biggest obstacle
to getting revenge.

268
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,860
Do you know what I mean?

269
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,600
My gosh. I feel so refreshed.

270
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,710
How is the alcohol rehab facility?

271
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,510
I can't afford to be picky.

272
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,310
I must become clean
if I'm to testify in court.

273
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,020
You need to keep going,
however hard it is.

274
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,520
If you give up halfway through...

275
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,320
I know, it'll be all for nothing.

276
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,260
I'll complete the course, clean up,

277
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,620
and prove myself by testifying in court.

278
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,330
Do you think...

279
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,300
my testimony will be enough?

280
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,300
If you want to reveal
what Min Doo Sik did,

281
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,370
you'll need proof he can't deny.

282
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,740
That proof.

283
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,240
It exists.

284
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,910
It exists? Where?

285
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,150
Inside our landlord's safe.

286
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,620
That's why I risked everything to move in.

287
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,720
Our landlord...

288
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,730
is Oh Pan Sool.

289
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,730
Is that true?

290
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,400
I had no idea
because I'd only heard the name.

291
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,740
Why won't you do anything?

292
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,440
Who cares about the safe?
We can just steal it.

293
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,110
No.

294
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,380
Evidence obtained in that manner
can't be used in court.

295
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,320
So you'll give up
when it's right under your nose?

296
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,050
I have no choice.
Even if it's hard and it takes time,

297
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,650
I must do things legally,

298
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,990
or it means nothing.

299
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,090
If that's what you say.

300
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,930
You know,

301
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,000
if Oh Pan Sool were to know
whose son you are,

302
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,900
he won't let you stay.

303
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,870
That's why I need you to be careful too.

304
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,610
There's one more thing.
Oh Pan Sool is related by marriage...

305
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,350
to Chairman Min Doo Sik.

306
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,850
What shocking nonsense is this?

307
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,290
Oh, my gosh...

308
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,500
Who's coming
that they're making such a fuss?

309
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,900
Do we have to dress up too?

310
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,000
It's what my father wants.

311
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,940
It's not about business, is it?

312
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,400
Of course it's not.

313
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,310
If it were about work,
they'd meet elsewhere, not at home.

314
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,340
Who on earth is coming?

315
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,920
You're going out when I invited a guest?

316
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,390
She's not my guest.

317
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,360
This is why you're so hard to like.

318
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,630
You used to say you liked
how much we were alike.

319
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,630
I bet you want me
to live alone and die alone.

320
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,530
What does that make us?

321
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,130
You stick around for a reason.

322
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,970
My money.

323
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,040
Your money is part of you.

324
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,310
It's stupid to separate you from that.

325
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,950
I'm getting out of the way for your sake.

326
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,720
This is the most I can do for you.

327
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,750
I'm moved to tears.

328
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,390
Act appropriately.

329
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,420
You don't live alone here.

330
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,890
How dare you...

331
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,200
My gosh.

332
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,430
Hello, sir.

333
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,770
Goodness.

334
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,010
Hello.

335
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,880
Are you okay that I made you
come over so early?

336
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,610
That's fine.

337
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,050
Are the chairman and CEO
unhappy with each other?

338
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,950
It's about today's guest.

339
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,950
Who is it that everyone's on edge?

340
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,760
I don't know who it is,

341
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,090
but they seem to be
tearing the family apart.

342
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,360
I don't think they're good for us.

343
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,470
You look lovely.

344
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,210
I'm not sure
if it's right to feel this way,

345
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,850
but I feel like a mom
who's about to marry off her daughter.

346
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,590
You look perfect.

347
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,400
Well and truly seduce Min Doo Sik.

348
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,540
You left home on purpose?

349
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,480
Should I have stayed and welcomed her?

350
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,780
Should I have said...

351
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,180
"Welcome. Come in."

352
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,720
What will you do now?

353
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,090
I'm still thinking.

354
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,320
One wrong move
will antagonize Madam Jang too,

355
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,490
and I don't think
I can take on both of them.

356
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,360
You must keep that woman
away from the chairman.

357
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,530
If their relationship deepens...

358
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,570
Don't even go there.
That would be torture to me.

359
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,500
I'd feel just the same.

360
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,710
Why is that?

361
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,510
That woman.

362
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,740
Does she mean something to you?

363
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,350
Not really.

364
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,550
I can't stand the idea that she
could become the chairman's wife.

365
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,020
That will never happen,
so don't mention it.

366
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,160
Even if the sky falls,

367
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,760
I will never let her be my stepmother.

368
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,630
Are we still waiting?

369
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,400
Yes.

370
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,970
Who could it be?

371
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,780
Gosh, you dyed your hair.

372
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,950
You look totally different, Dad.

373
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,330
The chairman invited her to our home.

374
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,190
She'll meet our family this weekend.

375
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,200
It's the grown-up version
of meeting the parents.

376
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,500
Shall we meet up this weekend?

377
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,140
I'm sorry. I have plans.

378
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,910
I looked forward to it for a long time.

379
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
I'm...

380
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,910
about to start something.

381
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,170
Where are you going in such a hurry?

382
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,530
To Min Doo Sik's.

383
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,170
Why? What for?

384
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,140
The woman I love
is about to become his fiancée.

385
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,640
So what? You'll go and try to stop her?

386
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,050
Should I let her do it, then?

387
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,650
She's sacrificing herself to get revenge.

388
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,190
If that's the choice she made,
stand by and watch.

389
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,020
No. I can't do that.

390
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,330
But...

391
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,300
Oh, dear.

392
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,470
Oh, no.

393
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,470
Don't go inside!

394
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,380
How could you come here?

395
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,050
What...

396
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,980
Why are you here?

397
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,420
Don't you know what this family is like?

398
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,460
I only accepted an invitation.

399
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,490
Do you accept any invitation
when it means certain death?

400
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,530
Come with me.

401
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,040
No.

402
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,910
I can't leave.

403
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,010
Why not?

404
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,680
Do you know how you look to me?

405
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,380
You look like a moth.

406
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,410
A moth about to head into a flame.

407
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,450
You don't care if you die?

408
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,880
I don't care.

409
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,020
How can you not care when I do?

410
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,830
You said you liked being called
Mi So's mom more than anything.

411
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,300
I'll call you that.

412
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,610
I'll keep calling you Mi So's mom.

413
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,880
Stop what you're doing.

414
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,630
The people in there.

415
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,160
They don't know right now,
but they'll catch on soon.

416
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,730
They won't let you live
if they know who you are!

417
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,650
You...

418
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,890
knew.

419
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,640
Then don't stop me.

420
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,840
I'm doing this for Mi So.

421
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,980
You shouldn't take a path with a dead end.

422
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,120
This is the path I must take.

423
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,720
I won't know if it'll take me
to utopia or dystopia until I get there.

424
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,620
So I'll keep going.

425
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,960
You already know
it doesn't lead to utopia.

426
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,660
It doesn't matter.

427
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,640
I can't let you...

428
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,680
take the path to dystopia on your own.

429
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,850
I must go on my own.

430
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,530
I'll remember.

431
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,970
Just like how you remember my parents,

432
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,370
I'll remember Mi So.

433
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,840
So please...

434
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,330
Leave.

435
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,110
We didn't meet here this evening.

436
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,440
Nothing changes.

437
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,110
Don't get any ideas.

438
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,130
Who is it?

439
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,820
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

440
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
