1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,280
As her father, I can make no excuse.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,250
I failed my daughter
by not teaching her better.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,850
I'd like you to correct everything
even now.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,350
Of course.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,750
If you do wrong,
you must ask for forgiveness,

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,590
and if you commit a crime,
you must pay the price.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,960
I'll look into where things went wrong...

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,930
and then take the necessary steps.

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,460
I don't want anyone to suffer unjustly.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,100
I'm relieved to hear that's how you feel.

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,100
Trust me and go home.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,900
I'll take care of it.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,700
Please...

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,940
reveal the truth.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,290
Send CEO Min to my office!

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,800
I heard that woman was here.

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,770
Didn't you hear what I said?

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,940
I told you to crush her properly.

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,070
I didn't think she'd come to see you.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,480
People with nothing
lose control when they get angry.

21
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,210
I'm sorry to trouble you
with something like this.

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,620
She forgot her place and acted out
because you were too gentle.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,690
How dare she come here
and look me in the eye?

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,590
If you want to learn, learn properly.

25
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,530
Don't you get that yet?

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,000
What I did to get this far?

27
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,600
I just met with the chairman.

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,700
He said he'd take care of it.

29
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,010
He even apologized.

30
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,180
I bet he called the older sister...

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,410
to his office to yell at her.

32
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,320
He's not at all like his daughter.

33
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,320
Mi So, someone's calling. I have to go.

34
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,560
Hello?

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,460
It's Semyung International High's
Admissions Office.

36
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,760
Are you Baek Mi So's guardian?

37
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,130
Yes, I'm her mother.

38
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,510
I called to tell you that
your daughter's admission was canceled.

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,170
What do you mean?

40
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,310
Her admission was canceled?

41
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm just passing on the final decision.

42
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,650
Goodbye.

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,190
Hello?

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Hello?

45
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,630
Darn it.

46
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,760
You accepted her
based on her superior grades.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,930
And that was without any tutoring
or academy classes.

48
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,270
You said so yourself...

49
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,110
that she was a rare case.

50
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,540
Please calm down.

51
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,480
She didn't look into any other schools
because you accepted her.

52
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,050
It's too late to apply now.

53
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,550
Why not let her take a gap year...

54
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,620
and prepare for next year's admissions?

55
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,450
What kind of an idea is that?

56
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,890
I won't accept this.

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,660
I can't accept
an unfair decision like this.

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,690
I'll petition the Office of Education.

59
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,130
If that doesn't work,
I'll go to the Ministry of Education.

60
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,960
I get that you're upset,

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,470
but those are the school regulations.

62
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,800
What exactly are the regulations
that made you cancel her admission?

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,410
I wanted to avoid bringing this up,

64
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,440
but Mi So was involved in
a disgraceful incident,

65
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,280
and everyone's talking.

66
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,650
She was even in the news.

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,120
Sir.

68
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,120
That news report.

69
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,090
It was all a lie.

70
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,390
We reported the assault to the police.

71
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,560
They found a stand-in to take the fall,
bribed the witnesses to...

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Ma'am. That's an issue
you should take up with the judiciary.

73
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,400
We care about a student's grades,

74
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,040
but we also put weight
on their character and conduct.

75
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,140
Your daughter was in the news
for her involvement in an assault.

76
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,080
Allowing her to attend...

77
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,580
That's not what actually happened.

78
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,520
We can't ignore the public sentiment.

79
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,390
I'll reveal the truth.

80
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,960
Please, give me some time.

81
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,830
You can't cancel her admission
just like that.

82
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,870
Mi So was overjoyed
that she could study here.

83
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,370
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

84
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,770
Mingang cares a great deal
about funding future academics.

85
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,250
Yes, of course.
I promise to fund you continuously.

86
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,450
Your school should advance
as much as its reputation does.

87
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,930
What took you so long?
You said you'd be home soon.

88
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,140
I had to drop by somewhere.

89
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,800
Tell me what happened.

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,510
What did the chairman say?
Will he really sort it out?

91
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,680
He really promised?

92
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,450
Yes.

93
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,280
He'll take care of
the fake news report and interviews?

94
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,880
Yes.

95
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,790
And reveal that I'm the victim
and his daughter's the attacker?

96
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,490
Yes.

97
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Then...

98
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,490
will the malicious comments go away?

99
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,960
I won't be bad-mouthed online
if the truth comes out.

100
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,330
No one will blame me when I'm the victim.

101
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,870
It's so annoying.

102
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,470
He should've done that sooner.

103
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,240
Did he say when he'd take care of it?

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,910
Did he give a deadline?

105
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,980
The sooner, the better.
I don't want people to misunderstand.

106
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,790
The viewer count is soaring like crazy...

107
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,560
and the comments are everywhere.

108
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,190
People leave...

109
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,930
hundreds of mean comments a day.

110
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,260
I might lose my mind.

111
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,970
Mi So.

112
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,740
I know how hard it is.

113
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,710
Hang in there a little longer
and try to relax.

114
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,850
I'm so upset, Mom.

115
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,880
I was so stressed...

116
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,650
when one word from the chairman
was all it took.

117
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,820
Get some rest.
I'll check on Yeon Ah at the bar.

118
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,760
They canceled her admission?

119
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,870
What kind of nonsense is that?

120
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,500
What did Mi So say?

121
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,440
I couldn't tell her.

122
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,070
She's already on edge.
I couldn't make it worse.

123
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,370
It's stupid to think
she can't go to the school...

124
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,710
she worked so hard to get into
because of a fake news story.

125
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,380
Mi So will lose her mind if she finds out.

126
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,750
I need to sort this out before then
and I don't know how.

127
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,390
This is all that girl's fault.

128
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,390
Who is this girl
that caused so much trouble for us?

129
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,290
Does she sleep well at night?

130
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,760
I don't believe this.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,230
I'm so angry!

132
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,300
Goodness.

133
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,510
Manager Gong. You're still single?

134
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,070
Yes.

135
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,810
My gosh.
You're old enough to be a grandma.

136
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,550
What do you get from us
that you worked here for that long?

137
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,320
I'd have quit long ago
to get married if I were you.

138
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,990
I haven't yet found a place
as nice as this.

139
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,220
That's nonsense.

140
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,090
It's a prison shaped like a mansion.

141
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,460
And it's run by Min Doo Sik
and his family.

142
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,600
Ja Kyung. I heard your marriage
with my brother was arranged.

143
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,900
What?

144
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,540
An arranged marriage
is really materialistic.

145
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,310
You only care
what each other has to offer.

146
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,120
It's not just that.

147
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,350
It is just that
in all the dramas I watched.

148
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,020
They're sworn enemies
disguised as a couple.

149
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,430
But you and Ji Seop
seem to be pretty happy.

150
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,830
I wouldn't liken you
to a couple of lovebirds.

151
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,740
I would say you suit each other
as a couple of cockroaches would.

152
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,140
We're cockroaches?

153
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,140
Manager Gong, will you run me a bath?

154
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,290
Wake up.

155
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,260
Wake up!

156
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,560
What's the matter?

157
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,870
You won't even let me nap on my day off?

158
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,400
Your youngest sister thinks
we're a couple of bugs.

159
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,740
Do you know that?

160
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,070
She said we're a couple of cockroaches
that suit each other!

161
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,440
That's better than not suiting each other.

162
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,710
That's not the point!

163
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,080
She called us cockroaches!

164
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,580
We're not cockroaches!

165
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,390
Let it go. She's a troubled teenager.

166
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,930
Do you know
how much of the company she owns?

167
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,400
Think of when
she comes of age and is able to...

168
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,730
transfer her shares to someone.

169
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,000
She doesn't care about business.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,070
If she gives her shares to one person,

171
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,940
it'll be game over for everyone else.

172
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,210
So be nice to her while you can.

173
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,640
That will help us out later, okay?

174
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,310
Is that...

175
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,680
how things go?

176
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,890
The final legislative bill
for the new business.

177
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,490
Does that mean all the legal issues
are taken care of?

178
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Yes, that's right.

179
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,370
Do you know her?

180
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,170
Who do you mean?

181
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,610
The mother...

182
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,210
of the teenage victim.

183
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,480
Do you know each other?

184
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,810
Of course not.

185
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,620
I don't like people who make secrets.

186
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,420
Secrets are never pleasant.

187
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,160
It's either fishy stuff
or a weakness that must be hidden.

188
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,460
What do you mean by that?

189
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,000
You already have a record,
so you wouldn't do it again.

190
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,940
I have no secrets.

191
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,510
That's good to know.

192
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,420
(Mingang Distribution)

193
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,630
Are you still working on
your personal business?

194
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,830
Just so you know,
this is an official call.

195
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,370
All the legalities are in place
for the new business,

196
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,410
so we must put things in motion tomorrow.

197
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,050
That means all that's left
is to sign the actual contract.

198
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,210
It's not just a verbal agreement.

199
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,310
That's right.

200
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,020
I need to know when you will fly out...

201
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,390
so we can plan our schedule.

202
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,590
I'm meeting someone later.
I'll call you soon afterward.

203
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,990
Okay.

204
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,830
I don't know what you're up to,
but good luck.

205
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,030
Thanks.

206
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,690
You waited a long time.

207
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,090
I'll see him today...

208
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,760
and hear the full story.

209
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,570
And then...

210
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,470
I'll avenge you.

211
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,450
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

212
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,190
Hello?

213
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,960
It's me, sir.

214
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,460
Jo Pil Doo.

215
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,490
Who?

216
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,030
You forgot already?

217
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,830
I'm Jo Pil Doo. I did time in your place.

218
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,000
What do you want?

219
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,370
We're not close enough
to exchange niceties.

220
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,640
A young man came to see me not long ago.

221
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,310
CEO Han's son.

222
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,310
Who came to see you?

223
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,750
CEO Han's son.

224
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,850
He lost his parents overnight,

225
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,950
so I thought he'd be a pauper,

226
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,420
but he turned into a decent young man...

227
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,660
who seems pretty capable.

228
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,060
Why did he come looking for you?

229
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,900
I don't know what he heard and where from,

230
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,830
but he asked me why his parents died.

231
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,670
And who was behind their death.

232
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,970
I haven't told him anything yet,

233
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,270
but I plan to now.

234
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,740
I wasted most of my life,

235
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,480
and for once,
I think I should do the right thing.

236
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,380
If he came to see me,

237
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,120
that means his grudge
is deeply set into his soul.

238
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,190
It is many years too late,
but you should also...

239
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,600
admit to what you did
and ask for forgiveness.

240
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,200
That's the way out.

241
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,440
The mean hag.

242
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,040
She isn't the only person
who sells ramyeon.

243
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,850
I won't buy from her again.

244
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Mr. Jo.

245
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,500
Mr. Jo!

246
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,000
Mr. Jo.

247
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,100
Mr. Jo!

248
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,440
Mr. Jo.

249
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,540
Is this 911?

250
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,850
I need an ambulance. Yes.

251
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,120
(Hankuk Hospital)

252
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,940
He was hit in the back of the head
with great force.

253
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,940
The emergency surgery saved his life,

254
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,910
but I'm sorry to say he's unconscious.

255
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,010
Who was it?

256
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,210
Who would go to such lengths
to silence you?

257
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,920
Is it the person I think it is?

258
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,020
I'm glad it was taken care of.

259
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,120
I didn't expect that.

260
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,460
It was sudden, but not a total surprise.

261
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,730
Don't you remember?

262
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,460
He was smart even as a kid.

263
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,730
He adored his dad.

264
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,870
Did he?

265
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm glad it's over.

266
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,010
You must be CEO Han's son.

267
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,380
Don't you know me?

268
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,410
You must know me.

269
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,550
I'm on TV and in the papers every day.

270
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,020
I'm pretty famous, you see.

271
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,520
Who do you respect the most in the world?

272
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,920
My dad.

273
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,800
It's your dad?

274
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,510
What if I were
to shoot your dad with a gun?

275
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,910
What would you do?

276
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,880
I'll get hit instead.

277
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,640
You're a good boy.

278
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,810
And then...

279
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,610
I will...

280
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,980
shoot you.

281
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,890
In my dad's stead.

282
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,130
Dinner's ready.

283
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,900
What's wrong? Do you feel unwell?

284
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,570
It's nothing.

285
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,090
What is it?

286
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,520
Do you have something to say?

287
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,960
What would you do if I were shot?

288
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,560
Would you take the bullet for me?

289
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,600
If you were shot?

290
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,900
I would get in the way
if someone threw a rock at you,

291
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,340
- but a gun...
- You won't?

292
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,870
Even if the shot were to kill me?

293
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,280
I could order you...

294
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,380
a bulletproof vest beforehand.

295
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,180
You said...

296
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,250
you'd pretend to die
if Father told you to die.

297
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,020
That's like putting on a show.

298
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,820
Taking a bullet for him
is a different matter.

299
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,660
One shot could kill me.

300
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,090
Why did you ask me that?

301
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,360
Is someone threatening to shoot you?

302
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,400
My gosh...

303
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,940
Can't you say what you don't mean?

304
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,270
You should say...

305
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,340
you'd take not just a bullet for him
but a cannonball too.

306
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,540
Why should I say what I don't mean?

307
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,750
Do you think he'd feel touched?

308
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,480
Dream on. He's not like that at all.

309
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,690
My father's heart is so hardened
that it has turned to stone.

310
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,190
If you know that,
you must try harder to win him over.

311
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,320
Why give up?

312
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,290
Win him over? My father?

313
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,800
If anyone does that,

314
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,770
I'll bow to them deeply.

315
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,640
Hi, Dad.

316
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,210
We're just talking.

317
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,250
My father-in-law's a bit weird.

318
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,650
Chairman Min? What could be wrong?

319
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,250
There should be no problems
with the assault all covered up.

320
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,520
I don't know what's up.

321
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,690
I'm a bit worried about it, that's all.

322
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,760
He might have a change of heart.

323
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,030
Okay. I'll think about it too. Bye.

324
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,130
I wonder what got into the chairman.

325
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,330
Is something else wrong now?

326
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,900
He got all sentimental,
which is out of character,

327
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,610
and asked his son something weird.

328
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,140
That's because he's lonely.

329
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,050
He has no friends at all.

330
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,150
Knowing what he's like,

331
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,380
I wouldn't be surprised
if someone wanted revenge.

332
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,790
He can be pretty nasty.

333
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,190
Should I become his friend?

334
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,390
You?

335
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,260
Why not? We're the same age.

336
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,890
We could chat in his office...

337
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,490
and talk about life
over drinks after work.

338
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,500
You're not good at much,
but I do know you're good at being funny.

339
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,200
You would cheer him up.

340
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,640
That's as silly as wanting to make
a cucumber salad with a sea cucumber.

341
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,470
I strive to share happiness with others.

342
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,380
So why are you so beautiful these days?

343
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,880
(Mingang Distribution)

344
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,020
Did you clean up Se Ri's mess properly?

345
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,550
I don't have to worry?

346
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,620
Of course not.

347
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,730
You've been a bit strange since yesterday.

348
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,360
Is something wrong?

349
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,530
I made a mistake.

350
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,130
A mistake?

351
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,640
I sprayed a weedkiller...

352
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,710
and thought that would be good enough.

353
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,940
But...

354
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,280
this one weed had taken root.

355
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,180
I thought it had died,
but it came back to bother me.

356
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,120
What do you mean?

357
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,450
I'm telling you not to be like me.

358
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,090
Don't give Se Ri's victim an out.

359
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,560
You must suffocate them.

360
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,090
If you show them mercy,
they'll take advantage of you.

361
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,260
If you let them close,

362
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,100
they'll cling to your ankle
and crawl up your leg.

363
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,400
Then they'll use your knee
to boost them up to reach your shoulders.

364
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,540
In the end,

365
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,710
they'll sit on top of your head.

366
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,880
That's what they're like.

367
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,080
Don't worry.

368
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,950
I took care of everything...

369
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,850
so they can't cling to me.

370
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,040
What are you doing?

371
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,380
You have such weird taste.

372
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,410
Don't you fear my sister?

373
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,250
She gives me the chills sometimes.

374
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,050
What are you saying?

375
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,720
You must steel your mind
if you want to be Kyung Chae's man.

376
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,260
Whatever it is you imagine,
she'll dish up something worse.

377
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,960
What does that mean?

378
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,100
A family is ruined.

379
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,730
The kid Se Ri assaulted.

380
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,440
I bet her whole family got squashed.

381
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,890
Ma'am.

382
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,690
What are we to do
if you want us gone just like that?

383
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,690
Do I have to worry about that too?

384
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,530
You paid minimal rent
and ran a pretty nice business.

385
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,460
You should thank me.

386
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,230
What kind of a reaction is this?

387
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,800
I know you gave us a good deal,

388
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,540
but this is so sudden.

389
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,010
I didn't think things would move so fast.

390
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,840
Did you sell the building?

391
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,110
Someone offered to buy it
for double the market value.

392
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,750
Wouldn't you sell it if you were me?

393
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,050
You said we could stay
for as long as we wanted.

394
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,090
You said we could stay
until we decided to leave.

395
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,260
It's not right to change your mind now.

396
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,790
Are you saying I went back on my promise?

397
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,330
You did.

398
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,530
You acted like you were so generous.

399
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,770
My goodness.

400
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,130
I get what's going on.

401
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,900
Give us some time to think.

402
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,940
What's there to think about?

403
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,410
You do as the landlord says.

404
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,080
Ma'am.

405
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,430
Hello, sir. It's Mi So.

406
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,270
Hi, Mi So. How are you?

407
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,470
You wouldn't be well
considering what happened.

408
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,510
Why did you call?

409
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,110
I called your mother,
but she didn't pick up.

410
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,980
So I had to call you.

411
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,480
What's this about?

412
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,750
You see...

413
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,950
The school's disciplinary committee
just made its ruling.

414
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,490
You will be expelled.

415
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
What?

416
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,130
Why would I be expelled?

417
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,430
You were involved in an assault,

418
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,300
and Semyung International High
decided to cancel your admission.

419
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,070
We had no choice but to take action.

420
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,870
What?

421
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,670
Is it true that Semyung
canceled my admission?

422
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,210
Are you sure of that?

423
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,190
Who buys a building
for double the price in this economy?

424
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,630
And what does the new landlord
have against us...

425
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,100
that they insist we move out?

426
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,070
Is that true?

427
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,330
Did Semyung International High
cancel my admission?

428
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,840
My teacher said you knew.

429
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,970
What...

430
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,040
Well, Mi So...

431
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,280
I asked if it was true!

432
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,340
Was my admission really canceled?

433
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,510
It was a shock to me too.

434
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,620
Why didn't you tell me?

435
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,520
You made me look like a fool.

436
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,950
My homeroom teacher called.

437
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,560
Because I instigated an assault,

438
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,730
the disciplinary committee...

439
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,830
decided to have me expelled.

440
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,230
What do you mean?

441
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,570
You'll be expelled?

442
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,140
I can't go to high school
and I'll be expelled.

443
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,810
Why is all this happening at once?

444
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,940
What did I do to deserve this?

445
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,740
Mi So.

446
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,780
I'll reveal the truth.

447
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,050
Mi So!

448
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,320
Mi So!

449
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,450
Baek Mi So.

450
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,860
You can't go anywhere in your condition.

451
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,690
I'll tell everyone the truth.

452
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,130
Where will you go? Who will you talk to?

453
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,130
Do you think people are out there...

454
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,360
waiting to hear from you?

455
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,670
This wouldn't have happened
if that were the case.

456
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,300
I wanted to go to that school so badly.

457
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,070
I'd even planned how to spend...

458
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,180
my three years there.

459
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,810
I dreamed of my high school life...

460
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,720
and I was so excited.

461
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,080
I know that.

462
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,320
How couldn't I?

463
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,590
That school was my dream, Mom.

464
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,190
I wanted to go to
that international high school,

465
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,890
study hard,

466
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,930
and go to a prestigious university.

467
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,330
I wanted to make you proud and happy.

468
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,470
But I can't anymore.

469
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,860
Why must I suffer...

470
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,990
when I'm the victim?

471
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,830
That girl will be out there laughing.

472
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,930
Why should I cry?

473
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,770
Why is the world like this?

474
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,080
It's so unfair.

475
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,780
This isn't right.

476
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,960
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

477
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,310
Do you think Mingang Distribution
doesn't know about you?

478
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,140
I told you not to fight,
that you'd get crushed.

479
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,680
Why are you doing this to us?
What did we do that was so wrong?

480
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,110
You still don't get what you did wrong?

481
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,420
I look back at everything that happened
since the incident.

482
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,920
I'd rather...

483
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,790
you say to me that you can't do anything.

484
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,920
Just apologize!

485
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,690
I promise. I'll take care of everything...

486
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,300
so we can live like we did before.
