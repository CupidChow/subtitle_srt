This is delicious. Gosh!

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,800
This spicy seafood broth is invigorating
and has a nice kick to it.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,040
It has this clean, savory finish.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,040
I can't believe how fresh this is.

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,440
Seeing me enjoy it this much,

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,640
I'm sure you all feel confident buying it,
right?

I know you better than anyone.

12
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,430
Cut!

13
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,340
We sold out!

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,640
- We're sold out, everyone!
- Yes!

15
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,310
We've sold out of everything
we prepared for today.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,580
Thanks to all of you, our first livestream
was a huge success.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,780
We'll see you next time
with an even better product.

18
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,850
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,640
Looks like they still have
most of their stock left.

20
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,410
No wonder. She can't even taste it.

21
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,420
True.

22
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,550
I heard she's allergic to seafood.

23
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,920
- But she looks perfectly fine.
- She's fighting to hide it.

24
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,760
But it's obvious how this will end.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,330
The online trolls forced her to taste it,

26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,400
but her stomach must be
killing her right now.

27
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,100
I should check today's sales figures
and our remaining inventory.

28
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,140
I need to submit a report to the Chairman.

29
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,240
I'm sure he's eagerly awaiting
for the results.

30
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,920

all enjoyed our first livestream.

Yes, hello?

00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,450
Is it true my mom's in the hospital?
Which one is she at?

45
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,950
Calm down.

46
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,750
She's asleep right now.

47
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,990
I said, which hospital is she at?

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,230
Is my mom okay?

49
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,660
Yes, she is.

50
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,760
Your mom is fine, so don't worry.

51
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,340
Are you crying?

52
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,400
Just tell me the name of the hospital.

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,940
It's Hankuk Hospital.

54
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,640
I'm on my way now. Look after my mom
until I'm there. Got it?

55
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,750
"My mom?"

56
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,820
How does it feel?

57
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,730
To be called "Mom"
by the person who is responsible...

58
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,860
for your daughter's death?

59
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,800
- Ms. Se Ri, where are you off to again?
- To see my mom.

60
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,840
It seems Se Ri is more taken
with that woman than the Chairman is.

61
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,710
What on earth is her secret?

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,010
I know, right?

63
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,320
How does she get people
so wrapped around her finger?

64
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,920
Just you wait. Sooner or later,

65
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,350
Se Ri would probably play dead
if that woman told her to.

66
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,990
How can you say that?
She has a birth mother,

67
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,660
and it already makes my blood boil
that she calls some stranger "Mom."

68
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,300
Oh, my! Wait, Se Ri has a birth mother?

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,370
- Where is she?
- Oh, don't be silly. Of course not.

70
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,900
- I was just saying.
- It didn't sound like it to me.

71
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,810
Manager Gong, you know something,
don't you?

72
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,540
- If you do, you have to tell me.
- No, I don't know anything at all.

73
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,980
What was that?

74
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,290
Does she know something or not?

75
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,400
Are you feeling any better?

76
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,400
Where am I?

77
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,140
You're at the hospital. You were
brought in for anaphylactic shock.

78
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,540
If it's that severe,
you shouldn't have eaten it.

79
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,680
Why did you go through with it?

80
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,450
- We were live. What was I supposed to do?
- Unbelievable.

81
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,390
You're lucky it wasn't worse.

82
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,490
It could have been really serious.

83
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,860
Mom.

84
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Se Ri.

85
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,100
How did you know I was here?

86
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,500
With our condition,
eating seafood could kill you.

87
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,140
What were you thinking?
You could have died.

88
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,340
Is the livestream really that important?

89
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,810
Why would you do something so stupid?

90
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,490
My poor Se Ri.
You were so worried about me.

91
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,960
Don't cry.

92
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,590
I'm okay.

93
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm okay, so please stop crying.

94
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,070
Here are today's sales figures.

95
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,410
This is just from the livestream,

96
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,510
and the orders are still rolling in.

97
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,240
What about her?

98
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,650
She couldn't even sell
half of her initial stock.

99
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,190
Can a meal kit even compete
with a puffer jacket on price?

100
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,720
It was an uphill battle,
but I didn't back down.

101
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,330
That's even worse
than the chain store's sales.

102
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,500
How could she not sell out a product
with such a low barrier to entry?

103
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,630
You see?

104
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,100
At the end of the day,
results speak for themselves.

105
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,600
This is hard data.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,610
You still think I'm not qualified?

107
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,580
Do you still doubt my abilities?

108
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,080
Will you still drag me down
from my CEO position?

109
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,710
Put your personal feelings aside.

110
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,990
Take a good look and see
who the right person is for Mingang!

111
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,220
Withdraw the motion to dismiss me.

112
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,760
And don't you ever,

113
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,200
so much as mention putting anyone
but me in the CEO's chair.

114
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,780
What did the Chairman say?

115
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,280
What could he say?

116
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,050
How could he argue when I shoved
the sales numbers in his face?

117
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,050
Then you should get back
to the office as soon as possible.

118
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,550
That's the plan.

119
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,290
When someone is rushed to the hospital,

120
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,460
the least you can do is ask
how they're doing.

121
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,070
- Who was taken to the hospital?
- You're really pretending you don't know?

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,240
- Lucia collapsed during the livestream.
- Oh, did she?

123
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,980
- And I thought it was something serious.
- What did you just say?

124
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,080
She's your family.
Aren't you worried at all?

125
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,550
You may not be blood-related,

126
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,220
but you still live under the same roof.

127
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,760
Don't talk about what you don't know.
Some families are worse than strangers.

128
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,690
Do you have any idea how agonizing it is
living in the same house?

129
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,800
It's a living hell.

130
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,000
If it's hell for you,
did you ever consider she's in hell too?

131
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,870
Whose side are you on?

132
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,740
Stick to company business,
and stay out of my family matters.

133
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,080
Try having a stepmother your age,
Director Moon.

134
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,710
Then let's see you spout
that nonsense about "family."

135
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,400
You should go to Hankuk Hospital.

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,630
That's where your wife is right now.

137
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,700
What? Why is she there?

138
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,140
She fainted during the livestream
and was taken to the hospital,

139
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,980
but she's stable now
after receiving emergency treatment.

140
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,650
She said not to tell you,
not to worry you,

141
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,820
but I felt you had to know.

142
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,550
She must have been nervous
about her first broadcast.

143
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,790
If the CEO position was riding
on these sales results,

144
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,690
does this mean CEO Min
is being reinstated?

145
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,830
Those were the terms. My hands are tied.

146
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,760
They competed fair and square,
and this is the result.

147
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,830
Fair and square?

148
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,540
What about damage control
with the shopping host and the trolls?

149
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,570
Money talks.

150
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,910
A little cash was all it took
to keep their mouths shut.

151
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,710
Make sure nothing leaks.
If the Chairman finds out...

152
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,950
That won't happen.

153
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,550
I mean, they drew lots
in front of everyone,

154
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,350
the shopping host went off the grid
for personal reasons,

155
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,820
and all comments and sales were online,
so how would he ever know?

156
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,030
This was going to happen anyway.
They made things needlessly complicated.

157
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,300
So now, all we have to do
is call a board meeting,

158
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,230
reject the motion for your dismissal,

159
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,270
and cancel your transfer
to the online team. That's it, right?

160
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,140
That's the plan.

161
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,710
That was a close call.
I hear allergic reactions can be fatal.

162
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,750
Is she feeling better now?

163
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,710
She recovered quickly.

164
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,620
Still, it's a shame
everything fell apart like this.

165
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,450
She had to pick that one,

166
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,260
and on top of that,
they got lucky and sold out.

167
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,730
When the sales numbers are that different,
she's completely boxed in.

168
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,670
So the CEO position will go back
to Min Kyung Chae?

169
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,100
What a shame.

170
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,970
I really thought we were going
to get them this time.

171
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,710
What's on your mind?

172
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,950
There's just something
that doesn't sit right with me.

173
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,820
What is it?

174
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,160
It's nothing. Never mind.

175
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,830
I was just about to head home.
What are you doing here?

176
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,730
So we could go home together.

177
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,640
Your daughter pulled off quite a feat.
Go and congratulate her.

178
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,340
And give her the CEO position back.

179
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,940
And you? You're the Chairman's wife.
You'd enjoy being a mere staff member?

180
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,310
I don't mind.

181
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,080
I already told you.

182
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,020
As long as I'm by your side, it's enough.

183
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,480
How did it come to this?

184
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,620
I thought you were going to put that brat
in her place for me.

185
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,420
If this is how it's going to be,

186
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,490
I'm just a father
hindering his talented daughter,

187
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,830
nothing more than a petty old man.

188
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,860
She earned that position
with her own abilities.

189
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,300
And that's why she won't listen
to a word I say.

190
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,570
She turned the tables all on her own.

191
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,440
Come on, try to be proud
of her for a change.

192
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,940
You're so understanding.
I wish she appreciated it.

193
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,880
Where are you heading to work tomorrow?

194
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,450
- I'm not sure.
- Go to the CEO's office.

195
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,650
You're still the CEO, after all.

196
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Even if it's a temporary title,
you're the CEO the Chairman appointed.

197
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,190
Until the board makes it official,
you report to that office.

198
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,240
I heard what happened.

199
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,170
Are you feeling any better?

200
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,510
I am.

201
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,210
Mom!

202
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,980
See? I said I'd be right home.

203
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,090
I had to get back to you.
I knew you'd be worried sick.

204
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,050
I was worried about
how I'd sleep alone tonight.

205
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,360
I'll be right here with you.

206
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,790
I can't sleep unless
I'm next to you either.

207
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,500
I suppose I have to stay healthy
for Se Ri's sake.

208
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,070
She came to see me
at the hospital earlier.

209
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,110
The poor thing
was just bawling her eyes out.

210
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,480
I have to eat well and live
a long and healthy life.

211
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,050
That way, I can see Se Ri get married
and be there for her, right?

212
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,060
- Do what?
- I'm her mother. Why wouldn't I?

213
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,760
After I help her find a good husband
and get married,

214
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,000
of course, it'll be my job to help her
through pregnancy and childbirth.

215
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,330
That's just what mothers of daughters do.

216
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,970
Oh, right. You don't have any children,
so you wouldn't know about these things.

217
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,480
I hear some women,
even after having a child,

218
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,440
hide the fact that they're a mother...

219
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,380
and live without ever being
treated like one.

220
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,450
Gosh, how pitiful.

221
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,960
To never hear their child call them "Mom."

222
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,690
What's the point of all that success?

223
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,130
She said...

224
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,800
all of that just to get to me, right?

225
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,070
It certainly seems that way.
I wonder how much she really knows.

226
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,770
For some reason,

227
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,480
I have a feeling she knows everything.

228
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,610
That's impossible.
If she knew, why pretend she doesn't?

229
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,960
Oh, perfect timing.
I was just coming to see you about this.

230
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,800
What is this?

231
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,370
It's the penalty invoice for the host
who left the broadcast without notice.

232
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,170
Please review this
and take the appropriate legal action.

233
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,340
What's the point of this?
It won't undo what already happened.

234
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,810
What is your problem?

235
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,450
You're a lawyer.
Don't tell me you don't know contracts.

236
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,380
When a contract is broken,
holding them accountable...

237
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,520
is your job, isn't it, Lawyer Kim?

238
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,390
Hey.

239
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,400
Do you think you can just
walk out like that?

240
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,100
Are you serious?
After yesterday's results?

241
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,730
The CEO position was on the line.

242
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,940
But it's not official yet,

243
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,340
and it still needs to be
approved by the board.

244
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,710
Seeing Lucia as CEO, even temporarily,
makes my skin crawl, and I'm furious.

245
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,750
The way she parades around home and work,
all because she has Father's support.

246
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,520
You think I'm enjoying this?

247
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,920
It is what it is. We have to deal with it.

248
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,760
No. I refuse to.

249
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,300
(Mingang Distribution)

250
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,070
What are you doing here?

251
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,750
I asked, why are you still here?

252
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,480
Did you not see yesterday's sales results?

253
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,150
It's an order from the Chairman.

254
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,690
He said to work in the CEO's office
until the board reaches a decision.

255
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,590
So go back to your desk and work.

256
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,390
Are you really acting like
you don't know what's going on?

257
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,530
Is "what's going on" more important
than the Chairman's order?

258
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,860
Do you think digging in your heels
like this will change anything?

259
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,200
You just look pathetic right now.

260
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,670
You're the one who's pathetic, not me.

261
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,840
Oh, right. We're at the company.
Should I be calling you Ms. Min?

262
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,410
Watch your mouth.

263
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,250
I won that fair and square,
and it's despicable to deny it.

264
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,750
Are you questioning a competition that was
fully transparent from start to finish?

265
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,690
I know you won fair and square.

266
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,590
I know, but for now, do as you're told.

267
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,930
Nothing good will come from
defying the Chairman.

268
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,860
Can't you just wait a few days?

269
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,500
Come back after the board
makes it official.

270
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,730
I'll gladly give up the office then.

271
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,640
Should I call security?
Want a repeat of last time? Then stay put.

272
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,190
Is she really trying to kick you out
of the CEO's office?

273
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,530
She must think she won
because of yesterday.

274
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,830
I'll admit,
based on the results, it was a landslide.

275
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,730
Assuming the process itself was clean.

276
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,540
What's that supposed to mean?

277
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,940
Something just doesn't sit right with me.

278
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,680
Out of all the products,
that one just happened to be chosen,

279
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,510
and then the shopping host
just happened to bail.

280
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,980
All of these so-called coincidences...

281
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,290
just seem off.

282
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,390
My stepmother likes this tea too.

283
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,100
So save some for her.

284
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,000
She's probably having something nicer out.
You don't need to save her any of this.

285
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,370
Ms. Se Ri, why are you so fond
of your new stepmother?

286
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,040
Do you need a reason to like someone?
I just do.

287
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,940
- That woman...
- I told you not to call her that!

288
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,810
Goodness. You look like
you're about to hit me.

289
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,380
Seriously, is that any way to talk
to your sister-in-law?

290
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,950
Then don't be so disrespectful.

291
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,960
You're completely under her spell,
aren't you?

292
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,990
Fine. Your precious stepmother.

293
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,660
Let me ask you. If Father were to hand
over the chairmanship later on,

294
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,830
who would you support
between Kyung Chae and your stepmother?

295
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,010
- Well...
- Don't tell me it's your stepmother.

296
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,310
And why not?

297
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,110
It should go to whoever is more capable.

298
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,650
Come on, that's not how it works.
You're supposed to back your sister.

299
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,880
Blood is thicker than water.

300
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,780
Ms. Se Ri, I need to have a word with you.

301
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,160
I changed your diapers.
I practically raised you.

302
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,690
Like I don't know that.

303
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,230
As the one who practically raised you,
I believe I have the right to say this.

304
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,130
- Fine, just say what you have to say!
- Ms. Se Ri.

305
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,970
It's fine that you're getting along
with your stepmother,

306
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,410
but that doesn't mean
you should hurt your sister's feelings.

307
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,140
What are you talking about?
I've been getting along fine with her.

308
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,880
That's not what I'm talking about.

309
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,280
Should I tell her or not?

310
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,450
Ms. Kyung Chae...

311
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,490
is not just your sister.

312
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,290
- If she's not just my sister, then what?
- Anyway,

313
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,760
just start treating her better from now on
so you won't have any regrets.

314
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,570
Hello, is this the Legal Team?
This is Moon Tae Kyung of the Online Team.

315
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,870
I'm calling to check the penalty fee claim
for the shopping host.

316
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,310
Excuse me?

317
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,340
What do you mean
the request was never submitted?

318
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,280
No, that can't be right.

319
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,010
Okay, got it.

320
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,590
What's wrong?

321
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,890
Did the Legal Team mess something up?

322
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,360
- It seems Lawyer Kim never filed it.
- What?

323
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,760
Sun Jae is not the sloppy type.
He's razor-sharp about his work.

324
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,830
Why would he make a mistake like that?

325
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,940
I'll have to check on it myself.

326
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,330
Hello. Excuse me.

327
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,160
- Where did you get that raffle box?
- Someone asked me to get rid of it,

328
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,900
so I was about to throw it out.

329
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,100
- Who?
- Lawyer Kim Sun Jae.

330
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Unbelievable.

331
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,310
I'll take care of it.
Please give it to me.

332
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880
Oh, I don't think I can do that.

333
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,980
The lawyer specifically told me
to throw it out myself.

334
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,980
I need to check something, please let me.
I promise I'll dispose of it properly.

335
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,820
Gosh.

336
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,730
They must have switched the raffle boxes.

337
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,400
Min Kyung Chae had the one
she was going to draw palmed in her hand.

338
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,040
So she was
just putting on a show for everyone.

339
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,110
And inside this one, to make sure
you couldn't draw anything else,

340
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,110
they must have rigged it.

341
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,120
Should we see if our hunch is correct?

345
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,880
Just as I thought.

346
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,320
It's just as I expected.

347
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,050
This means Kim Sun Jae...

348
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,320
must be behind the shopping host.

349
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,360
He probably paid her off
and told her to lie low somewhere.

350
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,730
I'll have to ask Madam Jang
to look for her.

351
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,800
I'll check the puffer jacket buyer list.
Something about it seems suspicious.

352
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,610
Hey, Director. Moon.

353
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,880
About that shopping host...

354
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,210
We've lost contact and have no address,
so it seems impossible to find her.

355
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,720
- So what should we do?
- Well, nothing we can do then.

356
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,490
What was that?

357
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,520
What's gotten into him?

358
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,700
You're sucking those things down
morning and night.

359
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,840
Didn't you hear from Ja Kyung?
Our in-law's young wife is doting on him,

360
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,410
finding him all sorts of healthy tonics.
I don't have a young wife,

361
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,840
so I have to look after myself.

362
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,910
That makes sense for him, as he remarried.
What do you need all that energy for?

363
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,810
What's that supposed to mean?

364
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,350
I need to invest in my health
before the cold weather really sets in.

365
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,120
That way, I'll get through the winter.
Imagine if I get sick.

366
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,620
You'd be the one stuck taking care of me.

367
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,160
Oh, really? If it's so great,
you could have offered me some.

368
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,060
What am I, chopped liver?

369
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,400
Why do we both need to take it?
It's enough if just one of us takes it.

370
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,100
If I'm healthy, then you're healthy too.

371
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,800
You're so selfish.

372
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,200
All right, fine. Here, drink up.

373
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,910
Hey, it's already empty.

374
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,910
There's a bit left. Add water and drink.
The dregs at the bottom are the best part.

375
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,380
- Here.
- Oh, for crying out loud!

376
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,580
Why hasn't Ja Kyung called?
I'm dying of curiosity.

377
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,050
I wonder who got the CEO position.

378
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,320
You're curious about the silliest things.
If it's not Ji Seop, who cares?

379
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,330
Then again, Ji Seop is
a total outcast over there.

380
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,500
That family is so bizarre
when you think about it.

381
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,760
Meanwhile, our family
is peaceful and happy...

382
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,600
because I'm
such a wonderful head of the household.

383
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,640
Ever heard of knocking?

384
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,880
Should I apologize for being so rude
to a senior managing director...

385
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,640
since I'm just a staff member?

386
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,510
I saw the sales figures
from the livestream.

387
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,080
You really stuck it to them!

388
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,020
The board is going to meet soon.

389
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,020
Just don't pull any tricks
with Director Oh.

390
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,260
I'll be reinstated as CEO at once.

391
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,660
- Why would I do that?
- You and Lucia have a thing, don't you?

392
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,860
You've got me all wrong.

393
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,030
I always side with whoever has power.
And right now, that's you.

394
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,100
And?

395
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,870
You're on my side?

396
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,610
As long as you're in power.

(Mingang Distribution)

398
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,290
Something felt off,
so I checked the list of buyers,

399
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,730
and a single ID was used
to purchase a huge number of jackets.

(Credit Card, Express Pay)

401
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,030
Who would buy so many unless they resell?

402
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,900
One person buying this many
makes no sense.

403
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,700
And there's more.

404
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,740
For starters, they hit over 10,000 viewers
in the first 10 minutes.

405
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,940
Their comment section was full of praise,
while ours was nothing but hate.

406
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,850
So you're saying
they might have hired a troll farm.

407
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,590
It's also highly likely
the sales figures were fabricated.

408
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,920
So I looked up
the buyers' shipping addresses,

409
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,860
and they were all going
to the same address.

410
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,260
Where was it?

(Mingang Distribution)

412
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,850
This is the address.

413
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,220
A warehouse?
Then it wasn't a regular customer.

414
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,750
Excuse me, sir.

415
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,460
What's all this?

416
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,990
I'm moving this to the incinerator
for someone.

417
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,960
Why do you ask?

418
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,230
Do you mind if I check what's inside?

419
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,740
Go ahead.

420
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,050
It's just as we suspected.

421
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,250
How could they think
of burning brand-new products?

422
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,850
Inflated sales.

423
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,820
This alone is grounds
for disciplinary action against them.

424
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,130
We're taking these.

425
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,560
You can't do that!
I was told to incinerate all this.

426
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:13,440
If you don't want to be an accomplice,
you'll back off right now.

427
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,670
If you didn't know what was happening,
you might get some leniency.

428
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,780
How could you let them take it?

429
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,080
They just showed up out of nowhere
and took everything.

430
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,410
What was I supposed to do?

431
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,980
You idiot!

432
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,980
No wonder you're stuck in a dead-end job.

433
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Darn it!

434
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,160
What's wrong?

435
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,460
Moon Tae Kyung and that woman
found the jackets we siphoned off.

436
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,970
What did you say?

437
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,470
This is all the evidence we need.
