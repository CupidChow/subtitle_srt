1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,250
We're actually a dating couple.

2
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,200
I brought some warm water with sea salt.

3
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,570
I got into all sorts of trouble
because you sent me to the doctor.

4
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,570
We got mistaken for a cheating couple.

5
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,810
What do you mean by that?

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,210
Never mind.

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,680
I can take care of...

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,680
my own health,
so don't make a fuss anymore.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,650
You're not my legal guardian.
Why did you call Doctor Yoon?

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,890
Exactly. That is your wife's job.

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,530
I'm all you have,
so I have to do that for you.

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,790
What?

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,430
Unless you'll stay single forever,

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,100
why don't you find
a lady you like even now?

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,700
What got into you?

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,570
You keep bringing that up,
and it makes me think you want to marry.

17
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,670
You find someone yourself.

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,180
At my age?

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,080
What about me? What about my age?

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,150
(Episode 19)

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,490
You don't look too good.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,330
Is the work a bit too much?

23
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,260
We're often strapped for cash.
It's no big deal.

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,230
It's all about
how you overcome the crisis.

25
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,800
How is Se Ri these days?

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,940
She studies so hard.

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,670
She said she'd stay
at the academy until late tonight.

28
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,970
That's good to know.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
It would be much worse
if she were causing trouble too.

30
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,320
You asked Soo Jung
to let you use her reserve funds?

31
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,490
Why ask when you told her to say no?

32
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,290
Come on.

33
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,860
Do you think Soo Jung is the type
to be controlled?

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,900
To be honest, you shouldn't have asked.

35
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,270
Why not?

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,100
The store chain and my project
are all Mingang's businesses.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,470
I know you're stuck,
but let's not be irrational.

38
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,940
Why do you think
Father separated the store...

39
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,410
and your online business?

40
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,710
If businesses keep sharing funds,

41
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,950
when one goes down, so does the other.

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,920
You should've done a better job.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,950
Do better yourself.

44
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,150
This involves you too.

45
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,360
You're a vice director.

46
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,260
I can't stand that brat.

47
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,200
Darn her! I like her less each day.

48
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,570
Even sparrows squawk before they die,
and that's what she's doing.

49
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,480
She must still think she has a shot.

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,450
I doubt that. I bet
she feels more suffocated each day.

51
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,480
She's too prideful to shut down
a business she started,

52
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,750
but the thought of keeping it going
is killing her.

53
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,220
It's really odd.

54
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,120
Knowing Kyung Chae,

55
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,890
shouldn't she have
murdered Director Moon long ago?

56
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,300
She's the one who brought him in.

57
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,930
It's her ego talking.

58
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,100
Is it nothing but her ego?

59
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,270
What else is there?

60
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,870
Do you think Kyung Chae
has feelings for Director Moon?

61
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,570
I don't think so.

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,710
Kyung Chae is like our dad
and has a heart of stone.

63
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,280
She's called Icy Witch for a reason.

64
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,380
(Mingang Distribution)

65
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,420
Sales went up a great deal.

66
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,920
You might exceed your goal at this rate.

67
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,360
We should've set a higher goal
in January if we'd known.

68
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,990
Shall I adjust it?

69
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,460
You're doing well.

70
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,860
We'll have the final numbers
at the end of the year,

71
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,800
but this is pretty good
for the second quarter.

72
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,330
I'd love to double the sales
if I could get my way.

73
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,770
That much?

74
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,210
Sounds good.
An entrepreneur should be ambitious.

75
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,480
What will you do?

76
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,380
Your sister is flying high.

77
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,210
You can't flail around forever.

78
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,950
If neither the new business
nor Director Moon is working,

79
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,820
wrap it up instead of dragging things on.

80
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,490
Father.

81
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,520
A distribution business
with no funds is as good as dead.

82
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,830
It's not just a temporary issue.

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,860
You've had this problem for four years.

84
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,730
Soon, you'll have to honor
promissory notes and debts.

85
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,830
That will take a miracle
unless you get some cash.

86
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,840
Why are you so negatively extreme?

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,200
You had high hopes for the new platform.

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,810
I did, and you crushed those hopes.

89
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,480
You gave Director Moon
too much authority and coddled him,

90
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,180
which is why you're stuck.

91
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,450
Don't worry.

92
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,980
I'll get funding and solve the issue.

93
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,620
Anyone can say that.

94
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,090
I'm taking you to next month's
entrepreneur gathering.

95
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,990
You always took Kyung Chae.

96
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,230
I'll take you this time.
It'll look better.

97
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,070
I can't believe what I just heard.

98
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,480
Father invited me
to the entrepreneur gathering.

99
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,550
Will you give me some tips?

100
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,250
Oh, you don't have
the time for that, do you?

101
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,320
How dare she...

102
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,390
Calm down.

103
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,530
I wanted to drop the gatherings
that were nothing but hassle.

104
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,200
It works for me.

(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

107
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,050
We need to pay some of our suppliers.

108
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,420
I'll sign it later.

109
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,870
Why won't you say anything?

110
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,200
If you read what I gave you,

111
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,470
you must have questions
about Director Moon.

112
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,710
Not that again.

113
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,310
If he's ruining our business
with sinister motives...

114
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,550
I heard you call that "forced roasting."

115
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,910
Don't say that.

116
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,020
Look into Director Moon
even now while you can.

117
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,850
If you suspect him that badly,

118
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,690
bring me something that says he embezzled
or was professionally negligent.

119
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,090
You have a whole lot of assumptions
and not one bit of proof.

120
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,830
If Director Moon does us a disservice,
I'll be the first to kick him out.

121
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,560
That's why I'm so suspicious.

122
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,670
Why is he implementing...

123
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,170
a strategy that was proven to fail
at his previous company?

124
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,270
That's because...

125
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,010
Nothing you say is persuasive enough.

126
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,610
The failure of this business
puts himself at risk.

127
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,910
Why would he do that?

128
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,150
What if he has another desperate cause...

129
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,380
that gives him that reason?

130
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,060
Do you know
how the chairman is treating our CEO?

131
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,900
She could lose everything to her sister.

132
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,640

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,710
without you having to explain.

134
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,080
Why did you even join our company?

135
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,750
You asked me that once before.

136
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,120
Tell me why you joined.
I'd love to hear the answer.

137
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,520
Okay. Answer this question, then.

138
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,160
Why are you using strategies
that were proven...

139
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
to fail at New Buy in the US?

140
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,730
And why are you bringing on board
all the small suppliers...

141
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,570
when other distribution companies
rejected them?

142
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,940
Why are you...

143
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,580
sticking to plans that are bound to fail?

144
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,040
Where did you get that information?

145
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,750
Why? Is that something I shouldn't know?

146
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,780
Do you have some dirty secrets?

147
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,750
Listen up, Mr. Kim.

148
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,550
You'll just deny it.

149
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,220
You'll come up with excuses...

150
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,860
and reasons that sound fancy enough.

151
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,830
But I see through it all.

152
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,530
And soon, others will see through it too.

153
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,070
They'll see how craftily
you're harming the company.

154
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,240
I don't know what you have against us,

155
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,740
but it's not like the Min family
is your sworn enemy.

156
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,540
You shouldn't betray them like this.

157
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,260
We haven't talked in a while.

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,850
You haven't changed at all.

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,790
You haven't changed yourself.

180
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,490
How was life in the US?

181
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,800
I live a good life there
because it's my home.

182
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,170
Why do you look so haggard?

183
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,540
I've been stressed out at work.

184
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,310
What brought you to Korea?

185
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,240
Business, of course.

186
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,980
I was busy setting up
a private equity fund in Macau.

187
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,950
There's a whole company
to manage it, but people...

188
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,750
insist on meeting me before pledging.

189
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,820
It must be a large fund
if you're directly involved.

190
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,030
They say it's the biggest ever.

191
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,330
Now that we have the funds,
it's time to look for things to invest in.

192
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,280
Seoul's traffic jams are legendary.

193
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,180
I was at a standstill wherever I went.

194
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,350
Welcome back.

195
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,650
I checked out
a few condos while I was out,

196
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,350
but didn't like anything so far.

197
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,290
We must stay here for a while,
even though it's a hassle.

198
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,530
It's not a hassle at all.
I don't mind where we stay.

199
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,500
Did you meet CEO Min?

200
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,600
She's struggling.

201
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,170
She's so prideful that she wanted
to hide it, but she couldn't.

202
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,040
I heard she was stuck
without the necessary funds,

203
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,640
and it must be true.

204
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,110
What will you do?

205
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,010
I'll wait and see for a bit longer.

206
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,780
What about you? Did Tae Joo
get you Chairman Min's schedule?

207
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,220
The father and daughter
are strangely alike.

208
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,060
They're both proud people
and don't show their feelings.

209
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,050
It's not like the Min family
is your sworn enemy.

210
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,410
You shouldn't betray them like this.

211
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,020
You don't know anything.

212
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,570
Mr. Jo?

213
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,640
Mr. Jo.

214
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,650
I swear his finger moved.
I think he's coming around.

215
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,520
Mr. Jo?

216
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,400
Maybe you were mistaken, Ms. Jung.

217
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,270
That's odd.

218
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,610
I was sure he moved.

219
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,710
Four years is a long time to be in a coma.

220
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,610
Let's see how things go.

221
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Doctor!

222
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,460
Mr. Jo.

223
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,490
Jo Pil Doo.

224
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,700
Do you hear me?

225
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,570
If you hear me, move your finger.

226
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,470
My gosh.

227
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,340
Call his guardian.

228
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,710
Okay.

229
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,220
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

230
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,150
Hello?

231
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,190
What? Is that true?

232
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,330
Okay. I'll come over right away.

233
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,570
Did you see that?

234
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,540
He thinks so little of us that he didn't
even say where he was going.

235
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,240
It happens. Maybe it was really urgent.

236
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,980
Right. He doesn't have to report to us.

237
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,540
He can do what he wants.

238
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,980
It was pretty obvious
that it was important.

239
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,520
He rushed out,
so I guess a supplier called.

240
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,480
You people...

241
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,990
Did you all join Director Moon's fan club?

242
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,460
Don't fangirl or fanboy over him.

243
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,430
It's obvious he's slacking off.

244
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,160
(Authorized Personnel Only)

245
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,470
Nurse.

246
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,700
What happened?

247
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,970
Go on inside. He responded to us earlier.

248
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,640
Is he conscious?

249
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,510
Not yet, but there's a strong possibility.

250
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,350
It depends on the patient's will,

251
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,510
but the doctor is optimistic.

252
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,790
Okay, great. Thanks so much.

253
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,300
Thank you.

254
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,530
Thank you so much.

255
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,270
I knew this day would come.

256
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,600
Thanks for hanging in there,

257
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,610
and thank you for giving me hope.

258
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,110
Thank you.

259
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,960
I was busy setting up
a private equity fund in Macau.

260
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,500
They say it's the biggest ever.

261
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,630
Now that we have the funds,

262
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,570
it's time to look for things to invest in.

263
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,740
Stella Jang is someone worth trusting.

264
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,150
(Selling shares without parental consent)

265
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,780
What the heck?

266
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,750
I know I can sell it after I come of age.

267
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,450
I'm asking if there's a way
to sell it right now.

268
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,160
You're all morons.

269
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,560
None of you is any help at all.

270
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,070
Are you studying?

271
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,570
You might come first in your class.

272
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,140
I should study on my own
when I don't go to the academy.

273
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,080
Ms. Kyung Chae is able to hang on
because you're doing so well.

274
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,310
What's up with her?

275
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,020
Her business is doing poorly.

276
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,480
She's short on funds.

277
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,920
It would be nice if you could help her.

278
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,920
If you were an adult,
you could sell your shares...

279
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,990
and help your sister out.

280
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,960
I got in the way again.

281
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,630
Tell me if you need anything.

282
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,810
What a joke. Why would I do that?

283
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,510
I'll be left with nothing
if I sell my shares.

284
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,140
Wait and see.

285
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,950
I'll sell my shares, find my birth mom,

286
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,750
move to the US, and never come back.

287
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,350
Hello.

288
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,390
I didn't order any food today.

289
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,130
I called her for something.

290
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,900
I'll give you my parents' home address.

291
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,360
Send them your food too.

292
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,630
We'd love the extra business.

293
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,440
My parents are picky eaters.

294
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,970
Especially my dad.

295
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,610
I'll prepare their food with extra care.

296
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,740
I must say something, just in case.

297
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,480
You know you can't repeat...

298
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,980
what you heard
from one home to another, right?

299
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,080
I know I shouldn't do that.

300
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,450
That's why I only know
this is some chairman's house.

301
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,820
I don't even know which company.

302
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,320
What? You don't know what company we own?

303
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,230
We own the largest distribution company...

304
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,260
called Min...

305
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,400
Never mind.

306
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,830
It's better if you don't know.

307
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,040
I'll call my dad.

308
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,070
Don't you worry about what we eat.

309
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,480
I want to free Mom from the kitchen.

310
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,980
Your mom is so spoiled
she might turn rotten,

311
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,510
and you made things worse.

312
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,980
Dad, watch what you say
to strangers, okay?

313
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,780
You can't tell the delivery girl
about my in-laws.

314
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,450
I know what you mean.

315
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,090
I watch my tongue
even when I'm on the toilet.

316
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,790
There's always something
going on with your in-laws,

317
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,430
so the less we gossip, the better.

318
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,260
Okay, bye.

319
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,870
Our Ja Kyung is sweet and kind,
just like me.

320
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,800
That's more ridiculous
than wrapping spaghetti in kimchi.

321
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,110
Ja Kyung takes after me, not you.

322
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,780
Don't be silly. People think we're twins.

323
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,980
I'd rather watch a sloth run a marathon.

324
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,320
Ja Kyung has the face
of a Joseon-era queen,

325
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,950
and you have the face of a slave.

326
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,650
I wish she could live the life of a queen
instead of just looking like one.

327
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,530
Honey. How about this?

328
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,860
Not lending them money
isn't the only solution.

329
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,230
Go to Kyung Chae
and offer to invest in her business...

330
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,870
if she kicks out the director...

331
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,440
and promotes our son-in-law Ji Seop.

332
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,240
That's a pretty creative idea.

333
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,870
Yes, that would work
since she's in a bind.

334
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,340
You made yourself useful for once.

335
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,800
I'm on my way.

336
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,320
I'll see you soon.

337
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,610
What the heck was that?

338
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,540
Why aren't you here yet?

339
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,180
An accident?

340
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,650
Are you all right?

341
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,620
Okay. Let's meet another time.

342
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,930
I'm sorry, but my guest can't make it.

343
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,670
We must serve the food at the exact time.

344
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,640
I'll pay for the food.
Take it back to the kitchen.

345
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,010
Why don't you eat at least, sir?

346
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,710
On my own? No way. Get me the bill.

347
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,310
Excuse me.

348
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,850
Goodness.

349
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,390
My friend suddenly canceled on me.

350
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,360
I'd like to pay
since I was here for a while.

351
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,290
No, you don't have to.

352
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,830
I guess a lot of people
are getting stood up today.

353
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,930
Him too.

354
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,280
Sir.

355
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,920
Don't you remember me?

356
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,020
I remember you.

357
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,460
We meet again.

358
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,600
See? Isn't it nice
to drink together at home?

359
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,370
Going to a bar is a waste of money.

360
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,310
We have all we need right here.

361
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,780
Yes. My father's wine cellar
is bigger than some small bars.

362
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,880
He's staying out pretty late tonight.

363
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,480
Could he be with a woman?

364
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,120
Who, Father?

365
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,860
That's impossible.

366
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,520
Anything is possible
between a man and a woman.

367
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,130
My father is still young and healthy.
He can date if he wants to.

368
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,660
Don't even say something that gross.

369
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,300
People already call your family
messed up because...

370
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,970
you're an assorted mix of half-siblings.

371
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,540
If Father brings someone home,

372
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,270
the whole family might end up going crazy.

373
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,280
You think so?

374
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,820
I really enjoyed that. Thank you.

375
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,690
I had a light lunch
because I expected to have a heavy dinner.

376
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,590
I'm glad to hear that.

377
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,720
I'm always in your debt.

378
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,730
Not at all.

379
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,430
I'd already paid for the food,

380
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,200
and it would end up in the trash
if no one ate it.

381
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,030
I'd have invited anyone
who wanted the food.

382
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,950
It's the second time already.

383
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,620
It's strange how we met by chance twice.

384
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,860
It is.

385
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,730
Guess what?

386
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,130
Stick a pin in the ground...

387
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,570
and drop a single seed from the sky.

388
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,070
The seed landing on top of the pin
has the same possibility as that.

389
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,770
The possibility of what?

390
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,270
Of something meant to be.

391
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,180
We wouldn't have met again...

392
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,210
if we weren't meant to be.

393
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,690
Meeting once is a coincidence.

394
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,320
Meeting twice is called inevitable.

395
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,920
Meeting thrice...

396
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,660
is meant to be.

397
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,130
"Meant to be."

398
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,870
I don't know how you feel,

399
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,440
but I don't mind this chance encounter.

400
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,540
Enough that I'm actually glad
my friend couldn't make it.

401
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,710
You're pretty good
at uplifting someone's mood.

402
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,580
I mean what I say.

403
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,120
I like the food, the atmosphere,

404
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,690
and the music.

405
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,790
And I appreciate my company even more.

406
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,630
This is a perfect evening.

407
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,710
I'll go ahead.

408
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,480
Goodbye.

409
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,060
It's not easy to find someone
you're meant to be with.

410
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,890
We live in a small country,

411
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,330
and we crossed paths again.

412
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,270
It's silly to put
so much meaning into that.

413
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,970
The deities decide what happens.

414
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,670
No amount of work on our part will help.

415
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,190
Are you all right, Tae Joo? Were you hurt?

416
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm fine.

417
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,970
I'm glad to hear that.

418
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,170
It's tough, isn't it?

419
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,640
You know what he's like.

420
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,770
He doubts and tests everyone,

421
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,310
and he's so cold,
he keeps everyone at a distance.

422
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,010
He's frigid and dangerous.

423
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,080
But for someone like you, Lucia?

424
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,240
We should have come
with Ms. Kyung Chae and Mr. Ji Seop.

425
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,380
Why should we care about the kids
who forgot their mom's death anniversary?

426
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,990
It's a bit sad to come here on your own.

427
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,790
It's fine. I won't stay for long.

428
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,020
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

429
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
You really don't know what today is?

430
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,970
It comes around just once a year,
and you forgot?

431
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,500
That makes you less than human!

432
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,170
I plan to promote Soo Jung to CEO
at the regular board meeting.

433
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,570
Madam, it's Min Kyung Chae.
Can I see you right away?

434
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,880
Even if it's the chairman's order,
there are things we can't do.

435
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,980
Aren't you shaking Mingang to its core?

436
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,550
Why should I care about
something so insignificant?

437
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,080
Do you have feelings for Director Moon?

438
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,580
I might as well think about...

439
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,690
the feelings I didn't know I had.
