1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,840
Tell your mom...

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,070
(Episode 8)

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,480
not to make a big deal
out of what happened.

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,510
What happened has happened.

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,650
Finding and punishing the culprit...

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,220
won't cancel out the assault.

7
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,880
Why should I do that?

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,850
Because that will be to your benefit.

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,490
Do you think I came here empty-handed?

10
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,060
My assaulter
must be from a powerful family...

11
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,990
if they sent someone like you.

12
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,700
Do you think studying hard
will make you a great person?

13
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,940
You can't beat the people
who start way ahead of you.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,810
You'll just end up working for them,
running their errands.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,240
Just like you?

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,650
Mom. Who is this guy?

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,360
Is she really your daughter?

18
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,730
Didn't you hear her say "Mom?"

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,130
If she's 16 years old...

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,300
- Did you...
- What are you thinking?

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,810
My gosh.

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,870
Have a conscience.

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,710
She's not your daughter. Don't worry.

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,240
That had better be true.

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,710
If you're lying to me...

26
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,220
What will you do? Will you drug me again?

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,820
Don't be mistaken.

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,420
She's not yours.

29
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,150
Have you forgotten...

30
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,190
what you did to your own child?

31
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,660
What is she, then?
Why are you a single mom?

32
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,030
Do I have to tell you my story now?

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,700
I met someone right after you left me.

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,240
We had Mi So, but we couldn't marry
because our families disapproved.

35
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,510
Okay?

36
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,610
I'm here as Mingang Distribution's lawyer.

37
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,580
Forget about the assault.

38
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,820
That's best for you and your daughter.

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,360
You became a hound for the rich.

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,020
Watch what you say.
I worked hard to get to where I am.

41
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,460
I know that.

42
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,300
No one else might know, but I do.

43
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,770
I know how cruel and dirty you are.

44
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,810
Just how far you'll go to be successful.

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,610
You're the same as you were 16 years ago.

46
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,550
You still talk like that.

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,220
You took the words out of my mouth.

48
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm flustered...

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,990
by how little you've changed.

50
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,320
I was going to forget about the assault,

51
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
but seeing you changed my mind.

52
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,460
I can't let you get your way.

53
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,560
Don't make things any worse.

54
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,330
It's a warning, not a request.

55
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,170
Don't come here again.

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,470
That's a warning, not a request.

57
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,480
If you show up around me
or my daughter again,

58
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,910
I won't hold back then.

59
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,850
You got something wrong.

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,250
I'm not the naive girl
you knew 16 years ago.

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,880
The clueless Baek Sul Hee...

62
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,820
you managed to manipulate...

63
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,620
is long gone, so watch out.

64
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,960
Gosh, I'm scared.

65
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,930
Sul Hee.

66
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,640
It's good for the baby.

67
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,540
I don't need stuff like this.

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,810
Thanks, darling.

69
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,180
Once I finish training,

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,420
I'll become a prosecutor.

71
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,320
You will?

72
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,150
That's great.

73
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,690
Will we get married, then?

74
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,560
Shall I look up some wedding halls?

75
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,060
Am I too big to get married?

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,470
Sul Hee.

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,540
Let's break up.

79
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,410
I think this is it.

80
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,310
What?

81
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,120
What are you saying?

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,030
I know how much you suffered.

83
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,460
I know that better than anyone, but...

84
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,100
You know how hard
I worked for this, don't you?

85
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,930
You saw everything.

86
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,540
This is a lot of money.

87
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,240
It's more than twice the amount
you spent on me.

88
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,750
Will you let me go?

89
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,880
How could you...

90
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,590
How can you do this to me?

91
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,190
Don't do this, honey.

92
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,660
What about our baby?

93
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,570
It needs a dad.

94
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,910
Think again, honey. For our baby's sake.

95
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,970
Now...

96
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,610
There won't be a baby
for me to care about.

97
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,280
What do you mean?

98
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,680
Your baby is right here.

99
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,890
It's inside my belly.

100
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,890
What's going on?

101
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,700
Honey.

102
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,270
Call an ambulance.

103
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,440
Something must be wrong. Call for help.

104
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,620
Did you really...

105
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,820
I told you.

106
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,360
There's no baby for me to care about.

107
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,400
Don't go, darling. Stay with me.

108
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,440
Please don't go.

109
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,040
Honey!

110
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,380
Honey.

111
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,970
It can't be.

112
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,780
It won't be.

113
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,850
It must not be.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
Did the guy leave?

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Listen carefully to what I say.

116
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,470
I found out who hurt you.

117
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,740
You found the actual attacker
and not the fake?

118
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,380
Why won't she be punished?

119
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,280
Is she from a rich family?

120
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,590
Yes. Her family is rich.

121
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,220
How rich?

122
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,830
Is she the daughter
of a chairman of a large company?

123
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,560
That's why I can't let it go.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
I'll do anything it takes to punish them.

125
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,170
They can't be forgiven for being rich.

126
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,870
I can't live with myself
if I don't do something.

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,070
I once told a man I met...

128
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,780
that it's wrong to tell someone
to forget what they can't.

129
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,380
I think that
if I cover this up and let it go,

130
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,450
I'll think of it forever
and it'll weigh on me.

131
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,160
- Get out of here.
- Oh, my gosh.

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,100
No way.

133
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,600
You still owe me
and you want more stuff for free?

134
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,640
Come on.

135
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,410
I haven't eaten anything decent in days.

136
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,470
I'll pay you back soon.

137
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,010
If I get lucky this time,
I'll pay you what I owe plus the interest.

138
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,110
As if you will.

139
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,980
- Give me that back.
- No, please.

140
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,920
- Let go of it!
- Oh, dear.

141
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,820
You can't even afford food.

142
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,360
- Darn you.
- Come back! Lady!

143
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,130
Darn it.

144
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,790
She's a viper, she is.

145
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm about to starve and she won't help.

146
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,460
Darn it.

147
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,200
You'll fall ill
if you drink on an empty stomach.

148
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,270
Eat some rice soaked in the soup.

149
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,390
Here you go.

150
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,170
It's hot. Cool it a bit first.

151
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,780
This won't make me tell you anything.

152
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,690
I won't talk.

153
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,290
I caused the accident
your parents died in,

154
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,790
and I paid the price.

155
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,690
Talk all you want about the truth.

156
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,560
You won't get anything.

157
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,470
I got that.
I decided to stop asking questions.

158
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,000
What can I get out of someone
who won't talk?

159
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,140
(Beef ribs)

160
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,150
Wait, sir.

161
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,330
Be sure to eat tomorrow.

162
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,570
Don't starve.

163
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,910
Bye.

164
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,960
CEO Min said
Moon Tae Kyung will join soon,

165
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,600
so prepare for the launch.

166
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,770
Ask Legal for advice and support...

167
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,530
so the documents
and processes are airtight.

168
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,540
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,910
Moon Tae Kyung will be
the new general managing director.

170
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,210
Handpick some smart guys...

171
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,440
from Business Strategy
to fill your new team.

172
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,950
If that doesn't work,
find another solution.

173
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,750
Okay.

174
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,880
Recommend someone from Legal
whom you think would work.

175
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,890
Yes, sir.

176
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,700
Is there a rift between you two?

177
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,730
Did you have a lover's spat?

178
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,600
It's not like that.

179
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,270
As if it's not. Something went down.

180
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,640
Did you do something to upset Kyung Chae?

181
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,980
Did you mess up something tied to Se Ri?

182
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,750
Se Ri is the one thing
Kyung Chae doesn't give up on.

183
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,590
She is Kyung Chae's weakness.

184
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,520
I think I'm right.

185
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,090
See you around.

186
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,760
He insists on staying loyal?

187
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,640
The person you called is unavailable.

188
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,710
Stop trying.

189
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,880
Neither Bo Ram
nor the cafe owner will pick up.

190
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,080
Why, exactly?

191
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,520
That's what I don't get.

192
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,520
So many things don't make sense.

193
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,450
First, there was the fake culprit.

194
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,490
And now they won't arrest the real one?

195
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,790
Why not? Because her family is rich?

196
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,430
Shouldn't she still be arrested?

197
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,200
There's evidence and witness statements.

198
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,700
And who was that guy who came here?

199
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,270
I'll explain everything later.
Let's go home.

200
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,440
Why? Are you afraid he'll come back?

201
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,410
You said you felt suffocated.

202
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,350
The doctor said you can go home,
so let's do that.

203
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,000

Hello, Min Soo Jung speaking.

206
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Soo Jung?

207
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,050
Is this Se Ri?

208
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,890
When did you fly in?

209
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,660
That's not important.

210
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,100
Kyung Chae said I could come home,
but I haven't heard from her since.

211
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,570
She said you could come home?

212
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,300
That means she's unable to send you back.

213
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,840
But she can't leave you here either.

214
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Did you...

215
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,740
get into trouble while you were here?

216
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,550
Kyung Chae is different from us.

217
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,890
You and I are illegitimate daughters.

218
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,660
Father was forced to take us in.

219
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,960
I don't know why Kyung Chae
cares so much about you,

220
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,330
but it won't last.

221

or exercise your rights,

223
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,230
things will change.

224
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,840
Kyung Chae will be the first to ditch you.

225
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,070
Love it or hate it, that's our fate.

226
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,610
We're in the same situation.
We should band together.

227
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,610
That's how we'll both survive.

228
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,920
Tell me what happened.

229
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,390
I need to know so I can help you.

230
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,460
Well, actually,

231
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,860
shortly after I came here...

232
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,210
Do something for me.

233
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,480
I want to put a story in the paper.

234
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,280
No, not in one of the major ones.

235
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,250
Dongseo Daily might work,
since they hate large businesses.

236
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,090
It would help if the journalist
shared that sentiment.

237
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,090
I want it in the morning edition.

238
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,270
Try this cut.

239
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,640
Ms. Soo Jung got it
from the fish market herself.

240
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,880
Did you? When did you drop by?

241
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,240
Today after work.

242
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,850
You like raw fish.

243
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,780
It's low in calories, so eat all you want.

244
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,390
Are you in a good mood?

245
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,660
I have high hopes for the new business.

246
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,760
You should.
We're family, so it's our business.

247
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,090
I like your attitude.

248
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,240
You decided who will be
the general managing director...

249

for the new business,

250
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
but you have some other vacancies.

251
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,480
So what?

Well, you don't have to,

254
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,150
but there's no reason why you can't.

255
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,090
Focus on your store.
That job is perfect for you.

256
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,760

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,630

258

259

I don't have anything special going on,

264
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,220

bothered about something.

to welcome you home.

- Okay.

00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,810
(M Distribution Heiress
Assaulted Fellow Teen)

362
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,110
(To launch new e-commerce business)

363
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,650
What's this?

364
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,580
How is it in the news already?

365
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,150
You didn't report it, did you?

366
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,060
Is this possible
when the victim has no idea?

367
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,620
What paper is it in?

368
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,290
Dongseo Daily. Park Gyeong Bae wrote it.

369
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,700
I have to go out for a bit.

370
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,930
Okay.

371
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,970
I should've contacted you first,

372
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,270
but I trusted my source
and it was a big story,

373
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,340
so I published it first.

374
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,280
Can you tell me who gave you the story?

375
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,380
No. I must protect my sources.

376
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,880
Now that you confirmed the story is true,
Mingang Distribution will take action.

377
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,950
As you can see,
we're a small publication...

378
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,350
compared to other papers.

379
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,390
They'll sue us for defamation...

380
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,790
for writing about it with zero proof.

381
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,100
Here's the video proof.

382
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,910
That's great. I can do a follow-up.

383
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,940
It might not go to print...

384
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,980
if Mingang stops us in time.

385
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,210
I'll switch to TV instead.

386
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,250
A good friend of mine is an anchor at KBC.

387
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,950
Do that for me.
Then they can no longer deny it.

388
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Give me a moment.

389
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,230
Lady Luck is on your side.
You got the evidence too.

390
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,970
There's no denying it, then.

391
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,940
It breaks my heart too.
It's a family matter.

392
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,370
But I couldn't turn a blind eye.

393
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,210
I care a lot about justice, you see.

394
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,320
The story will air on KBC news today.

395
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,950
You couldn't stop that one story?

396
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,160
Don't blame her.

397
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,930
The reporter confirmed the story
and found video evidence too.

398
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,460
No TV station would turn down
a story like that.

399
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,330
It can't be stopped.

400
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,170
Not by Kyung Chae
or even the deity himself.

401
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,230
This is just great.

402
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,370
You messed up right before the launch.

403
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,240
You ruined the company's image
and insulted the family.

404
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,240
Now our stock prices will fall...

405
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,040
and reporters will flock.

406
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,180
Bring Se Ri to me tomorrow.

407
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,810
Tie her up and lock her somewhere.

408
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,020
And you. You don't deserve to be CEO.

409
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,750
Be prepared to step down.

410
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,060
It was you, wasn't it?
You tipped them off.

411
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,670
You haven't stopped...

412
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,000
viewing people with prejudice.

413
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,810
I can tell it was you
by the choice of paper.

414
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,180
I bet you chose Park Gyeong Bae
because he's a known weirdo.

415
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,620
Not to mention everyone knows
he's friends with a KBC anchor.

416
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,120
It's obvious he'd take the story
to a TV station...

417
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,590
if we stopped him from printing it.

418
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,150
My goodness. Calm down.

419
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,560
Think about that later.

420
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,660
For now, let's relax and watch the news.

421
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,540
Mi So. Come and join me.

422
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,690
Your story will be in the news.

423
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,290
Will it really?

424
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,330
Who assaulted me?

425
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,970
Mingang Distribution's chairman's
youngest daughter.

426
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,970
We'll watch the news together,
and then I'll tell you...

427
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,410
why Bo Ram and the cafe owner
stopped talking to you.

428
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,780
Here's the next story.

429
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,780
At around 8 p.m.
in an alley in Seodam-dong,

430
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,780
Min Se Ri, the third daughter
of Mingang Distribution's chairman,

431
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,450
assaulted a teenage girl
who was around the same age.

432
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,890
Min was known for being involved in...

433
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,260
big and small assaults in the US...

434
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,960
where she had a notorious reputation
among the Korean expats.

435
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,260
Min returned to Korea in secret...

436
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,660
and assaulted Baek over a small argument,

437
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,170
and Baek was rushed into surgery
to repair a ruptured intestine.

438
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,530
It's over now.

439
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,170
It was in the news, so she'll be punished.

440
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,240
But it turns out there's a plot twist
worthy of a TV show.

441
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,910
The troublemaker rich teen
wasn't the perpetrator.

442
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,880
The truth is that it was planned
by someone...

443
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,250
who expected a large payment.

444
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,450
We talked to Baek's friend
who was at the scene,

445
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,620
as well as an acquaintance.

446
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,660
My friend provoked her first.

447
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,990
She said the girl looked rich...

448
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,060
and said she'd get beaten up
to blackmail her for money.

449
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,400
Something similar happened
when she worked for me.

450
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,270
She wanted the money.

451
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,040
Her family is poor...

452
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,410
and she always needed money.

453
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,010
What got into Bo Ram and the cafe owner?

454
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,680
Why did they lie?

455
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,120
Why did they make things up?

456
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,250
What are they doing?

457
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,440
I liked the story.

458
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,970
Especially the interviews.

459
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,880
Now you have some new facts.
Be sure to keep the story going.

460
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,550
Then we'll handle the deal as promised.

461
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,430
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

462
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,870
Do a better job.

463
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,680
The lower their birth,
the harder it is to crush them.

464
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,940
Do you know her?

465
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,010
The mother of the teenage victim.

466
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,350
A million dollars? Interesting.

467
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,250
I'm loving the comments.

468
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,290
This is why I left you.

469
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,150
The story they make up becomes the truth,

470
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,560
not the story that powerless you tell.

471
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,360
Do you know that what you did is a crime?

472
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,760
Is there proof that I leaked the story?

473
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,390
What really happened that day?

474
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,660
Who was behind my parents' death?

475
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,130
Do you think I'll let this go?

476
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,400
Do whatever you want.

477
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,630
I won't stop you.
