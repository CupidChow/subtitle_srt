00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,810
(Episode 53)

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,110
(Mingang Distribution)

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,520
Are you Jung Lucia
with the Online Business Team?

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:14,950
Yes.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,520
I'm with World Patch.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,820
There's talk that you're dating
Chairman Min Doo Sik.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,530
I'll answer
if you request an official interview.

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,470
How long have you been together for?

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,830
I'll explain that later.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,000
Where did you meet,
and how did you grow close?

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,940
Could you go into detail?

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,840
Did you approach the chairman on purpose?

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,750
I heard you were a gold digger.

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,020
What?

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,090
A gold digger?

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,390
What do you say...

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,460
about that rumor?

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,230
You can't deny it. It must be true.

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,330
I heard some other chairman...

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,110
got bitten badly by a gold digger
and lost every cent he had.

21
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,940
I wonder if this is a similar case.

22
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,440
What kind of a question is that?

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,420
Where did you say you were from?

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,890
World Patch?

25
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,620
Is this how they do things?

26
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,690
You ignore procedure and protocol...

27
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,930
and barge in with cameras and mics.

28
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,470
If you want an interview,
shouldn't you ask first,

29
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,270
then check your facts?

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,140
Whatever. Get out of here.

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,510
Why are you still here?
Shall I call the police?

32
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,540
Get out of here!

33
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,450
- Let's go.
- Shall we go?

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,090
My gosh.

35
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,100
How could they come right into the lobby?

36
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,660
Did they call you beforehand?

37
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,100
No.

38
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,400
Someone had to have given permission,

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,140
or they'd never dream of doing this.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,340
I have an idea who that was.

41
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,880
Why would you run the risk
of being called a gold digger?

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,380
I expected this much.
It's a mountain I must climb.

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,710
You don't have to.

44
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,710
You don't have to climb
if you take my hand.

45
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,450
Can't you trust me and leave it to me?

46
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,020
I'll take Min Doo Sik to court somehow...

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,220
How great a sentence
do you think a judge will give him?

48
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,660
He'll spend all the money he has
to hire the best lawyers.

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,360
He'll get probation at most.

50
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,460
That menial sentence
will even relieve him of his guilt.

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,230
What good would that do?

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,900
That doesn't make your choice right.

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,570
I don't care if it's not right.

54
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,170
We chose different paths.

55
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,370
We can never work together.

56
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,010
My gosh...

57
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,590
Print it tomorrow.

58
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,820
Make it as provocative as possible.

59
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,390
The more negative comments, the better.

60
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,030
Hire people to write them.
Don't worry about the cost.

61
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,670
A suspicious relationship between
a chairman and a woman his daughter's age.

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,100
That will go down well.

63
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,810
Hayoon Logistics' Chairman Ma.

64
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,280
His scandal with his secretary
ruined the company's stock price.

65
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,310
Our stock price might take a hit.

66
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,450
We'll use that as an excuse
to call a board meeting and condemn him.

67
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,250
At the meeting, you'll get him...

68
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,720
If his scandal ruins
our company's image...

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,050
and the stock price,

70
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,860
even the chairman will be no exception.

71
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,890
He must be held responsible.

72
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,830
The special rule he set up.

73
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,900
If a member of the owner's family
harms the company,

74
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,600
they must hand over their shares.

75
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
If you get hold of it,

76
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,310
you will become chairwoman.

77
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,080
I was going to wait,
but the schedule got moved up.

78
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,550
What can I do
when the situation is so grave?

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,920
I bet Kyung Chae called those reporters.

80
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,050
Soon, it will be in the news,

81
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,120
and you'll be branded a gold digger.

82
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,330
Our stock price will plummet,

83
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,660
and a board meeting will be called.

84
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,630
Stop that from happening,
like you did before.

85
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,900
No. It's different this time around.

86
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,610
I was able to put a stop to it then,
but not this time.

87
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,440
I can't cover up for the chairman.

88
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,710
If the chairman
were to get into trouble...

89
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,050
Shouldn't you be worrying about yourself?

90
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,280
If my dad is cornered,

91
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,850
he'll throw the woman aside
to save himself.

92
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,860
I did all I could.

93
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,890
It's up to you now.

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,830
Whether you become
the chairman's new wife or not.

95
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,000
Consider this your final trial.

96
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,300
Min Soo Jung is right about that.

97
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,140
No director can cover up
the chairman's issue.

98
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,680
The chairman might change his mind
if the stock price takes a hit.

99
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,080
If he faces the risk of losing his stake
for harming the company,

100
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,320
like it or not, he'll end it with you.

101
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,620
He'd never give up the business.

102
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,320
What should we do?
The articles will come out tomorrow.

103
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,590
Min Kyung Chae is nastier than I thought.

104
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,330
She's planning to take
both you and her father out...

105
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,300
and become chairwoman.

106
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,630
She wants to get two birds with one stone.

107
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,710
Does a company crisis
mean nothing to her when she's the CEO?

108
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,240
Can't you tell from what she did
to her older brother?

109
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,080
She's no pushover,
considering she's willing to use...

110
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,050
my ties with the chairman
to her advantage.

111
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,850
If that's what she does,

112
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,350
we must do the exact same thing.

113
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,590
You'll do that, then?

114
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,090
I should.

115
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,270
Is Lucia your type?

116
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,670
What do you mean?

117
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,940
You seem to want her as a stepmom.

118
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,980
I only respect what Father wants.

119
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,210
Let's say she marries our father...

120
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,050
and then gains control of his shares.

121
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,220
You seem to want
to do something with that.

122
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,580
Don't put that on me.

123
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
Our family tree is complicated as it is,

124
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,550
and I don't want it to get any worse.

125
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,120
You were always like this.

126
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,690
You told lies even when it was so obvious.

127
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,830
If you'd been honest just once,

128
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,830
our relationship could've been different.

129
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,000
What about you?

130
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,010
Were you ever nice to me since I moved in?

131
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,010
Did you treat me
the way you treated Se Ri?

132
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,580
You're not like Se Ri.

133
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,850
How are we different?

134
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,680
This is why people think
she's your daughter.

135
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,990
What?

136
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,860
No one says so,

137
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,260
but they think you're Se Ri's mom.

138
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,660
Min Kyung Chae's secret
illegitimate child, who was registered...

139
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,500
as Dad's daughter.

140
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,140
Would I let Se Ri be if she were mine?

141
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,410
I'd have brought her to Mingang
and made her replace you.

142
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm warning you.

143
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,720
Don't you dare defend that woman
in my presence again.

144
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,060
Don't call her "that woman."

145
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,890
Shall I say she's our stepmom, then?

146
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,630
She has a name.

147
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,370
I don't get why you're like this.

148
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,670
She's a nice lady. I know she is.

149
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,610
What do you know? What could you know?

150
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,210
Why are you still messed up, then?

151
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,710
I hate it when you're like this.

152
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,950
Why are you so distrusting?
You make an enemy out of everyone.

153
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,120
I can proudly say
I did all I could for you.

154
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,390
I spent a fortune on everything
so you'd never miss having a mom.

155
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,890
Forget money. I want care.

156
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,330
I want to be cared about.

157
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,130
Did you ever care about me?

158
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,430
What about that woman?

159
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,870
Will she consider you her daughter?

160
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,570
I like her.

161
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,040
I get to decide who I like.

162
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,970
Don't try to control that too.

163
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,940
I won't put up with that.

164
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,350
(Mingang Distribution)

165
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,550
He's here.

166
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,290
Did you hear the rumor?

167
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,220
- My gosh.
- It must pay to be pretty.

168
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,290
- He had so many women.
- It's gross.

169
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,330
He's looking at us.

170
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,630
He's pathetic.

171
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,850
You're here.

172
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,720
You brought more flowers?

173
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,390
The old bunch will wither soon.

174
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,290
This is my job from now on.
Don't tell me to stop doing it.

175
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,330
It's weird.

176
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,230
What is?

177
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,400
The staff in the lobby
bowed to me politely...

178
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,900
but whispered behind my back.

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000

Everyone was talking,
but they froze when I got in.

183
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,110
That's because
they feel uncomfortable around you.

when it comes to you?

187
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,260

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,810
Isn't calling a board meeting
over the chairman's love life a bit much?

357
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,380
I think it is.

358
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,720
Is it a crime to be in love?

359
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,550
There's someone for everyone.

360
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,620
What shall I do?

361
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,330
Shall I vote against whatever they want?

362
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,530
No. Leave it.

363
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,330
Don't say anything this time.

364
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,470
- My gosh.
- Does this make sense?

365
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,770
It's a disgrace.

(Mingang Distribution)

367
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,750
So, what do you want to say?

368
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,650
Why did you call me here
when I'm a busy man?

369
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,120
We're here...

370
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,690
to find a way to remedy the crisis...

371
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,590
that caused our stock price to fall.

372
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,960
Before that, though,
we must identify the cause.

373
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,270
You all must know that everyone is
talking about the pathetic scandal...

374
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,940
between the chairman
and one of our employees.

375
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,510
You want to reprimand me, the chairman,
over something as trivial as that?

376
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,110
It's not trivial.

377
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,980
I'll be honest. Do you know...

378
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,550
how disappointed I am in you?

379
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,750
What?

380
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,720
How could you, of all people,
get involved in...

381
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,320
a scandal about a gold digger?

382
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,820
You chose her out of all the options?

383
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,120
That's what I'd like to say.

384
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,890
My goodness. I feel humiliated.

385
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,300
So what if you're madly in love?

386
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,630
The stock price plummeted.

387
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,430
As chairman,
you should be held responsible.

388
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,470
That's right.
This is the worst kind of issue.

389
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,810
Did being alone for so long fire you up?

390
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,510
To think you're in the news
because of a woman.

391
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,550
If our stock price doesn't recover soon,

392
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,550
shareholders will come after you
with sticks and stones.

393
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,550
Why are you silent, Director Oh?

394
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,290
Will you vote against the flow again?

395

This time, for once,

396
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,100
I side with the other directors.

397
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,000
You're ganging up on me to fire me?

398
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,470
Relax and sit back down.

399
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,940
This is too serious...

400
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,140
to tell us to ignore it
because it's a personal issue.

401

402
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,650
Do you think I don't know
you're controlling everyone?

What? A gold digger scandal?

407
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,770
They're embarrassed?

408
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,810
I should just...

409
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
Oh, my gosh.

He seemed pretty angry.

412
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,820
He brought it upon himself.

413
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,490
Why did he go after someone like that?

414
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,230
What will you do now?

415
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,530
Find a way to take my father's shares.

416
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,600
You'll make him give up his stake
for harming the business?

417
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,040
Because it's a fact.

418
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,310
He is a huge risk to the company.

419
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,410
He's freaking out because he knows that.

420
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,310
He knows his title hangs in the balance.

421
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,750
Very well. I'll check the related laws.

422
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,800
You're making things worse.

423
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,400
You should've known your place
and backed down.

424
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,740
Why go after someone out of your league?

425
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,480
I know you want to be chairwoman,

426
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,410
but you're threatening your own father.

427
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,050
You're mistaken.

428
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,990
You're the threat to his position, not me.

or this would be boring.

I have one last thing to say.

433

One "last" thing?

434
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,740
Even if I am a gold digger
who seduced the chairman,

435
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,970
I deserve a chance to defend myself.

437
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,110
Send a load of reporters
to Mingang Distribution right away.

438
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,530
I arranged this press conference...

439
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,360
to express my thoughts...

440
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,830
on the articles you wrote.

441
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,200
Are you going to say
you're not a gold digger?

442
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,570
That's not explaining.
That's making an excuse.

443
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,910
A gold digger
who approached the chairman for his money.

444
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,910
That's what you want me to be.

445
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,380
I'm sorry that it's not true.

446
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,890
Stop yapping and prove it.

You're beating around the bush.

449
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,660
You didn't know he was a chairman?

450
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,770
You met him by chance?

451
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,200
And those coincidences kept recurring?

452
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,770
Yes.

453
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,540
You can't prove it, but it's true,
so we must believe you?

454

That's what people call a scheme,

455
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,380
and people like you
are called gold diggers.

456
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,550
If your feelings
for the chairman were genuine,

457
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,020
even if you'd met by chance,
you should've left him once you knew.

Let's all go.

460
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,430
It was a waste of time.

461
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,630
Anyone thinks
they can host a press conference.

462
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,030
This is over. Let's go.

having to worry about her tuition.

465
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,080

What are you on about?

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,780
I bet you loved the extra cash.

468
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,690
You didn't think you'd get caught?

469
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,560
You got tens of thousands of dollars.

470
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,090
Tens of thousands?

471
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,490
Have you lost your mind? That's not true!

472
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,200
And you. You bought a property.

473
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,400
Is it your retirement plan?

474
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,610
No. I didn't buy anything.

She's making it up.

476
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,940
You shameless, corrupt piece of trash.

477
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,120
You give hard-working,
innocent journalists a bad reputation.

478
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,620
Is that true?

479
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,450
- This is a scoop.
- My gosh.

00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,650
Is it true?

481
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,720
Darn you.

00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,290
Are you crazy?

483
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,730
You want to frame me with your lies?

484
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,230
Can you prove it? Do you have proof?

485
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,870
The proof.

486
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,740
It's right here.

487
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,710
- What's that?
- What?

488
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,940
This turned crazy.

489
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,150
See for yourself.

They're photos of you being bribed.

491

This is nothing. Don't be afraid yet.

492
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,130
Think of what you did to me.

493
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,830
You wrote about me
without checking the facts,

494
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,830
and you paid people
to leave scathing comments.

495
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,400
You replaced the truth with lies.

496
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,270
You crushed a person's life
and made a mockery of them.

497
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,910
You. Do you know me?

498
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,150
Did you look into me?

499
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,410
What do you know?

500
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,980
Who I am, how I lived.

501
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,720
Did you do any kind of research
before you wrote about me?

502
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,220
You didn't have to.

503
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,500
All you had to do
was call me a gold digger and bury me.

504

This is what you did to my Mi So.

505

Bring proof that I'm a gold digger.

506
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,410
If you can prove
that I seduced the chairman,

507
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,020
I'll admit to it then.

508
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,420
And...

509
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,720
go and tell the person
who paid you to frame me.

510
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,530
Very soon, they will end up paying...

511
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,570
the exact same way.

00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,010
I am a gold digger.

514
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,810
I approached you on purpose.

518

She'll get Father fired.

519
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,320
I didn't teach you
to ruin your own father.

520
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,820
If you didn't want to be ruined,
you shouldn't have done anything wrong.

521

Do you want to
become a monster to catch one?

What's wrong with that?

523
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,660
I might want to kill her
if she keeps showing up.
