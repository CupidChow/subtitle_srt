1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,170
I'll side with you...

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,880
and get you everything. In return,

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,910
on the day you become chairman,

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,890
you will make me CEO.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,950
No matter what it takes,

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,890
- are you sure you can make me chairman?
- Of course.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,890
To do that,

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,030
you can't keep the chairman at home.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,870
If I don't keep him at home?

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,200
Send him to a nursing home.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,310
That's the only way you'll have a reason
to kick Lucia out of the house.

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,110
If the chairman stays at home,

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,780
that woman will use taking care of him
as an excuse to stick around.

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,580
That's true.

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,220
Why didn't I think of that?

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,180
The house was in an uproar today
because of the chairman.

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,250
What are we going to do?
He's only going to get worse.

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,050
Don't worry.

19
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,320
I have a plan.

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,790
Do you have something in mind?

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,490
My father...

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,130
I'm sending him to a nursing home.

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
What?

24
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,560
A nursing home?

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,470
But that seems a little extreme.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,570
Manager Gong,
you said you were on my side.

27
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,910
I asked if you were on my side or his,
and that's what you said.

28
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,180
- Was that just an empty promise?
- Of course not.

29
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,250
I'm loyal to you.

30
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,110
Then it's settled.

31
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,750
If he passes away there,
it'll be a blessing for both him and us.

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,360
So just bear with it a little longer,
Manager Gong.

33
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,590
Once I become the chairman...

34
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,230
and get that woman, Lucia,
out of this house,

35
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,060
we'll have our perfect happy ending.

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,670
If we just get that woman
out of the house,

37
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,900
Ms. Se Ri will get along with you again,
just like before, right?

38
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,340
She has to.

39
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,940
I like the sound of a "happy ending."

40
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,250
I shouldn't be laughing,

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,750
but why do I keep laughing?

42
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,680
Please stop laughing.
Someone might hear you.

43
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,380
Sorry.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,850
You're drunk. Hurry and get ready for bed.

45
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,120
Manager Gong.

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,890
You have no idea how anxious I've been.

47
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,260
I was so afraid that woman
would take Se Ri away from me.

48
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,130
I know. Of course I do.

49
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,070
If I don't, who does?

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,370
Watching her call that woman "Mom"
and follow her when they're not related...

51
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,280
has been tearing me apart.

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,460
Now, I'm going to kick that woman out.

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,020
I'm going to tell Se Ri everything.

54
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,560
That I'm not her big sister...

55
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,700
but her real mother,
who gave birth to her.

56
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,770
The chairman is acting that way
because of his dementia,

57
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,610
but what is there to laugh about?

58
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,110
Min Kyung Chae, what are you plotting?

59
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,890
Whatever you're plotting,

60
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,420
just know that your daughter is
in my hands.

61
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,910
Ji Seop, come to my room for a minute.

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,480
I need to talk to you about Dad.

63
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,480
What now?

64
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,920
What's going on?
Why are you leaving again?

65
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,690
Director Min is looking for me.

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,160
A family matter?

67
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660
It seems like it.

68
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,040
What about Father?

69
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,940
Are you just going to stand by
and do nothing?

70
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,970
What are you talking about?

71
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,640
Kyung Chae already has the doctor's report
for Dad's dementia.

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,410
Doesn't it seem strange
she's keeping it so quiet?

73
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,520
She said it's because of
the company's image and the stock price.

74
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,620
She may be a piece of work,
but she cares deeply about the company.

75
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,860
After all she's put you through,
you still don't understand her?

76
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,060
She's definitely planning something
involving Dad.

77
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,500
What could she possibly do
with a confused old man?

78
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,360
I met with Lawyer Kim to sound him out,

79
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,630
but he wouldn't tell me
what they're plotting.

80
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,640
Then again, it's not like he'd ever talk.

81
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,940
You need to look into it quietly.

82
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,080
They're definitely up to something.

83
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,910
I'm telling you, my gut is never wrong!

84
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,750
Any updates on the nursing home situation?

85
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,020
As requested, I'm looking for a facility
where once you're in, you can't get out.

86
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,160
One that's willing to do illegal things,
of course.

87
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,930
I'm counting on you for the nursing home,
Lawyer Kim.

88
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
But the rest of your family
is the problem.

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,100
Ji Seop is one thing,

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,170
but I doubt the Director Min Soo Jung
will agree. Her motives are too obvious.

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,440
That's why it has to be a secret.

92
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,910
We have to take care of it
without anyone knowing.

93
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,410
Understood.

94
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,940
By the way, how is the chairman doing?

95
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,280
I'd like to see for myself.

96
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
You?

97
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,320
Yes.
I need to see him in person to be sure.

98
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,060
That's the only way I can map out
the specifics...

99
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,290
of when and how to execute our plan.

100
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,130
Our plan?

101
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,530
Yes.

102
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,060
Our plan.

103
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,840
So if Chairman Min Doo Sik
really has dementia,

104
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,180
that would mean he doesn't even remember
the secret ledger I've been managing.

105
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,260
Did you find a nursing home?

106
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,460
Make sure it's a top-of-the-line facility.

107
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,900
Once the chairman goes in there,

108
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,730
he'll never see the light of day again.

109
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,340
What? A nursing home?

110
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,480
She's going to shove Dad
into a nursing home,

111
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,810
just like she did with Mother?

112
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,920
I was a little surprised at first,

113
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,350
but the more I think about it,
it actually seems like a good idea.

114
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,790
If Dad stays home,
he'll just keep causing trouble.

115
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,090
With dementia, a patient's condition
only gets worse. It never gets better.

116
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,560
That's just an excuse.

117
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,130
For the patient, being in a facility
is better than being neglected at home.

118
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,740
- That's just the official reason.
- Then what? What's the real issue?

119
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,070
If Dad goes into a nursing home,
the chairman's seat will be up for grabs.

120
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,980
- So who do you think will take his place?
- Don't tell me Kyung Chae is...

121
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,350
doing this for Dad's sake
but because she wants the chairman's seat?

122
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,750
That's why we have to stop her,
no matter what.

123
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,160
If Kyung Chae becomes the chairwoman,
you know what'll happen to us, right?

124
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,730
We have to watch Dad
so she can't sneak him away.

125
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,890
Well, that's what Lucia is there for.

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,930
That woman's no fool.
She'll see what's happening.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,530
I was already planning to tell her
to keep a close eye on Dad.

128
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,440
Man, this is a real circus.

129
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,170
One minute you and Kyung Chae team up
to raise hell and kick her out,

130
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,180
and the next, you team up with Lucia
to stop Kyung Chae.

131
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,020
Welcome.

132
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,090
I heard the chairman was unwell,
so I came to pay him a visit.

133
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,190
I got a call from the CEO.
She said you would be coming.

134
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,490
And the chairman?

135
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,490
He's in his bedroom with Madam Jung.

136
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
It's good to see you eating so well.

137
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,380
Here you go.

138
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,650
What brings you here?

139
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,260
When I heard the chairman was bedridden,
I couldn't possibly stay away.

140
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,530
May I have some water?

141
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,760
I'm parched from rushing over here.

142
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,130
If you would,

143
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,800
Madam Jung.

144
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,770
Is it true?
Have you really lost your mind?

145
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,840
Do you really not remember anything
at all?

146
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,310
Then you wouldn't remember
what an amazing man you were,

147
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,050
or how successful and powerful you were.

148
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,260
You wouldn't remember
how much I respected you,

149
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,220
or how much I wanted to be just like you.

150
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,430
You wouldn't know that either, would you?

151
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,270
To me, you were a role model, a mentor,

152
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,700
and the Almighty.

153
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,840
If I could, I would've even sold my soul
to the devil,

154
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,970
if it meant I could be just like you.

155
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,780
Wanting to marry your eldest daughter
and become part of the owner family...

156
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,520
was all so I could be your son-in-law
and your trusted right-hand man.

157
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,020
But what is this pathetic display?
You've shattered all my dreams.

158
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,990
Reduced to doing this,

159
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,330
having to spoon-feed you of all people.

160
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,500
The era of Min Kyung Chae
is about to begin.

161
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,300
She'll take over Mingang Distribution
and reign supreme.

162
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,170
And I'll be right there by her side.

163
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,270
So...

164
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,040
While you're still lucid,
you should take the easy way out.

165
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,150
That's the only way to escape
the tragic fate that awaits you.

166
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,520
You've seen the chairman. You can go now.

167
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,190
Fine.

168
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,990
You must have your hands full.

169
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,530
You're really playing the part,
aren't you?

170
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,070
Are you all right, Chairman?

171
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,220
If Min Doo Sik is declared incompetent,
his three kids will start an all-out war.

172
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,920
I'm sure they will.
But they all have their own agendas,

173
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,930
so it'll be hard for them
to make a reckless move.

174
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,360
Exactly.
Every one of those children is dying...

175
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,700
to take over Mingang Distribution.

176
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,370
Madam.

177
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,900
In my opinion, if we're talking about
CEO Min Kyung Chae,

178
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,810
I suspect she'll be the one to kick
Chairman Min Doo Sik out of the house.

179
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,340
What makes you think that?

180
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,180
Because right now,
Min Kyung Chae has two main goals.

181
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,920
Becoming chairman and getting rid of Lucia
as soon as possible.

182
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,150
So if she gets rid of Min Doo Sik,
Lucia will be dealt with too. Is that it?

183
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,390
Exactly.

184
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,990
It's just speculation on my part,
of course.

185
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,690
That makes sense.

186
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,430
Now that her own father has dementia,
she must think this is her golden chance.

187
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,570
A chance to get rid of two thorns,
take the chairman's seat and the company.

188
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
Of course she'd think of that.
Why wouldn't she?

189
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,010
And I'm sure right there beside her,

190
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,910
Kim Sun Jae is the one
whispering in her ear.

191
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,680
So Kim Sun Jae will probably be the one
looking for a home for Min Doo Sik, right?

192
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,150
Director Min's healthy mom ended up
in a nursing home just like that.

193
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,950
So getting rid of Chairman Min Doo Sik
would be a piece of cake for him.

194
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,360
That Min Kyung Chae
is really something else.

195
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,130
Weren't you stopping by the hospital?

196
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,300
Oh, yes. I felt
I should check the results...

197
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,230
of Chairman Min Doo Sik's diagnosis
for myself.

198
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,870
It's true the chairman was an outpatient.
Under his primary physician, Doctor Kim,

199
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,070
we can confirm he had a brain scan
and was tested for dementia, but...

200
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
But?

201
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,610
The strange thing is,
I saw the scan myself.

202
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,050
Well, it looked pretty typical for someone
who's had brain surgery.

203
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,150
I didn't see anything seriously wrong
with it.

204
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,960
So you're saying you didn't see
any major abnormalities?

205
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,560
Well, I'm no Doctor Kim,
and this is just my personal opinion.

206
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,500
To say he has dementia based on that
seems like a bit of a stretch.

207
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,240
But then why would his personal physician
diagnose him with dementia?

208
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,540
I couldn't say.

209
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,810
I really couldn't say.

210
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,250
I told you to just stay here.

211
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,250
This isn't some happy occasion, so why go?

212
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,520
That's exactly why I have to go.
You've never visited a sick person before?

213
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,090
Our in-law is in that condition.
If we, his in-laws, just abandon him,

214
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,660
imagine how hurt he would feel.

215
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,960
Just stay here. It's no ordinary sickness.

216
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,230
Ja Kyung said he doesn't recognize anyone.

217
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,770
He has to be spoon-fed like a toddler,

218
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,200
and he might even soil himself. If you go,
it'll just be embarrassing for you both.

219
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,970
I'll clean up after him. If he's confused,
I'll be confused right there with him.

220
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,310
So what if it's awkward? I don't mind.

221
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,680
Goodness, just drop it, you old coot!

222
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,120
What? An old coot?

223
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,250
You beautiful old crone,
you've got quite a mouth on you.

224
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,550
"Old crone," is it?

225
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,790
You listen to me, you hear?

226
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,190
When I say don't do something
as a boss, you don't do it.

227
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,000
Gosh, look at your eyes.
What did you just say? "Boss?"

228
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,630
As in, "Sister?"

229
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,770
I mean, let's be honest.

230
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,500
It's a fact that Yang Mal Sook
is two years older than Oh Pan Sool.

231
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,410
What in the world kind of nonsense
are you talking about now?

232
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,240
I don't care if you're
2 or 20 years older.

233
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,140
The husband is the king of the castle!

234
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,680
You're going to make your eyes pop out.
I'm too busy now, so I'm leaving,

235
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,990
but we'll pick this up
when I see you again. Darn you.

236
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,090
For goodness' sake! I told you not to go.
Ja Kyung told you to stay away.

237
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,790
Let go! Let go of me!

238
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,360
No, I won't! I'll never let you go!
You're not going anywhere!

239
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,700
What is this, a soap opera?
Are we auditioning for a melodrama?

240
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,630
- Let go of me!
- Gosh!

241
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,440
- My pants are falling off! Let go!
- My goodness!

242
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,140
What are you doing in broad daylight?
Trying to make a sibling for Ja Kyung?

243
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,580
Fine, let's do it! Take it all off!
You take your clothes off too!

244
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,750
So you were planning to send Dad
to a nursing home all along.

245
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,350
Don't even think about playing dumb.

246
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,990
I already know everything.

247
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,860
You're dumping Dad in a nursing home,

248
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,990
so you can take over as chairman.
Did you think no one would figure it out?

249
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,300
Since you seem to know everything,

250
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,370
don't try to stop me.

251
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,870
- Because this is all for Father.
- For Dad?

252
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,970
That's a laugh.
Why don't you try being honest for once?

253
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,880
You only ever think about yourself,
don't you?

254
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,550
We can just leave for the office,

255
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,150
but what about the family at home
with him?

256
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,780
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to care for a patient with dementia?

257
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,990
Since when do you care so much
about the family?

258
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,990
If you won't be Father's hands and feet,
then keep your mouth shut.

259
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,760
That's what Lucia is for.

260
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,790
And how long do you think
Lucia will stick around?

261
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,260
Playing the part of a caregiver with
no inheritance or shares on the line.

262
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,500
How long do you really think she'll last?

263
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,340
Well...

264
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,370
Are you going to let Dad, just like Mom,

265
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,880
die in a nursing home?

266
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,280
- If that's Father's destiny, so be it.
- Kyung Chae!

267
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,380
Don't waste your energy.

268
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,280
Nothing you do will change the outcome.

269
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,560
So, is it true? Is Kyung Chae
really sending your father to a home?

270
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,460
Oh, that's great.
That's the best news I've heard all day.

271
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,670
I knew Kyung Chae had it in her.

272
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,270
You don't know anything, so just be quiet.
It's not that simple.

273
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,840
Then what's the problem?

274
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,980
Do you want me to waste my life on him
until I'm old and gray?

275
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,610
When did I ever say that?

276
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,980
Anyway, we can talk about this again
at home.

277
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,790
No, stop talking.
Just do whatever Kyung Chae says.

278
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,060
Come out and watch the chairman for a bit.
I need to step out.

279
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,430
- Again?
- I'm getting herbs for his dementia.

280
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,370
Would you rather go?

281
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,740
Who, me? I never said that.

282
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,180
Gosh.

283
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,910
Chairman, I'll be right back.

284
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,120
Keep a close eye on the chairman.
And don't take your eyes off him.

285
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,470
Father, you see,

286
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,780
it feels a little wrong to say this now,

287
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,350
but I'm going to say it anyway.

288
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,380
Now that you're in this condition,

289
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,420
I'm honestly not scared of you anymore.

290
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,290
You know how you opposed our marriage
because my father was a loan shark?

291
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,630
I was absolutely furious back then.

292
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,930
I secretly cursed you out and everything.

293
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,940
I even wished you'd get old
and end up with dementia.

294
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,640
But I never thought it would come true
so soon.

295
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,840
I had no idea.

296
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,410
So you mean there's a chance his symptoms
aren't real.

297
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,380
That's what Moon Tae Kyung said.
The nurse told him the case was unusual.

298
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,610
So he's faking dementia
when he doesn't even have it?

299
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,620
Who knows?
It's not like we can read his mind.

300
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,620
Unbelievable.

301
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,950
So what's the truth?

302
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,560
That's what you're here to find out.

303
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,660
Just in case,
you're careful around Min Doo Sik, right?

304
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,200
Of course.

305
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,030
Kim Sun Jae stopped by the house.

306
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,770
I was worried he'd say something weird
in front of Chairman Min.

307
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,480
Why would that jerk go there?
He's always so annoyingly diligent.

308
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Oh, my.

309
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,330
What do you think you're doing?

310
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,200
It's fun.

311
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,300
How could you do this to the chairman?

312
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,740
He's out of it anyway.
What's the big deal?

313
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,750
Honestly, ma'am.

314
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,950
Playing games like a little kid.

315
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,190
Well, days like these are numbered.
Once Father goes to the nursing home...

316
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,990
What?

317
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,460
Looks like you already know.

318
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,160
Ma'am, how did you know?

319
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,870
My husband told me, of course.

320
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,670
Apparently, Kyung Chae is the one
planning to send him to a nursing home.

321
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,210
That's great.

322
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,280
Manager Gong, you should get everything
off your chest about him.

323
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,380
Once he's in there,
who knows when you'll see him again?

324
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,320
Why would I have any complaints?

325
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,720
Oh, of course you do.
Come on, just let it all out.

326
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,430
I'm telling you, when I did it earlier,
it felt like a ten-year burden was lifted.

327
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,600
- Really?
- I'm telling you.

328
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,040
If you bottle it up, you'll get sick.
Go on.

329
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,080
Chairman.

330
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,250
Last time,
when there was that issue with Madam Jung,

331
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,420
you ignored me and took her side.

332
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,090
And you told me to get out of the house.

333
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,890
I know you were blinded by her, but still!

334
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,730
I, Manager Gong...

335
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,290
I mean, is this what I, Gong Mae Ja,

336
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,060
get after all these years
I've served this family?

337
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,530
Oh, my.

338
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,370
Wait, your name is actually Gong Mae Ja?

339
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,870
Yes, it's Gong Mae Ja.

340
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,410
Did you think I didn't have a name?
I wasn't born "Manager Gong," you know.

341
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,950
I'm not finished yet.

342
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,880
Chairman.

343
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,520
You'll be punished for acting this way.

344
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,050
He's getting what he deserves right now.

345
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,360
So? Doesn't that feel great?

346
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,360
- It does.
- See? Feels good, right?

347
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,330
Now that we've cleared the air,
how about some coffee?

348
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,440
- Oh, my gosh! Chairman!
- Hey, what are you doing?

349
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,840
- Dad!
- Chairman!

350
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,640
Dad! Stop it!

351
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,910
I'm sorry!

352
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Wait, hold on!

353
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,510
Dad! Stop it!

354
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,580
Chairman!

355
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,490
Oh, I'm sorry!

356
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,790
Honey, look at this.
I'm telling you, a whole clump fell out.

357
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,690
Honey, just send him to a home.

358
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,630
I told you it's not that simple.

359
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,600
What do you mean, it's not?
What are you hesitating for?

360
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,740
It's complicated.
If Father goes into a home,

361
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,640
- things at the company will get messy.
- Seriously.

362
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,290
Pull it out. Right here.

363
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,090
I think I got it.
Gosh, what are we going to do?

364
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,960
Ji Seop, come out here.

365
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,590
- Why?
- We have to tell Kyung Chae, don't we?

366
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,230
So you're just going to let him get sent
to a nursing home,

367
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,470
- and watch Kyung Chae become Chairwoman?
- What?

368
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,840
Gosh, that's out of the question.
Hey, follow me.

369
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,510
Oh, for crying out loud.

370
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,180
We're against it.

371
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,120
You are not sending Dad to a nursing home.

372
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,350
So, you're going to defy me
to the very end.

373
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,020
Are you going to be the one
to take care of him?

374
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,560
Have you ever spent even one day
by his side?

375
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,990
Stop pretending to care about this family.
It's disgusting, and I can't stand it.

376
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
What?

377
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,000
Disgusting?

378
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,570
Sending Dad away,
and kicking Lucia out of the house,

379
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,870
team up with Lawyer Kim
to take over as chairman,

380
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,740
and swallow up Mingang Distribution!

381
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,510
And eventually, you'll get rid of
Ji Seop and me too, right?

382
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,210
Am I wrong?

383
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,380
I'll say it again.

384
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,120
We are against it.

385
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,190
We are not sending Dad to a nursing home.

386
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,620
Try and do it on your own
if you think you can.

387
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,790
We'll call the police on you right away.

388
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,150
Something's definitely up
with that Min Doo Sik.

389
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,820
The truth will come out later,

390
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,780
but something smells fishy.

391
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,910
Se Ri, why are you still up?

392
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,580
I think Kyung Chae plans on putting Dad
in a nursing home.

393
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,820
Who told you that?

394
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,750
Manager Gong and Ja Kyung said so earlier.

395
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,490
It's already shocking enough
that Dad has dementia,

396
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,690
but for Kyung Chae to act like this
is even more outrageous.

397
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,360
Don't worry.

398
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,030
I won't let that happen.

399
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,370
Now you see why I told you
not to get close to Kyung Chae, right?

400
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,880
Good. From now on,
just stay away from Kyung Chae.

401
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,080
So Ji Seop and Director Min
are dead set against it.

402
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,520
How on earth did they find out?
Since when have they cared about Father?

403
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,860
I expected Director Min to oppose it,
but I didn't expect it from Ji Seop.

404
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,090
If Soo Jung gets in his ear,
Ji Seop will fall for it completely.

405
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,800
You know what my brother is like.

406
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,730
It would've been better
if they didn't know, but what can you do?

407
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,470
It doesn't matter.

408
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,600
They'd find out anyway once the chairman
is confined to the nursing home,

409
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,010
- so let's just say they found out early.
- We have no other choice now.

410
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,880
We just have to act
as quickly as possible.

411
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,580
So it seems Min Kyung Chae is dead set
on shoving her father into a nursing home.

412
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,480
We absolutely can't let that happen.

413
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,390
You need to stick close to Min Doo Sik.

414
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,560
We can't give her an opening.

415
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,100
It's time for you to make the call.

416
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,230
I'll handle the Director Min.

417
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,670
You will?

418
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,440
Actually, she called me in right after
the chairman was diagnosed with dementia.

419
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,070
She told me to abandon you
and join her side.

420
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,980
I'll ensure Director Min
doesn't get in your way.

421
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,250
You just walk your own path.

422
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,050
Stash the chairman somewhere
no one can find him,

423
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,290
then immediately call a board meeting...

424
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,190
and switch to an Acting Chairman system.

425
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,990
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

426
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:26,380
Put him where no one can see him
and don't discharge him without my word.

427
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,280
A closed-off place you can only leave
in a coffin.

428
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,850
Don't worry.
No one will take him by force on my watch.

429
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,790
Why don't you try
to get your father's will...

430
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,020
completely changed?

431
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,920
Who's requesting what? Moon Tae Kyung.

432
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,690
What do you really think you can do to me?

433
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,660
I checked the chairman's medical chart,
and I found something strange.

434
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,760
Strange in what way?

435
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
