1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,670
What did you say?

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,380
The chairman wanted to promote
Director Min to CEO,

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,450
but CEO Min scrapped everything?

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,820
Is that true?

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,760
Director.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,330
I asked if what you just said is true.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,460
Did my sister
get in the way of my promotion?

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,260
Why don't you calm down and...

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,830
Director.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,910
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,940
(Mingang Distribution)

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,680
What do you want?

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,320
I asked what you wanted.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,080
Don't you have anything to say to me?

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,050
What are you on about?

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,890
I had a feeling
you'd have something to tell me.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,560
If you came to spew nonsense, get out.

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,000
Didn't you hear me?

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,150
I waited to see you because I was worried.

20
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,980
I was talking to Stella Jang,
someone from the private equity fund...

21
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,080
I know.

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,560
I also know you got your job here
because of your connections.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,690
I didn't think you'd hear me.

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,460
I'm sorry if you found out
something you shouldn't have.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,630
It's not something I shouldn't have known.

26
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,270
Still, I don't want to be the reason
you two drift apart.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,070
- You're sisters...
- Sisters?

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,670
What is that anyway?

29
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,170
You don't know
how Kyung Chae treated my mom!

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
Director.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,280
Get out. I'll take it from here!

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
We sent the contract to Jogeon Logistics,

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,580
and CEO Jo believes
it's a partnership contract.

34
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,320
Did you tell him we get
a joint license on the new technology...

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,050
in return for repaying their debt?

36
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,050
Yes, of course. That's the key.

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,490
And the dual agreement?

38
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,820
It's ready.

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,890
Okay, good. Now, how long will you
keep Director Moon around?

40
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,600
Why would you ask me that all of a sudden?

41
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,770
We hired him because he had a use,
but why keep him when we're done with him?

42
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,740
His contract with us hasn't expired yet...

43
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,470
We can find an excuse to cut that short.

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,610
Lawyer Kim will easily find a way.

45
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,740
Is something wrong?

46
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,910
I'm not sure if he's fearlessly brazen
or has something up his sleeve.

47
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,610
He said to my face that he's right...

48
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,480
and that I'll see soon enough.

49
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,150
He's all talk
when he's not even worth his pay.

50
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,520
Our sales or profits
aren't as high as we'd hoped,

51
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,630
but reviews of our platform
are mostly positive, unlike the rest.

52
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,900
We pay our suppliers in full on time,
and our customers are satisfied.

53
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,960
Our review scores and reputation
are better...

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,930
than even Judo and Hangeon's,
the industry leaders.

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,830
Is he rubbing off on you?

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,870
Did he tell you too
that those two would topple soon?

57
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,240
He's no fortune teller.

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,640
You don't have feelings for him, do you?

59
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,180
I do not.

60
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,180
At first, I thought he was a nice guy.

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,950
He gets increasingly odd.
He gets on my nerves.

62
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,800
Are you here to see Ms. Lucia?

63
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,570
Yes.

64
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,670
She'll be back soon.
She left to take a call.

65
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,570
I heard the two of you
went to university together.

66
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,740
That, and we're kind of
related by marriage too.

67
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,980
I see.

68
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,510
That's not enough reason
to speak so casually at work.

69
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,350
Also,

70
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,050
you came here on business.

71
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,790
Shouldn't you greet us first?

72
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,020
What?

73
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,990
Will something dreadful happen
if you were to say hi first?

74
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,930
Is this something
worth starting a fight over?

75
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,800
You seem to think
very little about our team.

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,900
Do watch your manners.

77
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,470
Instead of disrupting the team
as they're trying to work,

78
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,370
and disrespecting them too.

79
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,870
What did you say?

80
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,270
Hey.

81
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,080
Why would you fight in front of the team?

82
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,220
Let's have a word.

83
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,670
What's going on? Why is everyone on edge?

84
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,500
There was an incident here four years ago.

85
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,670
Oh, right.

86
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,500
You wouldn't know about that.

87
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,110
Some kid jumped.

88
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,010
Is that so?

89
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,280
She came all the way up here to jump,

90
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,450
so she must've had a reason,

91
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,390
but that was pure stupidity.

92
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,990
Who would care if she died?

93
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,590
If a child acts out,
the parent should rein them in.

94
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,160
Why didn't her mom do anything?

95
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,000
Isn't that pathetic?

96
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,940
I wonder what kind of life she had
after burying her kid.

97
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,750
What are you doing?

98
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,550
My gosh.

99
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,750
It's a dizzying sight.

100
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,190
How must you feel...

101
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,160
to jump from up here?

102
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,330
No!

103
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,250
Thanks a lot.

104
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,620
Do I owe you my life now?

105
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,120
What's going on here?

106
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,930
Can't you tell we were chatting?

107
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
I'm not talking to her
as your subordinate.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,100
I'm talking to her
as a partner on a work project.

109
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,670
Lawyer Kim.
Is this how you treat a colleague?

110
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,240
Is this an office?

111
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,110
You have an office,
and we have meeting rooms too.

112
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,610
Why chat up here instead?

113
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,980
Why can't we chat up here?

114
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,450
Tell me.

115
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,390
Why can't we be up here?

116
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,230
Ms. Lucia. I have something to say.
Come with me.

117
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,270
It looks like you're done. Do you mind?

118
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,050
You pretend, but I got you, Sul Hee.

119
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,220
Just you wait until I expose you.

120
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,490
Is Kim Sun Jae out of his mind?

121
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,730
How dare he take you there?

122
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,900
He's deliberately trying to aggravate me.

123
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,000
He's not sure, so he's testing me.

124
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,600
This isn't good.

125
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,470
You got yourself a heckler
before we even got started.

126
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,310
He still can't stand it
that I got away four years ago.

127
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,350
He lost Min Kyung Chae's trust
because of that.

128
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,620
You got away at the last moment,
and knowing what she's like...

129
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
They forget what they did...

130
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,550
and only remember what happened to them.

131
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,190
If I hadn't gotten away,
he might have gotten his way...

132
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,390
and married into the Min family.

133
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,830
You just have to be extra careful.

134
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Min Soo Jung is going after
Jogeon Logistics too,

135
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,870
so pretty soon, the sisters
will be at each other's throats.

136
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,310
I hope so.

137
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,080
They must learn what happens
when they get too greedy.

138
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,650
By the way, about what you told me.

139
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,610
When Min Doo Sik practically stole...

140
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,080
from a small company
like Jogeon Logistics 30 years ago.

141
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,590
I did some digging.

142
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,890
The CEO and his wife...

143
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,720
had a son at the time.

144
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,630
The weird thing is,
no one knows where he went.

145
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,730
Goodness.

146
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,010
I'm eating enough to make you poor.

147
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,150
I'm craving so many things,
it's like I'm pregnant.

148
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,780
Eat all you want. I'll buy you anything.

149
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,450
I can't do that.

150
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,160
You already spent a lot on me.

151
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,260
The hospital bills
must've been astronomical.

152
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,760
I'm thinking of getting discharged.

153
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,800
My doctor doesn't say much,

154
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,570
so it looks like my test results are good.

155
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,270
Do you have somewhere to go
when you leave the hospital?

156
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,480
I have two perfectly fine legs.
I can go anywhere I want.

157
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,310
I'll walk where they take me
and sleep where I am when it's dark.

158
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,950
I will come to court to testify...

159
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,050
at your trial, so don't worry.

160
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,560
Instead of that, Mr. Jo,

161
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,090
why not live with me?

162
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,730
It's a small studio apartment,

163
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,000
but there's enough space for us two.

164
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,500
I wouldn't dare.
I'm a decent human being, you know.

165
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,940
I'm already deep in your debt.

166
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,800
I'd be subhuman to expect more from you.

167
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,310
Forget about that and come stay with me.

168
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,140
Mr. Jo.

169
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,610
The loan shark you mentioned
last time called Oh Pan Sool.

170
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,280
Do you know where he lives?

171
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,290
I only heard
he lived somewhere in the city.

172
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,530
Your father's contract that he has...

173
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,560
and my testimony will be enough to put...

174
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,070
Min Doo Sik on trial, right?

175
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,170
We need to find this Oh Pan Sool
if we're to get anywhere.

176
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,440
Yes, we must find him.

177
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,280
How about this?

178
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,810
Oh Pan Sool mainly does business
with companies...

179
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,580
like your father's
that are struggling to get a loan.

180
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,480
What was that place called?

181
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,950
The new target. Is it Jogeon Logistics?

182
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,430
I'm pretty sure their CEO
borrowed from him too.

183
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,030
Yes, you're right.

184
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,800
See?

185
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,840
You are my lifesaver.

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,440
I knew you'd come through.

187
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,940
That was nothing.

188
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,530
Let's erase her.

189
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,100
I see her again. Let's erase her.

190
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,470
I see her again.

191
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,780
"I have nothing to say,
but I want to speak."

192
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,280
What's up with you?

193
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,620
Did someone disappear
without paying you back?

194
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,350
Why are you moaning?

195
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,890
You don't need to know.

196
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,020
Yang Mal Sook. Have you given up on life?

197
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,260
Would someone arrest you
for dressing nicely?

198
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,730
It takes work
to cultivate class and elegance.

199
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,600
If you look cheap, you must try harder.

200
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,770
Why would I dress up
when I'm always at home?

201
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,140
I'd rather listen to a hedgehog squeal
from getting pricked while mating.

202
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,040
You're a woman until the day
your coffin lid is nailed shut.

203
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,710
Does giving up on looking good
make you happy?

204
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,340
You told me not to waste money on looks.

205
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,910
That makes as much sense
as a dumpling with no sides.

206
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,480
If you spend, make sure it shows,
so the money is worth spending.

207
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,820
Even when you spend, it doesn't show.

208
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,990
I just can't tell the difference.

209
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,990
Stop it.

211
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,900
Wait for me.

212
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,440
You won't get in?

213
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,390
How are you finding the work?

214
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,620
If you're asking about Jogeon Logistics,
I'll give you an official report.

215
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,790
I'm getting those from CEO Min.

216
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,460
I'm asking how you're finding it.

217
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,800
Do you think I got this job
with an ulterior motive?

218
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,510
I made one comment,
and you just won't let it go.

219
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,610
Because you never denied it.

220
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,580
You think I'm a gold digger, don't you?

221
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,510
That I approached you on purpose,

222
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,380
knowing exactly who you were.

223
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,380
Am I wrong?

224
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,390
Come to my office for a cup of tea.

225
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,920
No, thank you.

226
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,330
I don't want to be misunderstood again.

227
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,030
You said I hurt you.

228
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,130
You shouldn't say that flippantly.

229
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,270
If you tell just anyone they hurt you,

230
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,300
they could really get the wrong idea.

231
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,640
That they meant enough to you to hurt you.

232
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,620
I said you hurt me
because you're not just anyone to me.

233
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,820
You called them a coincidence,

234
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,890
but I thought our meetings were fate.

235
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,130
You did hurt me,

236
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,000
and I felt hurt.

237
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,200
I was serious and sincere.

238
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,930
You bought a lot of stuff.

239
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,800
Ms. Se Ri asked for something.

240
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,270
Studying must've boosted her appetite.
She has been making requests.

241
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,770
She's not home.

242
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,770
She isn't?

243
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,010
Where did she go? To her academy?

244
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,840
As if.

245
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,710
It was obvious she left to meet someone.

246
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,710
Are you...

247
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,650
my mom?

248
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,180
You must be Se Ri.

249
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,350
I wanted to meet you as soon as possible.

250
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,720
But when I heard our DNA was a match,

251
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,060
I just couldn't come to see you.

252
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,960
My heart beat out of my chest.

253
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,670
Are you really my mom?

254
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,110
Take a look.

255
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,110
You and I are a 99.9 percent match.

Se Ri.

260
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,920
My baby.

261
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,730
You're so big now, all grown up.

262
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,430
You're my long-lost baby.

263
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,770
Who is my dad?

264
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,940
If you're my mom,
you must know who my dad is.

265
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,280
Tell me. Who's my dad?

266
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,050
The kid said she had company shares.

267
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,480
Her dad must be rich.

268
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,550
A CEO of a large company, maybe?

269
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,850
I don't know who he is.

270
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,690
Your dad and I had a one-night stand.

271
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,590
He was the CEO of a big company,

272
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,830
and I was just some girl he came across.

273
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,800
Did you...

274
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,100
love my dad?

275
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,410
Of course I did.

276
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,270
That's how I got pregnant with you.

277
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,450
I had to let you go,

278
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,080
but I never forgot about you.

279
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,590
Where did they find such a dreadful actor?

280
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,930
I can't believe people fall for this.

281
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,200
The girl seems to believe her.

282
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,000
That kid...

283
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,370
is surprisingly stupid.

284
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,100
Would you believe that?

285
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,370
It's more like
she wants to believe it's true.

286
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,040
Is that it?

287
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,850
My sweet darling...

288
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,920
How about...

289
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,150
we take a smaller commission...

290
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,120
from our top sellers?

291
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,090
That will reduce our sales and profits.

292
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,530
We must accept that risk.

293
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,470
I sometimes wonder what you're thinking.

294
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,100
This wasn't how
you did business in the US.

295
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,070
How am I to take that?

296
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,210
You wouldn't know the details.

297
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,710
New Buy in the US...

298
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,380
was one of the bigger distribution
companies in the world,

299
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,850
but they had that many issues internally.

300
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,750
And I stuck to my principles even there.

301
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,690
Our platform
doesn't have a great advantage...

302
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,960
when it comes to commissions.

303
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,460
That's why I suggested we lower it.

304
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,260
There's no other reason.

305
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,300
You want to stick to morals
even if it means taking a loss.

306
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,300
It's not just about morals.

307
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,070
It's about common sense.

308
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,470
If we lose common sense,
we lose everything.

309
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,070
You have a point,

310
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,010
but if we struggle again
because we're short on funds,

311
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,510
it won't be just me who goes down.

312
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,350
Be prepared to go down as well.

313
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,150
That won't happen.

314
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,520
Both you and I...

315
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,090
will be victorious.

316
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,060
Why are you so confident?

317
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,760
Is there something or someone you trust?

318
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,430
There is.

319
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,460
I trust people.

320
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,600
It looks like the powerful are in control,

321
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,640
but in reality,
the average people are in charge.

322
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,910
I'm not sure if I should believe you.

323
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,610
People ask...

324
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,150
why I'm keeping you around
when the Min Kyung Chae they know...

325
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,580
would've fired you long ago.

326
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,480
I, too, wonder...

327
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,090
why I can't seem to...

328
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,060
let you go.

329
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,640
You look too blasé considering...

330
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,770
it's all your fault.

331
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,240
What do you want to say this time?

332
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,350
If you'd done your job properly,
we wouldn't have had to borrow...

333
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,210
from an equity fund
or take over a company.

334
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,650
Running a business
comes with dealing with variables,

335
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,620
and no one knows what tomorrow will bring.

336
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,220
Don't speak as if it's over and done.

337
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,520
We got the funding we needed.

338
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,330
You're rationalizing
the outcome of your mistake.

339
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,330
You think you're free of trouble
because the worst is over.

340
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,000
The fact is that you're running a business
into the ground,

341
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,900
and we're taking over
another company to make up for it.

342
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,770
You're always trying to pick on me.

343
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,810
I can brush it off,

344
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,540
but don't treat anyone else like this.

345
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,580
You look pathetic.

346
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,380
Who do you mean by "anyone else?"

347
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,420
Oh, Ms. Lucia?

348
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,220
How well do you know her
that you're always...

349
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,860
taking her side?

350
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,560
How much do you know
about Ms. Lucia that...

351
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,530
I know her well enough.

352
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,900
Or should I say I know too much about her?

353
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,810
What do you want?

354
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,110
I'll be the bigger person and apologize.

355
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,450
The talisman you found. That was me.

356
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,790
I apologize for putting it there.
I'm sorry.

357
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,260
Why won't you say, "You're welcome?"

358
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,900
You really need to get this
into your head.

359
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,330
Like it or hate it,
we must stick together.

360
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,400
Kyung Chae has Sun Jae,
who will do exactly as she says.

361
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,010
Then there's Director Moon,
who will never betray anyone.

362
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,540
Now there's Lucia too.

363
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,880
You don't know how powerful
her backer is, do you?

364
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,950
People would laugh
if we were to work together.

365
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,550
Who cares if they do?
What's wrong with that?

366
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,690
Can't half-siblings help each other out?

367
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,920
If you came here to say that, get lost.

368
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,260
Us two and Se Ri must stick together.

369
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,560
There's no beating Kyung Chae
if we fight on our own.

370
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,400
Is Father at death's door?

371
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,100
Is he thinking of stepping down?

372
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,630
Don't be silly.

373
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,070
If you want to inherit something,
finish the groundwork ahead of time.

374
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,340
Look at Sammyung Group.

375
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,210
They're grooming a seven-year-old
to take over the company.

376
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,910
We're way behind if you think about it.

377
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,650
Why haven't we heard from CEO Jo yet?

378
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
It takes more than
a couple of days to decide.

379
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,220
He needs time to think.

380
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,950
What's there to think about?

381
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,560
He took out a private loan.

382
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,290
They'll be urging him to pay up.

383
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,530
He's being forced to license out
a technology he worked on for years.

384
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,130
He would be torn.

385
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,430
Do you think he got another offer?

386
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,000
He hasn't, from what I heard.

387
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,900
CEO Jo doesn't have the guts
to contact others.

388
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,340
His company is not known at all,

389
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,740
and he's not the daring type.

390
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,980
That works for us.

391
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,450
I don't know what she's thinking.

392
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,220
The woman was an obvious fake.

393
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,750
Does she really think it's her real mom?

394
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,060
You mean Se Ri?

395
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,960
Wait and see.
She'll cause a huge mess soon.

396
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,430
Lucia.

397
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,360
Do you think you can face her?

398
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,760
I must, even if I don't want to.

399
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,230
She looks so unstable.

400
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,000
I guess it's because
she never had a mother figure.

401
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,340
It makes sense
that she's looking for her birth mom.

402
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,540
It's a ripe, young age.

403
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,380
My Mi So never got to live that long.

404
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,450
The worst thing a person can do is die...

405
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,680
before their parents,

406
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,820
and the most pitiful people...

407
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,860
are those who have lost a child.

408
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,330
You and I both are pitiful women.

409
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,640
Will you arrange for CEO Min to meet
Director Min at Jogeon Logistics tomorrow?

410
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,380
Yes. It should be a glorious sight.

411
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,750
Doctor Yoon wants you to see him tomorrow.

412
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,160
- What for?
- He wants to run more tests.

413
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,890
Why bother? I know how I feel.

414
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,930
Tell him not to worry, that I'm fine.

415
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,130
You should see him.
I'll tell the rest of the family.

416
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,600
Leave it.

417
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,900
They'd be pleased to hear
if I were terminal.

418
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,510
They cower in my presence,

419
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,740
but their biggest fear
is that I'll live a long life.

420
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,510
They can't wait for me to step down.

421
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,010
Not Ms. Kyung Chae.

422
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,680
She's just the same. She's...

423
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,450
She only cares about her allies.

424
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,130
Se Ri.

425
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,800
My baby.

426
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,070
You're so big now, all grown up.

427
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,140
You're my long-lost baby.

428
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,240
I feel so weird.

429
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,020
I heard you're studying hard.

430
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,860
So I can go to university next year.

431
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,220
Good.

432
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,130
I'm relieved that you finally grew up
and came around.

433
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,600
Don't worry about me,
and worry about yourself.

434
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,430
I'm not a kid anymore.

435
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,340
Are you sure?
I really won't worry about you, then.

436
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,310
Hello, CEO Jo.

437
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,610
Call Director Min first
and ask her to come see you.

438
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,650
Then set up
a separate meeting with CEO Min.

439
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,150
You remember my promise, don't you?

440
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,850
I'll make sure you keep
your technology and your company.

441
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,320
Don't worry.

442
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,630
Why won't you answer?

443
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,730
Why did you even ask me to come here?

444
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,370
The truth is,
I haven't made a decision yet.

445
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,470
You called me here
before you even made up your mind?

446
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,640
I made you a great offer.

447
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,240
You should be grateful...

448
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,510
I offered that much
for a stupid place like this.

449
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,280
It's not about the offer.

450
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,380
What's the problem, then?

451
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,790
Lawyer Kim is out on business,
and my driver is ill.

452
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,090
I'm sorry to ask you to drive.

453
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,160
Of course I should escort you.

454
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,600
He asked to see me so suddenly.
He must've made up his mind.

455
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,030
It looks like it.

456
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,310
Will you sign with me or not?

457
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,880
If you'll give me some time...

458
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,820
Why do you need more time?

459
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,320
Hello, CEO Jo.

460
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
The deal...

461
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,930
What are you doing here?

462
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,510
(Jogeon Logistics)

463
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,320
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

464
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,870
Have you lost your mind?
How dare you get involved?

465
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,830
We just need the deal signed.

466
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,240
This is why people say
you forget your place.

467
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,070
If it wasn't Lawyer Kim, it was Lucia.

468
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,240
Lucia tipped her off on purpose?

469
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,080
I'll treat you well and make it up to you.

470
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,650
Min Doo Sik will pay the price soon.

471
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,880
Jo Pil Doo. Do you know him?

472
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,920
Jo Pil Doo is alive?
