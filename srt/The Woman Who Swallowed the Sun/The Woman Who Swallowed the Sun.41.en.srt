00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,040
(Episode 41)

2
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,930
What do you want?

3
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,040
- Step aside.
- No.

4
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,410
Move!

5
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,210
Why are you doing this? What do you want?

6
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,920
Where are the documents?

7
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,460
The papers about your stocks,
certificate of deposit, and the trust.

8
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,360
Where are they?

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,560
I left them with someone.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,830
- With whom?
- My mom.

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,140
I found my birth mom.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,040
You found your what?

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,510
What are you doing out here?

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,190
Ms. Kyung Chae
went to Ms. Se Ri's room in a fit of rage.

15
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,590
Why? Did Se Ri get into trouble again?

16
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,620
It's pretty serious this time.

17
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,360
What did she do?

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,790
Her assets and share of the company.

19
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,230
I think she gave it to someone else.

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,330
What?

21
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,230
What kind of stupidity is this?

22
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,840
My goodness. What on earth is happening?

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,040
- Let's go see.
- Okay.

24
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,380
You found your what?

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,390
How many times must I say it?
I found my birth mother.

26
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,690
We compared our DNA, and I even confirmed
she's allergic to seafood like me.

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,460
So what?

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,330
Did your mom ask for your shares?

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,060
She didn't just ask for it.

30
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,800
She said she'd keep it safe,
then return it whenever I needed it.

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,740
Call that mom of yours right now.

32
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,870
When she picks up, put me on.

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,380
Call her right now!

34
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,980
She won't pick up.

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,320
I can't reach her
since the day I gave her my shares.

36
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,360
You got conned.

37
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,590
Your birth mom conned her own daughter.

38
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,630
Don't say that!

39
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,930
She could have her reasons!

40
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,380
What are you doing?
It's not right to resort to violence.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,680
He's right. You're not yourself right now.

42
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,220
I'd rather you lost it to a thug.

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,620
You found your birth mom?

44
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,790
You compared your DNA?

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,890
She's allergic to seafood like you?

46
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,130
You must've been overjoyed.
It must've been fantastic.

47
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,260
You wouldn't stop asking about your mom,

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,170
and then you met her.
I bet you could wish for nothing more.

49
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,200
That's right! I'm so happy
I could wish for nothing more!

50
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,200
Do you know what you've done?

51
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,910
Do you know what your shares mean?

52
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,010
Whoever gets their hands on it
could threaten our hold on the company.

53
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,480
And you gave it to a con artist?

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,350
Just like that?

55
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,850
Why do you even live?

56
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,090
Go out and die somewhere.

57
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,720
If you'll cause trouble
for the rest of your life,

58
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,690
go somewhere and die!

59
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,660
I don't want to live.

60
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,930
You wouldn't have done this
if you considered me a sister.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,540
You should've told me the moment
you realized you'd messed up.

62
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,440
Then we could've done something about it!

63
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,940
We missed the golden hour,
and you lied to us until we found out!

64
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,210
You're beyond help.

65
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,880
You shouldn't have been born.

66
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,920
If only back then...

67
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,490
I won't see you again.

68
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,100
Don't show yourself in my presence.

69
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,880
Calm down, Se Ri.

70
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,710
Your sister is just really angry.

71
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,950
She'll cool down in time.

72
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,790
She's so freaky scary
when she's really angry.

73
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,500
What was all that noise about?

74
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,170
What's going on?

75
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,770
What is it? Tell me.

76
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,270
I'll tell you in private.

77
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,780
What is it this time?
Is Se Ri in trouble again?

78
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,580
I think she was conned.

79
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,790
What con did she fall for?

80
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,620
Did she lose money?

81
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,990
She handed over her stake in the company
and the certificate of deposit.

82
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,990
What? That crazy...

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,730
What did the kid do that she ended up...

84
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,270
falling prey to a con?

85
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,840
Why didn't you know she was up to no good?

86
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,940
You started this.

87
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,070
She's your responsibility.

88
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,210
I was busy with work
and just found out myself.

89
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,210
I told you not to take in
a kid you can't handle!

90
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,450
Don't you add more to it!
I'm upset about it as it is!

91
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,490
Darn it.

92
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,190
My gosh.

93
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,330
How is Ms. Se Ri?

94
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,430
We managed to soothe her a bit.

95
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,370
Once she bursts into tears,
it takes a while for her to calm down.

96
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,270
Hey!

97
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,110
How can you be so calm
when a war just broke out?

98
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,980
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,380
You're listening to music
when the house is in turmoil?

100
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,780
Se Ri found her birth mom.

101
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,450
What?

102
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,190
She gave her mom
her stake in the company...

103
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,890
as well as her assets.

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,990
My word.

105
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,130
That's not all.

106
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,560
There's still verse two.

107
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,130
There's a twist.

108
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,670
The mom turned out to be a con artist.

109
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,640
What happened to her shares?

110
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,110
I've never seen Kyung Chae...

111
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,580
treat Se Ri like that in my life.

112
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,610
Me neither.

113
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,150
She coddled and covered for Se Ri,
whatever she did.

114
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,290
Kyung Chae can be so cold and exact.

115
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,660
If she decides you're out, you're out.

116
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,760
It's the end. You're done for.

117
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,530
What's wrong with Se Ri?

118
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,130
Rather than giving her shares
to a practical stranger,

119
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,060
wouldn't it have been nice
if she'd given them to you?

120
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,300
If we got her share on top of yours,
mine, and my dad's,

121
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,970
we could've done something with it.

122
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,240
Exactly.

123
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,810
My sisters are no help to me at all.

124
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,380
What happens now? What a waste.

125
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,080
Whoever has the documents now will be...

126
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,480
patting their full belly and burping.

127
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,990
Goodness.

128
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,800
Bring her downstairs.

129
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,440
Okay.

130
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,600
- Don't, Ji Seop.
- What? Okay.

131
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,370
Go get her.

132
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,910
- Okay.
- Don't, Father.

133
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,910
Don't even give her
a cup of water without my consent.

134
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,780
You can't do that.

135
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,750
Don't do this to another human being.

136
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,390
You're invading her basic rights.

137
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,020
Even murderers
get three full meals in prison.

138
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,730
Yes, Kyung Chae. Let her eat at least.

139
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,660
No. I can't forgive her.

140
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,560
I won't.

141
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,130
You're just the same as her.

142
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,870
After breakfast,
tell Lawyer Kim to come over.

143
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,170
Sun Jae? It's a Sunday.

144
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,540
Who cares what day it is
when there's a huge mess?

145
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,660
I brought some extra food as it's Sunday
and the family must be home.

146
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,200
What is it? Is something wrong?

147
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,270
The atmosphere is pretty frigid right now.

148
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,700
What's the matter?

149
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,570
I can't go into much detail.

150
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,340
Can you help me if you're not busy?

151
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,380
Of course. You have a visitor.
I'll set out a fruit platter.

152
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,520
And brew some tea.

153
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,320
It's fine.

154
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,290
It might need some revising.

155
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,360
Maybe just the last part of the sentence.

156
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,630
I need it to be airtight.

157
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,870
I know what to put in it.

158
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,840
I'll fix the clause.

159
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,390
Who is that younger man?

160
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,190
Lawyer Kim Sun Jae?

161
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,990
He's head of Mingang's Legal Team.

162
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,230
You mean to say...

163
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,860
this is Mingang Distribution's
chairman's house?

164
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,200
Yes.

165
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,570
You didn't know.

166
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,470
But then, no one would've told you.

167
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,990
Sul Hee, it's me.

168
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,000
I saw him.

169
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,870
You moron.

170
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,340
You idiot. You nutcase.

171
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,670
Why did you keep going to that house?

172
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,810
Stupid me.

173
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,180
I brought them extra food,

174
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,210
not knowing they were my sworn enemies.

175
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,580
Darn it.

176
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,780
Their youngest daughter.

177
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,550
It's the evil girl who got Mi So killed,
isn't it?

178
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,060
Yes.

179
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,630
My gosh. I won't go back there ever again.

180
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,030
Not even for a fortune.

181
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeon Ah.

182
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,200
Don't stop. Keep going back.

183
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,110
Why? What for?

184
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,070
I don't like them.

185
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,610
I think it's meant to be.

186
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,880
It feels like Mi So sent you there.

187
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,450
Mi So sent me there?

188
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,450
Keep going back and find out what you can.

189
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,160
Anything about that family will do.

190
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,890
Can you do that?

191
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,030
I can do it. I will do it.

192
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,200
So your sister
will keep delivering food there?

193
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,840
Yes.

194
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,300
It might work out for us.

195
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,240
Our sources have their limits.

196
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,180
We don't know what goes on at their home.

197
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,010
Anything your sister
can find out will help.

198
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,780
There must be a deity.

199
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,720
How did she end up
delivering food there of all places?

200
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,720
They'll try to get rid of me...

201
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,960
and Director Moon after the regular sale.

202
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,420
That would be the natural order of things.

203
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,300
Was Min Kyung Chae too reluctant
to make you a non-executive director?

204
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,400
Would she give me that position
knowing I'm on your side?

205
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,130
What should we do now?

206
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,700
I'll give them a reason
so they have no choice...

207
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,370
but to make me a non-executive director.

208
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,910
The chairman's idiot son, Ji Seop.
Tell me where I can find him.

209
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,920
(Mingang Distribution)

210
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,620
As I explained on Sunday,

211
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,090
there's a legal process
to get the shares reissued,

212
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,860
and that requires Ms. Se Ri's involvement.

213
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,030
Then the press will catch wind.

214
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,000
That would be highly likely.

215
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,030
They will criticize you
for keeping everything within the family.

216
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,200
That's a risk you must take.

217
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,800
What should we do, then?

218
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,870
Is there a solution or not?

219
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,840
There is a way, sir.

220
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,940
What you're saying is that
to get the shares from the con artist,

221
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,510
we must reveal what happened.

222
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,420
The Commercial Code mentions
the public summons procedure.

223
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,620
We can get the ownership
of the old shares annulled...

224
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,420
and request they be reissued,

225
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,890
but that process
requires a police report...

226
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,760
stating we reported
the theft or misplacement.

227
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,630
That's the same thing.

228
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,530
Too long has passed
because Se Ri kept it from everyone.

229
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,270
We could've done something
if we'd found out right away.

230
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,300
It might be too late,
but why not call the police?

231
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,470
And let them dig into Se Ri's past?

232
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,380
The assault from four years ago
might resurface.

233
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,650
We covered it up somehow back then,

234
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,410
but a kid died.

235
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,580
We don't need that
to come back to haunt us.

236
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,460
What happens now?

237
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,100
Say we lost Se Ri's stake.

238
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,430
Father, me, Ji Seop, Soo Jung.

239
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,670
Do our percentages remain the same?

240
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,710
There won't be any other variables
that will influence management?

241
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,110
I can't tell you that for sure right now.

242
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,810
I need to take a look at
some detailed accounts.

243
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,880
We cannot allow another variable.

244
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,920
Nothing will happen right now
because Ms. Se Ri had a small stake.

245
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,920
The problem is,
depending on who gets her stake,

246
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,660
it could become the casting vote.

247
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,190
It isn't right now,

248
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,330
so we must investigate the situation
in case another variable surfaces.

249
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,800
Why look into the situation
when it's obvious?

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,570
We all know
Kyung Chae will succeed Father.

251
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,640
Do you give up easily,
or do you have zero ambition?

252
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,610
Why assume Kyung Chae will take over
when the circumstances have changed?

253
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,910
Se Ri had the least amount of shares
out of us all,

254
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,950
but who she sided with
could've changed the game.

255
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,020
That's why Kyung Chae coddled her.

256
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,890
So she could take Se Ri's shares
to fight us off if she had to.

257
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,720
She had a plan.

258
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,890
Now that option is out the window.

259
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,960
We should fight with new rules.

260
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,330
How?

261
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,300
Kyung Chae has
the biggest share of us all.

262
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,670
That would change
if you and I were to join forces.

263
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,270
Forget it. What about Father?

264
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,970
It's game over
if he sides with Kyung Chae.

265
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,150
We all know he made plans
to make Kyung Chae his successor...

266
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,950
in case we ended up
fighting over the company...

267
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,380
after he died.

268
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,650
Things can and will change
if a new face enters the picture.

269
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,660
A new face?

270
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,530
Who knows?
Father might find true love late in life.

271
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,860
True love? What are you on about?

272
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,360
Don't underestimate
an older man's romance,

273
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,800
especially that of men like Father,
who were alone for years.

274
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,300
He spent so many long nights alone.

275
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,270
If he were to meet a woman
like a spring breeze to thaw his heart,

276
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,280
who's to say
he'll give his share to Kyung Chae?

277
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,580
Young or old, a man cares more...

278
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,520
about the woman by his side
than his offspring.

279
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,750
What are you on about?

280
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,230
Fifth floor.

281
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,340
(Mingang Distribution)

282
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,750
Are you concerned about something?

283
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,750
You don't look too well.

284
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,860
I was stressed out,
and I think it gave me indigestion.

285
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,330
I don't feel good at all.

286
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,500
I'll feel better once I get something
from the in-house doctor.

287
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,770
Why go to the doctor yourself
when you could send a secretary?

288
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,470
For exercise.

289
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,870
I need to walk as much as I can.

290
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,540
It's not good
to rely too much on medicine.

291
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,410
Give me your hand.

292
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,050
What for?

293
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,260
If you massage
the right spot on your hand,

294
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,090
it helps relieve
most symptoms of indigestion.

295
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,630
If you're at your desk...

296
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,800
all day long staring at papers
that give you a headache,

297
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,570
your body screams out asking for help.

298
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,100
Is that so?

299
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,340
What do you do in that situation?

300
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,180
I walk.

301
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,980
I like to walk along the Han River.

302
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,350
How do you feel?

303
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,090
Do you feel a bit better?

304
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,760
I think I do.

305
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,790
Give me the full treatment.

306
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,690
Do you remember our pact?

307
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,530
I do. Don't worry.

308
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,590
I said I had indigestion,

309
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,330
and she massaged my hand to help.

310
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,630
That was it.

311
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm sure it was.

312
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,940
You're too calculative and exact...

313
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,740
to go back on your word.

314
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,640
She can't even control her sister,

315
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,580
and she wants to control her father?

316
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,050
You can't have Lucia.

317
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,250
I'll get rid of her soon, so wake up.

318
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,560
Hello, Father.

319
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,030
Why haven't I heard from you at all?

320
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,370
Did you look into what I asked?

321
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,800
Oh, Stella Jang's background check.

322
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,510
"Background check" sounds very negative.

323
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,710
Let's just say I need information on her.

324
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,480
Come on, Father.

325
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,310
Butt, bottom, lower cheeks,
they're all the same thing.

326
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,880
You talk too much.

327
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,020
I hate people who love wordplay.

328
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,790
So, did you find out or not?

329
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,460
Well, not yet
because something came up at home.

330
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,890
What came up?

331
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,690
My youngest sister is in trouble.

332
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,560
That's part of your life,
and this is part of my life.

333
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,930
Even if your sister is in trouble,
you should do as I asked.

334
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,670
Father. Why do you want to know about her?

335
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,100
You should want to know about your wife.

336
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,040
You talk too much
for someone who is so clueless.

337
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,510
What more do I need to know about my wife?

338
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,610
I've known her for over 40 years.

339
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,710
I know how many pores,
sweat glands, and nose hair she has.

340
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,150
I don't want to know anymore.

341
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,790
Find out about Madam Jang
and call me right away.

342
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,690
Okay. Bye.

343
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,100
My gosh. What a striking woman.

344
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,940
Who is that?

345
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,440
What?

346
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,050
It's my beautiful wife Yang Mal Sook,
of course.

347
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,680
Don't be stupid.
Anyone can tell that's not me.

348
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,350
Who is that wench?

349
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,790
You called me your muse...

350
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,290
and sat me down
to draw another woman's face?

351
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,360
I left for a few moments...

352
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,390
to steam some sweet potatoes,
and you drew in someone else's face?

353
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,300
Are you going blind?
Do you have cataracts or glaucoma?

354
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,570
This is you!

355
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,070
That makes as much sense
as telling a day-old kitten to eat a lion.

356
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,500
Oh Pan Sool!

357
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,570
Do you think I don't know
you've fallen for someone?

358
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,780
Did thinking about her too much
cause a fire to light up in your heart?

359
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,880
- Don't come closer.
- Who is it?

360
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,020
- Who is she? When did you meet?
- That hurts!

361
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,280
- When did you meet her?
- Don't pinch the same place again!

362
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,690
Pinch other spots.

363
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,690
- That hurts.
- When did you meet her?

364
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,320
Hit me with money instead.

365
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,760
- This is much better.
- Who is she?

366
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,260
(Mingang Distribution)

367
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,460
The regular sale is coming up,

368
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,230
and our team will be busier
than ever before.

369
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,140
This sale doubles as
our fourth anniversary celebration,

370
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,000
so the company has high hopes.

371
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,340
Work extra hard,
and don't miss any details.

372
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,670
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,440
Do we do what we usually do?

374
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,950
Is the delivery network in place?

375
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,580
It is. Only time will tell
how efficient it is,

376
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,220
but the new partners we signed on...

377
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,220
will work just as hard and well
as the previous ones.

378
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,460
If we won't have any issues with delivery,

379
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,990
we just have to sell as much as possible.

380
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,030
Yes.

381
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,530
We could do with a special promotion
to highlight the sale.

382
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,430
To be honest, the usual promotions...

383
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,200
every company comes up with
don't work anymore.

384
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,010
It would be nice if we had a product
that was available...

385
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,840
only on our platform.

386
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,910
It would be massive if we had...

387
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,810
exclusive rights to something
that's popular abroad.

388
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,150
The hydration cream that's all the rage
among Millennials in the US.

389
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,580
That would sell well.

390
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,790
From the brand that Hollywood star
Helena Louise launched?

391
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,920
People in China pay extra to get it.

392
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,990
Wouldn't it be nice if we could sell that?

393
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,330
Is there anything you can do, Director?

394
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,500
I wish I could get that deal,
but it's not as easy as it seems.

395
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,440
Where are you coming back from,
Vice Director?

396
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,810
I went to the men's room. Why?

397
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,850
You were there for two hours?

398
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,420
Yes. I have chronic constipation,
and I need two-hour breaks.

399
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,490
Okay?

400
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,320
My gosh.
When do you get any work done, then?

401
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,060
Don't you worry. I get everything done.

402
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,430
Oh, do you? Great.

403
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,030
We need a special promotion
for the upcoming sale.

404
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,500
Would you like to plan it?

405
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,000
Do you think I can't?

406
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,640
I'm plenty competent.
I just never get an opportunity.

407
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,040
Exactly. I'll give you an opportunity
to show how competent you are.

408
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,210
Let's all look forward to
the great promotion...

409
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,720
our vice director will come up with.

410
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,460
Director. Can I have a word?

411
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Sure.

412
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,900
Darn him. Did he think I'd shy away?

413
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,240
It's my chance.
He wanted to see what I could do,

414
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,870
so I'll show it to him.

415
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,670
I'll crush him with an incredible idea.

416
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,050
What? What are you thinking?

417
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,890
Speak up instead of glaring lasers at me.

418
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,490
You should actually give
Vice Director Min a task.

419
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,570
Is it about what I just said?

420
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,800
I didn't mean it.

421
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No. Give him the task.

422
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,910
Do you mean that?

423
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,870
You know he can't be trusted...

424
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,680
in more ways than one.

425
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,040
What if he messes up...

426
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,010
Let's give him a chance to mess up.

427
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,390
I understand. Let's do that.

428
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,790
You won't ask why I'm suggesting this?

429
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,160
I was taught
not to ask an ally for a reason.

430
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,150
Whoever gets their hands on it
could threaten our hold on the company.

431
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,490
And you gave it to a con artist?

432
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,250
Just like that?

433
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,730
Why do you even live?
Go out and die somewhere.

434
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,630
If you'll cause trouble
for the rest of your life,

435
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,630
go somewhere and die!

436
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,110
Se Ri. You're hungry, aren't you?

437
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,880
Too bad that Kyung Chae said
you can't eat anything.

438
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,340
Ms. Se Ri.

439
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,170
You're eating like you're possessed
by a starved spirit.

440
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,970
What do you care?

441
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,980
I'll do whatever I want now.

442
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,650
I'm not scared of Kyung Chae.

443
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,430
Welcome home.

444
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,930
Where's Se Ri?

445
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,250
You can eat?

446
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,320
Just fine, thank you.

447
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,390
It's delicious!

448
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,760
You have no shame or conscience.

449
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,390
You know even less
of what damage you caused!

450
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,230
I'm guilty of just one thing.
Of being born.

451
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,870
To be honest, that's not on me, either.

452
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,370
Take that up with my birth mom!

453
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,540
I'll think of you
as a stranger from now on.

454
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,810
No! You're even worse than a stranger!

455
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,980
I'll hate and resent you
for the rest of my life.

456
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,080
If you tell me to walk east,
I'll walk west.

457
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,850
If you tell me to sit, I'll stand.

458
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,450
Oh, you told me to go and die.

459
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,320
I won't ever die!

460
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,360
I'll live until I grow senile!

461
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,890
How dare you talk like that?

462
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,490
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

463
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,330
No. Did Se Ri go somewhere?

464
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,870
- She ran away from home.
- She did what?

465
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,270
Do you get it now?

466
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,670
What kind of a nuisance
a child who goes against their parent is?

467
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,580
We dropped them a hint.

468
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,080
They'll do whatever it takes
to approach Stella Jang.

469
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,750
They're bound to go out on a limb.

470
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,050
Baek Sul Hee, you...

471
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,580
Don't you care what I do.

472
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,020
I don't think I'd be able to face...

473
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,160
the person who killed my child.

474
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,790
I'd rather strangle them in their sleep.

475
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,060
