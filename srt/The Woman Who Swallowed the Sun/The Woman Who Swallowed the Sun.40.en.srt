1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,540
If I find out you're lying, I'll kill you.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,740
Tell the truth.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,550
Was she really mine?

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,150
Was she?

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,990
Tell me. Tell the truth!

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,090
Didn't you connect the dots?

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,030
You'll hope it's not true, but it is.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,660
The "good" medicine you gave me
that was meant to cause an abortion.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,600
It almost killed us,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,600
but both Mi So and I...

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,000
barely survived.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,780
I raised her alone,
and I was both father and mother to her.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,010
I guess she just knew.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,210
She never asked...

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,680
about her father.

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,890
I gave her my family name
because she had no father,

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,560
but now that you stand before me,
I can tell the truth.

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,460
She should've been Kim Mi So.

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,170
Kim Sun Jae's daughter, Kim Mi So!

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,840
How dare you say she's mine?

21
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,910
How dare you have
and raise my child in secret?

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,120
What right did you have?

23
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,520
You called the CEO over, didn't you?

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,490
Great.

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,130
That we used to date,
and that we lived together.

26
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,860
That I supported you during your studies,

27
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,230
but you left me
as soon as you passed the bar.

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,770
That you even tried to kill
your own unborn baby.

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,010
I'll expose the true evil nature
of Lawyer Kim Sun Jae.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,780
You love proof, don't you?

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,580
I didn't think there'd be any
since it was so long ago,

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,520
but fortunately, or unfortunately,
there were quite a lot.

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,720
The restaurants we frequented together,

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,260
the neighbors we befriended,
our college classmates,

35
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,590
and our acquaintances.

36
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,760
There were lots of people.

37
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,670
I found them all on social media.

38
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,670
Oh, yes.

39
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,140
They remember us.

40
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,840
They'll testify too.

41
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,110
If you expose my identity as Baek Sul Hee,

42
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,680
I'll expose just how trashy you are.

43
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,960
They say a poor man
thrives off a woman's devotion.

44
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,790
Poor law student Kim Sun Jae...

45
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,060
leeched off Baek Sul Hee
and became a high-flying lawyer,

46
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,900
only to become Mingang's hound.

47
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,030
- You little...
- Shall I say it again?

48
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,500
If you reveal that I'm Baek Sul Hee,

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,540
your past comes out too.

50
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,810
Don't you get it?

51
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,380
Whether you like it or not,
we're in the same boat.

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,350
So you go do whatever you want.

53
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,350
If either one of us sets off the bomb,

54
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,490
we both get blown up.

55
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,790
I don't care if we turn to ash.

56
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,770
My daughter...

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,040
threw herself...

58
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,910
from this building.

59
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,810
What do you think I have to fear?

60
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,660
What are you two doing here?

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,930
Why did you want to see me here?

62
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,900
It's nothing.

63
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,910
Let's go upstairs.

64
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,600
What's going on?

65
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,310
Why did you call me downstairs,
and what were you talking about?

66
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,440
It's nothing.

67
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,640
It can't be nothing.

68
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,610
You wouldn't get
so worked up over nothing.

69
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,510
Tell me everything.

70
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,350
I was upset about the board's decision,

71
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,120
and I was arguing about it
with Ms. Lucia when you appeared.

72
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,860
Is that it?

73
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,460
That's it.

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,130
Okay.

75
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,160
Let's say so.

76
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,200
But keep in mind
that I'm pretending to fall for your lie.

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,900
You can go.

78
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,450
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Ms. Lucia.

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,630
You look dreadfully pale.
Is something wrong?

81
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,200
No. I feel a bit dizzy, that's all.

82
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,070
You should rest, then.

83
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,870
Or see the in-house doctor.

84
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,100
I'm fine.

85
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,670
We have enough staff to cover for you,
so rest up.

86
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,810
If you can't rest here,
go to the staff lounge.

87
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,680
Shall I accompany you?

88
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,480
Or get you some medicine?

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,750
I really am okay.

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,120
I'll get help if I really need it.

91
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,320
What's the matter?

92
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,190
What do you mean? What did I do?

93
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,990
You can talk to me.

94
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,220
About what?

95
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,290
I have nothing to say.

96
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,090
Ms. Se Ri.

97
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,300
I'm thirsty. I want to get some water.

98
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,070
Goodness...

99
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,480
You'll get a stomach ache.
You already have a weak system.

100
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,520
You won't tell me what's going on?

101
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,360
I have nothing to tell you!

102
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,290
You have nothing to say, is that it?

103
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,330
Then you listen to me.
I have something to say to you.

104
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,460
What is it?

105
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,660
I saw the inside of your drawer
a few days ago.

106
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,670
Something that
should've been there wasn't.

107
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,970
Your stock papers,
certificate of deposit, and trust papers.

108
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,240
Where are they?

109
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,180
I put them somewhere else!

110
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,680
Where?

111
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,010
Why do you want to know?

112
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,550
Why do you get involved in everything?

113
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,430
Didn't you connect the dots?

114
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,330
You'll hope it's not true, but it is.

115
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,930
She should've been Kim Mi So.

116
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,670
Kim Sun Jae's daughter, Kim Mi So!

117
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,750
You're the daughter of a single mom
who owns a snack bar...

118
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,390
on the outskirts of the city.

119
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,290
Did you look into my family?

120
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,090
Isn't that what you do
to people who are guilty?

121
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,190
You're mistaken.

122
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,900
The powerless can squirm,
but that won't change anything.

123
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,300
The world is ruled by the powerful,

124
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,530
and people like you and your mom
are nothing.

125
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,470
You mean less than a single ant.

126
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,100
An ant that can't escape a shoe.

127
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,090
He'll have a lot to think about.

128
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,520
If he's half a human, there's no way
he doesn't feel anything...

129
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,730
when he found out
he drove his child to her death.

130
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,230
Why did he threaten your innocent sister
and cause this mess?

131
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,470
Is she all right?

132
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,070
The guards I hired are watching her
around the clock, so she'll be fine.

133
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,640
Kim Sun Jae won't be able to
expose you for a while.

134
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,650
But he will still try to get you
and Moon Tae Kyung to leave Mingang.

135
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,980
He will, right?

136
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,790
This won't do. I should meet with CEO Min.

137
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,960
And say what?

138
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,160
If all else fails, I'll ask
to be made a non-executive director.

139
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,000
Then we'll still have some control
within Mingang even if you leave.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,670
They must be reined in.

141
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,890
You can take the next one.

142
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,590
The doors are closing.

143
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,630
Get in.

144
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,770
Who cares if we share the elevator?

145
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,600
This isn't the Joseon era.

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,410
You heard me. Get in.

147
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,850
Is that Legal?

148
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,310
If you're done reviewing the contracts,

149
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,180
can I have them back to show the CEO?

150
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,850
"Not yet?"

151
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,020
Can you put me through
to Mr. Kim if he's there?

152
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,090
Really?

153
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,230
Okay, thanks. Bye.

154
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,770
I need him to approve the new contracts,

155
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,710
but Kim Sun Jae didn't come to work.

156
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,540
He missed work today? Why?

157
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,340
I don't know.

158
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,680
He wouldn't skip work like that.

159
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,780
No, he wouldn't.

160
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,050
I wonder what he's scheming this time.

161
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,950
If someone suddenly misses work,
you're supposed to...

162
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,760
get worried or wonder
if something is wrong.

163
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,890
With him, I get suspicious first.

164
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,690
Goodness...

165
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,830
I didn't expect you to make such a demand.

166
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,100
Are you surprised?

167
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,870
I have a right to see how you spend
the investment I secured for you.

168
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,080
I don't think it's too much to ask you
to make me a non-executive director.

169
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,810
The rule of thumb is to appoint
a professional who has...

170
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,610
a broad understanding and expertise...

171
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,620
in the business the company is in.

172
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,390
Don't you know I have
a pretty spectacular career of my own?

173
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,520
After my ex-husbands died,

174
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,130
I took over their companies.

175
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,670
You look very kind, miss.

176
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,700
Can you put me through
to Lawyer Kim Sun Jae from Legal?

177
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,010
- Give me a moment.
- Sure.

178
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,950
Hello. Is Lawyer Kim Sun Jae present?

179
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,880
Oh, really?

180
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,980
Yes, thank you. Bye.

181
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,550
He didn't come in today.

182
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,260
What must I do, then?

183
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,820
Oh, you needn't answer.

184
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,160
I'll see my son-in-law instead.

185
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,830
Hello, it's me.

186
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,300
I'm in the lobby downstairs.

187
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,770
Come on down now. Bye.

188
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,180
Dear sweet fate, why must you taunt me so?

189
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,050
Who's this?

190
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,890
It's good to see you, madam.

191
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,890
Who are you?

192
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,420
I'm sad you don't remember me.

193
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,730
I remember you too clearly.

194
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,430
We met over there
as if destiny brought us together,

195
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,130
and we looked into each other's eyes
silently for a long time. That's me.

196
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,370
That happened?

197
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,800
It definitely happened.

198
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,600
Would it be impudent of me...

199
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,010
to inquire what brought you here?

200
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,180
I came to see the CEO as an investor.

201
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,850
I see, you're an investor.

202
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,680
I also am an investor.

203
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,750
I happened to have...

204
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,850
a huge hand in the company,
but that was a crude joke.

205
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,760
Goodbye, then.

206
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,560
Oh, no. Don't say goodbye so soon.

207
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,590
Madam. Don't you see me?

208
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,900
Am I invisible? Am I a shadow?

209
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,970
I know you see me.

210
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,170
You're hilarious.

211
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,300
You see me, don't you?

212
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,370
Are you interested in me?

213
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,810
You floored the gas pedal
and went for it. Your charisma is good.

214
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,110
If you cut off the head and tail
and ask point-blank,

215
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,480
that would make me extremely flustered.

216
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,750
I spent most of my life in the US,
and I prefer the American way.

217
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,620
You seem to be interested in me.

218
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,290
Can I be interested or not?

219
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,330
Let me ask you something.

220
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,270
If a man were to come across
the prettiest flower in the world...

221
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,700
and not even pause,
would he be a man or a beast?

222
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,770
A flower? That's not too bad.

223
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,270
I'm Stella Jang.

224
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,040
I'll see you around.

225
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,350
Just a moment, Stella Jang!

226
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,850
You forgot exactly three details.

227
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,420
When, where, and how?

228
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,790
Let's decide that.

229
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,720
When, where, and how?

230
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,590
Stella Jang? Ms. Jang.

231
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,090
- Ms. Jang!
- Father!

232
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,260
Father, Ms. Jang...

233
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,100
Do you know who Stella Jang is?

234
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,870
- Stella Jang?
- Yes or no?

235
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,040
You must know even if you don't.

236
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,900
Put everything else aside
and find out about her.

237
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,240
How old she is,

238
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,010
where she sleeps and wakes,

239
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,510
and most importantly,
if she's single, double, or triple.

240
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,750
Find out immediately.

241
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,050
You asked to see me?

242
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,590
Why don't you come by anymore?

243
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,290
We're close enough
that I don't have to call you to see you.

244
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,030
Aren't we on the same side?

245
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,860
Shall I give you a few tips?

246
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,040
Our chairman's taste,
preferences, ideal type, and more.

247
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,410
It should help.

248
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,410
I don't need that.

249
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,550
You know, I'm not like my sister.

250
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,520
She's a legitimate daughter
with an unblemished upbringing,

251
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,050
so she has limits,

252
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,360
but I'm not, and I don't.

253
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,090
What do you mean?

254
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,360
That you should be like me
and not stop at anything.

255
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,330
If things get tough,

256
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,230
try to bed my father
and score a night with him.

257
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,170
I'm showing you
how serious I am about our deal.

258
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,940
You should show how sincere you are too.

259
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,320
There's one thing I will never return,

260
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,660
even if they pay interest
on top of compound interest.

261
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,190
The rest, I'll return when I'm paid.

262
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,200
Doeun Industries' CEO
Han Kyung Soo's collateral.

263
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,570
The reason he'll return any collateral
when paid, but not my father's.

264
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,640
What could it be?

265
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,540
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

266
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,610
You need to eat too, right?

267
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,050
I was going to heat up
the goat soup we brought home.

268
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,120
Join us.

269
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,890
Goat soup?

270
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,460
My husband took me to the restaurant,

271
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,990
and it was so good
that we brought some home.

272
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,590
Here we go.

273
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,330
- Try it.
- Thanks.

274
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,840
My gosh.

275
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,480
Ma'am. I'm not a fan
of offal or bone broth,

276
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,610
but this smells and tastes so good.

277
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,080
Doesn't it? I thought so too.

278
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,590
Invigorating health foods
aren't just for the elderly.

279
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,320
Even young people like it too.

280
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,290
My husband fell in love with it...

281
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,360
and even wants to open a branch.

282
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,530
He went out to ask about it.

283
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,030
I see.

284
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,900
My gosh.

285
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,040
The soup is so thick and rich.

286
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,040
It's so good.

287
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,320
Ma'am.

288
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,190
Can I ask you something?

289
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,820
What's that?

290
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,500
Your husband said last time
that he'd return...

291
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,930
all the other collateral if he were paid,

292
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,130
but with one exception.

293
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,040
Doeun Industries' Han Kyung Soo?

294
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,940
He said he wouldn't return that.

295
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,240
Is there a reason for that?

296
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,180
I can't say.

297
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,250
I don't know anything.

298
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,850
I just assume that's a fact
because my husband says so.

299
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,650
Then, if someone were to ask,
would he consider...

300
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,660
Don't you know how stubborn my husband is?

301
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,660
If he says no once, that's that.

302
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,730
Why do you ask anyway?

303
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,630
Do you know Han Kyung Soo?

304
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,200
I heard he and his wife
died in an accident together.

305
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,500
They can't be your parents.

306
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,310
Are you a relative?

307
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,240
Gosh, no. I'm not.

308
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,080
I was curious, that's all.

309
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,920
- Eat up.
- Yes, thanks.

310
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,820
Your father came to the office today.

311
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,590
What for?

312
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,890
He came to see Sun Jae but couldn't,
so he called me instead.

313
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,630
Why did he ask me about Stella Jang?

314
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,530
Stella Jang? Who's that?

315
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,130
The person who connected us
with the private equity fund.

316
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,000
She outlived multiple rich husbands...

317
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,670
and inherited an incredible fortune.

318
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,810
Why would Dad ask about her?

319
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,340
I don't know. Maybe she's his type.

320
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,180
What are you saying?
That my dad is having an affair?

321
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,050
Not exactly,

322
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,550
but he must have an ideal type.

323
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,120
Who's to say
he didn't fall for her at first sight?

324
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,860
You're insane. What's wrong with you men?

325
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,730
Don't you even dare try that.

326
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,370
That hurt.

327
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,010
(Mingang Distribution)

328
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,180
I put a lot of thought
into selecting the right partners.

329
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,780
The problem is the contract.

330
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,120
We signed a provisional contract,

331
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,790
but if Legal doesn't sign off on it,

332
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,090
the delay will disrupt our schedule.

333
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,890
Can you handle the increased orders
that will come in during the regular sale?

334
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,530
Yes. The new partners
are smaller in scale,

335
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,660
but we linked them
with each other to form a chain,

336
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,500
and they will move as a team.

337
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,600
Providing a solution to the problem...

338
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,770
doesn't mean you're free from blame,

339
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,640
but I'm glad you moved quickly.

340
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,380
May I make a request?

341
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,940
What is it?

342
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,310
Can you ask Lawyer Kim
to get his team to review...

343
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,620
and sign off on the contracts
as soon as...

344
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,160
Why didn't you come in yesterday?

345
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,660
I had something personal to handle.

346
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,830
That's unusual for you.

347
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,400
I'm glad you're here.

348
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,900
Director Moon needs you
to sign off on the new contracts soon.

349
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,300
Why didn't you come to me in person?

350
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,410
I thought you had a thing
against my team...

351
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,540
Are you afraid I'll stall the process...

352
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,210
to get you in trouble?

353
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,450
I can't say that's not a concern at all.

354
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,510
You'll get them back before lunchtime.

355
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
Goodbye, then.

356
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,100
I thought about it, and you were right.

357
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,340
We are in the same boat,
at least when it comes to our past.

358
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,710
You can't delete me from your past,

359
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,750
and I can't delete you from mine.

360
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,650
But...

361
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,560
you're wrong about one thing.

362
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,090
You can bring up the baby I thought...

363
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,590
I'd gotten rid of 20 years ago,

364
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,830
but that won't make me feel paternal.

365
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,670
Revealing the truth now will be
a disaster and calamity to us both.

366
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,770
You should've kept it a secret.

367
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,540
You should've taken it to your grave.

368
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,210
You should've kept it to yourself.

369
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,650
What? Did you think
I'd clutch at my chest...

370
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,480
and wail if you told me who she was?

371
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,250
That I'd repent and beg for forgiveness?

372
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,860
You're wrong.

373
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,530
She's just a baby who died 20 years ago.

374
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,300
You called me...

375
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,670
Mingang's dog.

376
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,000
A dog...

377
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,640
must protect its master.

378
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,440
I'm going to do what a dog does.

379
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,180
You know a dog bites and never lets go...

380
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
when someone threatens their master.

381
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,220
You should've expected this much
of a backlash when you attacked me.

382
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,020
Watch out.

383
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,620
Your daughter died here,

384
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,160
and you could too.

385
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,050
Legal reviewed
and signed off on the contracts.

386
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,080
Those are the originals.

(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

388
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,650
My gosh.

389
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,650
They're all such minor companies
that I've never heard of them.

390
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,590
Our demands and requirements
are reflected in the contracts,

391
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,230
and if they fail to fulfill their duties,

392
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,600
they'll return the down payment
and pay compensation as well.

393
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,230
They'll agree to anything.

394
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,940
Don't trust the contract.
It's just a piece of paper.

395
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,410
Small companies like these
lose nothing if they go bankrupt.

396
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,680
If we demand compensation
and threaten legal action,

397
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,380
they'll turn themselves in to the police
because they'd rather go to prison.

398
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,250
So what if you get them
to agree to pay us a penalty?

399
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,190
What if they close their business
and refuse to pay?

400
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,960
You didn't think of that, did you?

401
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,590
Do you think it'll be that easy...

402
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,090
to string a few tiny companies together
to work as a team?

403
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,270
Let's see how things go.

404
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
The upcoming sale...

405
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,870
is your fourth anniversary sale,
and I expect great results.

406
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,510
Once the sale is over,

407
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,450
we'll decide what to do with you.

408
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,130
Hello, Manager Gong.

409
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,800
You're in a good mood.

410
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,300
Your voice is an octave higher.

411
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,670
Yes. Something awesome happened.

412
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,080
Did you win the lottery?

413
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,980
You could say that, I guess,

414
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,550
but what I got is better than money.

415
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,320
It's better than money?

416
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,350
Is there such a thing?

417
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,360
What is it?

418
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,960
I met my big sister.

419
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,860
My gosh. Did you really?

420
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,740
You couldn't find her for four years.
How did you find her so suddenly?

421
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,740
I don't know. It suddenly happened.

422
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,340
That's why I said
it was like winning the lottery.

423
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,040
I'm so happy for you.

424
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,910
Thank you.

425
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,920
You don't have to pay
for today's delivery.

426
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,190
It's on me
because I'm in such a great mood.

427
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,160
Watch out.

428
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,760
Your daughter died here,

429
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,760
and you could too.

430
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,170
No. I won't die here
or anywhere near Mingang.

431
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,970
You lot will shed...

432
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,840
as much blood as Mi So did.

433
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,650
What is it? Do you have something to say?

434
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,590
I'm not sure how this will sound
coming from me,

435
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,090
but it's about Ms. Se Ri.

436
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,430
What about her?

437
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,390
I happened to see by chance...

438
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,560
that one of her drawers was empty.

439
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,830
What do you mean?

440
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,800
The drawer where she keeps
the papers about her company stock.

441
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,570
It was empty.

442
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,500
What do you want?

443
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,740
- Step aside.
- No.

444
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,910
Move!

445
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,780
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?

446
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,520
Where are the documents?

447
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,090
The papers about your stocks,
certificate of deposit, and the trust.

448
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,560
Where are they?

449
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,600
I left them with someone.

450
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,170
- With whom?
- My mom.

451
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,340
I found my birth mom.

452
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,510
You found your what?
