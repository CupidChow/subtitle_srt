1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,450
What the...

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,380
(Episode 33)

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,580
What's this?

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,950
My gosh.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,720
You got slapped?

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,990
Well, someone from work
must've filmed and sent it.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,330
Don't mind it.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,500
Tell me!

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,770
Did Kyung Chae slap you?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Were you assaulted?

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,910
- Yes.
- I'll get her to...

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,110
Don't do anything.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,550
Aren't you angry
about how she treated you?

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,550
I am, but I can't take her on
and fight back.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,720
I see why Ms. Min was upset.

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,220
I didn't tell her where you were.

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,990
She found out somehow.

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,790
You knew she'd found out?

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,100
She came to see me.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,260
She's my daughter,

21
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,400
but I know
she'll do anything to get her way.

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,700
She'd have found me no problem.

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,210
Even so, if there was a misunderstanding,
she should talk it out.

24
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,440
How dare she lash out?

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,910
It's understandable.

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,250
Your emotions take over
when you're angry about something.

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,250
It was a mistake on her part.
Let it go and turn a blind eye.

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,490
You trust and depend on her.

29
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,330
To think I doubted
and suspected this kind woman.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,200
If you think about it,
I owe Ms. Min a great deal.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,330
I wouldn't have joined Mingang
if not for her,

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,640
and then I wouldn't have seen you again.

33
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,150
It was right of you to defend Kyung Chae,
whom he trusts the most.

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,650
The chairman will trust you even more now.

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,560
What is Sun Jae up to?

36
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,930
He tried to find out about us,
got nothing, then dug into my past.

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,860
What I did in the US...

38
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,070
and how I met my ex-husbands.

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,700
He will find out about your son, then.

40
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,970
My Ho Se?

41
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,710
He won't find out that easily.

42
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,910
What on earth did those people...

43
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,080
do to your son?

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,550
You want to know?

45
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,120
I didn't tell you much at all, did I?

46
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,700
Were they involved in his death
like they were in Mi So's?

47
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,430
Was the chairman the culprit?

48
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
He was related in a way,

49
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,240
but the actual culprit was someone else.

50
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,510
Who's that?

51
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,420
Do you know what you gave up on...

52
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,020
to become Mingang Distribution's CEO?

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,720
I bet you never missed
what you left behind.

54
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,260
My dear Ho Se.

55
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,660
My son, who treasured you with his life.

56
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,950
My gosh. Why are you drinking
without any snacks on the side?

57
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,250
You go and make something.

58
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,620
I'll bring a few things.

59
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,130
What did you mean by what you said?

60
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,760
That Lucia is after something bigger.

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,430
Does she want to be made CEO
for saving Father's life?

62
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,330
Is that why you slapped her?

63
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,970
How would you feel
if Father were to start dating?

64
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,170
Father with a girlfriend?

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,340
Forget it.

66
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,910
He's had more than enough lovers
in the past.

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,810
Who knows? He might have
one last relationship left in him.

68
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,220
"One last relationship?"

69
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,820
This is between us, but think about
Soo Jung and Se Ri's moms.

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,120
Father just used them.

71
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,990
Why are you talking about Father dating?

72
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,530
I have a feeling...

73
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,130
the old flower tree might bloom once more.

74
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,110
"The old flower tree might bloom?"

75
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,950
(Mingang Distribution)

76
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,900
Anyone who is old enough
craves human warmth.

77
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,140
Whether you're rich or poor,
that rule applies.

78
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,310
If someone approaches, they think
it's meant to be, and they open up.

79
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,950
Even more so if it's a young woman.

80
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,950
They mistakenly think it's fate,

81
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,320
and when the woman saves their life,
it's practically game over.

82
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,100
The unfortunate fact is,
all such relationships end in tragedy.

83
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,470
Women who don't know they were
just a toy get abandoned in the end.

84
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,910
They're ridiculed for becoming
a sexual partner to an old man,

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,880
and they end up ruined in body and spirit.

86
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,880
Then they're abandoned.

87
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,030
That's the renewed partnership contract.

88
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,400
My team reviewed it,

89
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,770
and all it needs
is the other company's seal.

90
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,040
You're such a competent guy
that this is nothing to you.

91
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,680
Just so you know, Mingang never failed...

92
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,650
to renew a deal with an existing partner
since its establishment.

93
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,860
Don't worry. I'll get this signed.

94
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,430
Why would I worry when it's a done deal?

95
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,860
I've been hearing strange rumors
about our partner companies...

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,800
Miyeon and Woojin.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Such rumors are common in our industry.

98
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,740
We can't do anything
if we believe everything we hear.

99
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,310
I wonder if you're confident
or if you're pretending to be.

100
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,610
Whatever it is,
the results will speak for themselves.

101
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,850
That sounds like
if things were to go wrong,

102
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,320
Mingang... Or to be more exact,
I would get into deep trouble,

103
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,290
and that's what you want.

104
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,620
What do you stand to gain
if something bad were to happen to me?

105
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,860
At least we get to see
if you're needed or not.

106
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,860
If you hold a position too good for you
because you were once highly spoken of,

107
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,560
action must be taken.

108
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,100
You mean...

109
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,100
I shouldn't be a director here?

110
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,310
Do what you can with that.

111
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,710
What was that about?

112
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,750
The partnership contract renewal.

113
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,260
I should get rid of Lucia soon.

114
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,530
Stella Jang won't let you.

115
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,630
She put you in touch with the fund
to get Lucia a job here.

116
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,460
We can't let her stay for that.

117
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,030
If the chairman returns,
it will be too late for us to do anything.

118
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,100
The simplest thing we can do now...

119
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,100
is to send her to another region.

120
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,040
Or we could send her
to work at one of our hubs.

121
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,080
I need a reason for that.

122
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,210
Come up with something.

123
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,710
The chairman will shield her
if we don't do something.

124
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,780
She'll be beyond our reach then.

125
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,690
The existing contract stands
until next month,

126
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,560
so we need to finalize this
by next week at the latest.

127
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,030
I guess?

128
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,260
What if the rumors are true?

129
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,200
Mingang will take action
if we lose those partners.

130
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,970
I could lose my job...

131
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,410
since the CEO
will have no more reason to keep me.

132
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,480
Are you saying you could get fired?

133
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,980
If that's what they want.

134
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,680
Why? Are you worried?

135
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,750
Why wouldn't I be worried?

136
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,490
I don't want you to get hurt.

137
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,560
It's reassuring to know
I have someone in my corner.

138
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,760
Didn't you know we're on the same side?

139
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,270
I wish we could be on the same side
until the end.

140
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,740
I'll be on your side until the end.

141
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,980
What's going on?

142
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,520
Why do I sense a certain warmth?

143
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,760
(Hankuk Hospital)

144
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,890
What are you all doing here?

145
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,890
I bothered to come,
and this is what I get?

146
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,930
Yes, Father. We were worried about you.

147
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,270
Worry about yourselves.
You never cared about me.

148
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,610
Do you have the time to be here?

149
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,440
What about your academy classes?

150
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,680
I go on time, so don't you mind.

151
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,710
Can't you at least pretend to be touched?

152
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,920
But then, you don't need family or kids.

153
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,080
You'll put Mingang first until you die.

154
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,050
My kids don't act like they should.

155
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,990
They only care about the inheritance.

156
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,890
Father. Are you upset
about something or us?

157
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,730
We don't only care about your money...

158
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,030
or the inheritance.

159
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,740
I don't know if you remember,

160
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,770
but when you were in a coma
after the surgery,

161
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,080
Ji Seop and I watched over you
in the hospital.

162
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,780
We prayed and wished you'd wake up.

163
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,120
You have no idea how anxious we were.

164
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,690
Take them home, Manager Gong.
I want to get some sleep.

165
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,890
My gosh.

166
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,090
See?

167
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,730
My father-in-law is a tough man.

168
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,530
To be honest, if he went to death's door
and had brain surgery at his age,

169
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,770
shouldn't he hug his kids
and say how happy he is to see us?

170
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,570
I wasted time coming here.

171
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,070
I won't care about Dad anymore.

172
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,810
I don't even care if he comes home.

173
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,150
See?

174
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,220
He's choosing to stay here
because he can't stand us,

175
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,320
and none of us care much about him,
so we're even.

176
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,730
Finalize the contract renewals
by next week,

177
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,200
then submit a detailed sales strategy
for the third and fourth quarters.

178
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,000
I looked up some other possible partners,
just in case.

179
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,740
They don't have much of a reputation
because they're relatively new,

180
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,910
but they'll work hard
if they're given a chance.

181
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,920
Are you saying you're not confident
the existing contract will be renewed?

182
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,750
It's not about being confident.

183
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,590
Regardless of what I think or want,
there could always be external variables.

184
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,190
All our competitors...

185
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,990
were established after Mingang.

186
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,200
But for a while now,
they've been our equals.

187
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,300
They could overtake us
if we aren't careful.

188
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,400
If they steal our partners
and suppliers too,

189
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,900
we'll never recover.

190
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,340
I'm aware of that.

191
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,340
I know competitors are offering extra
to sign with our partners,

192
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,010
but that's not the problem right now.

193
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,780
I know what you're saying.

194
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,380
That's why I'm saying
if nothing else works,

195
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,650
finding someone else
to do business with could be a solution.

196
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,430
Ms. Lucia.

197
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,760
You were hired
as the CEO's favor to someone...

198
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,870
and not through official channels.

199
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,470
That means what the CEO wants goes.

200
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,810
So what? Did the CEO
tell you to send me somewhere?

201
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,510
No. She'd have...

202
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,810
done something long ago
if she wanted you gone.

203
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,050
She's giving you the chance
to come to your senses...

204
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,280
and know when to leave.

205
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,520
Right now, you think the chairman
will shield you, but you're mistaken.

206
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,190
The Min Doo Sik I know isn't that soft.

207
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,100
He can't think straight
because he just had surgery,

208
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,470
and he's being nice to you.

209
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,200
The chairman is clear-headed
and is pretty much more lucid than anyone.

210
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,840
Don't belittle him
because he recently had surgery.

211
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,410
Why don't you...

212
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,410
ask him to pay you for saving him?

213
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,980
That would be nicer.

214
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,820
You do the math, then.

215
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,020
I'd love to know
how much the chairman's life is worth.

216
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,800
Lawyer Kim?

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,540
I'd been meaning to ask you something.
Can I have a word?

218
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,390
My sister is tough,
but she's not the type to get violent.

219
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,890
Especially not at work.

220
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,560
What did Lucia do to make her do that?

221
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,500
Find out for yourself if you want to know.

222
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,470
You seem to get the outline,
but not the details.

223
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,540
Whoever gets on Kyung Chae's nerves
gets on mine as well.

224
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,680
Do you think I'd side with her
and go against my sister?

225
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,950
Think carefully about it.

226
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,250
Kyung Chae and I share half our genes.

227
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,450
Lucia is a complete stranger.

228
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,590
My gosh.

229
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,170
He sent his stuff?

230
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,470
This room is occupied
by a few boxes and not a person?

231
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,670
This is how people move nowadays.

232
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,770
He can't move during the day
when he has to work.

233
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,740
The movers do the work for him.

234
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
That's enough.

235
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,280
What landlady
does the cleaning for the tenant?

236
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,280
He promised to pay us double.

237
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,080
Why don't you offer to provide meals too?

238
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,750
I ordered lots of side dishes
to do exactly that.

239
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,320
Did you donate a kidney to a gorilla
that fainted while beating its chest?

240
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,390
You might spend the extra money on him.

241
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,060
Don't be so stingy.

242
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,030
That's why Sun Jae stopped visiting us.

243
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,430
We're practically strangers now.

244
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,430
He's my only remaining relative
on my mom's side.

245
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,240
You sound like a mayfly
that's considering a pension.

246
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,410
Who do you think made Sun Jae a lawyer?

247
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,940
He should thank me, but he never did.

248
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,190
The side dishes you asked for.

249
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,620
Thanks a lot. We'll enjoy them.

250
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,720
You ordered a lot this time.

251
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,860
We have another mouth to feed.

252
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,330
I rented out Ja Kyung's bedroom.

253
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,070
A young man moved in,
and I can't ignore him, can I?

254
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,930
I should ask him to eat with us.

255
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,240
My gosh. You'll be truly blessed one day.

256
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,170
You're so nice to others.

257
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,270
Me, blessed?

258
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,250
But then, people do say I'm considerate.

259
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,150
Why do you spend my money
so you can be blessed?

260
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,750
While I get angry?

261
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,690
I don't think...

262
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,730
the chairman sees her
purely as a woman who saved his life.

263
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,120
What happens now?

264
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,990
If Father has feelings for her,

265
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,760
should I object or offer my support?

266
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,060
What can I do
to give Kyung Chae a hard time?

267
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,970
We need a new sales strategy
for the next two quarters.

268
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,370
Can you send me last quarter's numbers...

269
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,340
and suggestions if you have any?

270
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,510
Why sit at your desk
to come up with a strategy...

271
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,950
when nothing changes?

272
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,680
Our industry is struggling.
It's not just us that's doing poorly.

273
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,880
We still have to do something.

274
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,250
Plus, the CEO asked me...

275
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,590
for a detailed strategy this time.

276
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
Share your great ideas if you can.

277
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,330
Ideas don't pop out whenever you want,

278
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,860
like they're in some magic lamp.

279
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,670
What are you so disgruntled about?

280
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,300
I'm asking for help
to find ways to improve sales.

281
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,580
We should trust in the director
and keep going, not just give up.

282
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,680
We're one of the few departments
making a profit.

283
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,480
Our numbers are improving at least.

284
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,250
My gosh. I'm too scared
to voice my opinion now.

285
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,750
You two are ganging up.

286
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,860
That's what teammates should do.

287
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,690
We can't act all displeased
and speak sarcastically all the time.

288
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,530
The director is right.

289
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,030
We should come up
with a strategy to do better.

290
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,800
So what?

291
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,210
You want me to pay Lucia?

292
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,010
It has been a while
since she saved the chairman,

293
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,710
and she should be compensated.

294
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,850
That's how to draw the line and come up...

295
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,750
with a reason to warn her
to stay away from him.

296
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,950
That won't work
because the chairman is the issue.

297
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,490
He has feelings for her already.

298
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,860
I know him just as well as you.

299
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,760
He hates family issues that would affect
the company more than anything.

300
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,770
Why not use that to appeal to him
before things could get worse?

301
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,240
If word were to get out that the chairman
is dating a young employee,

302
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,680
that would ruin Mingang's image.

303
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,380
Talk to him about that,
and you can get through to him.

304
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,700
Can you drop by after work?

305
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,060
Do you have something to say?

306
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,830
It's not important,
but I'd like to see you.

307
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,300
I've been bored all day.

308
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,610
I'll visit, then.

309
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,070
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

310
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,350
Of course. I can make that for you.

311
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,350
Or anything else you want.

312
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,720
Okay. I won't bring anything.

313
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,650
Rest up.

314
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,330
The CEO wants to see you.

315
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,450
Accompany Lawyer Kim
to our Cheongju warehouse.

316
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,310
Right now?

317
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,920
Is there a reason you can't go?

318
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,320
No. It's sudden, that's all.

319
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,860
Do I need to ask you first
if you're available to travel for work?

320
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,490
I'm considering using the warehouse
for something else.

321
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,260
Isn't it natural for someone
on the team to check in person?

322
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,800
What is it?

323
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,900
Do you have plans for the evening?

324
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,340
No, I don't.

325
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,480
A business trip?

326
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,180
I haven't heard anything about that.

327
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,390
The CEO told me about it just now.

328
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,520
Why would she
arrange something so suddenly?

329
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,720
I'm going with Lawyer Kim.

330
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,460
What? With Kim Sun Jae?

331
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,600
Wait here. I'll go and talk to her.

332
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,750
Do you really need Ms. Lucia
to go on the business trip?

333
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,980
Why else would I send her?

334
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,280
I find it odd
that you'd send her on a sudden trip.

335
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,590
It's not sudden.
She should've gone long ago.

336
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,520
I'll go instead.

337
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,060
No. I have another task for you.

338
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,370
Why make such a fuss about a short trip?

339
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,570
Are you afraid
I'll hurt Lucia or something?

340
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,310
I'm irritated about the fact
that everyone here...

341
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,210
seems to ignore protocol
when doing business.

342
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,110
Her order is protocol itself.

343
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,380
You've worked long enough.

344
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,280
Are you sure it's about work
and nothing else?

345
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,520
You worry about nothing.

346
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,380
What are you up to?

347
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,080
Let's go inside.

348
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,960
(Snack Bar)

349
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,000
What are you thinking?

350
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,970
Don't get so worked up.

351
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,170
We have a long way to go,
and we need a break.

352
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,810
I'm accompanying you on business.

353
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,440
I'm hungry and would like
something to eat.

354
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,750
Put your emotions aside for once.

355
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,050
Come inside.

356
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,750
(Snack Bar)

357
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,800
You don't get the feel
because you lived in the US.

358
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,100
In Korea, poor dating couples...

359
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,400
share food at a place like this.

360
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,610
I used to come here often.

361
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,850
This was all I could afford
to buy my girlfriend...

362
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,720
as a poor man studying for the bar.

363
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,020
Hey.

364
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,020
This is still here.

365
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,660
I wrote this.

366
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,660
It's still here.

367
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,690
This Baek Sul Hee.

368
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,730
Don't you want to know who that is?

369
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,470
She was my girlfriend.

370
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,600
Is "girlfriend" too flippant a term?

371
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,710
We lived together.

372
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,840
That's why...

373
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,510
I remember her so clearly.

374
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,420
As if she were before me right now.

375
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,890
We should go.

376
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,950
Come in. I said you didn't have to knock.

377
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,860
You're not pleased to see me.

378
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,290
Why are you here?

379
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,830
Are you disappointed
I'm not who you were expecting?

380
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,970
Are you here to pick a fight?

381
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,530
Do you want your ill father
to become even worse off?

382
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,940
Lucia won't come.

383
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,540
We'll be late.

384
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,550
Oh, right.

385
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,420
The warehouse manager
postponed the meeting.

386
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,550
You should've told me sooner.

387
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,490
I just found out myself.

388
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,030
Scare her a bit.

389
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,930
I don't care how.

390
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,000
Baek Sul Hee.

391
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,910
Others might not know, but I do.

392
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,640
I know how to get you fired up.

393
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,750
You don't know
the CEO's youngest sister, do you?

394
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,480
She's a nutcase and a troublemaker.

395
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,420
No one knows who her birth mother is.

396
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,090
She couldn't finish her studies abroad...

397
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,690
and came back a few years ago,
where she got into massive trouble.

398
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,990
A teenage girl
was unlucky enough to meet her,

399
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,700
and she ended up dead.

400
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,900
What was that girl's name?

401
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,640
"Mi So," was it?

402
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,540
I'm the one...

403
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,410
who handled her body.

404
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,110
What should I say?

405
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,520
I'd never seen such a terrible sight.

406
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,020
I could barely look at it.

407
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,330
Stop it.

408
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,230
I wonder...

409
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,670
if her mom knows how dreadful
her kid's last moments were.

410
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,340
She never got to see it.

411
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,970
She'd have lost her mind if she had.

412
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,340
I told you to stop talking.

413
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,680
I couldn't sleep for days
after I'd sorted out the body.

414
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,050
I dreamed of the corpse,
and I couldn't even eat.

415
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,520
Whenever I think about that...

416
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,420
Stop it!

417
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,260
Stop the car. Pull over!

418
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,860
Pull over! Stop the car right now!

419
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,900
Baek Sul Hee.

420
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,900
Kim Sun Jae.

421
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:01,220
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

422
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,530
You said people should be used, not loved.

423
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,130
Is it wrong to be in love?

424
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,570
He was my heart and soul.

425
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,170
He was the only man
I loved unconditionally.

426
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,340
Is he really the father of your daughter?

427
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,140
It was a premeditated murder
disguised as an accident.

428
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,010
Could he be hiding something?

429
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,250
If she were to find out
he's no longer with us...

430
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,920
I won't forgive you either, Father.
