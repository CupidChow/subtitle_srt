1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,050
- What got into you?
- What?

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,350
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,150
- Will you calm down?
- Let go!

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,990
What's the point
when I can't go to school anymore?

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,020
I don't need my books!

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,890
Mi So.

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,530
Hi, Yeon Ah.

8
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,200
I need you here at the bar.

9
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,900
You have a visitor.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,510
I can't care about visitors now.
Send them away.

11
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,340
He's not that kind of visitor.

12
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,610
He says he is
Mingang Distribution's lawyer.

13
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,280
He's what?

14
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,080
Mingang Distribution's lawyer.

15
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,320
I'll stay with Mi So, so get over here.

16
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,600
How do you know about this place?

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,410
Money is information.

18
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,940
You can find out anything you want
if you have the money.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,740
I know this much.

20
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,110
Do you think Mingang Distribution
doesn't know about you?

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,980
What does that mean?
What does Mingang know?

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,390
I told you not to fight,
that you'd get crushed.

23
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,490
What does Mingang know about me?

24
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,890
Your daughter's high school admission
was canceled.

25
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,500
She got expelled,

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,230
and now you must close this snack bar.

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,900
Do you think that's all a coincidence?

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,870
What if it's not?

29
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,500
Do you think
those people made the decisions...

30
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,040
because of a news report?

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,810
Not at all. They could've ignored it
if they'd wanted to.

32
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,310
They could've let it go
instead of making a fuss about it.

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,420
The article was just a pretext.

34
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,790
They made those calls
for their practical interests.

35
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,720
The handouts from Mingang.

36
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,990
Then, all that was...

37
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,930
It's time for you
to face reality and where you stand.

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,300
Stop acting out so rashly.

39
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,330
You coming to my workplace
to pursue the truth...

40
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,100
makes me uncomfortable too.

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,110
We don't want to keep crossing paths.

42
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,340
I came all this way to tip you off...

43
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,850
because we used to have some good times.

44
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,750
Get a grip, Baek Sul Hee.

45
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,000
(Mingang Distribution)

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,480
Go on upstairs.

47
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,060
(Mingang Distribution)

48
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,890
We might get really close...

49
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,830
if you keep visiting.

50
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,200
You got my daughter
kicked out of high school...

51
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,200
and bought the building my bar was in.

52
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,940
I have no say in what the school decides.

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,070
We're just one of their sponsors.

54
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,310
Because of that,
she got expelled from her current school.

55
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,650
Do you know what you've done?

56
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,580
How could you do this?

57
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,190
My daughter wanted to go there so badly.

58
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,790
My company sponsors many schools.

59
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,020
You own a snack bar.

60
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,990
I happened to like the building
where you were a tenant, so I bought it.

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,460
Is that a problem?

62
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,700
Why are you doing this to us?
What did we do that was so wrong?

63
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,440
You still don't get what you did wrong?

64
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,170
What should I know
when I did nothing wrong?

65
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,480
Why don't you ask for forgiveness?

66
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,410
Wouldn't that be more humane?

67
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,880
You want your daughter
to go to that high school,

68
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,910
and you want to keep your snack bar.

69
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,980
Then, beg for what you did wrong.

70
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,790
Only then can I decide
whether or not to forgive you.

71
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,090
You people are in the wrong,

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,390
and you want me to beg?

73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
I can't forgive you. No!

74
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,130
I won't ever.

75
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,370
Didn't I tell you last time?

76
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,810
Forgiveness is what
the powerful give the powerless.

77
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,410
Come in.

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,690
Let go.

79
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,550
- Let go of me!
- Wait.

80
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,590
I insist on returning what I get.

81
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,580
Let me go!

82
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,830
(Mingang Distribution)

83
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,240
- What?
- Get over here quick.

84
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,680
Mi So's acting weird.

85
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,050
What's wrong?

86
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,080
She locked herself in her room,
and she's quiet.

87
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,750
Come home already.

88
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,550
Darn it.

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,890
What's going on?

90
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,290
She locked the door and won't answer.

91
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,890
I can't hear a thing.

92
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,830
Mi So. Open the door.

93
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,370
Let me in.

94
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,870
Sul Hee, don't you have a key?

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,370
We never locked any of our doors.

96
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,010
Baek Mi So. Unlock the door right now.

97
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,380
You're making me really angry.

98
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,150
Locking yourself in there
won't solve anything.

99
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,390
Are you listening?

100
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,120
Baek Mi So.

101
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,290
Is she asleep?

102
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,800
She has been quiet for a while.

103
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,400
She hasn't made a sound.

104
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,100
This is not good.
Will you call a locksmith?

105
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,350
Thank you.

106
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,880
Mi So!

107
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,080
Baek Mi So. Wake up.

108
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,750
Oh, no. What should we do?

109
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,590
Should I call 911 for an ambulance?

110
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,320
There's no time for that. I'll carry her.

111
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,160
- Mi So. Will you wake up?
- Mi So.

112
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,100
Get on Mom's back. Come on.

113
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,000
Mi So.

114
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,380
Hang in there, okay?

115
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,140
Please wake up.

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,060
It can happen if you suffer a great shock.

117
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,100
Her body protected itself from a shock
she couldn't bear by blacking out.

118
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,640
Nothing else is wrong with her?

119
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,070
The test results were clear,

120
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,910
but what could shock a teenage girl enough
that she'd pass out?

121
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,710
She should wake up soon.

122
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,310
Thank you.

123
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,940
Mi So.

124
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,150
You locked yourself in your room
and passed out.

125
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,290
What if you never woke up?

126
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,950
I didn't know...

127
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,930
I'd pass out like that so suddenly.

128
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,030
Are you trying to get into trouble?

129
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Are you?

130
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,230
Your body isn't just yours alone.

131
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,440
Can't you imagine...

132
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,870
how I felt?

133
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,310
My heart sinks when you...

134
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,050
so much as break a fingernail.

135
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,050
When you cry tears,

136
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,450
I shed blood.

137
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,190
Do you know what I thought...

138
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,790
as I carried you here?

139
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
"Please..."

140
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,870
"Please let her be okay."

141
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,140
I begged with all my heart.

142
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,310
"I don't mind
if you take my life instead."

143
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
"Please spare my baby."

144
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,120
It's that hard on me too.

145
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,150
I know you're worried about me.

146
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,390
I'm struggling too.

147
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,930
You must hang in there.

148
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,340
Right now, that's what you must do.

149
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,070
So we can correct everything.

150
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,540
We won't stop like this.

151
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,110
To right the wrong,

152
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,880
all we can do right now is survive.

153
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,850
I can't do that.

154
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,930
I keep thinking about it
even though I try not to.

155
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,030
I hate myself,

156
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,540
and the resentment is driving me crazy.

157
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,980
Don't cry.

158
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,260
My gosh.

159
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,800
My poor baby.

160
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,150
Why did you do that? Turn it back on!

161
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,350
Being grounded doesn't mean
you can act like this indoors.

162
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,320
What did CEO Min tell you to do?

163
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,720
Do you want me to study
when I never studied a day in my life?

164
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,060
Are you insane?

165
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,590
Then read a book,
or listen to classical music.

166
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,060
You're such a loser.

167
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,330
You do anything Kyung Chae says.

168
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,130
Why do you do this?

169
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,240
Are you her handmaid?
Like from the Joseon era?

170
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,640
Do you bow and grovel to the young lady?

171
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,070
Ms. Se Ri. I'll say just one thing.

172
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,080
Don't say anything.
I know what you want to say.

173
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,860
Ja Kyung!

174
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,860
Shall we go shopping? Let's get some air.

175
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,530
Father told me off...

176
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,670
for taking you shopping last time.

177
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,000
Do I have a contagious disease?

178
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,140
Why won't anyone spend time with me?

179
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,010
Don't you know why that is?

180
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,350
Don't you think you should change a bit
after that incident?

181
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,580
Like what? Should I be remorseful?

182
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,720
Let's be honest.

183
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,050
Kyung Chae covered for you
as best she could.

184
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,460
That's how
you got off scot-free and moved in.

185
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,920
I'm suffering
a great punishment right now.

186
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,590
I was grounded.

187
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,930
I'm stuck at home
under Manager Gong's watchful eye,

188
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,330
and you nag enough for everyone.

189
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,500
Listen.

190
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,130
No one would treat you like this
if you learned...

191
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,870
to control your temper.

192
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,770
Why did you target an innocent kid?

193
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,810
Whose side are you on?

194
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,540
I can't stand listening to this.

195
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,240
What I mean is...

196
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,580
If anyone should be remorseful,
it should be the poor girl...

197
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,680
with no connections.

198
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,550
There's more to life than money.

199
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,520
Handling and measuring everything
with money isn't...

200
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,590
What?

201
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,120
You married Ji Seop for his money.

202
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,630
What the...

203
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,340
We married for love too!

204
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,670
Dad!

205
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,110
Why do you sound so annoyed and hoarse?

206
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,510
I tried to lecture Se Ri for her sake...

207
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,180
but got way more than I bargained for.

208
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,580
What? The little insect butt
tried to show you up?

209
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,990
I'm stressed out to death.

210
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,590
Dad. Shall we get a massage tomorrow?

211
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,020
It has been a while, right?

212
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,960
More than a while.
Make the reservation right away.

213
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,790
See if you can find a tailor-made program.

214
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,730
See you tomorrow.

215
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,830
Where did she come from
and why is she upsetting everyone?

216
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,640
What is it?
Is the youngest one in trouble again?

217
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,440
I thought she'd be quiet if she went home.

218
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,810
A troublemaker in public
would be even worse at home.

219
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,950
She was in the news for what she did.

220
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,380
Shouldn't she lie low?

221
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,050
She must be acting up even at home.

222
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,750
That's all the chairman's fault.

223
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,490
He dated a woman so crass
she can't even be named.

224
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,160
They did this and that,
and then some more...

225
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,360
And they had a child.

226
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,800
My goodness.

227
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,600
I hope my Ja Kyung
doesn't get too stressed out.

228
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,300
She must have a baby soon.

229
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
What if the stress makes her infertile?

230
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,940
That's as preposterous
as a mudfish getting lost in some mud.

231
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,410
I won't let that happen.

232
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,980
I'll teach that Se Ri girl
a good lesson myself.

233
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,860
My friend provoked her first.

234
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,900
She said the girl looked rich...

235
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,070
and said she'd get beaten up
to blackmail her for money.

236
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,770
Something similar happened
when she worked for me.

237
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,140
Her family is poor.

238
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,980
What is it, Mi So?

239
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,650
I can't stay in bed.

240
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,550
I keep thinking of it
even when my eyes are closed.

241
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,690
- I told you not to think...
- I can't control my thoughts!

242
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,760
I look back at everything that happened
since the incident.

243
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,130
Lie down. The drip isn't done yet.

244
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,870
What are you doing?

245
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,910
Will you stop it?

246
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,840
Mi So!

247
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,980
My gosh.

248
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,520
Baek Mi So. At least finish the drip.

249
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,050
Do as you're told. Go back inside.

250
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,160
I said I'd take care of it.

251
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,990
What can you do in your condition?

252
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,890
You can't take care of it!

253
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,960
You don't have a solution.

254
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,860
Isn't that why you're just killing time?

255
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,730
There is a solution. We can find it.

256
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,030
Why haven't you found it already?

257
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,070
Why are you just watching?

258
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,840
Why are you putting up with it all?

259
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,540
Because...

260
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,310
I'd rather...

261
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,180
you say to me that you can't do anything.

262
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,550
Just apologize!

263
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,220
Baek Mi So.

264
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,790
Will you stop this?

265
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,400
(Intensive Care Unit)

266
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,350
Are you all right?

267
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,420
Mi So.

268
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,090
Don't touch me.

269
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,860
Why are you like this?

270
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,100
I don't just hate
Mingang Distribution right now.

271
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,370
I don't just hate the chairman's daughter.

272
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,800
Do you hate me too?

273
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,100
Wouldn't you if you were me?

274
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,010
Look at what's going on!

275
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,940
I'm annoyed to death about everything,

276
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,540
and you're no help to me at all.

277
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,650
I told you I'd correct everything...

278
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,350
You overestimate yourself.

279
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,650
You're just a snack bar owner.

280
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,020
All you can do...

281
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,690
is cook ramyeon and tteokbokki.

282
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,060
You...

283
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,130
How could you say that?

284
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,970
Maybe...

285
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,240
things wouldn't be like this
if I had a dad.

286
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,650
That girl acted out because she knew
her dad was behind her.

287
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,150
That incident...

288
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,920
and all the heartache that came after...

289
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,990
made me see what a dad is.

290
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,090
Why did you have me when I had no dad?

291
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,160
Why are you so selfish?

292
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't you know
how much a child needs a dad?

293
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,470
I get that...

294
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,040
you need someone to yell at right now.

295
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
Stop it.

296
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,150
Did you think you really were both
a mom and dad to me because I said so?

297
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,480
What a joke.

298
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,150
You can't do anything to help.

299
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,980
Stop what you're doing.

300
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,080
I'm leaving.

301
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,480
I'm sick of this place and of you.

302
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,850
Have you lost your mind?

303
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,320
I'll live on my own.

304
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,990
Don't do this, Mi So.

305
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,030
Even if you're upset enough
to want to leave,

306
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,170
I won't apologize for slapping you.

307
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,030
You deserved it.

308
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,170
If you act out again, I'll slap you again.

309
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,140
I will, even if it breaks my heart.

310
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,440
Because that's how I love you.

311
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,240
I don't want to see you anymore.

312
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,080
You must, anyway!

313
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,550
Do you think you were
nothing but sweet as you grew up?

314
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,120
You acted out
because you couldn't have your way...

315
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,220
so many times.

316
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,760
But I didn't even consider abandoning you.

317
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,390
You must put up with me too.

318
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,760
You had no dad...

319
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,330
I'm sorry for raising you without a dad,

320
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,840
but I don't regret having you.

321
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,870
I don't, whatever people say.

322
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,480
I'll be your mom even in the next life.

323
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,490
I promise.

324
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,030
I'll take care of everything...

325
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,160
so we can live like we did before.

326
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,900
How?

327
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
I can't reach Bo Ram...

328
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,870
or the coffee shop owner.

329
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,780
I'll take care of that. Don't worry.

330
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,970
(Mingang Distribution)

331
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,280
Min Kyung Chae speaking.

332
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,150
It's Moon Tae Kyung.

333
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,420
Tomorrow works for me.

334
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,220
As what?

335
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,850
As my first day at work.

336
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,290
Oh, that sounds just fine.
I'll alert the staff.

337
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,130
Before you do that.

338
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,730
The condition of my hiring.

339
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,260
You haven't replied yet.

340
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,700
Oh, that?

341
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,730
I have a condition.

342
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,170
Company information
that only the family can access.

343
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,040
Share that with me.

344
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,580
That's not a decision I can make alone.

345
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,050
I'll ask the chairman and call you back.

346
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,710
I'll send a car and driver
to the hotel in the morning.

347
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,860
He wants to access confidential info
before he even starts?

348
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,340
I'll release the timeline for the launch
when Director Moon starts tomorrow.

349
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,070
Do that.

350
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,340
One thing bothers me, though.

351
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,610
His one condition is that...

352
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,880
he be allowed access to confidential files
reserved only for family.

353
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,220
Why does he want that?

354
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,480
I didn't ask.

355
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,690
What will you do?

356
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,160
I'll see how he does first.

357
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,860
It won't matter if he's loyal to me,

358
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,460
but if he's not...

359
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,030
If you think he'll betray you,

360
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,030
make good use of him,
then dump him before he dumps you.

361
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,600
People are meant to be used,
not trusted or relied upon.

362
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,170
Especially those beneath you.

363
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,140
You really won't eat?

364
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,850
Do you know how long it's been
since you last ate?

365
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,510
Forcing food down my throat now
will only make me sick.

366
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,780
I'll eat once everything's sorted out.

367
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,190
You'll pass out before then.

368
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,960
You're already in bed
because you have no energy.

369
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,490
Yes, Mi So. Eat just a few mouthfuls.

370
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,960
I made kimchi fried rice. You love that.

371
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,050
She's so darn stubborn,
and it's lasting a while this time.

372
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,450
She was like that as a kid too.

373
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,590
It looks like it won't end...

374
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,460
before you meet with Bo Ram
and the cafe owner.

375
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,100
How are we to reach people
who changed their numbers?

376
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,000
I wish there were someone
who could put us in touch with them.

377
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,100
Goodness.

378
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,690
(Mingang Distribution)

379
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,130
I'd like to meet Kim Sun Jae from Legal.

380
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm Baek Sul Hee. He knows me.

381
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,430
Just a moment, please.

382
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,540
Someone is here to see
Mr. Kim Sun Jae from Legal.

383
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,770
Baek Sul Hee. She says he knows her.

384
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,640
Okay, thank you.

385
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,020
He's in a meeting. You'll have to wait.

386

(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

387
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,270
Nice to meet you. I'm Moon Tae Kyung.

388
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,910
We meet at last.
I've been waiting for this moment.

389
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,140
I've hired many great talents
and paid a fortune to scout people,

390
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,010
but you gave me the hardest time.

391
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,980
I apologize.

392
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,480
I had to tackle
some urgent personal issues first.

393
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,150
If you feel bad about that,
do your best for me. I expect a lot.

394
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,590
- This is...
- I'm Director Min Soo Jung.

395
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,900
Nice to meet you.

396
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,870
Our goal is
to run the business like a family.

397
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,200
Just remember that familism
is at the center of everything.

398
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,070
I hope we can trust each other
like family.

(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

400
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,670
You're an adult.

401
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,600
An adult shouldn't do this.

402
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,470
Come forward and say
you lied in the interview.

403
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,670
They won't change their statement
because you ask them to.

404
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,380
Appealing to their humanity won't work
when they were bought.

405
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,410
What perfect timing.

406
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,450
This is Moon Tae Kyung,
the general managing director...

407
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,520
of the new business.

408
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,880
You asked who my daughter's father was.

409
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,290
Are you afraid...

410
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,850
that my daughter might be yours?

411
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,890
She's not mine, is she?

412
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,860
Whether she is or not,
this cannot come out.
