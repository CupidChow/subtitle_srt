1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,950
Wait here for a second.

2
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,030
This is all your fault!

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,270
You should never have shown up.

4
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,070
You should have stayed away from my Se Ri!

5
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,900
Fine. Go on, try me.

6
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,270
You think the truth will disappear
just because I'm gone?

7
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,180
Just like Se Ri is my daughter,
Mi So is yours.

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,280
And you're the one
who caused that tragedy...

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,380
to happen to your own daughter.

10
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,760
Let me see your face. Are you hurt?

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,930
I'm fine.

12
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,400
What in the world is going on?

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,330
Stay right here.

14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,610
Roll down your window.

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,180
What do you think you're doing?
Were you trying to run someone over?

16
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,080
Are you out of your mind?

17
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,520
Just you wait. I swear I'll get you...

18
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,820
out of my sight for good.

19
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,790
Hey, Min Kyung Chae! Stop!

20
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,240
There are security cameras here, right?

21
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,880
Let's give the footage to the police
and report her for attempted murder.

22
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,050
Min Kyung Chae looked completely unhinged.

23
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,420
If we just let her go,
there's no telling what she'll do.

24
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,960
She'll definitely think
this is all my fault.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,690
That if I weren't around,
things would be fine with Se Ri and Mi So.

26
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,160
They never change, do they?

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,330
Why is everyone in the Min family
like that?

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,030
Seriously, do any of them
have any self-awareness?

29
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,510
(Episode 121)

30
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,590
Ma'am, are you awake?

31
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,670
- Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,840
You were brought in after a fire.
Don't you remember?

33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,040
A fire?

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Yes.

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Se Ri!

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Se Ri.

37
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,290
Are you okay? Stay with me!

38
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,450
Mom...

39
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,450
Just hang on.

40
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,090
You have to stay conscious. Okay?

41
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,530
I remember now.

42
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,030
My mom saved me.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,470
Where's my mom?

44
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,410
Please get my mom.

45
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,610
Mom.

46
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,710
Mom.

47
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,900
- Hello?
- Are you Min Se Ri's guardian?

48
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,970
I am. What is it?

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,640
The patient just woke up.
She's asking for you.

50
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,880
She did?

51
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,910
Okay. I'm on my way.

52
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,190
Let's get you to Madam Jang's hotel.
I'd worry about you anywhere else.

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,220
Take me somewhere else instead.

54
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,230
To see my Se Ri.

55
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,160
You want to see Se Ri?

56
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,530
I've barely gotten to see her.

57
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,900
Min Kyung Chae has been blocking
my visits.

58
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,050
Are you okay?

59
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,550
You're really awake, right?

60
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,190
I'm so relieved.

61
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,830
I thought I'd lost you.

62
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,130
I was so scared you'd never wake up.
I was a nervous wreck.

63
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,600
Let me look at you.

64
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,570
How do you feel?

65
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,440
Are you hurt anywhere?

66
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,940
Tell me if you're in any pain.

67
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,410
I'm fine, Kyung Chae.

68
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,720
But where's Mom?

69
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,230
"Mom"? What are you talking about?

70
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,530
You aren't waiting for that woman,
are you?

71
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,700
Don't you remember what she did
when she left us?

72
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,240
She stole Dad's stake, wrecked
our whole household, and just left.

73
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,140
You know that.

74
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,610
And do you know
what she's like at the company?

75
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,280
She's strutting around
like she owns Mingang now.

76
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,750
She's already dead set
on kicking me out first.

77
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,990
After she gets rid of me,
Ji Seop and Soo Jung will be next.

78
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,060
That's why she went after the old chairman
in the first place.

79
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,890
Kyung Chae, what's gotten into you?

80
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,990
Why are you saying such awful things
about Mom?

81
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,300
I'm not badmouthing her.
I'm telling you the facts.

82
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,730
Look.

83
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,500
I've held my tongue until now,
but that woman is a con artist.

84
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,310
She lies every time she opens her mouth,

85
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,610
and she's a master at manipulating
situations to her advantage.

86
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,650
She's terrifying and will do anything
to get what she wants.

87
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,150
You have no idea how many incidents
she caused at the company, do you?

88
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,520
And was it any better at home?

89
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,760
We never had a moment's peace
after she moved in.

90
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,430
Mom's not like that!
She's always been so good to me!

91
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,330
You've got her all wrong.

92
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,860
She is not a good person.

93
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,200
Even if she acted like a mother to you,

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,070
she didn't mean any of it.

95
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,970
She was just using you
and playing with your feelings.

96
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,280
I want to go home.

97
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,280
- I don't want to be here anymore.
- Wait.

98
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,910
Fine, I get it.

99
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,820
Go get changed and wait.

100
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,220
I'll go handle the discharge paperwork.

101
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,830
Why did she badmouth Mom...

102
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,370
when she barely even knows her?

103
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,040
Se Ri!

104
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,840
Mom.

105
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,250
When did you wake up?

106
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,050
Thank goodness.

107
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,690
Thank you so much for waking up.

108
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,060
Thank you so much for letting me
hold you like this again.

109
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,930
You were really worried about me,
weren't you, Mom?

110
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,780
What do you think you're doing here?

111
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,920
I thought I made it perfectly clear
you're not to come here.

112
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,020
- What are you doing?
- Go wait in the car.

113
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,360
Kyung Chae!

114
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,420
Now!

115
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,730
Do as I say.

116
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,760
Do you want to see me
drop dead right here?

117
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,100
Do I have to kill myself in front of you
to get you to listen to me?

118
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,370
Is that it?

119
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,400
Should I just die for you then?

120
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,910
Kyung Chae.

121
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Just go now!

122
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,020
How dare you threaten her
by saying you'll kill yourself?

123
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,260
Is that any way
to treat your own daughter?

124
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,530
My patience has its limits.

125
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,860
You tried to hit me with your car earlier,

126
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,160
and now you're trying to hit me?

127
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,040
I told you none of this
is going to change the truth.

128
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,340
Se Ri is mine.

129
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,510
She's my daughter!
I'm the one who gave birth to her.

130
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Really?

131
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,320
So, we have one child and two mothers?

132
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,020
What should we do?

133
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,620
Should we cut her in half to share?

134
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,020
Fine. Be my guest.

135
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,560
Go right ahead.

136
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,860
Should I split her and take my half?

137
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,600
If I can't have her, neither can you.

138
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,890
Ms. Se Ri, what happened?
We were worried sick.

139
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,790
I think you took ten years off my life.

140
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,290
Are you all right, Se Ri?

141
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,360
Do you recognize me?

142
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,990
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Who are you?

143
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,100
It's five.

144
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,830
Oh my...

145
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,930
Something must have happened
to her head...

146
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,840
after being kidnapped and then
getting caught in that fire.

147
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,110
She was just messing with you.

148
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,480
You've been through so much.
It must have been so hard on you.

149
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,480
If that woman happens
to show up at the house,

150
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,410
never let her in.

151
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,250
- "That woman"?
- Lucia.

152
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,750
Do not open the door for her,
no matter what.

153
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,290
Why would she even come here?

154
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,320
She might come here
and try to take Se Ri from me.

155
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,460
She's completely lost it.
So, whatever you do, don't open the door.

156
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,830
Okay.

157
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,210
What's wrong with her?

158
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,070
Looks to me like she's the one
who's lost it.

159
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
Unbelievable.

160
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,250
Get changed first.

161
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,250
Why did you do that back at the hospital?

162
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,260
She came because she was worried.
How could you kick her out like that?

163
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,990
Have you not been listening
to a word I've said?

164
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,530
I told you she's a bad person!

165
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,100
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

166
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,600
- I said I want to see my mom.
- And I told you no!

167
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,370
I'm confiscating this.

168
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,570
If I find out you contacted her
behind my back or went to see her,

169
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,410
it's over for both of us.

170
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,150
Promise me that you won’t see her.

171
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,610
You're not going to answer me?

172
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,960
What do you think you're doing?

173
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,900
- What are you doing?
- Let go!

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,100
- Stop it!
- This is the only way...

175
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,770
to make sure you have no clothes
to go out in.

176
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,540
What are you doing? Stop it!

177
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,610
Stop it!

178
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,720
What are you doing?

179
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,990
I said stop!

180
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,260
I heard Se Ri woke up.

181
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
That's a relief.

182
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,500
It's that woman I'm worried about.

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,540
She keeps trying
to get her claws into Se Ri.

184
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,010
I should've finished her off
when I had the chance.

185
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,280
Why not just send Se Ri far away from her?

186
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,080
Why are you agonizing
over something so simple?

187
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,610
Far away? Where?

188
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,250
Should I send her abroad...

189
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,750
Of course.

190
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,690
I'll just send her abroad again.

191
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,490
I'll send her somewhere
that woman can never find her.

192
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,260
Why didn't I think of that?

193
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,170
So she knows the girls
were switched at birth.

194
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,270
She's still doting
on another woman's child?

195
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,510
Even though she knows how tragically
her own child died,

196
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,850
she's determined to deny reality?

197
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,580
Like that's going to work.

198
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,420
The moment reality truly sinks in,

199
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,690
she'll completely lose her mind.

200
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,630
I wish I'd never woken up.

201
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,230
How can you say that?

202
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,630
If you hadn't, Ms. Kyung Chae
would have worried herself to death.

203
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,240
She was an absolute wreck,
worrying that you wouldn't wake up.

204
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,610
Then why is she doing this to me?
What is all this?

205
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,950
She's so over the top sometimes.
She's not even my mom.

206
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,120
Se Ri.

207
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,090
I need you to listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

208
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,930
It might be a bit of a shock,
but you need to know the truth.

209
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,090
What are you planning on telling her?

210
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,430
Kyung Chae is so obsessed with you...

211
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,730
- because...
- Ms. Ja Kyung. Please, don't.

212
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,040
It's because
you're Kyung Chae's secret daughter.

213
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,770
Your birth mother is Kyung Chae.

214
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,010
Are you insane? What are you saying?

215
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,250
Kyung Chae is my mother?

216
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,620
Is that true?

217
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,050
No, it's not true!
Don't believe a word she's saying.

218
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm asking you if it's true!

219
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,860
Is she really my mother?

220
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,030
Did she really give birth to me?

221
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,030
It's true.

222
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,730
I'm sure she has her reasons,

223
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,000
but she secretly gave birth to you...

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,370
and registered you
as your father's daughter,

225
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,740
so she could pretend to be your sister
all this time.

226
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,710
No way...

227
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,980
How could she?

228
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,320
Then she should have told me.

229
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,720
Why did she keep it a secret
all this time?

230
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,790
I need to hear it from her myself.

231
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,930
I need to hear her say
whether she's my mother.

232
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,530
Se Ri.

233
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,460
Se Ri!

234
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Se Ri.

235
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,910
What's wrong? Hey, why are you crying?

236
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,280
What are you doing here?

237
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Mom.

238
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,650
They're saying that Kyung Chae
is my mom...

239
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,750
and that she's been hiding it from me
this whole time.

240
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Se Ri.

241
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,230
Calm down.

242
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,430
This isn't the place.
Let's go somewhere quiet, okay?

243
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,080
What's going on with you two?

244
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,990
Madam Jang.

245
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,090
Could you please look after Se Ri for me?

246
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,590
Look after her?
What are you talking about?

247
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,130
Oh, dear.

248
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,930
You should wash up first.
Your face is a mess.

249
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,940
Go on, wash up in the bathroom over there.

250
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,840
What happened?

251
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,680
What were you thinking, bringing her here?

252
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,120
She found out that Min Kyung Chae
is her birth mother...

253
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,090
and it looks like she ran out in shock.

254
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,920
But she's not even her birth mother.

255
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,360
It seems she doesn't know that part yet.

256
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,790
I was already planning
to get Se Ri out of that house,

257
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,230
but things just ended up this way.

258
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,260
Please look after her just for a few days.

259
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,870
What a tangled mess.

260
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,840
That poor girl is just caught
between two mothers.

261
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,810
What did you say? Se Ri ran away?

262
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,280
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

263
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,180
What on earth were you doing?
You couldn't even keep an eye on her?

264
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,920
Did Ja Kyung really say that to her?

265
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,760
I always knew her big mouth
would cause trouble one day,

266
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,760
but I never imagined
it would be like this.

267
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,460
What did Kyung Chae say?

268
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,430
Is she mad at me?

269
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,740
What do you think?

270
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,610
As if she hasn't been through enough.

271
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,340
She just got home and is recovering,

272
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,880
and you poured gasoline on the fire?

273
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,840
Were you even thinking?

274
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,010
I had no idea you could be so clueless.

275
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,920
I just figured
Se Ri had to find out someday,

276
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,320
and it just slipped out before I knew it.

277
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,220
Anyway, this mouth of mine is the problem.
It really is.

278
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,660
(Mingang Distribution)

279
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
What's wrong?

280
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,330
You seem anxious.

281
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,130
Se Ri...

282
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,400
found out I'm her birth mother
and ran away.

283
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,110
She left her phone,
so I can't even reach her.

284
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,640
I can't even look for her
if I don't know where she is.

285
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,610
She's probably with that woman.

286
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,420
- No way.
- I just saw them in the lobby, hugging,

287
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,190
and then they left the building together.

288
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,490
I knew it.

289
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,660
I knew she'd try
to take Se Ri from me one day.

290
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,630
I can't believe her!

291
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,060
Where on earth could they have gone?

292
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,730
Isn't it obvious?

293
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,170
The one place she'd consider safest.

294
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,470
A place you know very well, too.

295
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,450
Where's my Se Ri?

296
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,710
Where did you hide my daughter?

297
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,580
Give her back to me now.

298
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,520
- I said, give her back to me right now!
- Hey!

299
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,190
Hey, Min Kyung Chae!

300
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,860
What do you think you're doing,
barging in here?

301
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,060
Have some class!

302
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,290
If you have something to say, be civil.

303
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,690
Do you think I don’t know
that woman took Se Ri...

304
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,730
and is keeping her here?

305
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,360
Come out here right now!

306
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,200
I said, come out now
before I call the police!

307
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,270
Give me back my daughter, you kidnapper!

308
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,340
I said, give me back my daughter!

309
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Se Ri.

310
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,620
I'm not going with you.

311
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,150
Se Ri.

312
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,490
If you're really my mom,
how could you do this to me?

313
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,090
You sent me away to study abroad at seven,
shuffling me from place to place.

314
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,630
You have no idea how lonely I was.

315
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,930
It was all for you.

316
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,400
Do you have any idea
how much that tuition cost?

317
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,030
People are dying to get into that school.

318
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,440
And that's not all.

319
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,340
You said you hated the dorms,
so I got you a new luxury apartment...

320
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,610
and had a housekeeper and private driver
treat you like a queen.

321
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,380
That's not what I wanted.

322
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,510
I needed a mom.

323
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,080
A mom who was like a friend
who'd make eye contact with me, hug me...

324
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,420
and just talk to me.

325
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,150
Okay, from now on, I'll...

326
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,190
No.

327
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,790
Your mom will.

328
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,930
From now on, I'll be the mom
you want me to be.

329
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,930
It's too late.

330
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,970
Se Ri.

331
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,470
Why didn't you save me from that fire?

332
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,370
Why didn't you run into the fire?

333
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,710
If you were really my mom,

334
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,170
how could you hesitate
to save me from that fire?

335
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,810
Of course, you'd be scared.
You're only human.

336
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,850
But a mother shouldn't be like that
when it's her child's life on the line.

337
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,720
Se Ri, you've got it all wrong.

338
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,350
I'm the one who saved you.

339
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,760
I carried you out
and took you to the hospital.

340
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,420
So what are you talking about?

341
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,960
You must not remember
because you were unconscious.

342
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,530
I saved you.

343
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,500
Stop lying! How can you lie to my face
about something like that?

344
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,070
When I collapsed in the fire,
the one who saved me wasn't you,

345
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,710
it was my mom.

346
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,180
- Se Ri.
- I'd rather you just stay my sister.

347
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,080
That's just how I feel.

348
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,590
It's hard for me to accept you as my mom.

349
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,990
I'm going to stay here with my mom
for a while.

350
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,030
You should go.

351
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,930
Se Ri.

352
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,030
Se Ri!

353
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,870
I think it's best you go now.

354
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,270
Se Ri has clearly made up her mind.

355
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,410
What did you do to turn her against me?

356
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,280
How on earth did you manipulate her?

357
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,680
She's my daughter.
I raised her for 20 years.

358
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,980
How could you take her from me?

359
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,020
Who do you think you are?

360
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,860
Who do you think you are?

361
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,490
What do you think you're doing?
Stop harassing my mom!

362
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,150
What on earth happened to her?

363
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,390
Hey, you don't think
she's really losing it, do you?

364
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,560
I know. She looks completely zoned out.

365
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,930
Ja Kyung said Se Ri ran away
and Kyung Chae went to bring her back.

366
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,370
What is wrong with Se Ri?
Is now really the time to be running away?

367
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,010
Can you blame her?

368
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,080
The woman she thought was her sister
suddenly turns out to be her mom.

369
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,650
I get that,
but we have a million other problems now.

370
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,220
And what about the company?
We're lucky Lucia is lying low for now,

371
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,520
but what if she exercises
Father's stake immediately?

372
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,090
Kyung Chae needs to pull herself together,
so we can figure this out.

373
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,690
She should've just left Se Ri alone
when she just got out of the hospital.

374
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,530
Why did she have to
reveal her birth secret now?

375
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,960
Hey, where did your Ja Kyung go?

376
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,200
Where did she go
after causing all this trouble?

377
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,540
So you're saying you ran away
and came here?

378
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,770
What did Ji Seop say?

379
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,940
He freaked out about the mess I made.

380
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,280
There's no way I could listen
to all that nagging!

381
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,610
I'm just going to stay here for the night.

382
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,650
You can stay the night if you want,

383
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,050
but who on earth do you take after?

384
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,790
If you were just 10 percent
like your father...

385
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,120
But no, you had to be 99 percent
like your mother.

386
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,660
So you always run that mouth of yours
and cause trouble.

387
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,960
What kind of nonsense
is that supposed to be?

388
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,000
Why am I the blabbermouth?
You're the big mouth, Oh Pan Sool.

389
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,800
I'm a man of discretion.
My lips are sealed.

390
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,370
When I'm out, I don't open my mouth
unless I'm eating.

391
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,900
So my friends say, "a man's word
is his bond" was a saying...

392
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,670
made up just for me.

393
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,810
"A man's word is his bond"?
Don't make me laugh.

394
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,850
Your word isn't your bond.
It's more like bubble gum.

395
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,120
How often have you gotten into trouble
for running your big mouth?

396
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,420
My beautiful wife.
Do you want me to scold you...

397
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,490
until you’re breathless, farting,
and drooling all over yourself?

398
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,060
Even if I'm a blabbermouth,
I'm still more tight-lipped than you.

399
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,930
When you die, your mouth will rot first
from all the flapping you do.

400
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,200
- What is it, you handsome old geezer?
- You sexy old broad!

401
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,600
- Darn you.
- Darn you!

402
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,970
- All you do is mutter...
- Zip it!

403
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,070
(Mingang Distribution)

404
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,540
I don't know what
Min Kyung Chae's next move will be.

405
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,580
The only thing I'm sure of
is that she'll stop at nothing.

406
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
After she came all the way
to Madam Jang's place...

407
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,250
only to be humiliated by her daughter,

408
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,920
she can't be in her right mind.

409
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,390
It's Min Kyung Chae.

410
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,600
I'm going to kill myself today.

411
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,830
My own daughter has rejected me...

412
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,570
and won't accept me as her mother.
What's the point of living anymore?

413
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,610
Let's meet one last time.

414
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,910
Se Ri's mother to mother.

415
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,410
I'll be waiting for you
at the Andeok Reservoir.

416
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,460
You're not actually going, are you?

417
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,430
I have to.
She asked to see me mother to mother.

418
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,330
Then, I'll go with you.

419
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,600
No. I'll go by myself.

420
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,170
It could be a trap.

421
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,770
She could be using suicide talk
to lure you just to hurt you.

422
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,780
Even if that's true,
we need to settle this once and for all.

423
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,610
I'll go alone.

424
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,130
So you came.
I guess threatening to die works.

425
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,410
Whether you live or die is up to fate,
but before that happens,

426
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,710
you need to tell the press
what happened to Mi So four years ago...

427
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,750
and issue a formal apology
as the CEO of Mingang Distribution.

428
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,850
And beg forgiveness...

429
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,320
for making Mi So the guilty party
with your lies.

430
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,290
And acknowledge and accept Mi So.

431
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,660
Just like Se Ri is both my daughter
and your daughter,

432
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,800
the same goes for Mi So.

433
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,000
I told you I have nothing to do
with that girl.

434
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,430
I said not to mention your dead daughter
in relation to me again.

435
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,240
You really have nothing to do with her?

436
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,770
Denying it with all your might
won't make it untrue.

437
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,040
The feeling of her kicking inside you.

438
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,580
Mothers remember that feeling.

439
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,020
No, I don't remember.

440
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,850
I feel absolutely nothing for her.

441
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,060
Someone with no feelings
would deny it this desperately?

442
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,090
If you truly felt nothing,
you wouldn't be acting this way.

443
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,290
You...

444
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,500
For ten months as an unwed mother,

445
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,030
it must have been so hard for you,
hiding it from the world.

446
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,270
I know what that's like.

447
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,770
Because I went through the same thing.

448
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,640
So instead of blaming yourself,

449
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,580
you can still acknowledge and accept her
as your daughter.

450
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,290
Do you know how smart Mi So was?

451
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,190
She took after you and your sharp mind.

452
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,830
She was always at the top of her class.

453
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,170
Her picky eating always bugged me,

454
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,670
but now I realize she gets that from you.

455
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,040
And her face...

456
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,510
She's the spitting image of you.

457
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,350
Her eyes, her nose, her mouth.

458
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,280
There's not a single feature
that isn't yours.

459
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,790
No, I'm not her mother.

460
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,160
What makes you think I'm her mother?

461
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,460
- I said I'm not.
- Why are you doing this? Let me go!

462
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,130
I should be asking you that!
Why are you doing this?

463
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,000
- Why?
- Let go!

464
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,540
- Why on earth are you doing this to me?
- I said, let go of me!
