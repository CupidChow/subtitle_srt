00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,010
(Episode 26)

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,180
What's going on?

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,910
What is Director Min doing here?

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,880
I called you both.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,350
You both contacted me separately,
suggesting I sign a contract.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,820
You both work at Mingang Distribution,

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,890
and I couldn't decide who to sign with.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,960
You both urged me to sign your contract,

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,330
and I felt cornered.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,330
We need to talk.

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,580
(Jogeon Logistics)

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,310
Is that what you wanted?

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,020
Hey...

14
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,930
Something didn't go well.

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,400
She's in a huff...

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,470
What's up with her?

17
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,840
(Mingang Distribution)

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,240
Have you lost your mind?

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,440
How dare you get involved?

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,680
Why can't I?

21
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,820
Father never cares how we do it
as long as we get it done.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
We just need the deal signed.

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,250
How can you say that?

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,290
Father gave me the job.

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,690
Don't bring him into this.

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,990
He doesn't care who does the job.

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,860
We all work for the same company.

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,430
Quit that nonsense!

29
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,430
Father said this was top secret,
and you ruined it!

30
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,200
- If he were to find out...
- Tell him, then!

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,870
If he were to find out,
the most he'll do to me is yell.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,910
But you'll have proven your incompetence.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,440
If CEO Jo didn't jump at your offer
despite the favorable conditions,

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,640
it means you took the wrong approach.

35
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,380
This is why people say
you forget your place.

36
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,320
I wondered when you'd say that.

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,190
My mom was the mistress, not me.

38
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,920
I am my father's daughter,
and I've lived and worked hard.

39
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,460
You think you're superior to me,

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,760
and I put up with it
because I get where it comes from.

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,700
But you can't treat me like that
for 30 years.

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,730
You're sick, and there's no cure.

43
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,700
You've decided to go all the way.

44
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,540
No. You haven't even had a taste...

45
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,640
of what happens
when I decide to go all the way.

46
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,240
Concentrate on the chain store...

47
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,450
and stay away from my business.

48
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,250
You concentrate on the online business.

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,480
I'll make you pay if this deal flops.

50
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,950
I'll drag you down
from your director position.

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,220
Who says you can do that?

52
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,420
Do you think a word from you
will get me fired?

53
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,530
Your business and mine
are separate entities.

54
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,630
You can't touch me.

55
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,390
Are you all right?

56
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,100
No.

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,000
How could I be...

58
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,230
when I'm about to lose out
at the last moment?

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,340
It's not over yet.

60
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,270
CEO Jo said he'd think about it.

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,640
Can't you tell what happened?

62
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,340
Soo Jung would have offered
a better deal than we.

63
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,880
Then, if you were to team up with her...

64
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,210
and approach CEO Jo together...

65
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,480
That's nonsense.

66
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,050
I can't stand the fact that...

67
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,090
we both jumped in to buy a stupid company,
and now we must negotiate?

68
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,420
That's not the problem right now.

69
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,090
That's important to me.

70
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,090
Mingang's pride means something.

71
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,530
You might give CEO Jo the upper hand
over both you and Director Min,

72
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,100
and you could both go down.

73
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,370
I must sign the deal
with Jogeon Logistics,

74
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,740
but I will never side with Soo Jung
to do anything.

75
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,260
Why are you so rash?

76
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,560
What did you say?

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,400
How dare you?

78
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,470
Why go up against CEO Min?

79
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,370
Are you taunting me?

80
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,240
Why can't I challenge her?

81
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,640
Why not let her sign the deal
with Jogeon Logistics?

82
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,280
Why should I, when she
got in the way of my promotion?

83
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,750
Why can't I stop her when she stopped me?

84
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,880
If this were to cause a rift...

85
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,420
I told you not to say that.

86
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,150
What do you know about us?

87
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,690
Family? Close ties?

88
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,460
Do you think that exists
within a family that owns a company?

89
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,090
We're forced to share...

90
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,960
because the chairman is alive and well.

91
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,630
The moment he dies and an heir takes over,
the rest will be left with nothing.

92
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,300
You don't know anything.

93
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,410
I'm worried about you, that's all.

94
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,910
Don't worry about me.

95
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,840
I can look after myself.

96
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,220
CEO Jo called you both...

97
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,690
to confirm the details of your offers.

98
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,160
The issue is who told Director Min.

99
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,660
If it wasn't you, it was Lucia.

100
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,730
I told you it wasn't me.

101
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,700
Then it leaves Lucia.

102
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,440
Why? What for?

103
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,540
We can always find a reason or two.

104
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,510
I can't just ask Soo Jung.

105
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,940
The director has no reason
to tell the truth.

106
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,240
She'll only lose a trusted source.

107
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,050
You're right about that.

108
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,080
But then...

109
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,380
you'd know because you once
sided with us both.

110
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,550
Must you dig up the past like that?

111
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,690
What's important is that the woman
got between you and Director Min,

112
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,430
and things could go wrong.

113
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,740
Ms. Lucia.
Let's go to the rooftop for a chat.

114
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,740
Why? So you can pretend to jump again?

115
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,110
Someone might save me again.

116
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,750
Whatever you want to say,
you can say it here.

117
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,320
Okay, then.

118
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,120
Director Min found out
about the Jogeon Logistics deal.

119
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,520
Did you tell her?

120
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,990
I'm not like you.

121
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,230
You talk as if you know me well.

122
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,800
Do you know me?

123
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,830
Have we met before?

124
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,500
I never laid eyes on you...

125
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,810
until you started working at Mingang.

126
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,780
You seem to have wanted the sisters
to start a cat fight.

127
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,880
Do I have a reason to want that?

128
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,850
You can always make one up.

129
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,220
If you got a job here
thanks to the rich Madam Jang,

130
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,390
just keep quiet and work
unless you have another goal.

131
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,530
Also,

132
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,700
whatever you do,

133
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,670
don't forget I have my eyes on you.

134
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,220
Pretend all you want.

135
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,050
I'll expose you.

136
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,290
Your cute play won't last long.

137
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,430
Hey.

138
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,930
I need you to look into someone for me.

139
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,410
Was that really my mom?

140
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,440
Darn it.

141
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,880
Should I believe them or not?

142
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
Ms. Se Ri, come down for lunch.

143
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,390
Eat this instead of
the spicy seafood stew.

144
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,290
Do you really get a rash
if you so much as touch seafood?

145
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,030
You never understand
until you have a reaction of your own.

146
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,400
Her case is pretty extreme.

147
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,640
That's most definitely hereditary.

148
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,240
I have a similar condition.

149
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,440
I'm like my mom. We can't eat cucumbers.

150
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,110
Father can eat seafood,
so the allergy must come from your mom.

151
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,810
It's not that scientific.

152
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,250
It's more scientific than science.

153
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,980
Everyone around me is like me.

154
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,550
Is everyone around you really like you?

155
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,090
Yes.

156
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,420
Nothing's more important than this
when finding out who you're related to.

157
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,930
CEO Jo called you both...

158
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,440
to confirm the details of your offers.

159
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,310
The issue is who told Director Min.

160
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,480
If it wasn't you, it was Lucia.

161
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,010
I told you it wasn't me.

162
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,220
Lucia tipped her off on purpose?

163
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,520
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

164
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,220
Hello, Madam.

165
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,190
It's nice to see you again.

166
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,600
Or should we have met outside
where we could've gotten some air?

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,270
No. It's nice to see you like this.

168
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,300
Are things going well?

169
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,940
I'd like to ask you something about that.

170
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,540
I know what I tell you
reaches Lucia too...

171
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,450
Not everything. It depends.

172
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,050
Just because I know her
doesn't mean I tell her everything.

173
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,190
What's going on?

174
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,490
The Jogeon Logistics acquisition.

175
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,160
It was a secret,
but my sister found out and got involved.

176
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,230
I heard she was as competent
a businesswoman as you.

177
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,970
She must be really good.

178
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,770
I think there was a leak.

179
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,470
Lawyer Kim, Director Moon, and I
knew about the deal.

180
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,170
Director Moon refused to do the job.

181
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,180
That leaves Lawyer Kim or Lucia.

182
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,280
And it's not him.

183
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,110
Then you think it was Lucia.

184
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,850
Why would she do that?

185
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,580
I have no idea.

186
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,360
Whatever her goal is,
if I were to fight my sister,

187
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,690
it would cause a ruckus,

188
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,290
and that would hurt Mingang.

189
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,690
That's a bit of a reach.

190
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,730
If you're right,

191
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,630
are you saying
Lucia wants to topple Mingang?

192
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,900
Why would she?

193
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,040
I told you. I don't know why.

194
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,550
Kyung Chae asked me if you were the leak.

195
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,450
It doesn't matter.

196
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,620
Min Soo Jung can't tell
that she heard from me.

197
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,260
She'd lose me as a source if she did,
and she wouldn't want that.

198
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,160
Soo Jung has no one but you to rely on.

199
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,760
Kim Sun Jae will never help her,

200
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,570
and Director Moon isn't the scheming type.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,270
You're the only one
who can tell her what the CEO is up to.

202
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,940
We just need the sisters
to hate each other even more.

203
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,880
It would be perfect
if we could get to Chairman Min too.

204
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,180
What is he like at work?
Did he say anything to you?

205
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,480
Not yet.

206
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,190
I can tell that he's bothered,
but he's still suspicious.

207
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,990
He will be.

208
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,830
He can't accept that a few coincidences
might mean something more.

209
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,600
But once someone like that
decides to open up,

210
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,460
they'll give you all they have.

211
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,470
Why didn't you see your doctor
when I even made an appointment?

212
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,510
I was away from the office all day long.

213
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,110
Doctor Yoon insisted on seeing you,
so it must be serious.

214
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,050
Don't worry. Everything's in order
in case I drop dead tomorrow.

215
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,020
I even have a notarized will.

216
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,760
I left you a stake too, so claim it.

217
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,160
Do you think I'm worried
I won't get anything?

218
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,690
I said I was fine,
but you won't leave me alone.

219
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,660
If you keep fighting me,
I'll pick you up myself tomorrow.

220
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,470
You might make me sick, okay?

221
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,930
Turn off the lights on the way out.

222
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,300
Goodness.

223
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,080
I can go home tomorrow.

224
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,010
I laid in this bed for four years,

225
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,880
and it feels strange to leave.

226
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,790
It feels like yesterday
when I brought you here in an ambulance.

227
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,660
There are lots of people like me here.

228
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,790
Lying in bed with an oxygen mask,
not yet dead but not actually alive.

229
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,900
I'm the only one
who woke up and recovered so completely.

230
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,600
It's a blessing to just wake up,

231
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,300
and my memory is intact too.

232
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,140
Yes.

233
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,310
I'll come by when you get discharged.

234
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,410
Don't bother. You should work.

235
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,780
You're too busy to come here.
I can manage on my own.

236
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,150
It's fine.
I can pretend I'm out on business.

237
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,050
Don't do that, okay?

238
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,150
It makes me uncomfortable.

239
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,260
I'll treat you well and make it up to you.

240
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,030
Okay.

241
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,770
Don't worry about anything.

242
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,740
The first thing I'll do when I leave...

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,710
is visit your parents and greet them.

244
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,240
Where's the columbarium?

245
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,910
It's Haneul Memorial
at the outskirts of Gyeonggi Province.

246
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,220
I should've come to my senses long ago.

247
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,760
I shouldn't have listened to
that fool Min Doo Sik.

248
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,560
Meet me tomorrow where your parents are.

249
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,990
I'll be there waiting.

250
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,360
Okay.

251
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Okay?

252
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,470
(Mingang Distribution)

253
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,340
We haven't heard from CEO Jo,
so I guess he hasn't decided yet.

254
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,980
There's no point in waiting.

255
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,210
Let's visit and urge him to sign.

256
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,350
Forcing him won't help.

257
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,320
He's allowed to think...

258
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,350
How much time should we give him?

259
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,190
Enough for him to accept another offer?

260
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,020
Do you even think...

261
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,590
this acquisition is an important task?

262
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,290
Do you care what happens?

263
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,860
CEO Min took me off...

264
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,170
my online business duties
so I could focus on this.

265
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,330
You might not like my output...

266
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,440
You should have pulled out
all the stops to make it work.

267
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,210
No. You shouldn't
get in the way, at least.

268
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,040
What? What are you talking about?

269
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,410
- You don't know?
- What are you both doing?

270
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,280
This isn't the time to argue.

271
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,290
Let's think of how
to get the contract signed.

272
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,270
Someone made sure
everything got unusually messed up.

273
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,410
Ms. Lucia. Siding with Director Min...

274
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,540
won't do you any good.

275
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,240
I gave it a go, and it really wasn't...

276
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,810
Are you saying
I'm weighing my options between them?

277
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,850
I hope you're not,

278
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,280
but if you are...

279
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,250
Hang on.

280
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,360
Well? Did you look into it?

281
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,660
You asked about Baek Sul Hee.

282
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,130
She went missing
after her daughter died four years ago.

283
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,560
Are you sure?

284
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,770
Yes. I don't think she's dead,
but she hasn't been found.

285
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,870
Either she's living in hiding...

286
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,340
Or...

287
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,610
she got a new identity...

288
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,980
and is living as someone else.

289
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,890
I told you I didn't feel like eating.
Will you leave me alone?

290
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,290
Eat. Eating keeps you alive.

291
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
Why did you lose your hearty appetite?

292
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,700
I grilled your favorite meat.

293
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,670
Stuff your face until your cheeks bulge.

294
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,170
"Stuff my face until my cheeks bulge?"
You are so vulgar.

295
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,610
We don't just live on food alone.

296
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,580
What else keeps us alive?

297
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,740
My gosh...

298
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,850
That was more like a blanket than a wrap.

299
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,120
Why not make it bigger
and rip my mouth open?

300
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,690
You're so crass.

301
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,230
What the...

302
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,490
Is it good?

303
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,560
It's good.

304
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
I don't need you to feed me.

305
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,840
Here goes.

306
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,700
Say, "Ah."

307
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,710
Are you playing the coquette?

308
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,010
"Ah."

309
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,680
Isn't my ssam extra tasty?

310
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,520
It's the best ssam I've had...

311
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,390
in 27,342 days.

312
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,590
Here comes another one.

313
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,130
It's not nice to make just one. Say, "Ah."

314
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,200
- "Ah."
- "Ah."

315
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,870
It's too big.

316
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,040
That's enough!

317
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,080
What did I do?

318
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,940
I just fed you.

319
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,250
Did I ask you to feed me?

320
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,350
You're both women, and it's the same ssam,
so why is it so different?

321
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,090
What did I...

322
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,390
Are you thinking about some other witch?

323
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,600
We're more likely to find an elephant
that blew its nose and got an infection.

324
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,760
Don't call the exquisite lady a witch.

325
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,330
An "exquisite lady?"

326
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,310
The food you mentioned last time.

327
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,450
I cooked some stuff
from your husband's hometown.

328
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,320
I bet it tastes delicious. Thank you.

329
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,950
That ruined my appetite.

330
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,560
- How are you?
- I feel horrible!

331
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,030
But since you're here, have a good time!

332
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,300
He must be in a bad mood.

333
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,470
Why complain after a great meal?

334
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,170
(Hankuk Hospital)

335
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,510
Why bother a busy man like me?

336
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,410
We scanned your brain last time.

337
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,980
You should hear the results.

338
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,650
Aren't you even curious?

339
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,320
Why bother?

340
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,920
I'm fine. Don't worry.

341
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,650
Are you a doctor?

342
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,920
Why do you conclude that you're fine?

343
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,360
Will you be nice?

344
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,760
Doctor.

345
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,760
A patient is getting discharged,
and he came to say goodbye.

346
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,730
Excuse me.

347
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,340
Hello.

348
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,610
Thank you, Doctor.

349
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,510
You saved my life.

350
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,890
I wish you good health.
Look after yourself.

351
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,090
I'll do that.

352
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,060
Thanks so much
for looking after me, Nurse.

353
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,290
Not at all.

354
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,360
- I wish you well.
- Thanks.

355
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,460
I'll get going, then.

356
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,430
- I'm glad you recovered.
- Thank you.

357
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,800
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

358
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,670
Why would it take so long
just to say goodbye?

359
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,110
He's going home
after waking up from a four-year coma.

360
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,220
I didn't think he'd make it
when he first came in.

361
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,950
I guess some people are just tough.

362
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,950
How badly was he hurt?

363
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,160
He was hit hard
in the back of the head in an alley.

364
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,330
Someone brought him in.

365
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,460
Really? What's the name?

366
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,670
I'm Yoon Min Sik.

367
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,870
Not your name.
The name of the guy who just left.

368
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,400
That was Jo Pil Doo.

369
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,470
- Who?
- Jo Pil Doo.

370
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,010
Why? Do you know him?

371
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,250
Sir.

372
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,250
Goodness.

373
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,390
Jo Pil Doo!

374
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,200
It is you. Jo Pil Doo the fixer.

375
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,240
What are you doing here, Chairman?

376
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,540
You shouldn't be here.

377
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,980
Do you think you can scare me into hiding?

378
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,780
I'll tell the whole world what you did!

379
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,420
(Hankuk Hospital)

380
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,730
If the rooftop is too much,
how about here?

381
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,540
Everyone has such a spot.

382
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,610
A place they just can't stand.

383
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,350
If you feel that way about our rooftop,
how about we talk here?

384
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,820
What do you mean?

385
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,320
Let's meet here to talk about
what others can't know.

386
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,390
Why would we have to do such a thing?

387
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,630
Actually,

388
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,960
I know everything.

389
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,170
I met with CEO Jo, and he told me.

390
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,470
This might sound strange.

391
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,470
(Jogeon Logistics)

392
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,110
You must not sign this deal.

393
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,150
Partnering with Mingang Distribution
will not do you any good.

394
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,650
I know what you want to say.

395
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,220
Ms. Lucia told me already.

396
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,220
She seemed like a good person.

397
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,490
She said
something similar happened 30 years ago.

398
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,760
She told me she'd heard from someone else.

399
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,740
Years ago, Chairman Min Doo Sik
tried to acquire a small company,

400
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,270
but things went wrong.

401
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,570
The CEO and his wife died,

402
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,410
and their son was left alone.

403
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,610
She told me
not to let that happen to my Geon.

404
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,890
Oh, she also said something else.

405
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,060
She wished the boy
were happy and well somewhere.

406
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,600
I don't know what CEO Jo told you,
but I didn't mean...

407
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,040
You don't have to explain.

408
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,410
I'd gone to see him to say the same thing.

409
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,310
You and I met with CEO Jo
with the same heart.

410
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,450
Why would you...

411
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,790
I told you. I had the same heart.

412
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:42,060
That means we have a secret,
even though it's just about this deal.

413
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,270
If you climb up step by step,

414
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,840
you'll reach the rooftop.

415
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,100
When the day comes,

416
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,710
being there won't hurt
as much as it does now.

417
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,420
I'll go ahead. I have stuff to do.

418
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,570
(The late Han Kyung Soo,
The late Yoon Hee Jeong)

419
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,140
Father.

420
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,570
Mother.

421
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,710
He'll be here today.

422
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Jo Pil Doo.

423
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,480
He caused your deaths,

424
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,190
but I really need him right now.

425
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,920
He wants to make it up to you...

426
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,630
and has offered to testify in court.

427
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,390
Then Min Doo Sik...

428
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,070
will pay the price soon.

429
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,920
(The late Han Kyung Soo,
The late Yoon Hee Jeong)

430
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,370
Jo Pil Doo is alive?

431
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,450
Why on earth?

432
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,820
Why?

433
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,690
I waited for four years.

434
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,760
I can finally take Min Doo Sik to court.

435
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,100
Is it that hard to testify?

436
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,600
Why, Mr. Jo? Why?

437
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,050
Min Doo Sik.

438
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,890
(Mingang Distribution)

439
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,430
Jo Pil Doo is alive.

440
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
This wouldn't have happened
if you'd taken care of it then.

441
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,970
Find him and deal with him.

442
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,270
Remember.

443
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,540
I won't accept the same mistake twice.

444
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,940
Who do you think
looked after him for four years?

445
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,610
It's the fool
who wants to avenge his father.

446
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,120
Find Han Kyung Soo's son
and bring him to me.

(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

448
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,520
Wasn't there a Jo Pil Doo here?

449
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,360
Who looked after him?
His guardian, I mean.

450
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,990
If she's really my mom,

451
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,030
she'll have the same allergy.

452
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,270
You were arrogant enough
to get in the way.

453
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,770
I must work with Soo Jung instead?

454
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,300
Let's talk over a drink.

455
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,370
I could give you some tips.

456
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,510
You look out for her.

457
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,610
Is she that competent, or is she charming?

458
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,840
You and Director Moon are extremely close.

459
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,710
What were you two doing in there?
