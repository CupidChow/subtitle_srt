1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,910
Hard to believe, isn't it?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,940
I suppose it feels like
your world is ending.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,450
It'd be stranger
if you believed me right away.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,290
I'm telling you, Se Ri is my daughter.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,090
What's wrong with you, Kim Sun Jae?
Have you lost your mind?

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,230
How dare you come in here
spouting such nonsense!

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,130
We even did
a grandparentage DNA verification test.

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,800
Of course you did.

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,270
I pulled a lot of strings
to make it happen.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,040
This is the paternity test result
for Baek Sul Hee and Se Ri.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,780
Twenty years ago,

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,420
on the day Min Kyung Chae gave birth
to your son Ho Se's daughter,

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,260
Baek Sul Hee gave birth to my daughter
at the very same time.

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,730
And as if by fate,
the two babies were switched.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,260
In other words,

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,330
your granddaughter is Mi So,

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,070
who jumped from the rooftop
of Mingang Distribution four years ago,

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,500
and Se Ri is my daughter.

19
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,910
You crazy jerk!

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,280
Stop spewing nonsense and get out.
Get out now!

21
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,580
Very well.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,310
I'm sure none of this is sinking in.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,620
But these are the facts.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,450
Min Kyung Chae may not know,
but Baek Sul Hee knows everything.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,360
And you don't even realize
that woman is playing you for a fool.

26
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,620
Tired?

27
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,520
Here. Fruit is the best thing
when you're tired. Have some.

28
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,290
How much longer do I have
to do this part-time job?

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,300
You can quit tomorrow if you want.

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,100
I'm not going to force you.

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,400
But, Se Ri, I want you to live
like a normal 20-year-old.

32
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,470
That includes working a part-time job
like other people your age.

33
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,580
Is it that hard?

34
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,750
The other stuff is manageable,

35
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,920
but it's the rude customers
that bother me.

36
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,320
How so?

37
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,760
They're just rude and talk down to me.

38
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,290
I wouldn't mind if they were older.
But they're clearly my age.

39
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,930
It's this whole "I'm the customer,
you're just the worker" attitude.

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,700
Their power trip is insane.
I'm telling you.

41
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,740
Se Ri, have you ever done that?

42
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,710
Have you been rude to someone your own age
working in a cafe?

43
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,510
Just because you were in a bad mood,

44
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,280
have you made someone feel awful
for no good reason?

45
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,850
Me? Well...

46
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,120
When would I ever go
to a place like a cafe?

47
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,830
If I'm having coffee, it's at a hotel.
I don't go to dumps like that.

48
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,470
Are you just pretending not to remember
in front of me,

49
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,470
or do you really not remember?

50
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,370
Se Ri.

51
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,710
If you can't remember Mi So,

52
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,440
then I can't recognize you.

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,020
I'm only doing this
because you told me to.

54
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,090
It's boring and pointless.

55
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,590
It's just exhausting.

56
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,130
Still, try to stick with it
as long as you can.

57
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,800
I promise you.

58
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,100
It'll definitely be a good opportunity
for you.

59
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,940
To learn about life
and reflect on yourself.

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,210
Tae Joo, why should I believe
a lunatic like him?

61
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,650
I'm not sure.

62
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,050
But it would be hard
to lie about something like this.

63
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,850
We could just run our own test
and find out immediately.

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,390
Then it's really not Se Ri,

65
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,490
but Mi So, who died, is Ho Se's daughter?

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,430
Were the two babies really switched?
How could something like that happen?

67
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,700
If you're worried, should I look into it?
Maybe go see CEO Min?

68
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,170
But he said she didn't know anything.

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,910
But since she didn't know,
she just did the paternity test back then.

70
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,150
But he said Lucia knows, right?

71
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,420
She must have been
laughing her head off...

72
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,290
as she watched me make such a fuss,
thinking her kid was my bloodline.

73
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,220
It's probably the opposite.

74
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,400
Watching you dote on Se Ri
without knowing a thing,

75
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,200
Lucia probably felt sorry for you.

76
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,540
No way.
She wanted me to be fooled to the end...

77
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,540
so I'd make her precious daughter
the heir to Mingang.

78
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,610
If that were true, she would have done
whatever it took to silence Lawyer Kim...

79
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,680
to keep the secret from getting out.

80
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,060
After four years with her,
do you still not know Lucia at all?

81
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,160
That's not the issue right now.

82
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,660
If the two babies really were switched,

83
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,660
that means Mi So is Ho Se's daughter.

84
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,500
And I know...

85
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,800
what a horrible end she came to.

86
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,770
How am I supposed to just let this go?

87
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,610
(Notice of
Emergency Shareholders' Meeting)

88
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,550
(Agenda: Motion for the Dismissal
of Acting Chairman Jung Lucia)

89
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,050
(Chairman Min Doo Shik)

90
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,420
Did you see the company intranet?

91
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,420
I just saw it.

92
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,890
There's still time. Should we try
to block the shareholders' meeting?

93
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,060
- There might be a way.
- That will be difficult.

94
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,160
The largest shareholder can call
the shareholders' meeting at any time,

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,970
as long as
the proper procedures are followed.

96
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,100
My dismissal will be decided
at the shareholders' meeting, won't it?

97
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,870
It'll pass immediately
as long as they have a quorum.

98
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,440
But you never know if we can find
grounds to postpone it.

99
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,480
They followed all rules and procedures,
so we have no real grounds for a delay.

100
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,910
There is one thing, though.

101
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,450
There are absolutely no grounds
for your dismissal.

102
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,190
They're just pushing you out
because you don't fit in with their plans.

103
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,420
If we appeal to that...

104
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,190
It won't be easy.
They're all on Min Kyung Chae's side.

105
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,060
Still, we have to block it
as much as we possibly can.

106
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,430
And if that doesn't work,
let's gather as much support...

107
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,500
as we can with our shares combined
and mount a defense.

108
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,410
How long are you going to act like this?
This is childish.

109
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,740
(Mingang Distribution)

110
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,740
If you're upset with me, just say so.

111
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,910
Don't act out and sulk like this.

112
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,310
I'm sure you don't have time
to worry about me.

113
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,950
You're calling a shareholders' meeting
to get Lucia fired,

114
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,820
and then you can be the CEO
or the chairman all by yourself.

115
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,890
You can just have it all.
Why bother with me?

116
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,660
What on earth is wrong with you?

117
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,360
I even let it slide
when you took off your engagement ring.

118
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,830
I'm so grateful I could cry.

119
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,270
Forgive me. I forgot my place
when I took off a ring I never deserved.

120
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,640
But about that ring...

121
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,710
You were the one who took it off first,
Min Kyung Chae.

122
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
What did you just say?

123
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
And another thing.

124
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,780
- "Min Kyung Chae"?
- Or should I be calling you "Master"?

125
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,490
Once Lucia and Moon Tae Kyung are gone,
it'll be your perfect little world.

126
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,130
You won't need someone like me then.
Right?

127
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,600
But you're overlooking one thing.

128
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,170
Those nominee shares
that I'm secretly managing...

129
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,770
Although I'm doing it
under the chairman's orders,

130
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,070
I could still use my voting rights
as I see fit if I really wanted to.

131
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,550
Who I back is the key
to this whole battle for control.

132
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,380
And without my support,

133
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,150
do you really think Min Kyung Chae
can be the majority shareholder?

134
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,250
Are you threatening me?

135
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,650
So...

136
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,090
what is it you want from me?

137
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,960
What exactly can you do for me?

138
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,560
If I wanted to get married tomorrow,
could you do that?

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,570
An old hound is useless, isn't it?

140
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,970
But it seems you forgot...

141
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,570
that even a hound can turn on its master.

142
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,690
It's been quiet around the house lately.

143
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,120
During the day, it's just the two of us.

144
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,190
Where does Se Ri keep going all the time?

145
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,260
She's working a part-time job now,
waiting tables at a cafe.

146
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,660
My gosh. Why would she do that?
It's not like she needs the money.

147
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
I know, right?

148
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,640
Madam Jung made her do it,
but how could she make her do that?

149
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,010
She's obviously trying to make her suffer.

150
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,410
It's to get back at Ms. Kyung Chae.

151
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,140
I don't get why she would make Se Ri
do something like that,

152
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,950
but how is that supposed to get back
at Kyung Chae?

153
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,720
Of course it's to get back at her!

154
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,350
You know who Ms. Se Ri is
to Ms. Kyung Chae, don't you?

155
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,290
How do you think Ms. Kyung Chae feels
watching her get treated so badly?

156
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,820
Wait. What exactly does Se Ri mean
to Kyung Chae?

157
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,260
Is there some other secret
besides them being half-sisters?

158
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Like a secret about her birth
or something?

159
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,230
That's as ridiculous as a penguin
on top of Mount Everest...

160
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,800
selling shaved ice.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,400
A birth secret? Don't be ridiculous.

162
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,110
- Good grief.
- My goodness!

163
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,440
You don't have to lash out
if that wasn't the case.

164
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,480
And by the way, what you said
about the penguin on Mount Everest...

165
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,780
is actually a phrase my dad holds
the copyrights to.

166
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,450
You can't just go around using it
without permission.

167
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,390
That's a classic Oh Pan Sool quote.

168
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,920
Is someone talking about me?
My ears are burning.

169
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,460
Someone's probably badmouthing you.

170
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,930
You've done more than enough
to deserve it.

171
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,660
It's hardly a surprise.

172
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,530
Now you're just spouting nonsense,
like a woodpecker breaking its own beak.

173
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,470
I don't badmouth people,
and people don't badmouth me.

174
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,500
I'm practically a saint,
halfway between Buddha and Confucius.

175
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,810
The Buddha? Sure.

176
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,380
You have absolutely no self-awareness.

177
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,280
Not only are your looks hopeless,
but your temper is a disaster, too.

178
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,580
Do you have any idea how much people
trash-talk you behind your back?

179
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,290
My darling wife.
Why bring my looks into it?

180
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,960
When people first saw Ja Kyung,
they suspected a birth secret.

181
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,830
She was just too pretty
to be your daughter.

182
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,260
You're so dramatic.
And you think she looks like you?

183
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,570
At least get your facts straight.

184
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,170
When Ja Kyung was in that kid's contest,

185
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,470
everyone said
she must've been switched at birth...

186
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,340
because she didn't look a thing
like her mom.

187
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,910
What do you mean she doesn't look like me?

188
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,240
People always say
we're just like carp-shaped buns.

189
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,310
What's wrong with you?

190
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,550
Sure, carp-shaped buns.
Except you don't have any filling.

191
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,120
First daughters always take
after their dads.

192
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,050
It's a universal law of nature.

193
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,290
Everyone says she's my spitting image.

194
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,590
Spitting image, my foot.

195
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,920
Fine, you want to get a paternity test
for the three of us?

196
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,990
Now you're talking.

197
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,290
Let's do the test now and see
who she's the spitting image of.

198
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,300
Bring it on.
The whole world knows I gave birth to her.

199
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,100
For Pete's sake.
The watermill that night is my witness.

200
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
Yang Mal Sook at the watermill?

201
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,340
"If you don't marry me, Pan Sool,
I'll become a nun!"

202
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,240
The full moon that night saw everything.

203
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,150
That's hilarious.

204
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,550
You were desperately clinging to me,
holding onto my skirt!

205
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,480
Your skirt? In your dreams.
You were wearing pants that day.

206
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,690
Enough! Let's get the paternity test
for the three of us!

207
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,890
Fine!

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,270
I thought she was my granddaughter,

209
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,000
but in reality, she's the enemy
who caused my granddaughter's death?

210
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,370
In a situation like this,

211
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,410
what am I supposed to do?

212
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,720
Why are you here again, Grandma?

213
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,220
Are there no cafes in your neighborhood?

214
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,620
I actually liked hearing
you call me Grandma.

215
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,790
I thought you said you hated it.

216
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,330
I did.

217
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,760
But somewhere along the way,
I grew to like it.

218
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,400
Maybe I liked it even more
because it came from you.

219
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,770
In that case, I'll say it more often,
Grandma.

220
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,670
Why are you wasting time here?

221
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,370
Are you that scared of your stepmom?

222
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,280
Does she hit you or something
if you don't do as you're told?

223
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,880
It's not like that...

224
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,480
It's just that I can sort my thoughts out
better here than at home.

225
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,420
What is there that needs
so much sorting out?

226
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,260
What kind of person I am,

227
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,290
or if I've ever caused anyone
to get hurt...

228
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,400
Things like that.

229
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,130
Has someone been hurt...

230
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,900
because of you?

231
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,310
That's something...

232
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,240
Why are you asking that?

233
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,980
I haven't even told my own mom
about this yet.

234
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,910
If it's that difficult to talk about,

235
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,850
why do you even think about it?

236
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,750
It's because...

237
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,790
my mom told me to reflect on
whether I've hurt anyone...

238
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,390
or been mean to them,

239
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,290
so that's what I'm doing.

240
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,860
Your stepmom told you that?

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,900
Yes. Why?

242
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,500
Sit down if you're having coffee.
Otherwise, go.

243
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Hey.

244
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,990
Did you know that
Kyung Chae and Sun Jae broke up?

245
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,860
What are you talking about?
Why? What happened?

246
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,870
It looks like that brat Sun Jae defied
one of Kyung Chae's orders.

247
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,840
So now Kyung Chae is livid
and making a huge scene about firing him.

248
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,870
- That doesn't sound like Lawyer Kim.
- I know.

249
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,840
Then again, Sun Jae did put up with her
for a long time.

250
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,610
You know how she terrorizes
the people who work for her.

251
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,350
So what's Lawyer Kim going to do now?

252
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,850
Who knows? According to Kyung Chae,
he even took off his engagement ring.

253
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,840
Are you really planning to break off
your engagement with my sister?

254
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,610
I heard you took off your engagement ring.

255
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,310
News travels fast.

256
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,810
It looks like this is the end
of the road for us.

257
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,150
I struggled just to get us engaged,

258
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,750
but anything beyond that...

259
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,950
Then you can go beyond that with me.

260
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,990
What did you just say?

261
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,490
Let's give it a try. You and me.

262
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,990
Whatever it is.

263
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,760
Right now, you can't side with my sister,

264
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,100
and you can't side with Lucia either,
right?

265
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,370
So what's there to think about?

266
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,040
Team up with me,
and we'll take them both down.

267
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,510
But I was with your sister. How could I...

268
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,110
You think that matters?

269
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,540
I know my sister better than anyone.

270
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,410
You two were engaged,

271
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,280
but I bet your relationship
wasn't physical, was it?

272
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,980
Am I wrong?

273
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,260
My shares, plus your nominee shares.

274
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,400
If we pretend to support them
with the shares, only to backstab them,

275
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,660
don't you think it could be a lot of fun?

276
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,600
Don't you realize that could get us both
kicked out of Mingang for good?

277
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,970
Kyung Chae is already trying to figure out
how to get rid of you anyway.

278
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,680
Isn't it better to strike first
than to wait to be fired?

279
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,120
Kim Sun Jae has been
deliberately acting out,

280
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,020
and now he's finally
showing his true colors.

281
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,190
Really?

282
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,560
We've already set a date
for the shareholders' meeting,

283
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,490
but now that he's digging in his heels,

284
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,360
I'm worried things
are going to fall apart.

285
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,660
But you have your shares,

286
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,970
and Ji Seop and Ja Kyung
promised to give you theirs.

287
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,170
So shouldn't that be enough?

288
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,740
There's more to it than that.

289
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,310
I know he's my brother, but he changes
his mind at the drop of a hat.

290
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,410
You never know
what unexpected problems might come up.

291
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,880
You need to hurry
and transfer your stake to me.

292
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,080
You need to make your move.

293
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,680
Look. Our plan to make Father
and Lucia get a divorce...

294
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,150
ended up falling through.

295
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,560
You have to be the one
to step up and take charge.

296
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,620
That way, Se Ri can become the head
of Mingang that much sooner.

297
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,530
Se Ri as the head of Mingang?

298
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,730
Of course.
That's what you want, isn't it?

299
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,770
And I...

300
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,240
will make sure that happens for you.

301
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,010
On another note,

302
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,410
I have to ask you something,
and I want you to be completely honest.

303
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,580
Of course.
I'm always honest with you.

304
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,350
Four years ago,

305
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,590
there was a fatal accident on the rooftop
of Mingang Distribution, wasn't there?

306
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
To my understanding,

307
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,990
a girl back then, around Se Ri's age,

308
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,630
jumped to her death.

309
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,730
That? It was nothing.

310
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,700
Someone died, and it was nothing?

311
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
She was a very troubled girl.

312
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,140
It sounds harsh, but she had it coming.

313
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,370
Her mother was a single mom,

314
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,580
and she couldn't even
name the biological father.

315
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,110
They were never on our level
to begin with.

316
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,880
She got tangled up with Se Ri,
and we got dragged into it.

317
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,250
When I think about her mom showing up...

318
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,150
and making a scene
at the new business launch ceremony,

319
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,790
I still cringe.

320
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,390
And that's not all.

321
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,530
She'd come by and make a scene,
saying she'd clear her daughter's name.

322
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,670
Doing that wasn't going to bring
her kid back to life.

323
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,040
No wonder the father wants nothing to do
with any of it.

324
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,910
It's obvious, isn't it?

325
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,910
He must be some good-for-nothing bum
she met somewhere.

326
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,880
And with a father like that,
what do you expect from the child?

327
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,050
Mother.

328
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,220
Don't you dare call me "Mother."
Get out now!

329
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,130
Get out of my sight!

330
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,960
(Mingang Distribution)

331
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,140
What is going on?

332
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,640
She was acting like
she'd give me the world.

333
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,480
What does she expect me to do now?

334
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,380
I'm already annoyed to death as it is.

335
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,420
Come to my office.
There's something you have to know.

336
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,310
What do you two think you're doing?

337
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,480
You and Lawyer Kim basically broke off
your engagement, right?

338
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,610
He took his engagement ring off himself,

339
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,850
and you knew and went along with it.

340
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,620
That means the engagement is off, right?

341
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,620
What did you just say?

342
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,060
She said a hound
after hunting season is over...

343
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,530
is just waiting to be put down.

344
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,160
He told me what you said. That was harsh.

345
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,400
I know using people and tossing them aside
is your specialty, but still.

346
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,600
So what, you two are going
to get together now?

347
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,410
We're going to start
seeing each other seriously.

348
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,080
You're insane.

349
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,680
Careful with your words.

350
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,680
Is there a law that says we can't date?

351
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,950
Look, we may have had
an engagement ceremony,

352
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,050
but we never even held hands.
What's the problem?

353
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,660
What is wrong with you?

354
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,190
Are you out of your mind?
Snap out of it!

355
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,460
We're perfectly fine.
You're the one who needs to get a grip.

356
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,300
- My future sister-in-law.
- What? Sister-in-law?

357
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,040
Lawyer Kim, are you really doing this?

358
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,800
You're the one who's overreacting.

359
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,440
You don't want him, but you can't stand
to see someone else? Is that it?

360
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,680
Is this how you're going
to stab me in the back?

361
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,610
Especially with the shareholders' meeting
coming up.

362
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,710
You shouldn't have backstabbed me first.

363
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
Since it has come to this,

364
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,990
would you mind leaving, my sister-in-law?

365
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,660
Unless you plan on standing there
to watch us kiss.

366
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,890
It might be a little inappropriate
for the office,

367
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,830
but we're just so hot for each other.

368
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,310
(Mingang Distribution)

369
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,490
Jang Yeon Sook turning on me
wasn't enough, and now them!

370
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,390
Did you all plan this?

371
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,820
Do you all want to see me go insane?

372
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,990
Why is everyone doing this to me?

373
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,840
This is the revised new business proposal
from before.

374
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
Hey, what's wrong with you?

375
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,780
Here she goes again.

376
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,720
What was the urgent matter?

377
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,130
Mother knows everything.

378
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,770
Lawyer Kim Sun Jae
paid her a visit recently.

379
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,370
You mean she knows about Se Ri and Mi So?

380
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,940
Also, Chairman Min Doo Sik...

381
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,440
is in the VIP Room
at Hanmyeong Hospital right now.

382
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,180
He's regained consciousness,
and his motor functions have returned.

383
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,050
He can communicate as well, of course.

384
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,320
It wasn't easy betraying Mother.

385
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,390
I know it's the right thing to do,
but stabbing her in the back like that...

386
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,760
I understand completely.

387
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,460
That's why I never intended
to pressure you.

388
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,230
But if I hesitated any longer,

389
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,470
I was afraid something irreversible
would happen.

390
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,510
I was afraid...

391
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,940
she might murder Chairman Min Doo Sik.

392
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,310
Murder? What do you mean?

393
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,150
Right now, there's nothing
she won't do for Ho Se.

394
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,370
She's probably heading to the rooftop.

395
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,480
Why there?

396
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,050
Madam Jang knows that
Mi So and Se Ri were switched.

397
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,780
Apparently, Kim Sun Jae went to her
and told her everything.

398
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,930
My Mi So...

399
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,430
My Mi So...

400
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,830
How?

401
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,440
How could she, so frail,
in a place like this?

402
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,870
Please, forgive her.

403
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,840
What Se Ri did...

404
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,380
is unforgivable,

405
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,610
but please, just this once,

406
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,950
forgive her.

407
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,790
I'll make sure she's punished
and turns over a new leaf.

408
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,560
I'll make her understand
the terrible thing she's done.

409
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,930
And...

410
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,690
I'll make her spend her entire life...

411
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,630
atoning for what she did to Mi So.

412
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,830
And what good will that do?

413
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,300
That won't bring a dead child
back to life.

414
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,840
What I can't stand is...

415
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,880
why, of all things,
those two had to be the ones switched.

416
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,280
Why? Just tell me why!

417
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,050
Why did they have to be switched...

418
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,920
for your daughter to kill my grandchild?

419
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,180
Just why?

420
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,920
Before Mi So...

421
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,090
was your granddaughter,

422
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,930
she was my daughter.

423
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,000
You know how much she meant to me.

424
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,770
Others may not understand,

425
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,140
but you, of all people, know.

426
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,340
You're Mi So's...

427
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,310
grandmother, after all.

428
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,150
I won't let Mi So's death...

429
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,820
be in vain.

430
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,730
When Mi So...

431
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,130
was in that incubator,
hovering between life and death,

432
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,010
I was told countless times
she might not make it through the night.

433
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,610
But Mi So...

434
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,480
pulled through every single time.

435
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,850
And growing up,

436
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,620
she was a sweet daughter
who never gave me a moment's worry.

437
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,460
No matter what anyone says,

438
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,930
Mi So is my daughter.

439
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,200
Even now, just thinking about Mi So,

440
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,540
it hurts so much right here
that I can't even breathe.

441
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,950
So how can it be...

442
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,220
that Mi So isn't my daughter?

443
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,220
I failed her.

444
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,360
I'm the one who couldn't protect Mi So.

445
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,760
So, please, just blame me.

446
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,430
Mi So wouldn't want...

447
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,070
to see her grandmother fall apart...

448
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,270
because of her, either.

449
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,210
I'll decide what to do with you later.

450
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,710
First, I have to punish the one
who truly deserves it.

451
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,510
Die! Just die!

452
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,910
Die!

453
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,480
Die!

454
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,610
Just die!

455
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,550
Die!

456
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,180
Die!

457
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,520
Die...

458
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,690
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

459
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,310
You're breaking up with me this way?

460
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,280
You're stabbing me in the back
to be with Soo Jung?

461
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,780
If that doesn't work,
then we'll have to play our final card.

462
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,180
Your final card?

463
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,680
If you want to protect Mingang,
do it on your own.

464
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,120
From now on, try to be a decent person.

465
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,520
Don't tell me you're packing everything up
and skipping the country.

466
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,330
Hurry and stop them
before this whole thing blows up.

467
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,530
I might be leaving,

468
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,030
but not without what I deserve
for my loyalty to Mingang.

469
