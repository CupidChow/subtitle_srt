1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,550
This isn't her.

2
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,590
I did it.

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,720
Tell the truth and say you didn't do it.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,060
The culprit is someone else.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,890
I did it, okay?

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,590
I beat your daughter...

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,730
into a pulp.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,960
Got that?

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,200
This means the case is closed.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,300
Something is off.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,770
Bo Ram won't take my calls
or read my texts.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,410
(Episode 6)

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,910
Mom.

14
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,610
Yes, what?

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,480
What have you been thinking about?

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,780
It's nothing, really.

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,080
Mom.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,120
Do you know you've been acting weird
since you talked to the police?

19
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,520
Why don't you smile a bit, Madam Baek?

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,660
You should be careful.

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,590
You just had surgery.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,000
Do you know what Mom expects of you?

23
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,940
I do. You want me
to live a long, healthy life.

24
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,940
You said I was born premature
and was in an incubator for a long time.

25
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,610
I stressed you out badly.

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,610
The doctor said you wouldn't make it.

27
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,010
But I didn't give up on you.

28
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,980
I must be really persistent.

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,790
That's why I fought and survived.

30
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,490
I'll keep doing that, so don't worry.

31
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,660
Let's live happily forever, Madam Baek.

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,730
Yes, let's.

33
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,840
Welcome.

34
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,180
Why are you here?

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,080
I need to ask for a favor.

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,980
Give me the original CCTV footage.

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,180
I need to look into everything
from the start.

38
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,480
I deleted it.

39
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,850
- Why?
- That's the rule.

40
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,250
You said you'd keep it.
That I could ask for it if I needed it.

41
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,960
You caught the culprit. Isn't that enough?

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,830
How do you know that?

43
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,230
I just found that out.
How did you know already?

44
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,500
I don't have the video anymore.

45
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,530
Sir.

46
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,370
They found a fake culprit
and closed the case.

47
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,240
There's nothing I can do now.

48
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,270
Don't do anything then. It's over.

49
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,010
This isn't right.

50
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,210
What do you want me to do?

51
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,450
Mi So is one innocent victim too many.

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,510
I don't know who told you
to delete the video...

53
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,680
Leave already.

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,020
Sir.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Bo Ram.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,900
(Wu Bo Ram)

57
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,270
I came to ask you something.

58
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,110
The police told me...

59
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,880
you identified the culprit.

60
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,280
Why did you do that?

61
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,720
Because it was her.

62
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,090
No, it wasn't her.

63
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,150
Yes. It was her.

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,490
You got the culprit.

65
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,490
You wanted someone to pay.

66
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,400
No. I don't want
someone innocent to pay for it.

67
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,300
Bo Ram.

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,140
Help me out.

69
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,810
Let's find the actual culprit.

70
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,580
Mi So is overjoyed
thinking everything is sorted out.

71
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,840
I can't watch that anymore.

72
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,880
I won't testify.

73
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,020
I won't do anything anymore.

74
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,790
I know you're not doing this on purpose.

75
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,090
Someone must've told you to do this.

76
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,130
It's not right.

77
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,760
You shouldn't do this
even if you were told to.

78
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,630
I gave a statement...

79
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,470
and I want to stay out of it.

80
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,740
You don't want someone else to go down...

81
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,810
for something
you know they're innocent of.

82
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,980
The culprit will be out there
having a great time.

83
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,650
We can't allow that.

84
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,580
What do I care?
That's none of my business.

85
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,750
Then why are you...

86
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,950
ignoring Mi So's calls?

87
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,420
Are you ashamed to take them?

88
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,520
That's because I'm busy.

89
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,260
No.

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,430
You know what you did wrong.

91
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,100
You're avoiding Mi So because
you know what a terrible thing you did.

92
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,410
You can't even visit her.

93
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,770
I have to get to class.

94
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,270
Bo Ram.

95
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,590
Why is CEO Min late today?

96
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,600
I don't know. I only heard she had plans.

97
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,800
I don't think it's a work thing.

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,630
But then,
she must have other things to do.

99
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,540
She shouldn't spend her peak working.

100
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,410
Who, Kyung Chae?

101
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,680
She's not like that.
She'll be working somewhere.

102
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
I bet...

103
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,150
she's the only CEO out there
who works like her life depends on it.

104
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,650
The CEO should lead by example
so the subordinates know what to do.

105
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,320
Should she slack off like you?

106
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,250
I don't slack off all the time.

107
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,320
Father. How about
I find Kyung Chae a boyfriend?

108
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,130
There should be a few good guys
I met at university.

109
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,100
- That's a great idea.
- Yes.

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,000
That would suit Kyung Chae
better than going to a matchmaker...

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
or a marriage agency.

112
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,070
She's the type
that wants to meet people naturally.

113
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,410
You don't know Kyung Chae at all.

114
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,140
She'll find her own partner
without your help.

115
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,580
Who knows, she might be
having some fun with a man right now.

116
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,880
What do you mean?

117
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,520
Do you know something?

118
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,550
I just think...

119
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,190
it's a possibility.

120
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,430
You're quite a strategist.

121
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,100
How did you think to get a stand-in?

122
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,770
Any other option would drag things on
and have too many variables.

123
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,440
Nothing is cleaner than closing the case.

124
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,910
I like the clean wrap-up.

125
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,280
That's enough about Ms. Se Ri.

126
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,390
Let's talk about us.

127
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,420
Talk about us?

128
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,160
Like what?

129
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,960
The new business?

130
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,090
There's more to our relationship...

131
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,660
than superior and subordinate.

132
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,730
Is that so?

133
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,100
Would we work as a couple,

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,030
a man and a woman?

135
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,800
A man and a woman?

136
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,340
I never thought about that.

137
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,140
It's time you started, then.

138
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,310
It would be quite worthwhile.

139
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,520
(Psychiatric Ward Admittance Consent Form)

140
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,790
(Name: Min Se Ri)

141
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,110
Is that a no?

142
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,450
(Min Se Ri)

143
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,020
(Min Se Ri)

144
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,580
Just don't push me away.

145
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,550
I'll come to you.

146
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,240
The person you called is unavailable.

147
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Connecting to voicemail.

148
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,880
This is my final goodbye.

149
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,450
I won't appear before you again,
Kyung Chae.

150
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Take care.

151
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,230
Hey.

152
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,070
Kiddo.

153
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,310
Kid.

154
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Kid!

155
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
Hey!

156
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,750
Wake up. What's wrong?

157
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,250
(Min Se Ri)

158
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,130
Don't call. I don't need a goodbye.

159
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,370
Hello?

160
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,740
Who's this?

161
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,740
Your sister is unconscious.

162
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,710
What?

163
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Se Ri!

164
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,350
Se Ri.

165
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,190
Oh, are you her family?

166
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
It looks like...

167
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,560
she overdosed on a sedative.

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,130
The doctors took care of it,
so she'll be fine. Don't worry.

169
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,570
She should be at a university hospital.

170
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,370
What would a place like this know?

171
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,870
Will you be responsible
if she were to die?

172
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,370
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

173
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,880
The doctor will be responsible
since he said she'd be fine.

174
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,110
Did I say that?

175
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,280
And even smaller clinics
can administer first aid.

176
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,080
You should've taken her to a big hospital!

177
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,960
Moon Tae Kyung?

178
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,930
Oh, right. We should've gone
to a big hospital.

179
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,360
How silly of me.
I'm sorry I didn't think of that.

180
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,000
But I think I did everything I should
as a passerby.

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
I called 911, brought her here,

182
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,940
and kept an eye on her.
What more should I have done?

183
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,540
My goodness.

184
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,770
Thank you.

185
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,240
Now you thank me? Just like that?

186
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,010
Here's an official apology.

187
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,180
I'm sorry for being so rude,
and thank you for your help.

188
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,290
Well...

189
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,190
You don't have to get so serious.

190
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,130
All is well. We should help others.

191
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,200
Bye, then.

192
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,870
Wait. Are you staying at
the hotel she was at?

193
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,400
Yes, I am.

194
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,340
I'll go now that she has family here.

195
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,190
You're awake.

196
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,130
Kyung Chae.

197
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,470
Were you here all night long?

198
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,300
Why did you take the pills?
Were you going to die?

199
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,870
I didn't try to kill myself.

200
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,610
I was scared.

201
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,250
That you'd really refuse to see me again.

202
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,270
Where's Father?

203
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,600
The chairman and Director Min left early.

204
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,340
You were out all night?

205
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,980
Can I have some tea too, please?

206
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,810
I'll get you a herbal tea.

207
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,850
Where did you stay?

208
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,580
No, where you stayed isn't important.

209
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,590
With whom?

210
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,060
Don't ask. That's a private matter.

211
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,560
You look a bit haggard.

212
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,760
You shouldn't work too hard.

213
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,460
There's no cure for workaholics.

214
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,730
Why try so hard when you have...

215
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,170
nowhere higher to climb?

216
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,570
There's no way she stayed up just to work.

217
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,010
- What else would she do?
- Don't you have a store to manage?

218
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,310
We're closed today. Did you really...

219
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,380
I'm sorry, but I'm really tired.

220
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,710
You're tired?

221
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,250
How come? Why?

222
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,750
What for?

223
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,760
Manager Gong, bring the tea to my room.

224
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,760
Let's go to our room.

225
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,860
That's weird.

226
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,470
Did you see the face she made?

227
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,370
There's no way it's an overnight thing.

228
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,080
I've never seen her this down
since I moved in here.

229
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,910
Right.

230
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,410
She's usually so full of energy.

231
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,250
Did the talisman work?

232
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,220
It can't be working already.

233
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,450
What else could it be?

234
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Is that it?

235
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Money's rolling in, rolling in like crazy.

236
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,960
It's rolling in endlessly
from all directions.

237
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,560
I'm attracting cash like a magnet.

238
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm absorbing cash like a black hole.

239
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,370
Anything and everything in the world
that looks like cash...

240
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,800
is rolling into my lap.

241
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,280
Cash... Money...

242
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,080
Does that chant even work?

243
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,580
You say it every single day.

244
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,020
You sound like a woodpecker
that sprained its neck pecking wood.

245
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,420
Yang Mal Sook, your worst attribute
is that you doubt everything.

246
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,790
You heard that chant until your ears bled.

247
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,790
I heard it too and my ears are bleeding.

248
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,460
And what did we get?

249
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,030
What do you see here? Cash.

250
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,830
We have cash and money.

251
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,470
Nothing's for free.

252
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,330
Even cup noodles
take three minutes to cook.

253
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,040
Gathering universal energy
will take more than just days.

254
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,940
I must say the chant thousands of times.

255
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,110
Cash... Money...

256
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,180
My dear sparkling daughter.

257
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,380
Dad. The talisman you gave us is amazing.

258
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,220
Why? Did something happen?

259
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,690
Kyung Chae came home totally down and out.

260
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,860
Didn't I tell you to trust me?

261
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,430
I said I'd make you a chairman's wife.

262
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,660
All you have to do is trust me
and prepare to be a chairman's wife.

263
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,330
Let's say the chant.

264
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,700
Cash... Money...

265
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Bye.

266
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,370
You're funny. You're cute
even when you stand there listening.

267
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,540
Don't feel embarrassed. Chant with me.

268
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,250
- Cash... Money...
- Cash... Money...

269
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,320
- Cash, money.
- Cash, money.

270
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,390
The person you called is unavailable.

271
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,360
Connecting to voicemail.

272
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,560
Wu Bo Ram. What are you up to?

273
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,300
Why can't I reach you?

274
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,600
I have some good news.

275
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,670
That girl, the psycho.

276
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,840
They found her, and she'll be punished.
Isn't that great?

277
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,680
What's wrong, Mom?

278
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,980
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

279
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,590
We weren't able to get her punished.

280
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,820
You said you did.

281
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,660
It was someone else.

282
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,830
They arrested some other girl.

283
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,730
I'll explain the details later.

284
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,300
Trust me for now...

285
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,330
and concentrate on getting better, okay?

286
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,170
I don't know what you're saying.

287
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,740
I promise.

288
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,450
I'll find her and punish her.

289
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,680
I won't let you feel disappointed...

290
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,950
in how the world works.

291
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,050
Bear with me.

292
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Goodness.

293
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,110
Not again.

294
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,710
Why are you back when the case is closed?

295
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,940
We should find the actual girl.

296
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,450
You know what I mean.

297
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,680
Stop being so stubborn.

298
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,150
Do you think we police are idiots?

299
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,390
She could pass for the culprit,
but it wasn't her.

300
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,390
I'll take over from here on out.

301
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,160
Give me the video evidence.

302
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,530
That was taken care of
after the case was closed.

303
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
It's gone.

304
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,700
Why are you like this?

305
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,770
The perpetrator confessed.

306
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,100
Then I want to cancel the report.

307
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,840
I won't report the assault.

308
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,810
I don't want to create an innocent victim.

309
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,580
Listen, lady.

310
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,550
Just because you want to take it back...

311
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,850
doesn't mean we can flip things
as we would a pancake.

312
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,990
Don't you know about double jeopardy?

313
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,490
Who on earth is the real culprit?

314
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,390
Why would you go this far?

315
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,090
I get it.

316
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,030
If you had to find a stand-in,

317
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,060
she must be from a great family.

318
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,330
Watch what you say.

319
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,340
That's just nonsense.

320
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,710
If you keep this up,

321
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,510
I'll take you in for obstruction.

322
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,550
(Investigative Team 1)

323
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,060
Excuse me. Where's the owner?

324
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,030
I bought and took over the cafe.

325
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,130
Where did the previous owner go?

326
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,600
I heard some company scouted him.

327
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,470
How did he go...

328
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,700
from selling coffee
to working at a conglomerate?

329
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,310
Mingang Distribution, was it?

330
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,980
Mingang Distribution?

331
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,810
Yes.

332
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,760
I'm back.

333
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,520
How is Mi So doing?

334
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,730
She's fine.

335
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,360
I see you were busy.

336
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,730
Yes. A group
of Mi So's classmates came by.

337
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,440
I feel bad for Mi So who has to do
without Bo Ram from now on.

338
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,870
What do you mean? What about Bo Ram?

339
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,810
The kids told me
that Bo Ram is switching schools.

340
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,680
Her family will move closer
to her dad's job.

341
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,910
- Bo Ram's dad is working?
- Yes.

342
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,720
I thought he'd retired early.

343
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,490
He just got a job somewhere else.

344
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,520
I wonder who he got to pull strings.

345
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,420
Which company?

346
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,060
It's Mingang Distribution, I think.

347
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,660
Mingang Distribution?

348
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,330
I heard some company scouted him.

349
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,500
How did he go...

350
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,340
from selling coffee
to working at a conglomerate?

351
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,600
Mingang Distribution, was it?

352
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,210
Is it really Mingang Distribution?

353
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,740
Yes. What's the matter?

354
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,310
Don't even ask.

355
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,320
She came to say the girl was a fake.

356
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,820
The case is closed, so it's over now.

357
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,250
Good job.

358
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,960
I'll wire the amount I promised.

359
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,290
Thanks a lot. Bye.

360
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,200
(Police Station)

361
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
You're back.

362
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,800
Will you come here every single day?

363
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,170
Was it Mingang Distribution?

364
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,440
They found the stand-in, bought
the witnesses, and destroyed the proof.

365
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,340
What are you talking about, lady?

366
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,510
Why did Bo Ram's dad
suddenly get a job there?

367
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,220
And what about the coffee shop owner?

368
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,290
How could that happen at the same time?

369
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,990
They have no other connection.

370
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,120
That's because...

371
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,120
How would I know?

372
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,690
Mingang Distribution is behind it,
isn't it?

373
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,260
You could get someone in serious trouble
if you keep repeating that.

374
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,600
Making fake statements...

375
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,600
and deleting the original video.

376
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
All that!

377
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,800
Mingang Distribution made them do it,
didn't they?

378
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,040
They did not!

379
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,540
Wait and see.

380
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,540
I'll reveal the truth.

381
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Lady.

382
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,550
Lady!

383
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,490
Darn it.

384
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,830
What should I do?

385
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,800
The victim's mother was here again.

386
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,600
She asked if Mingang Distribution
was behind it all.

387
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,000
She left saying she'd get to the truth.

388
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,970
How did she find that out?

389
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,470
I have no idea.

390
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,380
I don't know how she found out.

391
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,850
What should we do?

392
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,020
Even worms squirm
when they're stepped on too hard.

393
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,580
If she were to keep digging
and make things worse...

394
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,220
Then she's just a squirming worm.

395
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,220
She must've gotten lucky
to get the company name,

396
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,720
but that'll be about it.

397
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,130
The case is closed,

398
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,660
and with no evidence,
she can blame us all she wants...

399
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,100
and get sued for defamation.

400
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,100
Yeon Ah, do you think
there's a security camera back there?

401
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,610
The alley by the playground
on the way to the school.

402
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,440
I'm not sure.

403
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,580
People rarely go that way
because it's kind of run down.

404
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,780
Why do you want to know?

405
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,750
I just got back from the police station.

406
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,320
They arrested the girl who hurt Mi So.

407
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,790
What? Already?

408
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,350
That's great.

409
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,990
But there's a problem.

410
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,190
What problem?

411
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,030
What on earth did I just hear?

412
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,470
A fake culprit?

413
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,380
How could that be?

414
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,810
I'm not just worried about Mi So,
but about that girl too.

415
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,250
It was a revenge assault,

416
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,780
so even though she's a minor,
the penalty will be pretty hefty.

417
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,120
Are you saying you think
Mingang Distribution was behind it?

418
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,690
I bet it's someone pretty high up.

419
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,030
I guess, if they managed
to hire two random people.

420
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,000
Look up Mingang Distribution.

421
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,330
Okay.

422
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,570
Here we go.

423
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,610
Chairman Min Doo Sik,
daughter CEO Min Kyung Chae,

424
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,280
younger daughter Director Min Soo Jung.

425
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,850
His son is Home and Mart
General Manager Min Ji Seop.

426
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,150
He had another daughter later in life.

427
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,780
Later in life?

428
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,790
How old is she?

429
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,490
She was born in 2006,

430
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,290
so she's 16 now.

431
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,660
She's Mi So's age.

432
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,000
"The youngest daughter
was sent abroad to study at a young age,"

433
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,600
"and she's well-known
among the Korean expats."

434
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,440
"She switched schools many times..."

435
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,540
"after being involved in assault cases."

436
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,570
My gosh.

437
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,540
Mr. Jo!

438
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,110
Mr. Jo! Are you in?

439
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,580
Mr. Jo!

440
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Hey.

441
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,140
It's you again.

442
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,040
I said I'd make you pay if you returned.

443
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,740
Threaten me all you want.

444
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,780
I'll keep coming back.

445
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,840
Until you tell me the truth.

446
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,510
You don't fear threats?

447
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,580
Do you want me to get serious, then?

448
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,860
Get lost.

449
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,130
Do whatever you want.

450
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,130
If you think that will make me give up.

451
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,760
I'll do that, then.

452
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
Out here,

453
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,780
no one notices if someone goes missing.

454
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,650
If you have a death wish,

455
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,680
you've come to the right place.

456
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Do it.

457
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,690
Do you think I won't?

458
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,000
I will.

459
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,000
Sure.

460
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,800
Go ahead.

461
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,910
Slash my throat.

462
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,440
Do it once. Do it ten times!

463
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,480
Do it now!

464
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,420
What...

465
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,890
Darn you.

466
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,100
Mr. Jo.

467
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,570
This is the kind of person you are.

468
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,370
You could never harm someone.

469
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,080
And you...

470
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,480
fled the scene of an accident,

471
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,410
leaving two people to die?

472
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,120
I don't believe it.

473
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,580
I don't want to believe it.

474
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,520
Who was the real culprit?

475
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,860
Tell me the truth.

476
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,290
There is no other truth.

477
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,360
I killed your parents.

478
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,630
If you have the time to waste doing this,

479
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,700
concentrate on bettering your life.

480
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,690
(Searching for witnesses of an assault!)

481
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,530
Do you think this will work?

482
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,160
It happened a good while ago.

483
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,800
We must do something.

484
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,600
All I have is a suspicion,
but I can't do anything with that.

485
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,730
I need proof, however small.

486
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,000
I wish we could find
a witness or something.

487
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,410
People don't care about others
as much as they used to.

488
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,580
They turn a blind eye
because they don't want the hassle.

489
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,680
Let's trust in them, though.

490
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,920
Who can we trust if not others?

491
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,990
I think the rich ruin the world.

492
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,320
They try to solve everything with money.

493
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,990
First, they shouldn't commit a crime,

494
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,290
but if they did,
they should pay the price.

495
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,100
Stuff like this happens
because they try to get away with it.

496
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,370
You're right.

497
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,740
(Diner)

498
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,420
She chose an alley with no cameras.

499
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,600
Here, my Mi So...

500
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,370
Please help.

501
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,970
I'm looking for a witness. Take a look.

502
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,640
Please read this. I need a witness.

503
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,320
Hello. I'm looking for a witness.
Will you read this, please?

504
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,950
- No. Go away.
- Please, sir.

505
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,290
- Take a look.
- Fine.

506
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,590
I'm looking for a witness to an assault.

507
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,360
Please spread the word.

508
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,760
Please. Thank you.

509
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,300
Sorry for stopping you. Please help.

510
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,070
Can you take a look?

511
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,210
- Will you take a look?
- Leave me alone.

512
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,110
Give me a call.

513
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,150
Sir, will you take a look?

514
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,080
We're looking for a witness.

515
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,950
(Searching for witnesses of an assault!)

516
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,100
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

517
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,610
Shall we sign the contract?

518
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,880
I have a condition.

519
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,250
Company information
that only the family can access.

520
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,450
Share that with me.

521
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,380
I don't know how you managed to find him,

522
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,980
but do you think he'll be loyal to you?

523
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,590
Let's wait and find out.

524
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,320
Wait and see. Your father
will soon call you to the head office.

525
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,890
You won't come home?

526
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,130
I don't have to go to the US?

527
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,260
Mom will find her and punish her.

528
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,560
Hang in there.

529
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,730
I'll clean things up...

530
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,370
so the worst doesn't happen.

531
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,830
Who are you?
