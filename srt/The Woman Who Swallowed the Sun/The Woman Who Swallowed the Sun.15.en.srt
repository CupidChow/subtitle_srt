The wave of innovation
and change for our future.

00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,180
Who will create it?

00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,050
Mingang Distribution will!

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,920
Shall we cut the cake to celebrate?

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,960
Who says you can celebrate?

00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,610
My daughter's dead,
and you're celebrating?

00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,380
My daughter cries in her grave,
and you're smiling?

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,710
Bring her back.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,950
Bring my Mi So back to life!

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,990
Bring her back!

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,690
Get her off me!

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,960
Let go of me!

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,330
These people killed my daughter.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,700
My innocent daughter died for no reason!

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,640
Tell them what you did.

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,110
Tell them so the whole world knows!

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,310
Beg for my Mi So's forgiveness!

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,120
Beg and say you're sorry!

21
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,080
Bring back my daughter!

22
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,350
You should beg a thousand times!

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,060
Plead and beg!

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,930
Bring back my daughter!

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,730
I apologize.

26
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,530
Good days are often jinxed.

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll end my presentation...

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,200
and hand it over...

00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,540

31
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll take it from here.

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,190
Can you put up the next slide?

33
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,830
Let me go!

34
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,910
How dare you come here?

We're launching a new business
that could earn billions a year.

36

That's money you can never come across
in a dozen lifetimes combined.

That important event...

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,290
Who do you think
keeps this country moving?

39
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,160
Who do you think feeds people like you?

40
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,260
You ruined everything
when you should be grateful.

41
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,390
Because your daughter died?

42
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,900
How could you say that?

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,400
Don't mention her with your dirty lips!

44
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,600
You don't get it, do you?

45
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,540
What your daughter did.

46
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,710
It's disgusting and vulgar.

47
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,710
Why did you act out and make things worse?

48
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,020
You should've remembered your place
and let it go.

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,980
It was all a lie.

50
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,550
You people made up the fake news.

51
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,360
You framed innocent others to cover up...

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,590
what you'd done.

53
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,000
You people...

54
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,000
are the disgusting and vulgar ones.

55
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,630
You haven't yet learned your lesson.

56
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,410
Now, you get to see...

57
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,710
what happens to people like you...

58
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,640
who come after me when you have nothing.

59
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,050
The truth will hurt.

60
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,420
Do you think I'll let you off lightly?

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,850
I'm the one who won't let you off now.

62
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,560
I'll make you regret what you did today
for the rest of your life.

63
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,940
Let go of me!

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,380
What do you think you're doing?

68
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,150
Go on by unless you want a beating.

69
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,690
You can go on by...

70

Come with me.

74
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,710
Come on. Do you want to get dragged away?

75
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,980
Hurry.

76
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,030
Don't you recognize me?

77
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,200
I remember you.

78

Shall I take you home?

79
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,840
I want to see my daughter.

80
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,450

Mi So.

Mom's sorry.

84
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,950
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,460
I'm so sorry.

86
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,130
I feel so angry and upset.

87
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,890
How must you have felt?

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,300
I had no idea.

89
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,630
I was so powerless...

90
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,170
that I couldn't clear your name,

91
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,340
and I let you die with a heavy grudge.

92
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,780
You had such a useless mom.

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,710
I miss you.

94
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,980
I miss you so much.

95
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,950
Mi So.

96
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,890
I wish...

97
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,870
I wish I could see you just once.

98
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,670
If I could hold your hand...

99
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,040
and look into your eyes...

100
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,780
If only I could hold you once more.

101
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,460
What should I do now?

102
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,600
I don't think I can live without you.

103
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,030
I can't...

104
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,700
I just can't take another breath.

105
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,010
My poor baby...

What's wrong? Are you in pain?

112
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,650
You can't speak? Is that it?

113
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,820
Oh, no.

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,040
I don't even remember how the launch went.

117
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,940
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,280
I told you so many times
to clean it up properly.

119
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,040
I did as you said, as best I could.

120
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,910
And that still happened?

121
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,750
What if she comes back
a few years later to get revenge?

122
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,620
She looked pretty gutsy to me.

123
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,090
She's just a poor single mom.

124
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,860
That's the problem.

125
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,490
Her daughter was all she had,

126
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,790
and she lost her everything.

127
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,030
People who have nothing to lose
won't stop at anything.

128
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,340
I used to think like you in the past,
so I left some loose ends.

129
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,610
I thought he was just a poor orphan.

130
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,670
But...

131
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,510
Don't you be like me.

132
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,250
We can't accept any unforeseen variables,
whether in business or in life.

133
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,050
Everything must be under control.

134
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,920
I'll remember that.

135
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,820
Why? Do you think I'm too harsh?

136
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,830
No. You're right about everything.

137
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,200
While we lived our lives...

138
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,600
and grew the business,

139
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,240
they lived to get revenge.
How can you stop that?

140
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,940
We must nip it in the bud, then.

141
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,140
So they can't even dream
of getting revenge.

142
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,160

147
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,630
I'm pretty sure she said "Mi So."

What's your name?

149
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,540
Since we crossed paths like this,

150
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,040
can't we ask each other's names?

151
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,480
I'm Mi So's mom.

you incompetent fools another chance?

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,650
How dare you come in with your shoes on?

189
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,890
Call her right now!

190
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,760
As you can see, she left her phone behind.

191
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,860
Your sister caused a ruckus at my company.

192
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,730
She left a huge mess she can't pay for
by selling ten of these apartments.

193
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,230
What nonsense is that?

194
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,400
Sul Hee's not like that,
so get out right away.

195
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,140
I'll call the police if you don't.

196
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,110
I'd like that.
Let the police decide who's at fault.

197
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Your sister racked up a lot of charges.

198
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,880
Trespassing, property damage,

199
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,620
rampaging, and assault too!

200
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,120
What are you staring at? Call the police.

201
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,540
Won't it be dangerous to go home?

202
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,570
I have a bad feeling.

203
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,080
Look. I knew
something like this would happen.

204
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,920
Find her.

205
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,890
Fasten your seat belt.

206
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,610
Sit down.

207
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,250
Stay here with me for a while.

208
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,120
It'll be so uncomfortable...

209
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,690
if you can't speak.

210
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,090
It should be temporary,

211
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,660
but I think you should see a doctor.

212
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,000
I guess...

213
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,370
you wouldn't have the mind to get help.

214
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,540
They came by in person to find you,

215
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,880
so it looks like they're really annoyed.

216
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,280
Or should I say they're angry?

217
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,280
I'm worried that...

218
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,280
CEO Min Kyung Chae
is just as nasty as Chairman Min Doo Sik.

219
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,960
(Mingang Distribution)

220
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,590
If you don't have other plans,

221
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,660
go home and rest. You look tired.

222
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,470
I don't think
I can sleep even if I go home.

223
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,230
The launch was ruined,

224
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,140
and we lost her too.

225
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,270
What will you do once you find her?

226
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,780
Isn't it obvious?

227
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,240
If she did wrong, she must pay for it.

228
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,510
We can file criminal and civil charges,

229
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,920
but she'll get off on probation
or be fined...

230
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,050
if it's her first offense
and she shows remorse.

231
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,790
If she insists she lost reason
out of shock from losing her daughter,

232
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,520
she'll most likely get off lightly.

233
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,630
We must see to it that she doesn't!

234
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,760
I'll make her pay
for forgetting her place...

235
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,160
and harming Mingang's reputation.

236
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,900
She too has to learn that life isn't easy!

237
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,480
Listen to me carefully.

238
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,180
Mingang Distribution's CEO Min Kyung Chae.

239
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,820
Knowing what she's like,
she won't let this go.

240
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,260
I don't care.

241
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
But then,

242
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,560
you must fear nothing right now.

243
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,000
You don't care. You lost a child.

244
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,240
This is my son.

245
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,020
He's dead.

246
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,890
That's why I'm like this.

247
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,290
"Stay strong. You'll smile one day."

248
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,490
That's all nonsense.

249
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,960
No day is a good day...

250
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,170
for a mom who lost a child.

251
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,340
Every day is torment, whether you live...

252
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,170
for one century or ten.

253
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,710
How did you get through the torment?

254
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,080
Or are you still going through it?

255
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,150
I'm no longer tormented.

256
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,360
I'm not in paradise either.

257
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,300
What I did and how I got through all that.

258
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,730
Do you want to know?

259
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,720
Welcome home.

260
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,050
- Hi, sister.
- Can you run me a bath?

261
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,320
Yes. Have some ssanghwa tea first.
I'll make you a cup.

262
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,020
Thanks.

263
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,660
Kyung Chae. Did you hire my assistant?

264
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,130
I'm still looking.

265
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,800
Still? It's getting annoying.
You mentioned it long ago.

266
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,770
Wait. I was busy.

267
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,770
I'll find you someone. Keep quiet.

268
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,070
You tell me to keep quiet
if you have nothing else to say.

269
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,280
Hey. You shouldn't be like that.

270
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,950
I might be a pathetic brother,
but even a neighbor's dog gets a hi.

271
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,920
I'm tired. I don't know what you want,
but it'll have to wait.

272
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,820
You don't know what I want?

273
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,920
How can you not know?

274
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,090
She gets ruder by the day.

275
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,600
Ji Seop.
She's not in her right mind today.

276
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,570
Someone grabbed her by the hair
during the launch.

277
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,300
What? What are you talking about?

278
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,670
Something happened.

279
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,910
What happened? Finish the story!

280
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,810
Darn it.

281
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,250
She tossed me just enough
to get me worked up.

282
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,450
What happened?

283
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,460
It was so crazy.
It was worse than a civil war.

284
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,160
I wanted to take a video.

285
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,390
Someone really pulled Kyung Chae's hair?

286
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,260
It was a sight.

287
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,800
The video would've gotten
tens of millions of views.

288
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,770
I'll give you a blow-by-blow account.
Let's talk another time.

289
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,170
Okay, bye.

290
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,510
Something crazy goes on
in that house every single day.

291
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,210
You reap what you sow.

292
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,210
How dare they not invite me?

293
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,750
People who discriminate
end up paying somehow.

294
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,690
I guess the chairman
upsets people at every turn.

295
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,860
I'm surprised his business didn't flop.

296
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,490
Why are you barking like a cat?

297
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,730
He might be a horrible man,
but he's a great businessman.

298
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,600
You don't know what you're saying.

299
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,300
These days,
you can't run a business if you're horrid.

300
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,940
Stop saying stuff that
would make a hippo rip his underwear...

301
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,870
and pray that Mingang flourishes
for our Ja Kyung's sake.

302
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,150
My dad said it was hard to believe.

303
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,280
So that's why she was so frigid.

304
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,550
Kyung Chae's really something.

305
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,850
How can she act as if nothing happened
after something like that?

306
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,060
That's just her poker face.
She's human too. She'd be embarrassed.

307
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,430
She would've looked so bad...

308
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,300
in front of all those people.

309
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,160
That's why men should be in charge.

310
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,100
I'd have gotten things
under control right away.

311
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,940
I wonder...

312
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,600
who grabbed Kyung Chae by the hair.

313
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,710
Hello, Ms. Min.

314
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,850
Still nothing?

315
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,150
There's no movement.

316
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,550
Keep watching.
She has to come by at least once.

317
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,450
You know what happens
if you mess up again, right?

318
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,490
I do.

319
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,290
Ms. Min.

320
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,030
Can we use
some physical force in the process?

321
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
You must resort to violence if need be.

322
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,730
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

323
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,040
Why are you going this far?

324
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
Why shouldn't I?

325
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,410
What could she possibly do?

326
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,180
She already did something.

327
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,920
How can you say that
after seeing how the launch went?

328
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,590
Get Director Moon.

329
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,650
You can run things by me before...

330
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,320
Get Director Moon.

331
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,760
Director Moon.

332
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,500
The CEO wants to see you.

333
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,270
Okay.

334
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,300
Oh, right.

335
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,070
About...

336
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,270
the incident at the launch.

337
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,580
Can you tell me what it was about?

338
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,110
It was just a small happening.

339
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,910
"A happening?"

340
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,320
That's not what it looked like to me.

341
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,850
Who would do that at an important event?

342
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,290
Unless they had
some huge grudge against Mingang.

343
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,390
What are you saying?

344
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,660
I'm saying I'd like to know
what the CEO did to her...

345
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,260
that was so bad.

346
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,330
Director Moon.

347
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,700
Aren't you one of us now?

348
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,440
You were offered a fortune,
so instead of getting curious,

349
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,040
shouldn't you prove your worth?

350
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,210
I can take care of my own business.

351
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,820
I'm sorry to say
my team hasn't yet been put together,

352
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,080
so I can't work yet.

353
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,720
Bye, then.

354
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,260
That arrogant punk.

355
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,840
You're on standby
until the team is finalized.

356
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,740
I understand.

357
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,210
Will you stay at the hotel?

358
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,640
I should move soon.

359
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,110
Give us the address when you do.

360
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,640
You can call it a day.

361
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,050
Okay.

362
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,850
I don't know the details,

363
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,950
but the woman at the launch.

364
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,660
Don't you think
it would be best if you tried...

365
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,230
to gain her understanding or forgiveness?

366
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,400
I think that would be ideal,
both for you...

367
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,100
and for Mingang.

368
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,300
Was I out of line?

369
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,240
I believe every result has a cause.

370
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,110
Nothing bad would've happened
if she'd managed her life properly.

371
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,510
I don't think it's right...

372
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,080
to live and die irresponsibly,
then demand we pay for it.

373
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,150
Do you really think so?

374
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,690
You got something very wrong.

375
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,490
Forgiveness is what
the powerful give the powerless.

376
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,700
What do I do?

377
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,970
What if they harmed Yeon Ah?

378
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,240
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

379
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,320
I forgot to give this to him.

380
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,840
Wait!

381
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,650
It is you.

382
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,420
Don't you remember me?

383
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,520
The scooter accident.

384
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,090
You looked after me.

385
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,260
How have you been? I'd been wondering.

386
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,270
At Mingang Distribution's
new business launch.

387
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,570
That was you, wasn't it?

388
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,940
I heard you say "Mi So."

389
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,050
Did something happen to her?

390
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,190
How could that be?

391
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,020
Does it involve Chairman Min's family?

392
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,730
Yes. I thought so.

393
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,370
You wouldn't ruin
an event like that for no reason.

394
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,940
Why are you here and not at home?

395
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,010
Are you...

396
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,180
hiding from CEO Min?

397
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,060
Why won't you speak?

398
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,730
What's wrong?

399
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,800
You can't speak?

400
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,740
My gosh...

401
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,350
I know the Min family better than anyone.

402
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,080
They won't let this go.

403
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,650
They make sure
to return more than what they receive.

404
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,830
Mr. Moon.

405
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,330
It's CEO Min.

406
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,840
What are you doing here?

407
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,500
I brought the resumes
and performance reviews...

408
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,610
of the people who might join your team.

409
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,870
To help when you're assigning tasks.

410
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,180
Oh, I see.

411
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,550
Why didn't you send someone else?

412
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,090
Why don't we have some tea?

413
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,290
Come with me.

414
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,790
Hey, you. Wait.

415
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,600
Turn around.

416
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,160
Let's see your face.

417
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,770
Turn around.

418
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,540
Why can't you show me your face?

419
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,010
I didn't know you were here.

420
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,480
The little rat managed to hide.

421
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,580
Hey, you. Baek Sul Hee!

422
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,730
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

423
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,880
If you lost money or your honor,

424
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,050
you can put that behind you.

425
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,580
You can't do that with a lost child.

426
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,780
I'll see them and bring an end to it.

427
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,050
I can't just let it go.

428
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,950
The kid you beat up
because you were in a foul mood.

429
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,860
She's dead. That's how angry she was.

430
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,760
Koreans are so emotional.
They can't stand to watch someone suffer.

431
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,160
It's not the truth that matters.

432
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,000
It's about how you use the public.

433
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,970
I have a feeling we could join forces.

434
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,930
Will you come with me?
