00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,160
Chairman!

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,260
Chairman.

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,770
Oh, gosh...

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,030
Here.

6
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,410
Are you all right?
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,780
I'm fine.

8
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,780
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

9
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,290
Oh, dear.

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,960
Why don't you go see Dr. Kim?
I'll take you there.

11
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,430
No, I'm telling you, there's no need.
I'll be fine with some rest.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,230
By the way, what brings you here?

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,900
Seriously...

14
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,670
What in the world is going on?

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,640
My heart started racing,
and I got anxious.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,040
I came here on a hunch.

17
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,010
Who knew I'd find you like this?

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,710
Without me, you could've collapsed,
and no one would've even known.

19
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,920
Chairman, if you keep this up,
something terrible could happen.

20
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,520
Just come home with me.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,960
You need to rest.

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,360
Please, Chairman.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,640
(Episode 70)

24
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,270
Hey!

25
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,180
And you call yourself my friend?

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,210
What are you talking about?
I was busy, and you're making no sense.

27
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,480
Hey, Kim Sun Jae!
How could you do this to me?

28
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,550
If you want to marry Kyung Chae,
you can't be treating me like this.

29
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,750
Don't you know who I am?

30
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm Kyung Chae's brother.

31
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,160
- Keep this up, and I'm leaving.
- The chairman's will!

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
If you'd shown me sooner,
this would've been avoidable.

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,530
I would've come up with a plan
or something!

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,470
What are you on about now?
What about the chairman's will?

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
You're going to play dumb to the very end,
aren't you?

36
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,570
Fine, forget it.

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,380
Fine. Keep sucking up to my father.

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
See how well that serves you.

39
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,680
Get out of my way!

40
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,620
What in the world was that about?

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Vice Director Min.

42
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,560
You've been away from your desk all day.
What on earth have you been doing?

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,900
- That's not the problem right now.
- Then what is?

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,900
You wouldn't understand this feeling,
would you, Director Moon?

45
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,710
That feeling when you think
something's yours, but it isn't. No.

46
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,640
it was mine at first, but now it's not.

47
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,580
What in the world are you talking about?

48
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,680
You're lucky you don't have siblings
to fight with over an inheritance.

49
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,950
Excuse me?

50
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,290
Be even happier you don't have a father
to fight for your inheritance.

51
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,290
Stop the nonsense and show me the proposal
that was due today.

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Director Moon!

53
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,970
- Yes!
- I can't work today.

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,470
There's no way I can work
feeling like this.

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Darn it!

56
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,370
What's wrong with him?

57
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,410
Gosh!

58
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,380
How are you home at this hour?

59
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,750
The chairman is unwell.
Don't let anyone in his room.

60
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,360
Especially his son.
He's absolutely not allowed in.

61
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,120
This way, Chairman.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,100
Wait, why isn't my husband allowed in?
What did he do wrong?

63
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,770
What's gotten into them all of a sudden?

64
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,280
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

65
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,210
So in the end,

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,350
you handled him
just like you always do, Father.

67
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,880
I will never forgive you.

68
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,150
Whatever happens from now on...

69
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,420
is on you, Father.

70
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,730
(Mingang Distribution)

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,470
From now on, I'm going to start managing
the board members.

72
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,570
Especially Director Kim Jin Chul.

73
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,240
Apparently, his son got into some trouble
in the US.

74
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,340
Team up with a local lawyer
and get the charges dropped.

75
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,680
As for Director Jung Woo Sik,
bury his daughter's admission scandal.

76
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,410
And for Director Cheon Myung Tae,

77
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,080
find a solution
for his greenbelt land issue.

78
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,780
Why all of a sudden?

79
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,420
When have I ever done things differently?

80
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,390
In exchange,

81
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,860
you need to ensure that in an emergency,
their shares in Mingang Distribution...

82
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,330
are transferred to me.
Make those terms perfectly clear.

83
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,460
Why are you suddenly consolidating
Mingang Distribution shares?

84
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,400
Because I think it's time.

85
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,270
Time for what?

86
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,970
It's time I started preparing
to become the chairman.

87
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,570
Wait, then what about the chairman?

88
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,040
A generational shift.

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,250
At any other company,
it would have happened ages ago.

90
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,650
If anything, it's overdue.

91
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,130
The back of your head.

92
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,900
What? Goodness.

93
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,070
No, you've got a full head of hair now.
What are you doing here?

94
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,640
- Sir, what brings you here?
- I asked you first.

95
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,640
You've no business at Mingang Distribution
at this hour.

96
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,410
So, what brings you here?

97
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Well,

98
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,820
the truth is, I work for this company.

99
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,420
Really? My goodness!

100
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,020
Why didn't you say anything?

101
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,920
I thought you were at some tiny company.
I was completely in the dark.

102
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,630
Seriously, why the secrecy?

103
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,630
I wasn't trying to be secretive,
it's just that...

104
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,100
Oh, my, look who it is.

105
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,760
Hello, sir.

106
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,670
Ms. Stella.

107
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,940
Again and again.

108
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,840
And again!

109
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,850
We meet again.
We meet again, my dear lady.

110
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,420
Ms. Stella, to what do I owe the pleasure?

111
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,120
I'm a non-executive director,
so I'm here for a meeting. And you, sir?

112
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,550
For a meeting as well.

113
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,660
Ms. Stella. I have followed your lead...

114
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,560
and become a non-executive director
for Mingang Distribution.

115
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,530
Is that so? How wonderful.

116
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,900
- It seems we'll see each other often.
- Indeed, we will.

117
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,470
Why does fate refuse to leave us alone
and insist on bringing us together?

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,940
Such a meddlesome fate.

119
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,440
What if we grow fond of each other?
You know how people are.

120
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,150
The more you see them, the more you care.

121
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,080
Oh, dear. If I end up falling for you,

122
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,920
- that would be a problem.
- Don't see it as a problem!

123
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,420
If you fall for me, then just give in.
I'll make sure you can never escape.

124
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,060
Can we control our hearts?
The heart wants what it wants.

125
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,830
- From now on, you and I, Ms. Stella...
- Please, call me Stella.

126
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,470
And in return, I'll call you Pan Sool.

127
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Pan Sool.

128
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,480
Pan Sool...

129
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,510
That's the first time in my life
anyone's ever called me that. Pan Sool.

130
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,110
Stella. Tella.

131
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,520
After the meeting, how about you and I
get a bitter coffee and make it sweet?

132
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,320
I'd love to, but I have stocks
to sell before the close.

133
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,690
Maybe next time.

134
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,730
Tella!

135
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,500
S...

136
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Stella!

137
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,630
Stella!

138
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,600
S...

139
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Stella.

140
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,710
- Oh, dear.
- Chairman, I told you I would escort you.

141
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,080
You don't know what this meeting's for.
I'll be right back.

142
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,290
Do you really have to meet them today?
You're not feeling well.

143
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,090
Whatever it is, I'm sure it can wait.

144
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,160
It's a prior engagement.
I can't postpone it.

145
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
I'll be back.

146
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,570
I've told you to stop worrying so much.

147
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,710
Keep this up,
and you'll be in serious trouble.

148
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,510
Your brain scans.
If they get even a little bit worse,

149
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,780
they'll be identical
to a dementia patient's.

150
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,680
Are you saying I'm going to get dementia?

151
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,250
Who can say for sure? Only the sky knows.

152
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,890
I'm just saying you need to be careful.

153
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,760
Dementia doesn't exactly announce
its arrival.

154
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,160
You don't want to end up like Chairman Mo
of Inam Construction.

155
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,230
I heard Chairman Mo became like a toddler,
who can't even use the bathroom.

156
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,270
Perhaps because he was always so healthy,
the symptoms progressed so quickly.

157
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,740
His biggest regret must be...

158
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,680
not deciding which child to leave
the company to while he was still lucid.

159
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,280
Exactly. People like us
must decide on a successor in advance.

160
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,480
Aren't you leaving Mingang Distribution...

161
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,250
to your eldest daughter?

162
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,260
(Mingang Distribution)

163
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,490
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

164
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,800
If it's what I need to become chairman,

165
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,170
are you willing to give me
your shares in Mingang Distribution?

166
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,510
Why the silence?

167
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,640
That's not how you make a deal.

168
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,380
Shouldn't we feel out
each other's terms first?

169
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,320
Just what I'd expect from you, Lawyer Kim.

170
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,820
You're right.
I suppose we should align our terms first.

171
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,730
Oh, right.

172
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,660
By the way, about that painting...

173
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,630
- Who delivered it?
- Director Moon Tae Kyung.

174
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,000
He picked it up in the lobby
and brought it up.

175
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,550
Chairman, you're in such bad shape,
something could happen at any moment.

176
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,150
And your unexplained headaches.
They could be from your brain surgery.

177
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,830
I keep telling you, dementia is
not just somebody else's problem.

178
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,630
Dementia can be a side effect
of brain surgery.

179
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,270
Should I hand over the chairmanship
to Kyung Chae?

180
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,900
Then again,

181
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,170
she is the most qualified candidate
among them.

182
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,310
But why do I have this nagging feeling
in the back of my mind?

183
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,320
Here's some warm herbal tea.

184
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,760
Where's my wife?

185
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,420
She's in Ms. Jung's room.

186
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,360
They get along well, don't they?

187
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,360
Get along well? That's an understatement.
They're inseparable.

188
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,370
If I were to step down,

189
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,270
who do you think
should take over as chairman?

190
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,940
Wouldn't it be Ms. Kyung Chae?

191
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,040
I thought that was your plan all along.

192
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,310
That was the plan,

193
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,950
but after what she did to Soo Jung's mom,
it's been weighing on my mind.

194
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,350
Once she becomes the chairman,

195
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,550
she might get rid of Soo Jung
and her half-wit older brother...

196
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,190
in the same way.

197
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,260
Surely she wouldn't.

198
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,860
She'll purge anyone
who falls out of her favor.

199
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,560
At that rate, it's only a matter of time
before the entire Min Family is destroyed.

200
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,700
But Ms. Kyung Chae is the one
who's most like you, Chairman.

201
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,840
- That's what you always liked about her.
- It's true. I did.

202
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,840
But now,

203
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,170
that's the very reason it bothers me.

204
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,180
- Is that what Father is saying?
- Yes.

205
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,650
He said that based on what you did
to Ms. Soo Jung's birth mother.

206
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,120
He's afraid you'll deal with others
in the same way.

207
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,650
I understand.

208
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,960
Who do you think I learned that from?

209
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,760
You're the one who taught me, Chairman.

210
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,500
For you to get cold feet now is a problem.

211
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
Oh, gosh.

212
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,810
You're not a three-year-old. Don't cheat.

213
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,910
- He's here.
- Oh, he's here.

214
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,110
Come on in.

215
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,020
I prepared something special
as thanks for your help the other day.

216
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,850
Goodness, all this chicken?

217
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,620
Thank you, sir. I can't wait to dig in.

218
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,020
This looks absolutely delicious.

219
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,790
This isn't just any chicken.
Go on, have a bite.

220
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,530
Here you go.

221
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,900
Oh, thanks.

222
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,630
You'll see this is no ordinary chicken.

223
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
It starts in the heart,

224
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,440
goes through the mouth,
and hits the brain.

225
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,650
Gosh.

226
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,120
This is so delicious.
The texture is incredible too.

227
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,390
I know, right?
The chicken is spicy with a bit of a kick.

228
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,820
It's doing the samba twist on my tongue.
Samba!

229
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,930
Go on. Keep it up. Go on all night.

230
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,990
Samba!

231
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,560
All right, let me try some.

232
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,630
My goodness.

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,270
It's like my dopamine ran away from home,
and now it's rushing back home.

234
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,070
- I feel a samba coming on too.
- Samba!

235
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,110
Samba! Wait, get the cold rice.

236
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,950
- I bet it'll be the perfect combination.
- Cold rice?

237
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,220
Oh, chicken and rice!
I'll be right back with it.

238
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,150
- Bring the green onion kimchi too!
- You got it. Samba!

239
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,190
Actually, I was waiting for you.
There's something I wanted to ask.

240
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,530
It's about that Ms. S.

241
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,100
Ms. S?

242
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,900
I mean Stella Jang.
I heard her mention an evening market.

243
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,740
- Is she involved in that sort of thing?
- Oh, you mean Ms. Jang?

244
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,480
Ms. Jang is known as a stock market whale
because of her aggressive investing.

245
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,650
And I understand she's made a fortune.

246
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,180
What? She's got the looks and the brains,

247
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,990
and she's rich too?
We're a match made in heaven!

248
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,150
Samba!

249
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,010
Yes, it's me, Ms. Jang.

250
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,110
I've already mentioned you to him.

251
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,310
He's absolutely obsessed with money,
so he seems interested.

252
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,550
Excellent.
From now on, Mr. Moon, you need to...

253
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,790
keep planting ideas in Oh Pan Sool's head.

254
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,090
The thing about investing is
you sink all your cash into it,

255
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,260
and when that doesn't work, the next step
is to sell off your real estate.

256
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,860
If he keeps this up, he'll have to sell
his shares in Mingang Distribution.

257
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,370
And if we can get our hands
on those shares,

258
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,970
we can stop CEO Min
from becoming the next chairman, correct?

259
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,110
Exactly.
And if we add your stock options...

260
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,250
Still, the deciding factor is
how much Lucia...

261
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,550
can manage to get
from Chairman Min Doo Sik.

262
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,650
To get Chairman Min Doo Sik
to hand his shares over to Lucia...

263
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,150
Well, that's not going to be easy.

264
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,720
Is anything about this easy?

265
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,490
What if she gets hurt in the process?

266
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,200
You're only worried about Lucia,
aren't you, Mr. Moon?

267
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,270
Don't worry. That's not going to happen.

268
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,190
You should establish a succession plan
in advance.

269
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,560
It's not like you'll be
in that position forever, Chairman.

270
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,370
He's right.

271
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,070
It's not like I'm going to live forever.

272
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,480
How can you sleep at a time like this?

273
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,990
According to your father's will,
you and I are about to be flat broke.

274
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,160
I don't even want to talk about it.
The more I think, the angrier I get.

275
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,300
When you called,
I felt like the sky was falling.

276
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,570
Don't just sit there. Why don't you
go talk it over with Kyung Chae?

277
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,640
What good has she ever done for me?

278
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,510
- Then what about Soo Jung?
- You think she's any different?

279
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,750
For now, we must fiercely protect
your shares, mine, and Father-in-law's.

280
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,450
As long as we have our shares,
Kyung Chae and Soo Jung can't touch me.

281
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,520
Whoever wants to be chairman
will have to come to us for help anyway.

282
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,890
How can you not even think about becoming
the chairman yourself?

283
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,830
What do you want me to do?
Look at the situation we're in.

284
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,170
Whoever wants to become chairman
will send an SOS for the shares.

285
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,570
So tell your father to hold on tight
to his shares.

286
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,750
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

287
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,780
Good morning, Mr. Moon.

288
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,790
What is it now?

289
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,460
Getting so defensive over
a simple greeting between colleagues.

290
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,190
Since when were we on terms to be
greeting each other?

291
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,560
Look, Director Moon.

292
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,630
There's something I'm curious about.

293
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,600
Would you mind giving me
a straight answer?

294
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,200
What is it you're so curious about?

295
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,780
You're smart, so give it some thought.
See if my hypothesis is correct.

296
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,710
You know, about the CEO's portrait.

297
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,550
You see, I saw that painting once
at Ms. Jang's hotel.

298
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,420
- And?
- But now, it's in the CEO's Office.

299
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,790
I looked into it,
and the artist is already deceased.

300
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,930
Normally, posthumous works are kept
by the family.

301
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,530
Which would mean Ms. Jang...

302
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,300
could be part of
the artist's surviving family.

303
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,670
Stop spinning tales so early
in the morning.

304
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,210
It's boring, uninspired, and pointless.

305
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,180
Anyone can tell it's a third-rate story.

306
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,210
And what adds credibility
to this "third-rate story..."

307
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,650
is you, Moon Tae Kyung.

308
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,990
The one who put the painting
in the CEO's Office.

309
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,920
If you did it at Ms. Jang's request,

310
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,620
then that's proof you two are one team.

311
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,510
Kim Sun Jae is getting dangerously close
to the truth about you and your son.

312
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,040
He can't do anything right now
without proof,

313
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,280
- but you should be careful.
- All right.

314
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,550
Gosh, that Kim Sun Jae.
Annoying, repulsive, and good-for-nothing.

315
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,460
Now I see why Min Kyung Chae
doesn't think of him as a man.

316
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,160
In any case, with things as they are,
we can't just sit back and do nothing.

317
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,500
Hello.

318
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,670
Am I speaking with Chairman Min's wife?

319
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,710
Yes, speaking.

320
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,910
- May I ask who's calling?
- This is Doctor Kim.

321
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,950
The chairman came in for a consultation
a while ago.

322
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,120
I'm calling
because I thought you might be worried.

323
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,320
The chairman did?

324
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,150
You didn't know?

325
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,860
The fact that he kept quiet
about his hospital visit...

326
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,930
means he didn't want
the results to get out.

327
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,960
It must be serious enough
for him to hide it.

328
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,000
What's certain is
that Chairman Min is going to start...

329
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,500
seriously considering who he'll name
as his successor.

330
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,870
Min Kyung Chae was the frontrunner,

331
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,470
but this means
he's having second thoughts.

332
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,910
I think Min Kyung Chae disappointed him
over the Min Soo Jung incident.

333
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,980
She'd thrown her sister's birth mom
into a place like that and let her die.

334
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,720
That would weigh on my conscience too.

335
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,550
He trusted her the most among his kids
because she was so much like him.

336
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,390
But now,
it seems he's having reservations.

337
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,360
That's how it is
with your own flesh and blood.

338
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,630
He's seen how Min Kyung Chae treats people
who cross her,

339
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,470
and he's reluctant
to put someone like that in his seat.

340
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,870
He probably thinks
Min Ji Seop and Min Soo Jung...

341
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,540
could be dealt with the same way.

342
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,980
No father wants to see his own children
at each other's throats.

343
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,650
(Mingang Distribution)

344
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,650
Ji Seop, what are these documents?

345
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,520
Oh, they are...

346
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,060
You should take a good look, even now.
See which of your kids is truly capable.

347
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,460
Ji Seop, why do you always do this?

348
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,200
Didn't I tell you to report
to my office first?

349
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,170
- No, I was just...
- How many times do I have to tell you?

350
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,140
Please earn your keep.

351
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,980
She's capable, but she's too aggressive.

352
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,910
She walks all over her own older brother.

353
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,320
Ji Seop, that thing I mentioned last time.

354
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,690
Oh, here it is.

355
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,560
These must go to the CEO's office first.

356
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,690
I need it, so I get it first.

357
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,800
Gosh, then Kyung Chae
is going to chew me out again...

358
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,130
She's just like her older sister.
Good grief.

359
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,700
And him? Don't even get me started.

360
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
Are you okay?

361
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,610
Yes.

362
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,110
- The documents should be fine.
- No, not the documents. Are you okay?

363
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,790
Your children are an option,
but do you have to pick one of them?

364
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,990
Someone who is capable and compassionate,

365
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,560
and who won't betray you, Chairman.
Choosing someone like that would be wise.

366
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,270
Is he talking about Lucia?

367
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,250
What are you so deep in thought about?

368
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,450
Oh, it's nothing. Nothing at all.

369
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,820
You really brighten up
the Chairman's Office.

370
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,720
I told you I'm in charge of the flowers,
didn't I?

371
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,660
Don't let anyone else touch them.

372
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,060
All right, I won't.

373
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,990
Did you come all this way just for that?

374
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,000
This and that.
I was also worried about you.

375
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,900
I'm telling you, I'm fine now.

376
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,600
There's nothing to worry about.

377
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,390
It's time for dinner.

378
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,790
Right.

379
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,130
Go get Ji Seop.

380
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,000
He says he doesn't have an appetite.

381
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,270
Tell him to get down here, no matter what.
It's an order from his father.

382
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,410
And bring Soo Jung as well.

383
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,490
Honey, your father's asking for you.

384
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,460
I said I'm not eating.

385
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,230
I know I'm spineless, but how can I
eat at the same table as him?

386
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,370
The man doesn't even treat me like a son.

387
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,210
After seeing his will,
I can't even see him as a father anymore.

388
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,910
Come on, at least pretend to eat.
Your father is in a terrible mood.

389
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,850
No.
Eating with him will just make me sick.

390
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,520
Even if you throw up later,
just eat something for now. Okay?

391
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,520
What can we do about the will?
It's out of our hands.

392
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,460
I'm telling you, your father is
in a really bad mood.

393
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,900
- Come on, let's go. Now!
- I really don't want to.

394
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,700
I already told you. I can't eat
at the same table as Min Kyung Chae.

395
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,270
How long are you going to keep this up?
Enough is enough.

396
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,740
Are you just going to avoid her
for the rest of your life?

397
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,240
Yes, that's the plan.

398
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,480
Oh, so you're on Min Kyung Chae's side,
aren't you?

399
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,180
Then we have nothing more to talk about.

400
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,220
Whether you come down is your decision.

401
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,160
But the chairman doesn't seem
to be in a good mood right now.

402
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,460
If I go down by myself,
I can't promise you what will happen next.

403
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,330
Have you all forgotten we're supposed
to eat at least one meal together a day?

404
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,470
Why didn't you guys come?

405
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,040
Am I a joke to you?

406
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,380
Is your headache back?

407
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,380
You people are just too much.

408
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,590
Why make things so hard for the chairman?

409
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,850
Do you know how much stress he's under?

410
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,820
What if something happens to him?
Will you take responsibility then?

411
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,500
Are you in a lot of pain?
Should I get your medicine?

412
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,900
It'll pass.

413
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Chairman?

414
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,540
This isn't good. Let's get you up.
Go to your room and rest.

415
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,450
Chairman!

416
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,420
What are you all doing? Call 911!

417
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,990
Chairman!

418
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
What's all the commotion?

419
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,050
Did something happen?

420
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,420
Chairman,

421
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,650
are you all right?

422
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,220
Why? Is something wrong?

423
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,560
A moment ago,
you were suffering from a headache.

424
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,260
A headache? What headache?

425
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,730
My head's never been clearer.
I feel great.

426
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
What are you all waiting for?

427
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,930
Hurry up and eat.

428
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Okay?

429
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,140
I said, let's eat.

430
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,980
Gosh, this hits the spot.
This cod stew is excellent.

431
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
Right?

432
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,950
I told you to eat.

433
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,900
What's the matter, Chairman?

434
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,370
Who do you think I am?
How dare you serve me this?

435
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,210
Darn it.

436
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,310
This filth.

437
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,750
You all can eat this trash!

438
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,820
You all can eat this trash!

439
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,890
Eat this trash!

440
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,720
- Eat this trash!
- Oh my!

441
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,160
You expect me to eat this trash?

442
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,530
You vile creatures, eat it all!

443
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,260
Eat it all!

444
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,400
You all eat it!

445
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,220
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

446
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,270
Why is he acting like that?
Anyone can see it's dementia.

447
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,970
Does he really have dementia?

448
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,040
If he really has dementia,
then the whole plan is off.

449
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,050
After all we've done to get here,
you're telling me it just ends like this?

450
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,520
What if he has an ulterior motive?

451
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,620
That's what it's like to be a parent.
You're relieved they take after you,

452
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,290
but it's also horrifying.

453
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,990
Father, if keep this up, you're of no use.

454
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,030
You know what happens then, don't you?

455
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,800
