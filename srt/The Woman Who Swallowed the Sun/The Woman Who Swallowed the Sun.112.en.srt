1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,610
Die!

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,580
A person like you doesn't
deserve to live. Die!

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,880
And give you the satisfaction?
Why should I die?

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,850
My son... Why did you do that to my Ho Se?

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,090
Why? Just why?

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,690
He should've known better than to reach
for something he couldn't have.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,500
Was some poor artist ever going
to be good enough for my Kyung Chae?

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,770
He should have known his place!

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,570
How dare you say that!

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,640
You really think you can take me down?

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,210
I don't regret a thing I did.

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,080
If I had to do it all over again,
I'd do the same exact thing.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,350
Your son?

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,450
He'd die by my hands all over again!

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,130
You jerk! Just die!

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,290
Madam Jang!

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,230
Please stop!

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,070
- You have to stop!
- Let go of me!

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,640
This makes you no better
than he is, Madam Jang.

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,310
Why can't you see that
fighting fire with fire isn't the answer?

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,810
This is all that monster's fault!

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,280
This is all Min Doo Sik's karma!

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,780
That's why what happened
to Se Ri and Mi So happened!

24
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,990
Tae Kyung, don't try to stop me!

25
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,090
Don't stop me! You, of all people,
should understand how I feel.

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,690
- Die!
- Madam Jang.

27
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,030
Madam Jang!

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,970
I know. But please don't do this.

29
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,240
For your son's sake, you can't do this.

30
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,040
His mother becoming a murderer
on his account.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,470
No son would ever want that.

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,800
You don't even have the guts to kill me.
All bark and no bite.

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,100
It wasn't my karma, it was yours.
Your son's fate is your own doing.

34
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,140
Get it?

35
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,880
Even if I'm not the one to do it,

36
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,120
my son will never let you
get away with this!

37
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,990
You just wait, Min Doo Sik.

38
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,790
You will truly face divine retribution!

39
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,560
This woman's completely lost her mind.
She's insane!

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,260
If I were facing divine retribution,
would I have woken up?

41
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,960
Would I be able to talk like this?

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,870
This isn't divine retribution.
It's a blessing, a gift from the skies.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,110
You think you can get revenge?
On me, Min Doo Sik, of all people?

44
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,840
What a joke.

45
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,640
So the two of you ganged up
to try and take me down.

46
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,280
But in the end,

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,550
no matter what you do,
you're no match for me.

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,990
Having the nerve to barge in here
and try to kill me.

49
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,120
I'll make you pay for that very soon.
Just you wait.

50
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,760
Let's go.

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,100
Let's go, Madam Jang.

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,840
You two are dead meat!

53
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,720
(Episode 112)

54
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,990
How did you know where I was?

55
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,560
Tae Joo told me.

56
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,660
He said he couldn't just stand by
and watch something happen to you.

57
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,430
It would have been difficult for him
to intervene himself.

58
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,070
Madam Jang.

59
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,540
I know exactly how you're feeling
right now.

60
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,010
Who would understand better than me?

61
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,480
My parents died the exact same way
your son did.

62
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,590
Back then, Chairman Min Doo Sik
also used a patsy to take the fall...

63
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,090
for the accident
and covered up his own crime.

64
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,930
I found that driver a while ago
and asked him to testify in court,

65
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,130
but when Chairman Min found out,

66
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,060
he had the driver eliminated too.

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,470
Right. Jo Pil Doo.

68
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,370
- Lucia mentioned that once.
- Madam Jang.

69
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,170
Believe me, I've wanted to wring his neck
more than once.

70
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,410
I've even thought about hiring someone
to make him disappear without a trace...

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,680
more times than I can count.

72
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,480
Then why didn't you?

73
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,910
I already told you.

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Because then, I'd be no better than him.

75
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,820
My parents wouldn't want me
to ruin my own life...

76
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,520
just to get revenge on a monster like him.

77
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,560
So what now? Are we just going to
let that monster walk free?

78
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,860
No.

79
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,060
He has to be punished, no matter what.

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,300
We'll drag him into court,
expose every crime he's ever committed,

81
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,070
and make sure he gets the punishment
he deserves.

82
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,580
(Mingang Distribution)

83
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,180
Why do you keep calling me when I'm busy?

84
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,450
Are you really going to be like this?

85
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,160
- So, you're trying to see who wins this?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,330
I was working with the Legal Team,
carrying out my tasks faithfully.

87
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,430
You're the one who dragged me out here.

88
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,560
Is this really how you want to end
things with me?

89
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,900
- After all the years we've been together?
- The years we've been together?

90
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,070
- I guess it wasn't a short time.
- Exactly.

91
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,980
Who made you, a total nobody,
the head of the Legal Team?

92
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,050
And I repaid you with my complete loyalty.
Every time you were in a crisis,

93
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,680
I did whatever it took.

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,090
That's why you ended up engaged to me.

95
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,320
So that should have been enough.
Why the change of heart now?

96
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,520
I seem to recall you being the one
who called off the engagement.

97
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,260
So you pick now, of all times,

98
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,890
when I need you more than ever,

99
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,100
to stab me in the back
to be with Soo Jung?

100
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,800
With the shareholders' meeting so close?

101
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,100
What's that got to do with me?
It's not my problem.

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,640
You'll have to figure it out on your own.

103
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,210
I'm sure you'll handle the meeting fine.

104
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,440
(Mingang Distribution)

105
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,220
So, were you able to stop the mishap?

106
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,120
I barely managed to stop it.

107
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,820
But I'm worried about Madam Jang.

108
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,990
She'll pull through.
She's a very strong woman.

109
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,000
And Tae Joo will be right by her side
to take care of her.

110
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,800
Now that Chairman Min Doo Sik knows
who Madam Jang and I really are,

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,400
he's not going to just stand by
and do nothing.

112
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,870
The only reason he hasn't acted is
because he can't move freely right now.

113
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,910
How's his condition?

114
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,450
He regained consciousness a while ago
and can communicate,

115
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,850
but he's still paralyzed
from the waist down.

116
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,290
But he's tough as nails.
Once he recovers from the paralysis...

117
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,390
and can move freely again,
things will change.

118
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,690
He'll stop at nothing
to silence Madam Jang and me.

119
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,960
Madam Jang has Tae Joo to protect her.
You're the one in real danger, Tae Kyung.

120
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,030
There's no telling
when or how he'll come after you.

121
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,800
Don't worry about me.

122
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,010
I can handle myself in a fight.
Remember Kim Sun Jae?

123
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,880
Didn't I beat him to a pulp
with this very fist?

124
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,110
Don't joke around.
I'm worried sick about you,

125
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,650
and you're cracking jokes?

126
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,820
I can take care of myself.

127
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,990
Let's just prepare
for the upcoming shareholders' meeting.

128
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,290
We need to figure out how to stop them
from ousting you.

129
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,830
If that doesn't work,
then I'll have to play my final card.

130
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,260
Your final card?

131
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Chairman?

132
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,730
What took you so long?

133
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,140
I only just found out you were awake.

134
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,840
Your eldest daughter spirited you away
and hid which hospital you were in.

135
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,180
How was I supposed to know where you were?

136
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,880
You're here now. It's fine.

137
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,750
There's something I needed to tell you.

138
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,220
Watch out for Madam Jang
and Moon Tae Kyung.

139
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,150
They're both deceiving you.

140
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
What?

141
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,960
- What do you mean by that?
- It's a long story.

142
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,230
Anyway, those two have conspired
and will get revenge on me.

143
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,360
Revenge? What are you talking about?

144
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,460
Why would they possibly want
revenge on you?

145
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,630
That's why I'm saying they're crazy.

146
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,900
Moon Tae Kyung declared war on me,
saying he'd see me prosecuted.

147
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,140
He did?

148
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,580
I'm worried about you, Chairman,

149
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,540
but the company
is in just as much trouble.

150
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,080
What's wrong with the company?

151
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,980
You're doing great as acting chairman.

152
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,180
I think there's going to be
a shareholders' meeting soon.

153
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,620
Your eldest daughter called for it.
She wants to oust me.

154
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,360
I kicked that brat Kyung Chae
out of the CEO position.

155
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,890
I had to reappoint her.
She blackmailed me. I had no choice.

156
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,660
She's running rampant,
not even knowing you've woken up.

157
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,330
Who does she think she is,
trying to oust you?

158
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,940
Don't worry. As long as I'm around,
that's not going to happen.

159
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,740
I don't have enough of a stake,

160
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,040
and my position is so unstable.

161
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,080
I guess Kyung Chae still looks down on me.

162
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,420
What do you mean you don't have a stake?
You have the shares I gifted you.

163
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,390
And how much is that, really?
That's exactly why this is happening.

164
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,790
In a situation like this,
I need a bigger stake than Kyung Chae...

165
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,690
if I want to command any respect.

166
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
She has a point.

167
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,370
Lucia's stake is
only half of what Kyung Chae has,

168
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,270
so I can see why
Kyung Chae looks down on her.

169
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,870
But still, calling a shareholders' meeting
to oust her?

170
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,110
That brat is going to treat Lucia
the same way she treated me.

171
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,480
What if
I just give all of my shares to Lucia?

172
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,690
No, that might be going too far.

173
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,190
Anyway, if I'm ever going to return
to the company,

174
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,690
the paralysis in the legs should go away.

175
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
And I need to get some strength
back in my legs.

176
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,430
Goodness.

177
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,540
So? How do you feel?

178
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,410
Now that you've made up your mind
and picked a side?

179
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,010
Don't overthink it.

180
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,620
It's not like you and my sister
were a great match anyway.

181
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,690
And you think you and I
are a good match, Director?

182
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,890
I told you to stop calling me "Director."

183
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,960
Call me Soo Jung.
I'm a pretty cool woman, you know.

184
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,000
Are you seriously thinking
about marrying me?

185
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,770
I don't see why not.

186
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,570
Why?

187
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,640
Sun Jae,
you don't like the idea of marrying me?

188
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,170
This would be a first, wouldn't it?

189
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,440
Jumping from one sister to the next
for marriage.

190
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,040
So what?

191
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,980
All that matters is
that we're okay with it.

192
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,550
Come on,
let's go to my place for another drink.

193
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,190
Hey, what's going on with you two?

194
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,090
It's a look that's easy to misinterpret.

195
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Why are a man and his fiancee's sister
walking in arm in arm?

196
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,000
We're dating, Ji Seop.

197
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,630
What are you talking about?
What about Kyung Chae?

198
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,170
The two of you were engaged!

199
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
We broke off the engagement.

200
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
You broke it off?

201
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,840
When? And even if you did,

202
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,610
you can't just get together with Soo Jung,
can you?

203
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,180
Come on. Don't be so old-fashioned.
Times have changed.

204
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,550
What do you mean "times have changed?"
We still live in a society with morals.

205
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,960
Just a while ago, you were about to become
brother-in-law and sister-in-law.

206
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Does it make sense to go from in-laws
to lovers overnight?

207
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,660
Goodness, my dear mother-in-law.

208
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,230
It's been a while. Have you been well?

209
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,640
Your future son-in-law
is here to pay his respects.

210
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,740
My partner may have changed,

211
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,640
but either way,
I'm still your son-in-law, right?

212
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,290
What is all this drama?
This isn't some animal kingdom.

213
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,700
Did Sun Jae really just jump
from Kyung Chae to Soo Jung?

214
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,500
Give me a second. I'm so shocked
that I feel like getting sick.

215
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,310
Good thing your father's in a coma.

216
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,940
Imagine if he found out about this.

217
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,880
Even I'm absolutely floored.

218
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,180
When did he even break the engagement off
with Kyung Chae,

219
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,880
and when did he and Soo Jung
become a thing?

220
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,090
Sun Jae is quite the player.

221
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,320
Player, my foot!

222
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,420
That jerk thinks he can
walk all over our family.

223
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,390
How can he just jump
from one sister to the other?

224
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,670
What on earth is going on?

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,200
Why is he with Ms. Soo Jung?

226
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,140
Did you really break off the engagement?

227
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,610
So it seems.

228
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,310
But still, with Ms. Soo Jung?
How is that even possible?

229
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
Sun Jae...

230
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,920
wants you to remove the engagement ring
and get rid of it immediately.

231
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,190
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

232
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,660
You're taking this too far.

233
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,760
Who's taking it too far?

234
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,830
He's saying he's done with you.

235
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,200
He's saying he likes me more than you.

236
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,340
You're the one who's clueless right now.

237
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
So?

238
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,510
So you're actually going to
marry Lawyer Kim or something?

239
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,280
We'll get to that.

240
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,240
Is there any reason we shouldn't?

241
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,410
Just stop.

242
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,710
What do you think people will say?

243
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,620
Everyone knows
that Lawyer Kim and I were engaged.

244
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,120
Since when have you ever cared
what other people think?

245
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,320
Knock, knock.

246
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,820
Hey, baby. Come down and have some coffee.

247
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,960
- I made you some coffee.
- Okay, thanks,

248
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,800
honey.

249
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,210
What is all this?

250
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,870
Ms. Kyung Chae, what is happening?

251
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,680
Why are you letting yourself
be humiliated like this?

252
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,050
Goodness, how did this family end up
in such a mess?

253
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,220
(Mingang Distribution)

254
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,690
So when Kim Sun Jae
went to the house yesterday,

255
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,530
he was basically showing his hand.

256
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,800
I think he's putting on a deliberate act
in front of the family.

257
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,070
Figures. You did reject him,

258
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,200
and Min Kyung Chae also ditched him.

259
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,640
I guess he has nowhere else to turn.

260
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,710
It's also a silent threat
that he won't side with Min Kyung Chae...

261
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,210
at the shareholders' meeting.

262
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,080
It's a relief that Kim Sun Jae
isn't on Min Kyung Chae's side,

263
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,410
but their side still has
a much larger stake,

264
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,980
so there's nothing we can do for now.

265
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,590
I'll just have to go back
to Chairman Min and beg.

266
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,260
He did say he would stop the meeting,
at least.

267
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,060
Hey, Lawyer Park. What is it?

268
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,800
I just got a call from Chairman Min.
It looks like...

269
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,270
he's planning to give
all his shares to his wife.

270
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,540
Is he? How much?

271
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,010
- Don't tell me he's giving all of it.
- He is.

272
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,280
Not now, but he wouldn't have called
if he wasn't serious about it, right?

273
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,050
That's true.
The old man never calls for no reason.

274
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,820
Chairman Min would rather
install his wife in the position...

275
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,890
than hand the chairmanship over
to CEO Min.

276
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,990
Will you be okay?

277
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,530
Don't worry. I'll figure out a way
to land on my feet.

278
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
More importantly,

279
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,030
when Chairman Min's secret ledger
and shell company become an issue,

280
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,030
I need you to pull some strings
with the higher-ups.

281
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,200
Don't tell me you're packing everything up
and skipping the country.

282
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,940
Even if I do leave,

283
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,040
I'm going to get what I deserve
for my loyalty to Mingang.

284
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,820
It looks like Chairman Min is thinking...

285
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,020
of handing his entire stake over
to his wife if it comes to it.

286
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,790
What are you talking about?

287
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,190
Isn't my dad in a coma right now?

288
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,020
How could someone
in his condition do that?

289
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,730
He's made a full recovery,

290
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,030
and he's thinking of gifting his shares
to that woman, Lucia.

291
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,800
I heard he sought legal counsel about it.

292
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,930
How can he give that away?

293
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,640
Where on earth is my dad right now?

294
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,770
CEO Min snuck him into a VIP room
at Hanmyeong Hospital.

295
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,010
And she's been keeping it
a secret this whole time?

296
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,840
But then, how did Lucia find out?

297
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,150
That woman is more formidable
than you think.

298
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,880
Can't you tell from what's going on?

299
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,820
We went as far as pretending
to be a couple in front of people.

300
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,190
I came because I felt we should at least
be sharing this kind of information.

301
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,700
(Mingang Distribution)

302
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,040
I heard Dad's at Hanmyeong Hospital.
Why did you sneak him over there?

303
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,080
So I should've just left him with Lucia?

304
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,210
There's no telling what she might do.

305
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,550
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

306
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,850
What if that old geezer
comes to his senses,

307
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,290
grows fond of the woman at his side,
and decides to give her his stake?

308
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,560
As a matter of fact, it looks like
that's exactly what's about to happen.

309
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,030
What are you talking about?

310
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,430
Dad's awake,
and he's already met with Lucia.

311
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,700
He seems to be thinking
of giving his stake to Lucia.

312
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,640
He even sought legal counsel about it.

313
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,640
That's ridiculous!

314
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,810
How would she even know where to find him?

315
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,040
And Dad's awake?

316
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,510
If he were, I would've been the first one
they called.

317
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,980
That woman is Dad's legal wife.

318
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,820
There's nothing you can do
if she tells the medical staff...

319
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,880
to keep things from you.

320
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,020
I don't know how that woman found
where Dad is,

321
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,820
hurry and stop them
before this whole thing blows up.

322
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,310
So, you're awake.

323
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,310
Father, you're not really thinking...

324
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,110
of giving that woman
your entire stake, are you?

325
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,150
With the shareholders' meeting so soon,

326
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,120
are you really going to do
something this crazy?

327
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,750
Your father was on his deathbed,
and now he's finally awake.

328
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,060
You couldn't care less, could you?

329
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,160
All you care about is
taking over the company.

330
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,490
This is exactly why I'm considering
giving my stake to her.

331
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,930
Goodness.
She cares more about Mingang than you do.

332
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,570
She's the one who cares?

333
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,170
Who even is she?
What has she ever done for Mingang?

334
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,410
See? This is what I mean.
You only ever see one side of things.

335
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,270
Do you have any idea
what kind of person Lucia is?

336
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,640
I know you're infatuated with her,
but this is too much.

337
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,350
How can you even think about
giving her the entire Mingang stake?

338
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,910
Don't even think about it.

339
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,980
Who knows what she'll pull...

340
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,280
after she becomes
the majority shareholder?

341
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,290
Can't I do what I want with my own stake?
Is that what you came here to argue about?

342
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,190
Anything but that. You can't do it.

343
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,660
You'd be handing the entire company
over to her.

344
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,460
If you don't like it,
then cancel the shareholders' meeting now.

345
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,700
And stop trying
to kick out your stepmother.

346
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I'll be returning to the company soon,
and when I do,

347
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,770
she'll get her CEO position back,
and you will leave the company.

348
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,410
And that will settle everything.

349
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,540
Father!

350
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,880
I'm not going to say it again.

351
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,840
Cancel the shareholders' meeting,
and get out of the company now.

352
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,890
Gosh.

353
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,730
I was worried about you,
so I came to see how you're doing.

354
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,870
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

355
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,040
Shouldn't you be worried about yourself?
The shareholders' meeting is very soon.

356
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,540
That's actually why I'm here.
I thought you should know.

357
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,710
It's going to be called off.

358
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,080
Chairman Min promised he would stop it.

359
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,620
Well, good for you.

360
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,990
You certainly have a hold on Chairman Min.
You're a natural.

361
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,160
Please forgive Se Ri and me.

362
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Forgive?

363
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm not so sure.
I don't even know how to do that.

364
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,170
I've only ever thought about revenge.
Forgiveness never crossed my mind.

365
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,940
Our Mi So will be so happy in the skies
to finally have a grandmother.

366
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,850
It was always just the two of us,
so she envied friends with grandmothers.

367
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,780
And if you're a grandmother to Mi So,

368
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,820
then you're a mother to me.

369
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,990
We may not be related by blood,

370
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,760
but it's just like
how Mi So is my daughter.

371
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,270
Mother, I was just...

372
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,570
What's this?

373
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,370
What is this woman doing here?

374
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,210
You should go now.

375
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,590
Why are you meeting with that woman?

376
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,820
The two of you have no business
with each other anymore.

377
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,830
If you have something to say,
say it quickly and go.

378
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,060
Mother, why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

379
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,430
I even put up with it
when you slapped me for no reason.

380
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,440
But you can't be meeting her
behind my back like this.

381
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,810
Do I need your permission
to see Lucia now?

382
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,080
Of course you do
because she's our public enemy.

383
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,610
So you shouldn't be dealing
with her privately.

384
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,420
I came to discuss something,
and this is what I walk in on.

385
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,650
Father regained consciousness,

386
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,390
and he wants
the shareholders' meeting canceled.

387
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,320
He knows we plan to oust Lucia there,
so if push comes to shove,

388
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,230
it looks like he's planning
to give her all of his shares.

389
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,530
Then just drop it.

390
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:35,570
If he's going that far, drop it.
Won't you be satisfied until she's gone?

391
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,400
Mother, what's gotten into you?

392
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,270
You hated her more. Weren't you the one
who couldn't stand the sight of her?

393
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,850
I'll tell Se Ri to come over.

394
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,820
Mother, you miss Se Ri, don't you?

395
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,290
Hey, Se Ri?

396
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,190
It's your sister.

397
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,860
You know Madam Jang's hotel, right?
Get over here now.

398
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,090
What are you talking about?

399
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,530
I have to go to my part-time job in a bit.

400
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,900
- Forget your job. I said, get over here!
- Gosh.

401
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,940
What is wrong with you, seriously?

402
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,840
I don't even like that old lady.

403
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,340
Why do you keep trying to push me
and that old lady together?

404
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,410
That's because...

405
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,010
Anyway, stop complaining
and get over here on the double.

406
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,820
Just take a taxi,
and you'll be here in no time.

407
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,680
No. I'm going to rest a little
before I go to work.

408
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,990
If she's so bored, tell her to go
to a senior center or something.

409
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,560
She shouldn't be bothering someone busy.

410
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,860
Se Ri!

411
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,570
- Hello? Min Se Ri!
- That's enough. Stop it.

412
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,870
And don't come here again.

413
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,570
Mother.

414
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,410
If you want to protect Mingang,
do it on your own.

415
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,110
You have far more than Lucia does.

416
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,750
Why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

417
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,380
If I did something to upset you...

418
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,780
No.

419
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,450
It's nothing like that.

420
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,320
I'm grateful
that you loved my son so much,

421
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,630
and thank you
for having my granddaughter...

422
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,560
without giving up until the end.

423
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,800
- Then why?
- From now on,

424
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,770
try to be a decent person.

425
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,170
Don't be so greedy.
Just let things run their course.

426
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,280
If you've done wrong,
you must pay the price,

427
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,110
reflect on your actions,
and become a better person.

428
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,350
- What on earth are you talking about?
- You should go now.

429
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,990
I'm tired. I need to lie down.

430
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,500
So you're saying the chairman
is completely lucid?

431
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,500
He can move and talk and everything?

432
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,270
That's what she just said.

433
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,910
The chairman is truly a blessed man.

434
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,080
How could he just wake up perfectly fine
from that condition? It's like a miracle.

435
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,710
He's really something else.

436
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,750
A remarkable man, I mean.

437
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,380
So why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

438
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,220
Apparently, he doesn't want
any visitors for a while.

439
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,290
I can't blame him. If I were him,
I wouldn't want to see my kids either.

440
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,890
After all, none of them went looking
for him when he collapsed.

441
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,860
Hey. That's only because
we didn't know where he was.

442
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,260
Anyway, now that my father is awake,
things at the company will get messy.

443
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,930
The company? What now?

444
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,040
Kyung Chae and her stepmother
are on the verge of all-out war.

445
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,340
The shareholders' meeting will decide
who comes out on top.

446
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,780
That's why we rushed over here today.

447
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,610
You still have that stake, right?
The time has finally come to use it.

448
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,120
Of course he does. Don't worry.

449
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,890
You made him promise not to sell it
and to hold onto it tight.

450
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,390
You said you never know what might happen.

451
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,290
Right, honey?
You still have it safe, right?

452
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,560
Oh, that.

453
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,200
Of course. I've got a firm grip on it.

454
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,700
I said I'd be a son of a dog if I sold it.

455
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,300
That's perfect!

456
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,800
Then you should come
to the shareholders' meeting...

457
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,370
and exercise your voting rights.

458
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,440
- Me?
- Yes.

459
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,010
- Do I really have to be there?
- Yes.

460
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,910
- I'm going to be very busy that day.
- Please.

461
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,450
And he hasn't even told you
when it is yet.

462
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,890
You're acting very suspicious.

463
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,220
Don't tell me you've gotten
into trouble again, Oh Pan Sool.

464
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:23,060
You're unbelievable. Calling me by name
in front of our son-in-law like a dog.

465
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,630
Whatever day it is, I have a feeling
I'm going to be very busy.

466
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,700
That's my gut feeling.
And my gut has never been wrong.

467
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,340
That sly old fox.

468
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,450
Why is she doing this to me now?

469
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,180
Just why?

470
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,320
From the sound of it,

471
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,820
it seems Madam Jang
has definitely turned her back on you.

472
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,560
You turned on me too,
so of course that old fox did too.

473
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,560
All right then, Kim Sun Jae.

474
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,070
Are you happy now that you've betrayed me?

475
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,570
Thanks to my father, my plan
to kick out Lucia is about to fail.

476
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,040
So what now?

477
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,910
Why is everyone so desperate
to stab me in the back?

478
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,560
I really don't get why
Jang Yeon Sook is doing that.

479
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,130
Just a few days ago, she acted like
she'd give Se Ri the world,

480
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,130
and now she's treating her
like a total stranger.

481
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,040
This is our Se Ri we're talking about!

482
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,940
You, of all people, can't act this way!
You're her grandmother!

483
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,320
But Se Ri...

484
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,260
isn't Madam Jang's granddaughter.

485
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,730
Her real granddaughter is someone else.

486
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,870
And you have no idea
the two of them were switched.

487
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,900
Knowing the truth,
how would Madam Jang take your side?

488
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,620
You're the only fool
who's still in the dark.

489
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,640
What did I just hear?

490
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,250
The two girls...

491
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,950
were switched?

492
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,960
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

493
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,140
Lawyer Kim says our Se Ri was switched
with someone else.

494
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,180
Manager Gong, did you know about this?

495
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,980
If you could just make sure Ms. Kyung Chae
never finds out about this,

496
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,750
I would be forever in your debt.

497
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,280
He'll try to get rid of me first
since I'm the biggest thorn in their side.

498
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,920
I told you to get rid of
that jerk Moon Tae Kyung today!

499
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,490
Tae Kyung is in danger!

500
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,860
If anything happens to him, I can't go on.

501
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,230
