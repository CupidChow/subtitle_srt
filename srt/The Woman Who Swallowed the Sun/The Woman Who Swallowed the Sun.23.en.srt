00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,640
(Episode 23)

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,680
Mr. Jo.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,340
Do you recognize me?

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,950
Do you remember me?

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,880
Do you know how we met...

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,790
and how you ended up here?

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,690
It's okay.

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,430
I don't mind if you don't remember.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm grateful
that you regained consciousness.

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,630
Thank you.

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,970
I remember...

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,410
whose son you are.

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,900
Han Kyung Soo, CEO of Doeun Industries.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,860
Thirty years ago,

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,000
a Velvo car was involved in
a head-on collision...

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,540
with a truck...

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,840
that turned left at Mucheon Roundabout.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,970
Your memory...

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,250
CEO Han who was behind the wheel...

20
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,860
and his wife in the passenger seat
died at the scene.

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,290
That's right.

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,930
They were...

23
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,700
my parents.

24
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,570
You resemble them.

25
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,050
Who was he that pleased to see?

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,990
They didn't seem like family.

27
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,200
Why did you wait four years
for me to wake up?

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
You cared about the likes of me...

29
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,570
after how I treated you?

30
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,470
Don't say that, Mr. Jo.

31
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,110
I can't ask for anything more
now that you're awake.

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,650
No one would do this even for a family.

33
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,780
Thank you. Thank you so much.

34
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,620
The people who did this to you.

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,520
I promise to find out.

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,460
And those who killed my parents too.

37
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,130
I asked around,

38
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,000
and this might be a great opportunity.

39
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,670
Jogeon Logistics.

40
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,170
Min Doo Sik will do whatever he can
to take over the company...

41
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,410
to make up for
the Online Business Team's poor profits.

42
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,940
They are independent entities,

43
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,110
but if the Online Business Team
does poorly,

44
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,380
it will affect the stock price.

45
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,350
I think if this deal falls through,
it could deal Mingang a painful blow.

46
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,890
I'm not sure if incurring them
an extra risk will help.

47
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,490
It might be better to gain acknowledgement
by scoring the deal.

48
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,160
Do you have another idea?

49
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,960
We might not have to do anything.

50
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,800
The older Min sisters
will fight each other for it.

51
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,800
Is that why you went to Min Soo Jung?

52
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,200
She won't want...

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,510
her half-sister
to win their father's praise.

54
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,340
Those two are the worst enemies ever.

55
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,350
It'll be a fight worth watching.

56
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,280
Chairman Min will make a move too.

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,020
He's the type to back down
when someone moves in too aggressively.

58
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,490
He never stops doubting
or suspecting others.

59
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,560
(Mingang Distribution)

60
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,010
Are you all right?

61
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,610
Oh, dear. What am I to do?

62
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,580
- Let me help.
- Thank you.

63
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,580
Here.

64
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,290
- Were you hurt?
- I'm fine.

65
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,990
- Your clothes will get dirty.
- I don't mind.

66
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,090
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

67
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,700
Tell Jung Lucia to come see me.

68
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,750
Take a seat.

69
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,720
My gosh, sir.

70
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,590
What are you doing...

71
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,390
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

72
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Yes.

73
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,660
I'm Min Doo Sik,
the chairman of Mingang Distribution.

74
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,300
What...

75
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,800
How could this be?

76
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,670
Are you really the chairman?

77
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,740
You had no idea?

78
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,240
All this was a coincidence?

79
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,110
We met by chance multiple times.

80
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,350
To be honest, I'm suspicious.

81
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,550
Did you say multiple coincidences
mean it's fate?

82
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,190
But I think you approached me...

83
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,450
under the guise of a coincidence.

84
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,720
I "approached" you?

85
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,690
I don't think it was pure chance.

86
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,700
Even if we'd met in a past life,

87
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,530
there's no way this would happen.

88
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,570
I don't find you charming enough...

89
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,840
that I'd fake coincidences
to approach you.

90
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,240
Oh, your money?

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,080
When a woman goes after a chairman
old enough to be her father,

92
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,880
a better word to describe that
would be "purpose."

93
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,480
But that's from your standpoint, not mine.

94
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,890
I thought you were polite and respectable.

95
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,530
That's why I welcomed the coincidences.

96
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,730
I washed and ironed your handkerchief,

97
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,000
thinking that if I ever met you again,
I would thank you and return it.

98
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,670
That was it.

99
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,840
I just...

100
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,410
never thought we'd meet again like this.

101
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,410
What's the point in explaining
when you won't believe me?

102
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,720
It'll sound like an excuse.

103
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,920
I guess...

104
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,720
I was a fool and believed...

105
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,920
it was fate.

106
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,770
- You're going to the academy?
- What?

107
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,440
Yes.

108
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,670
Shall I ask Mr. Kim to drive you?

109
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,440
No, thanks. I'll take the subway.

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,380
You have to make multiple transfers
to get to your academy.

111
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,780
Take the car.

112
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,320
I said no.

113
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,480
See you.

114
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,360
Can you really find her?

115
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,130
Yes. Do you have trust issues?

116
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,400
What shares do you own?

117
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,200
Who bought them for you?

118
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,840
You don't need to know that.

119
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,540
You'd better find her.

120
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,010
And don't you dare con me.

121
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,440
If I were to con someone,

122
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,110
I'd find myself a meaty mark
and con them for a fortune.

123
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,510
What could I get from a student like you?

124
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,650
If things go wrong, I'll report you
to the police and lock you up.

125
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,080
Fine, whatever.

126
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,790
Did you bring what I asked for?

127
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,960
There it is.

128
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,930
I know of a woman looking for
her daughter who would be your age.

129
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,730
I'll have the results right away
if I compare her DNA with yours.

130
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,040
She believed him?

131
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,240
She seemed pleased to hear
she could find her birth mom with DNA.

132
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,880
I thought she was sly and crafty,
but she's still just a kid.

133
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,150
She fell for that lie?

134
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,720
- What shall I do?
- Let her be.

135
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,950
She must struggle a bit...

136
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,850
so that Lucia can get involved.

137
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,360
If we manage
to take over Jogeon Logistics,

138
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,560
we can make up for our team's slump.

139
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,800
It's your first job with us,

140
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,430
so work well with Lawyer Kim.

141
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,870
I'll have you excluded
from your other duties.

142
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,910
Business is all about
taking over and getting taken over.

143
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,470
Merging with a small company...

144
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,740
is no big deal.

145
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,110
It's not.

146
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,250
I accepted the investment
because I trusted Madam Jang,

147
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,850
but I'm wary of private equity funds.

148
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
You know the risks they come with.

149
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,020
We must take over Jogeon
at all costs, then.

150
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,890
While making it look like
we had good reason to.

151
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,290
I see you get it.

152
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,530
We met because I needed funding,

153
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,960
but I'd like us to get along.

154
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,430
I have many loyal subordinates,

155
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,200
but no one to bare my heart to.

156
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,810
I think you could become
an ally and a friend.

157
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,910
That's how I feel.

158
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,040
For that to happen,

159
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,280
I must do this job to your liking.

160
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,810
That's right.

161
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,550
I expect a lot from you.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm not too sure...

163
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,440
what I should do.

164
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,380
As you know, I got the job
as CEO Min's special hire.

165
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,780
I work directly under her.

166
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,210
I should do as she says, but I'm bothered.

167
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,650
Small companies like Jogeon Logistics
are easy prey.

168
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,420
That doesn't mean
just anyone can eat them up.

169
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,330
Especially not Min Kyung Chae.
Not while I'm right here.

170
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,290
I know what's bothering you.

171
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,930
And why Director Moon is
refusing to do the deal.

172
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,800
That's why
I keep coming to you for advice.

173
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,640
I know I shouldn't.

174
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,440
This is how we become a team.

175
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,510
Let's do this.

176
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,940
You stick around my sister
and do as she tells you.

177
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,350
I'll handle all the business in secret.

178
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,480
That feels like deceiving the CEO.

179
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,990
You're the one who's being deceived.

180
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,160
Don't you know about white lies?

181
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,560
I care more about Mingang than most.

182
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,530
But I'm against
the ruthless takeover of a small company.

183
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,840
I'm glad to know we agree on that.

184
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,200
You'll soon see for yourself...

185
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,640
that I'm more human than my sister.

186
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,210
She thinks she's more of a human?

187
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,880
Those two have no idea
what they're really like.

188
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,950
She tried to calm me in person,

189
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,850
but she'll plot something in secret.

190
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,720
She'll try to take over Jogeon
before her sister does...

191
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,890
to win her father's approval.

192
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,660
She might even demand the CEO title.

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,930
The case you mentioned last time,

194
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,870
from 30 years ago
that's similar to Jogeon Logistics.

195
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,140
As I told you,
there are so few details about the case...

196
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,670
that only those involved know anything.

197
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,210
Do you need to know about it?
Shall I see what I can dig up?

198
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,810
Someone knows about the accident.

199
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,220
That's very unlikely
unless they were directly involved.

200
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,650
Min Doo Sik was good at controlling
the media, so the word didn't get out.

201
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,390
You can tell
he's still pretty good at that.

202
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,560
So who knows what happened?

203
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,200
Director Moon Tae Kyung.

204
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,870
Take your time.

205
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,210
I haven't eaten in four years.

206
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,750
I eat and eat, and I still feel hungry.

207
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,150
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

208
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,360
Do you think Min Doo Sik...

209
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,660
is still enjoying his good life?

210
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,130
Just thinking of him makes my skin crawl.

211
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,670
He's trying to...

212
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,310
take over a small company
called Jogeon Logistics.

213
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,640
His excuse is that he wants
to commercialize the technology...

214
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,080
that they developed.

215
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,680
He's still up to what he did 30 years ago.

216
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,990
I really want to stop him this time.

217
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,020
I couldn't do anything 30 years ago.

218
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,290
We must stop him.

219
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,860
I'll help as soon as I feel better.

220
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,160
What will you do with Min Doo Sik?

221
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,500
I'll drag him to court.

222
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,300
You just have to testify to the truth...

223
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,810
about my parents' accident.

224
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,110
Will my testimony be enough
when there's no evidence?

225
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,480
We think I was whacked in the head...

226
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,950
by someone Min Doo Sik sent,
but we can't prove it.

227
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,720
It just had to have happened
in an alley with no cameras.

228
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,290
That's why I need you to testify.

229
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,190
If we keep poking around,

230
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,990
the police will reopen the case,

231
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,330
and the truth will have to surface.

232
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,370
(Mingang Distribution)

233
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,670
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

234
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,140
Ms. Lucia.

235
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,380
We're going somewhere this afternoon.

236
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,280
You'll be working away from the office.

237
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,320
You can't barge in
and poach someone on my team.

238
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,320
It's not poaching...

239
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,630
if we're following the CEO's order.

240
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,960
We have processes for a reason.

241
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,030
If you walk in like this
during work hours...

242
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,870
Do you need an official notice, then?

243
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,670
Listen, Lawyer...

244
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,810
Can I have a word?

245
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,560
This isn't your office.

246
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,290
You might be head of Legal,
but this is my domain.

247
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,490
Shouldn't you ask for my permission first?

248
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,800
What?

249
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,600
If you need the assistance of someone...

250
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,640
from another team,
you should put in a request.

251
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,500
Is that comical to you?

252
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,840
What are you saying I did wrong?

253
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,710
I told you we had the CEO's order.

254
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,350
Oh, so a fleeting comment is all it takes?

255
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,050
Would you not mind at all
if I showed up like this...

256
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,080
and borrowed someone from your team?

257
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,550
If you need someone, go right ahead.

258
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,890
I'm pretty flexible...

259
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,330
and have no problems
with lending out my staff...

260
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,060
if it's for the company's good.

261
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,230
Listen!

262
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,460
What's going on here?

263
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,200
Let's talk.

264
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,380
What's going on?

265
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,850
What order did you get from the CEO?

266
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,550
Is it serious?

267
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,230
He never answers.

268
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,260
Didn't I say I put someone else in charge
because you refused to do it?

269
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,400
A member of my team
should put our business first.

270
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,440
This is more important
than your team's business.

271
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,640
In the long run, it's for Mingang's sake.

272
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,910
Please reconsider.

273
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,940
This deal is not the best for Mingang.

274
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,080
It's too rash and risky
considering the high moral standard...

275
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,420
the public holds companies to.

276
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,290
Jogeon Logistics
will merge with a company if not ours.

277
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,460
I didn't understand why
you were so against it, but I tried to.

278
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,060
That's what you're like.

279
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,490
Principles and morals?

280
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,060
That's all good.

281
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,600
I'd have agreed with you
if this weren't about Mingang.

282
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,170
It's about Mingang,
which is why it must not happen.

283
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,870
Ms. Min.

284
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,770
People would point fingers
and criticize us...

285
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,010
for what we did if they were to hear.

286
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,240
Can you handle that?

287
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,540
That's not all.

288
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,410
If we're condemned for being immoral,

289
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,980
we'll lose whatever trust we had built up.

290
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,950
That's why we can't let the word get out.

291
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,920
Forget about the Jogeon deal
and focus on your team.

292
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,090
Your team accomplished nothing
in four years and barely got funding.

293
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,830
That should bother you.

294
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,490
You must have a lot to do
to make up for that.

295
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
That deal.

296
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,010
Do you have to do it?

297
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,610
Even though the CEO asked you to,

298
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,550
I said you could have said no.

299
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,950
And I said I had no reason to say no.

300
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,060
Not only because the CEO asked,
but because it's for Mingang.

301
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,230
Okay, then.

302
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,190
But I feel let down.

303
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,570
How well do you think you know me
that you'd feel let down?

304
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,300
I had a feeling...

305
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,700
you'd refuse the project.

306
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Companies take over and get taken over.

307
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,280
Forget about capitalism.

308
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,150
I'm talking about people and what's right.

309
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,850
When a company goes down,
many people lose what meant a lot to them.

310
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,990
Was there ever a time when you failed...

311
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,120
to protect someone dear to you?

312
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,860
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,090
Mom is sorry.

314
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,300
My dear daughter.

315
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,870
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

316
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,640
You wanted to protect someone
with all you had,

317
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,880
but you couldn't.

318
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,510
Can you really say you never failed?

319
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,590
Yes. Because I never failed in that way.

320
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,170
Say "ah."

321
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,870
Come on. Say "ah."

322
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,980
Say "ah."

323
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,650
I think you need more than money in life.

324
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,720
What else do we need?

325
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,360
- Love?
- Love?

326
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,000
- Love.
- Love.

327
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,370
L, O, V, E.

328
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,250
Honey.

329
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,890
Honey?

330
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,490
Honey. Pan Sool.

331
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,930
Where did she go?

332
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,360
The candy's gone too.

333
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,100
Have a rice cake.

334
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,500
What darn rice cake?

335
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,140
I don't care about rice cakes.

336
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,110
What do you care about, then?

337
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,810
I was having such a great time.

338
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,410
Why does your pretty face
look extra cheap today?

339
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,710
Your facial features look run-down.

340
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,620
Take a look in the mirror.

341
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,550
You'll shock yourself.

342
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,720
What are you on about?

343
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,720
I wonder when we'll find a tenant
to take Ja Kyung's room.

344
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,830
Did I ask for too much rent?

345
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,630
No one even called to ask about it.

346
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,860
You're so crass,
always talking about money.

347
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,200
Cash and money.

348
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,270
Is that all you care about?

349
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,240
What else is there to care about?

350
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,770
Love.

351
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,040
L, O, V, E. And candies.

352
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,320
I can't believe I just heard you say that.

353
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,060
Did a worm break its back breakdancing?

354
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,730
Yang Mal Sook!

355
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,400
If you keep this up,
our love will drift apart!

356
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,800
I want to go back to my dream!

357
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,770
Darn rice cake...

358
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,040
Kyung Chae and Lawyer Kim
are working on something in secret.

359
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,610
I bet Father gave an order.

360
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,850
Don't you know anything?

361
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,620
I don't.

362
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,550
I'd tell you what you didn't know
if I were you.

363
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,390
We can beat Kyung Chae
if we work together.

364
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,120
Don't you want to be CEO?

365
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,130
You can't be a director forever.

366
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,130
Ji Seop.

367
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,200
The lady who cleans my office...

368
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,930
gave this to me.

369
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,400
She found it
stuck to the corner of my desk.

370
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,640
Who do you think put it there?

371
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,280
And you want me
to side with you to fight Kyung Chae?

372
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,650
Have a conscience.

373
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,180
Darn it.

374
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,890
How did the cleaner notice that?

375
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,260
Do you know why...

376
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,500
I kept the store chain
and online business separate?

377
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,430
Yes.

378
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,700
Still, they're all
part of Mingang Distribution.

379
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,240
Everything affects the stock price.

380
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,240
If we take over Jogeon Logistics
and commercialize their new technology,

381
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,910
our online business
will overtake the store's profits.

382
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,810
Lawyer Kim and Lucia will see to that.

383
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,620
Lucia?

384
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,590
What's the matter?
You don't seem to like her.

385
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,590
Is something wrong?

386
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,590
I'm just a bit bothered.

387
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,930
Shall I put someone else in charge?

388
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,460
If you want me to, I can...

389
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,500
Leave it.

390
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,330
Let her prove what she can do.

391
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,130
And what kind of person she is.

392
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,710
As you can see,
our offer is pretty favorable.

393
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,910
They have no reason to reject it.

394
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,780
This is the only contract
they'll read and sign?

395
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,720
Yes. Only we will have
the copy of the dual agreement.

396
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,620
They're deep in debt,
which they must repay soon,

397
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,820
so they'll jump at the offer.

398
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,730
Did you look into the CEO?

399
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,890
His wife is in the hospital
with chronic heart failure.

400
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,760
Then he has no relatives
to object to the deal.

401
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,330
That's right. The CEO has the final say.

402
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,070
He doesn't know anyone
with legal expertise either.

403
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,310
That's even better.

404
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,040
What if...

405
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,810
Lucia has another idea...

406
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,480
You too?

407
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,310
What's wrong with everyone?

408
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,350
What don't you like about her?

409
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,450
Never mind. I'll tell you when I'm sure.

410
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,530
Where did you learn to cook so well?

411
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,640
Is your mother a good cook?

412
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,510
My sister taught me.

413
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,470
You have an older sister?

414
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,740
I'm envious. I'm an only child,
and I wish I had siblings.

415
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,580
You have both parents.

416
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,780
They care about you a dreadful lot.

417
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,490
Yes. My dad would do anything for me.

418
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,160
My feet never touched the floor
until I was seven.

419
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,890
My dad carried me everywhere.

420
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,360
I was always in his arms or lap.

421
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,570
Is it just you and your sister, then?

422
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,230
No. I had a niece too, but...

423
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,270
She died in an accident.

424
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,940
Oh, dear. How did that happen?

425
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,280
It was an accident.

426
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,810
My sister had a huge shock that...

427
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,950
Oh, dear.

428
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,320
Silly me. I started yapping.

429
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,490
I'll bring everything
on the list next time.

430
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,560
Okay.

431
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,860
(Business Partnership Contract)

432
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,190
(April 4, 2025)

433
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,000
I never imagined...

434
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,000
a company like Mingang...

435
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,070
would offer such a great deal
to a place like us.

436
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,100
How am I to repay the favor?

437
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,370
It's not a favor.
With this deal, we both win.

438
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,280
We get to commercialize
the technology you developed,

439
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,480
and you get to free yourself
from the financial burden.

440
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,720
I can breathe at last.

441
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,650
Thank you so much.

442
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,560
I'd like to treat you to a meal
to show my gratitude.

443
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,130
Here you go. Enjoy yourselves.

444
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,130
I should buy you something nicer,

445
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,230
but this is all I can afford.

446
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,200
This is good enough.

447
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,140
You'll make a lot of money.

448
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,840
Treat us again another time.

449
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,740
Shall I do that?

450
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,140
I ordered the deluxe soup.
I hope you like it.

451
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,690
- Thank you.
- I enjoyed the meal.

452
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,940
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

453
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,940
Hi, Son.

454
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,470
Right now?

455
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,180
Okay. I'll be back soon.

456
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,780
I'm sorry, but I have to head back.

457
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,090
- Go ahead.
- I'll see you again soon.

458
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,350
Bye.

459
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,220
Goodbye.

460
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Geon.

461
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,940
- Dad!
- My boy, Jo Geon.

462
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,740
Were you at the hospital with Mom?

463
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,280
Did that man give you the bread?

464
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,780
Yes.

465
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,360
Who are you?

466
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,470
"In a world of righties,
a leftie is abnormal."

467
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,500
That's what my aunt's husband told me...

468
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,270
when I lived with them in college.

469
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,340
He asked why I ate with my left hand,
that it was bad luck.

470
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,710
That's when I learned...

471
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,480
I should follow society,

472
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,350
that I can't get society to suit me.

473
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,780
I practiced so hard.

474
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,620
I've done everything
with my right hand since then.

475
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,720
Only one person knows
I used to be left-handed.

476
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,160
I'll go ahead if we're done.

477
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,730
Stop right there!

478
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,600
Baek Sul Hee.

479
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,630
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

480
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,550
Memories remain.
They can't be erased or cut out.

481
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,150
Baek Sul Hee.
I don't know why you came back,

482
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,780
but you won't get your way.

483
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,920
Do you know me well enough
to trust me to the end?

484
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,090
You don't need to know someone
to trust them.

485
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,320
You really found my mom?

486
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,460
So soon?

487
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,730
You found nothing while you worked...

488
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,430
at Mingang for the past four years.

489
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,260
The crucial proof might be somewhere else.

490
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,400
Somewhere else?
