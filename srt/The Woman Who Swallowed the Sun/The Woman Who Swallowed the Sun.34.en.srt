00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,740
(Episode 34)

2
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,350
Are you all right?

3
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,850
Get in. I'll take you back to work.

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,420
I'll go ahead, then.

5
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,070
Wait and see.

6
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,300
Soon, you'll tell everyone
you're Baek Sul Hee.

7
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,360
Hello?

8
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,530
Where are you?

9
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,730
Your business trip was cancelled.

10
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,670
What is it? Is something wrong?

11
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,540
Ms. Lucia.

12
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,780
Where are you? I'll come and get you.

13
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,510
Did you do something
to stop her from coming?

14
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,920
Was slapping her
where others could see not enough?

15
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,920
Did she tell you that too?

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,520
As if she did.

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,820
How dare the CEO resort to violence
when she should know better?

18
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,960
And at work too.

19
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,890
I hit her because she deserved it.

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,660
How dare you say that?

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,030
You said people should be used,
not trusted.

22
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,370
We should use Lucia, not trust her.

23
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,870
It depends on the person.

24
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,040
You should trust those who earned it.

25
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,770
You said there was no reason...

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,040
you couldn't date Lucia.

27
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,940
How could you say that to my face?

28
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,080
Is it wrong to be in love?

29
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,980
I can't help that I'm drawn to her.

30
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,180
Have you forgotten?

31
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,590
Who made me leave my boyfriend?

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,690
Who made me betray him?

33
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,620
Why do you think I became a workaholic
incapable of dating again?

34
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,590
You chose to leave him!

35
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,430
You made me choose.

36
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,430
Don't you remember
what you did to me in the US?

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,170
When I asked
if it was wrong to be in love,

38
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,700
you told me it was wrong!

39
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,540
Because you had fallen for a useless fool!

40
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,640
No. He was my heart and soul.

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,810
He was the only man
I loved unconditionally.

42
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,650
You can never say to me
that you love someone...

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,880
or that you wish to date again.

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,420
Not if you have a conscience.

45
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,420
If you want a companion, hire one.

46
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,390
I can accept that.

47
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,830
What did you say? How dare you?

48
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,910
You said you'd never accept it
if we did anything to harm the company.

49
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,740
I say that right back at you.

50
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,850
If you and Lucia get any closer
and pose a risk to Mingang,

51
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,980
I won't forgive you either, Father.

52
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,440
Ms. Lucia. Are you all right?

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,480
Did something happen to you?

54
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,830
The business trip was a ruse, then.

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,390
Goodness.

56
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,430
Just how...

57
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,570
I don't get it.

58
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,440
Ms. Min and Mr. Kim...

59
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,510
have no reason to do this to you.

60
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,010
They do have some kind of reason.

61
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,410
What's that?

62
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,350
You won't be able to understand.

63
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,790
Talk to me. I'll listen at least,
if I can't understand.

64
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,260
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,230
It's okay.

66
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,800
They say people write lies
even in journals they keep for themselves.

67
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,310
Everyone has a secret or two,

68
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,010
and there are circumstances
you can't tell anyone about.

69
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,280
So don't feel bad.

70
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,290
Just remember, I'll be the bamboo forest
you can whisper your secret to.

71
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,260
If you ever want to scream or cry,

72
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,860
come to me.

73
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,660
I'll listen to anything you say.

74
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,040
Father has feelings for her?

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,420
It's not a small matter.

76
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,850
People mistakenly think Father
is the worst playboy that's ever lived,

77
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,120
but he's actually a die-hard romantic.

78
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,530
Let's say my mom was a gold digger
who got to him on purpose.

79
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,030
He never revealed Se Ri's birth mom.

80
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,030
That means your mom
was the only love of his life.

81
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,430
You don't know anything.

82
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,970
Isn't that why you're stressed out?

83
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,010
If Lucia were a gold digger
who approached Father...

84
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,240
for money, she'd be easier to get rid of,

85
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,480
but she's not.

86
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,410
And Father is serious about her.

87
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,820
Keep your mouth shut.
It's none of your business.

88
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,150
I thought I could be of help to you.

89
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,590
Maybe not. Good luck, then.

90
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,510
What did he say that was so upsetting?

91
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,610
I feel much better now,
thanks to Director Moon.

92
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,650
Moon Tae Kyung?

93
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,050
He's your knight in shining armor.

94
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,320
Did Kim Sun Jae
curse you out or something?

95
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,360
He told me...

96
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,590
how Mi So died.

97
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,060
With great detail.

98
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,400
He's a psycho.

99
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,300
How dare he bring up...

100
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Why would he tell you that now?

101
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,280
He knows how to get me riled up.

102
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,610
How can someone be that evil?

103
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,780
I must ask, purely out of curiosity.

104
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,850
Is he really the father of your daughter?

105
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,030
I wasn't sure,
but I guess the moron has no idea.

106
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,560
He's working for the people
who got his daughter killed.

107
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,470
(Mingang Distribution)

108
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,750
Hello, Ms. Lucia.

109
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,880
Do you feel better?

110
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,750
I can't come into work today.

111
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,690
You haven't recovered yet?

112
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,160
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,230
Don't apologize. Rest up.

114
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,860
Bye.

115
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,770
Ms. Lucia is not here yet?

116
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,740
What happened yesterday?

117
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,950
What do you mean?

118
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,810
We didn't do much.

119
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,850
You know the business trip got cancelled.

120
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,750
I know that.
The business trip got cancelled,

121
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,990
but why did you leave a colleague
in the street in distress?

122
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,820
What did you do to her...

123
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,200
We need to talk.

124
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,140
Why are those two always so serious?

125
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,910
Why do I feel left out?

126
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,320
Hey, Director Moon.

127
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,350
Who are you
that you're so invested in her well-being?

128
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,120
Aren't you too nosy?

129
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm not being nosy.

130
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,670
Is it a personal interest?

131
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,200
I'm doing what a superior should do
for his subordinate.

132
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,140
A sudden business trip
that I didn't know about...

133
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,870
as her direct supervisor is problematic.

134
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,940
Then something happened
that upset her enough to call in sick,

135
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,680
and no one told me anything.

136
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,280
Who do you think you are
that you should be informed?

137
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,880
The CEO ordered the business trip,

138
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,850
but we heard en route
that it got cancelled.

139
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,720
She complained that she didn't feel well,
so I let her out of the car,

140
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,120
and I drove on home. That's all.

141
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,930
Is that really it?

142
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,460
What does that mean?

143
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,800
Why are you so hostile...

144
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,600
to Ms. Lucia of all people?

145
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,170
Let me ask you something.

146
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Why are you so kind to her?

147
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,270
You said it wasn't a personal interest.

148
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,640
Is there an ulterior motive?

149
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,880
"An ulterior motive?" Watch what you say.

150
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,810
Do you love her, then?

151
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,610
I told you to watch what you said!

152
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,820
What are you two doing?

153
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,690
Why did you raise your voice?
That's not like you.

154
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,700
The business trip to Cheongju.
I believe it was your idea.

155
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,260
Is it true it got cancelled?

156
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,800
What are you saying?

157
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,940
That I made up a trip
that didn't exist to toy with someone?

158
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,640
Mr. Kim Sun Jae.

159
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,180
I knew he didn't like me or Ms. Lucia
from the start,

160
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,080
but if he acts like this at every turn...

161
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,450
I get how much
you care about your subordinates,

162
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,850
but as a director, shouldn't your priority
be to serve your superior?

163
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,920
You seem to think
all my orders come from malice.

164
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm not just your superior.

165
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,460
If you know...

166
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,530
how hard I fought for you for four years,
you shouldn't act like this.

167
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,940
Don't anger me again.

168
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,950
Have you forgotten?

169
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,320
Who made me leave my boyfriend?

170
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,460
Who made me betray him?

171
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,360
Why do you think I became a workaholic
incapable of dating again?

172
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,530
He was my heart and soul.

173
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,800
He was the only man
I loved unconditionally.

174
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,670
You can never say to me
that you love someone...

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,870
or that you wish to date again.

176
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,600
Not if you have a conscience.

177
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,340
She still isn't over him.

178
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,010
If she were...

179
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,480
to find out he's no longer with us...

180
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,570
(Jung Lucia)

181
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You said you'd never accept it
if we did anything to harm the company.

182
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,640
I say that right back at you.

183
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,540
If you and Lucia get any closer
and pose a risk to Mingang,

184
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,310
I won't forgive you either, Father.

185
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,450
(Jung Lucia)

186
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,590
Connecting to voicemail.

187
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,860
Hello, it's me, sir.

188
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,590
You're not picking up.

189
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,160
Is everything okay?

190
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,500
I called to see how you were.

191
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,630
Call me when you can.

192
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,530
Why is this out here?

193
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,400
That was my son's lover.

194
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,140
They were madly in love.

195
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,870
They'd even...

196
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,740
scheduled to get married.

197
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,680
Did Min Kyung Chae betray him?

198
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
And that's why your son
was in an accident?

199
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,850
I can't forgive her...

200
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,790
because she must've loved him at one time.

201
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,460
Did she have to do that to him?

202
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,790
The evil thing.

203
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,700
She returned to Korea
after the accident...

204
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,030
and joined Mingang to succeed her father.

205
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,200
She swapped love for ambition,

206
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,870
though I'm sure
Min Doo Sik played a part in it.

207
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,950
When you said
your son's accident didn't seem right...

208
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,380
It was a premeditated murder
disguised as an accident.

209
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,250
Min Doo Sik must've
spent a fortune to cover it up.

210
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,390
I couldn't find out anything.

211
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,630
When I miss Ho Se too much,

212
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,700
I wish he'd have left behind
a child that looked like him.

213
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,540
I can't imagine how dreadful it would be
to be called a grandmother,

214
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,480
but a child of my Ho Se...

215
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,150
I could love them to bits.

216
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,750
Here you go.

217
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,190
What's this?

218
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,630
You haven't seen gimbap before?

219
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,660
I got up at dawn...

220
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,970
to get groceries and make this for you.

221
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Say, "Ah."

222
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,710
Say, "Ah."

223
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,810
How is it?

224
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,150
It's good.

225
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,220
You bet. It should be good.
Your mom made it for you.

226
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,050
It had better be good.

227
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,760
It's from a diner where you have to
wait for a long time to get in.

228
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,230
Take your time and chew carefully.

229
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,030
It feels weird. This is a first for me.

230
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,400
My gosh.

231
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,700
Your family is weird.

232
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,570
How did no one make you gimbap?

233
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,110
You said your oldest sister
cared a lot about you.

234
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,250
She's busy
and doesn't have the time for this.

235
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,420
You poor thing.

236
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,660
I can make this for you every day.

237
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,830
Eat all you want.

238
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,030
Shall I have a piece too?

239
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,150
Welcome.

240
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,820
Stay for some tea.

241
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,220
Okay.

242
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,590
Someone moved into your parents' place.

243
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,090
I can't think of anyone who'd do that.

244
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,330
The room you used until you got married.

245
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,930
They decided to rent it out.

246
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,860
I heard about that.

247
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,670
They found a tenant? Who is it?

248
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,130
Well...

249
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,270
I wouldn't know that much.

250
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,510
Can I see you tomorrow?

251
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,380
Yes.

252
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,580
Okay.

253
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,210
I was so worried, I couldn't focus today.

254
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,290
Promise to do what I couldn't finish
when you come in tomorrow.

255
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,020
I'll do that.

256
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,760
You promised, okay?

257
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,260
I guess I can slack off tomorrow.

258
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,730
Yes?

259
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,170
Good night. See you tomorrow.

260
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,700
Can I help you, ma'am?

261
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,640
Who were you talking to?

262
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,770
Your girlfriend?

263
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,140
What?

264
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,510
No.

265
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,550
Join us for dinner
if you haven't eaten yet.

266
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,180
I don't feel like eating with my husband.

267
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,220
No, thanks.

268
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,860
Don't mind me. Enjoy a cozy dinner.

269
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,190
"Cozy?" My foot.

270
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,030
It would be cozier with you.

271
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,230
No, but I...

272
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,360
Come on.

273
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Goodness.

274
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,570
- Sit down.
- Good grief.

275
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,870
Why bother someone who said no?

276
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,270
This isn't a dorm.

277
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,710
What landlord provides meals too?

278
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,310
Don't be like that.

279
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,710
It's good to be generous.

280
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,550
You upset so many people,

281
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,080
you might end up in Hades.

282
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,380
Do you eat doenjang with sushi?

283
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,320
Is it wrong to lend money
to struggling people?

284
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,850
You take an interest off the top...

285
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,660
and demand collateral.

286
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,330
Woman. Remember that I play
rock-paper-scissors with a fist.

287
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,790
Darn you.

288
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,230
Stop it.

289
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,830
You make me feel uncomfortable.

290
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,800
How about I pay you extra for the meals?

291
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,900
That's a given. On top of that,
I forbid you to stop me.

292
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,510
I've been waiting for the right time
to put this woman back in her place.

293
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,940
I think today is the day.

294
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,210
Fine, let's mark the day
on the calendar and celebrate it.

295
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,120
Yes, let's. I watched the movie
"Killing Wife" last night.

296
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,490
I could just...

297
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,160
Come on!

298
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,690
We'll eat at the small table from now on.

299
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,000
So you can flip it whenever you get angry?

300
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,370
I have many uses for my two fingers.

301
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,700
I have two arms, you know.

302
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,870
Fine. I lost.

303
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,140
Why you...

304
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,210
You, woman.

305
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,640
Here comes Oh Pan Sool's Fingers of Fury.

306
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,150
(Hankuk Hospital)

307
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,220
Isn't it time to renew the contracts
with our partners?

308
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,390
Director Moon will handle that.

309
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,960
I heard some weird rumors.

310
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,430
You heard?

311
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,230
I might be in here,
but that doesn't mean I'm deaf.

312
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,900
There's still some time.
Let's see how things go.

313
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,630
We call them partners,

314
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,870
but Miyeon and Woojin
are practically our subsidiaries.

315
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,310
They've worked with us for years.
Not renewing their deals is a betrayal.

316
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,540
Our competitors
are paying them extra to switch over.

317
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,510
You prove your worth
by maintaining what's yours.

318
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,580
We should be taking from others,

319
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,280
not losing what was ours,
because only a moron would do that.

320
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,720
Director Moon will handle that.

321
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,790
He's a competent man.

322
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,290
That's why we hired him,

323
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,220
but he's done nothing for us so far.

324
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,590
Darn it.

325
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,800
Ms. Lucia.

326
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,410
You can leave early if you're too tired.

327
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,780
I'll handle the rest.

328
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,710
Do you know how many times
you've said that?

329
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,820
Did I?

330
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,550
Yes, you did.

331
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,650
Don't worry.

332
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,460
I had a good day's rest,
and I feel so good I could fly.

333
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,830
I can't let you fly away.

334
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,500
Should I tie your wings or something?

335
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,070
You're great
in pretty much every other way,

336
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,740
but you tell the worst jokes.

337
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,070
"Every other way" how?

338
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,710
You need to go into detail
when you say something like that.

339
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,010
Don't fall ill.

340
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,180
And don't give an opening
to someone who wants to hurt you.

341
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,690
No one in the world
has the right to hurt anyone else.

342
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,990
When you say things like that.
That's when you're great.

343
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,590
When you console and support others.

344
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,530
I should work on my jokes, then.

345
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,640
Should I stay behind and study?

346
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,340
Goodness.

347
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,380
I rarely say something like this,

348
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,120
but why does the mood sour
whenever I come in?

349
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,750
You're wrong.

350
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,250
I'm not. You stopped talking
as soon as I came in.

351
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,930
See?

352
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,370
Ms. Lucia.

353
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,470
You look fine today.

354
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,500
What happened to you last time?

355
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,680
If you toy with me again,
I won't let it slide.

356
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,310
Who, me? I toyed with you?

357
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,080
Why? I have no reason to.

358
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,220
You shouldn't talk so freely
about other people.

359
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,950
What do you mean...

360
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,620
Oh, that accident.

361
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,030
It might be gossip to you,

362
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,830
but it's a heartbreaking tragedy
to others.

363
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,630
You can't talk about it like it's a joke.

364
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,870
Someone who just heard you would think...

365
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,100
you were that girl's mom.

366
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,670
Whether I am or not,

367
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,340
no one with a normal mindset
could talk like that.

368
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,140
Don't bring it up again.

369
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,150
That's a warning.

370
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,310
Okay, fine.

371
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,380
It's in the past,
and I had nothing to do with it.

372
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,820
But...

373
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,720
depending on what you do,

374
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,390
I will bring it up again if I need to.

375
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,830
I'm even willing
to go into more detail then.

376
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,140
The chairman is interested in
the upcoming contract renewals.

377
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,510
He's too proud a man to accept
losing a long-standing partnership.

378
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,290
If the rumors are true
and our competitors poached them...

379
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,690
Then we should
hold Director Moon responsible.

380
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,960
Why? Are you worried?

381
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,890
Do you think I'm worried for him?

382
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,800
Are you worried for me, then?

383
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,400
From the start,
I wasn't a fan of hiring him.

384
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,200
I was curious and expectant
to see how great he was,

385
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,000
but not anymore.

386
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,040
I defended him so far...

387
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,940
because I felt responsible
for hiring him, but that's it.

388
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,850
He stuck to his morals and principles
and didn't cause trouble.

389
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,780
That's the only good thing he did.

390
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,950
It all comes down
to the contract renewals.

391
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,150
The Online Business Team
could do with a personnel shuffle,

392
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,790
and that could provide
a good excuse to get rid of Lucia too.

393
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,500
(Jung Lucia)

394
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,650
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

395
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,950
There's no answer?

396
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,620
That's odd. Why can't you reach him?

397
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,020
I think he's avoiding me.

398
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
He has no reason to.

399
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,060
You said he flew into a rage
when he saw Kyung Chae had slapped you.

400
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,660
You said he was touched
by the food you packed.

401
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,630
Yes.

402
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,230
Why are you back to square one?

403
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,140
I thought you had him in your grasp.

404
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,410
Do you need an excuse to see him again?

405
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,240
No. I think that will make things worse.

406
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,620
I can't figure out what he's thinking.
He's so well-guarded.

407
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,230
Hello, it's me.

408
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,130
Can I see you right now?

409
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,100
Right now?

410
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,340
Why did you ask to see me?

411
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,710
You weren't wrong.

412
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,580
I should consider
what's best for the company.

413
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,420
Whatever happens, Mingang comes first.

414
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,390
I'm nothing without Mingang.

415
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,790
I thought I owed Lucia for saving my life.

416
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,030
I still think so.

417
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,970
However we make it look,
gossipers will talk.

418
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,300
Hanmyung Industries'
stock index plummeted...

419
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,240
after Chairman Jo married a woman
young enough to be his granddaughter.

420
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,500
What are you getting at?

421
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,280
Chairman.

422
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,960
Take that.

423
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,290
Thank you for saving my life.

424
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,330
Tell me if it's not enough.

425
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,530
I called you to give you that.
You can go now.

426
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,400
Don't just stand there. Leave.

427
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,340
Didn't you hear me?

428
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,810
Don't come here again.

429
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,270
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

430
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,380
You and I. We're even now.

431
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,920
I bet they made a deal about Lucia.

432
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,650
They're father and daughter,
and they're exactly alike.

433
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,320
If you make a deal with Father
and take the inheritance and Mingang too,

434
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,920
I won't see you ever again.

435
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,130
It would be best
to get her out of our sight.

436
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,760
Kyung Chae is my superior at work,

437
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,230
but I'm the eldest son.

438
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,000
I'll prevent Director Moon
from being replaced.

439
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,730
You are to become my father's lover.
