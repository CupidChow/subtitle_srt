00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,010
(Episode 83)

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,080
Se Ri!

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,480
Min Se Ri.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,520
Min Se Ri, where are you?

5
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,910
(Supply Room)

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,480
You shouldn't have pushed your luck.

7
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,010
Think long and hard in there...

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,680
about what you took from me...

9
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,250
and what a huge mistake that was.

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,560
I want you to stew on it
until it eats you alive.

11
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,270
Open the door! Open up!

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,170
I said, open the door right now!

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,570
- Open the door!
- Scream all you want.

14
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,440
- No one ever comes around here.
- I said, open the door!

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,280
But who knows?

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,610
If you're lucky,

17
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,920
you might get out within a week.

18
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,140
Is anyone out there?

19
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,310
Someone's trapped in here!
In here! There's someone in here, I said!

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,750
Hello! Is anyone out there?

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Hello!

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,380
She said she'd be right back.
What's going on?

23
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,430
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

24
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,330
Did something happen to her?

25
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,540
Excuse me, have you seen Lucia?
No, I mean...

26
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,780
- Has anyone seen the CEO?
- The CEO? She must be in her office.

27
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,740
Obviously I'm asking
because she's not there.

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,980
Excuse me, does anyone know
where the CEO is?

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,020
I'm not sure. We've been in the office
the whole time.

30
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,790
There is one person
who just got back, though.

31
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,390
That's right.
She left without saying where she went,

32
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,360
and she was gone for a while.

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,030
What? Am I not allowed a private life?

34
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,270
Min Kyung Chae,

35
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,500
have you seen the CEO, by any chance?

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,140
No, I haven't.

37
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,510
You haven't?

38
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,780
So you're saying
you really haven't seen her?

39
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,280
How many times do I have to tell you?
I said I haven't.

40
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,710
Where on earth could she be? Seriously.

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,180
At this rate, we're going
to miss the meeting.

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,890
The Doil Department Store meeting?

43
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,520
That's just a provisional contract.
We need the final contract signed today.

44
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,660
I know! That's why I'm trying
to find the CEO!

45
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,990
She definitely said she'd be right back.

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,700
If she went off the grid right before
an important meeting, isn't it obvious?

47
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,530
She probably got scared
now that she's in the CEO's chair.

48
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,600
It's not easy doing a job
she's not cut out for.

49
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,640
Watch your mouth.
The CEO would never shirk her duties.

50
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,180
Something must have happened to her.

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,850
CEO this, CEO that.

52
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,150
As if she's a real CEO.

53
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,900
What's with him?

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,400
Are you saying she's locked
in the supply room right now?

55
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,070
I'm not sure how long she'll last,
but she'll be in there for a while.

56
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,310
So that's why Moon Tae Kyung was
frantically searching for her.

57
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,480
Do you have any idea...

58
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,180
how hard I worked on the contract
with Doil Department Store?

59
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,920
I practically sold my soul
to land that provisional contract.

60
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,290
They acted so high and mighty,
all because they're a Big Three store.

61
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,790
Bragging that even if they're not
on our platform,

62
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,830
their sales are already through the roof.

63
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,600
I put up with all of that, flattered them,

64
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,870
and finally got that provisional contract.

65
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,170
And I'm supposed to just stand by
while that woman swoops in and takes it?

66
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,470
Wait, so what happens to our deal then?

67
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,110
It has to fall through.

68
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,180
That's how it becomes
the new CEO's first official failure.

69
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,380
I'll use that as an excuse for the board
to oust the incompetent new CEO,

70
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,650
and then I can make my return.

71
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,150
Wait, that was your plan all along?

72
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,320
If that deal goes south,

73
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,190
someone's head is going to roll.

74
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,690
Do you know how much money is at stake?

75
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,960
You never fail to impress.

76
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,400
Did you really think
I would go down that easily?

77
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,470
Can I see the security footage?
I know you can't leave the building...

78
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,640
without going through the lobby,
and someone is missing.

79
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,410
- Who are you looking for?
- Jung Lucia.

80
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,280
I mean, the new CEO.

81
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,390
It's confirmed,
she didn't leave the building.

82
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,790
We can see her getting off the elevator
on the third floor,

83
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
but after that...

84
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
The third floor?

85
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,470
Then why can't you see
what happened after that?

86
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,100
The camera on that floor
broke a few years ago.

87
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,280
Since the third floor is just for supplies
and is mostly abandoned,

88
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,880
I guess they don't think it's necessary,
so the repairs are a low priority.

89
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,070
Is anyone out there?

90
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,030
Hello?

91
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,340
Someone's in here!

92
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,040
Hello?

93
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,180
Is anybody out there?

94
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,950
Someone's in here!

95
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,020
(Mechanical Room)

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Where on earth could she be?

97
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,420
(Tae Kyung)

98
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,990
(Tae Kyung)

99
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,660
What's this doing here?

100
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,630
Then that means she's nearby.

101
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,140
Don't tell me...

102
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,550
Please, open the door!

103
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,620
- Please!
- Lucia?

104
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,020
Tae Kyung?

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,270
Tae Kyung, it's me! I'm in here!

106
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,330
Hang on. I'll get you out of there.

107
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,510
(Supply Room)

108
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,830
Oh my gosh, what happened?
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

109
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,270
I'm okay.

110
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,010
More importantly, what about the meeting?

111
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,040
There's still time.
Don't worry, we haven't missed it.

112
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,740
That's a relief.

113
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,320
Min Kyung Chae did this.
I saw a glimpse, but I'm sure it was her.

114
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,750
She lured me here
and locked me in on purpose.

115
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,460
What?

116
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,960
She wanted me to miss the meeting
so she could question my fitness as CEO.

117
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,800
I can't believe her.

118
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,500
How can someone be so malicious?

119
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,530
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

120
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,540
She's just like Chairman Min Doo Sik.

121
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,900
Let's focus on the meeting for now.

122
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,440
If we don't get
that contract signed today, it's over.

123
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,640
She'll call a board meeting over this
and try to have me removed.

124
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,810
We can't let that happen.

125
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,780
We can confront her later.
Let's get this contract signed first.

126
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,130
That was a close call.
Are you sure you don't need a doctor?

127
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,860
I'm just a little shaken, that's all.

128
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,130
What would you have done
if he hadn't found you?

129
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,330
You definitely owe Tae Kyung
a lot for this.

130
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,170
I should be going now.

131
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,110
I have to let my team go home for the day.

132
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,510
All right. I'll see you later.

133
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,220
He must have been worried sick about you.
Look at him, he's a wreck.

134
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,690
I guess I'm putting Tae Kyung
through a lot.

135
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,930
If you know that,
then you should treat him well.

136
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,930
Later, when all of this is over,

137
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,240
you should be with him
as Moon Tae Kyung and Jung Lucia.

138
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,310
No, as Moon Tae Kyung and Baek Sul Hee.

139
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,710
No, wait.

140
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,440
Just start fresh as a man and a woman.

141
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,910
I'll be rooting for you.

142
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,210
I can't do that.

143
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,120
I don't have the right to.

144
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,600
What is this, a staring contest?
Why's everyone just watching each other?

145
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,430
It's past quitting time,
but Director Moon is running late.

146
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,170
I wonder if the Doil Department Store deal
fell through.

147
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,340
He's at a key meeting, and it feels wrong
to leave before he gets back.

148
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,340
We've waited this long.
What's a little longer?

149
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,410
The Doil Department Store deal
is our project.

150
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,050
If they close the deal,
we'll be the ones handling it.

151
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,880
You're celebrating
before the deal is even done.

152
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,050
And why shouldn't we get our hopes up?

153
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,330
Sorry for keeping you all late.

154
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,830
Never mind that, how did it go?
Did you get the contract signed?

155
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,130
Great work today, everyone.
You can all head home.

156
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,040
- Right.
- Seriously. Did you get the contract?

157
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,910
See you all tomorrow.
Now, hurry and get home.

158
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,480
Have a good night.

159
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,550
So she was right.
Was I getting my hopes up for nothing?

160
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,080
Told you so.

161
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,220
Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

162
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,620
Could you stay behind for a minute?

163
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,330
Aren't you curious about
the results of today's meeting?

164
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,070
Should I be?

165
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,530
Of course you should.

166
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
You're on the online business team now.

167
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,670
Is there anything more important to us
than this deal?

168
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,010
I wouldn't know.

169
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,940
I still don't really feel like...

170
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,580
the online business team is my department.

171
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,820
No, that's not it.

172
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,690
It's because you knew
what would happen today.

173
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,290
You already knew the outcome, didn't you?

174
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,690
What are you talking about?

175
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,260
I know you're upset about your position.

176
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,330
But how could you
sabotage this contract...

177
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,560
and do something like that?

178
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,730
I have no idea what you're talking about.

179
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,170
Someone could have gotten killed
because of what you did.

180
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,240
Are you saying a person's life
means nothing to people like you?

181
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,280
It depends on whose life it is.

182
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,210
A person's death can be meaningless
or it can be noble.

183
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,020
What did you just say?
Why on earth would you...

184
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,250
abandon your own humanity like this?
Why? For what?

185
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,750
Shut your mouth! You don't know anything.

186
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,290
What could you possibly know?

187
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,960
Shut my mouth?

188
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,270
This is as far as I'm going today.

189
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,580
Consider yourself lucky.

190
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Got it?

191
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,350
If you'd been a man,

192
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,920
I would’ve beaten you to within an inch
of your life for what you did today.

193
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
By the way, Lucia.

194
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,240
There's something I'm dying to know.
Why did you go to that supply room?

195
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,380
I told you earlier.
I got a text from Se Ri.

196
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,750
That's exactly why I'm asking.
What could that text have possibly said...

197
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,890
that made you skip an important meeting
and rush over there to save her?

198
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,720
This is exactly what I was worried about.

199
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,590
People? No...

200
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,100
Let's not get philosophical.

201
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,870
A mother with a heart like yours,
even if you take in your daughter's enemy,

202
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,740
if you live with her
and raise her like your own,

203
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,940
you're bound to develop a maternal bond.

204
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,940
With someone to pour that love into,
how can a mother-daughter bond not form?

205
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,180
Don't say things like that!
Our Mi So would be upset to hear that.

206
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,320
- Maternal feelings?
- Lucia.

207
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,920
That's ridiculous. I'm telling you.
Even now, when I look at her,

208
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,490
I'm reminded of the day my Mi So died.

209
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,660
Maternal feelings?

210
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,930
How could I possibly feel motherly
toward a girl like that?

211
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,830
For me, my maternal love...

212
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,330
is reserved for my dear Mi So,
and that's all.

213
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,150
A mother with a heart like yours,

214
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,790
even if you take in your daughter's enemy,

215
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,150
if you live with her
and raise her like your own,

216
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,360
you're bound to develop a maternal bond.

217
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,360
No, why would I?

218
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,030
She's the reason Mi So is gone.

219
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,940
Mom.

220
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Some water.

221
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,440
Get it yourself.

222
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,610
Mom, what's gotten into you today?

223
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,650
Why did you send that text earlier?

224
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,650
Is it fun for you to mess with people
with fake texts?

225
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,790
I didn't send you a text.

226
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,230
Even though I have it right here from you?

227
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,530
No, it wasn't me.

228
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,030
That's weird.

229
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,870
I swear, it wasn't me.
Why would I send something like this?

230
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,240
So you're saying you didn't send it?

231
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,110
I'm serious.
Why would I do a thing like that?

232
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,380
You were home all day today, right?

233
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,780
And you didn't see anyone else?

234
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,790
Then there's only one person in this house
who would do something like this.

235
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,160
Se Ri, go on up to your room.

236
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,800
Have a seat.

237
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,240
I'll get straight to the point.

238
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,010
I want you out of this house.

239
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,610
What are you talking about?

240
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,110
Do I need to spell it out for you?

241
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,150
- I said, get out of this house!
- Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

242
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,590
Pack your bags and get out right now!

243
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Why?

244
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,560
What did I do wrong?

245
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,900
- You really have to ask?
- Yes, I do.

246
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,810
Tell me what on earth I did
to deserve this!

247
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,270
How despicable.

248
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,340
Excuse me?

249
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,910
I said you're despicable.

250
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,310
Sending a text like that
from Se Ri's phone.

251
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,520
Is that any way
for a grown woman to behave?

252
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,150
I have no idea what you're talking about.

253
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,060
I don't know
what's made you so angry, but...

254
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,330
- I'm being framed!
- Get out! Now!

255
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,130
No. I'm not leaving.

256
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,500
I'm not leaving
until the chairman comes home.

257
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,900
The chairman isn't coming home today.

258
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,040
A friend's mother died.
He returns tomorrow.

259
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,880
Just leave.
I'll explain everything to the chairman.

260
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,940
I have served this family
for thirty years.

261
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,050
- You can't just throw me out like this.
- Do you want to be dragged out?

262
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,150
Hey!

263
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,590
Are we really just going to
let her kick Manager Gong out?

264
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,360
The lady of the house is
telling her to leave.

265
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,590
I know, but still.
Kicking her out overnight isn't right.

266
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,360
You have to have some common courtesy.

267
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,400
Kyung Chae won't stand for this
if she finds out.

268
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,800
Of course. Manager Gong is her right hand.
She's not going to let this slide.

269
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,740
So, should we try to
stop her from leaving?

270
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,040
She'll just come back
once Kyung Chae gets here anyway.

271
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,140
Right, darling. Let's stop her.

272
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,140
Why don't we just stay out of it?

273
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,750
You two should just sit back
and enjoy the show.

274
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,750
And what's that supposed to mean?

275
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,390
You're the one who said it.
You can't fight the tide.

276
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,100
Wait, are you saying that Moon Tae Kyung
yelled at you and threatened you?

277
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,900
What, do you think I'm making it up?

278
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,810
- That bastard!
- That's not what's important right now.

279
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,210
If Moon Tae Kyung was the one
who rescued her,

280
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,150
- then the Doil Department Store deal...
- But didn't that fall through?

281
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,950
We don't know that for sure yet.

282
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
Yes, Manager Gong.

283
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,630
Ms. Kyung Chae.

284
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
I've been kicked out.

285
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,630
Kicked out?

286
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,870
That woman told me to get out.

287
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,800
She tells you to leave, so you just leave?

288
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,870
What was I supposed to do?
She looked like she'd tear my head off.

289
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,910
Where are you right now?

290
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,650
You were told to leave.
What are you doing back here?

291
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,360
I'm the one who told her to come in.

292
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,690
Manager Gong is like family to us.

293
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,030
Like family, maybe, but she's not family.

294
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,670
Get her out.

295
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,240
I won't have a schemer pulling tricks
under my roof.

296
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,010
She played a nasty little trick
using Se Ri's phone.

297
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,080
Though I'm sure
someone else put her up to it.

298
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,550
Thanks to her,

299
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,150
I was trapped in a warehouse
and nearly died.

300
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,120
Manager Gong did all of that
on someone else's orders.

301
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,220
Which, if you think about it,
makes the one who ordered it even worse.

302
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,260
I have no idea what you're talking about.

303
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,430
Don't go around accusing people
without any concrete proof.

304
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,070
That's a bad habit to get into.

305
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,900
What are you waiting for?
Go on and unpack.

306
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,470
Where do you think you're going?

307
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,940
I told you to go unpack.
What are you still doing here?

308
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,640
You're making a huge mistake.

309
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,780
Do you think I'm just going
to let this slide?

310
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,510
And what if you don't?

311
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,380
What, you have proof or something?

312
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,790
Next time you want to get rid of someone,
make sure you have some concrete evidence.

313
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,730
Let's go, Manager Gong.

314
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,940
Enjoy your meal!

315
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,580
Yeon Ah,
who is from the same hometown as me.

316
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,950
What are you so focused on?

317
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,450
The calendar.
My niece's birthday is coming up.

318
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,420
And it looks like it's already next week.

319
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,060
She's not your kid or your partner.
Why all the fuss over a niece?

320
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,930
To me, she's more than my own child.

321
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,560
My, what a thing
for an unmarried woman to say.

322
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,470
More than your own child?
That's not right.

323
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,400
You should get married and have a baby.

324
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,500
That's the real deal.

325
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,170
But still, my niece is like
my own daughter.

326
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,710
She's always seen me more as a mother
than an aunt.

327
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,880
So how old is your niece?

328
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,050
She'd be 20, if she were still alive.

329
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,320
Goodness, you mean
she's already passed away?

330
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,050
So young, too.

331
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,960
My goodness!

332
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Your poor sister.

333
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,330
There's nothing more tragic than a mother
who has to bury her own child.

334
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,500
So, speaking of which,
is it okay if I take a day off next week?

335
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,030
My sister and I need to go visit her.

336
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,170
Of course, of course.
You take the day off.

337
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,570
Hey now, young lady.
You know, we're so busy with customers.

338
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,010
If you suddenly take off, it's going to be
a bit of a, you know, problem.

339
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,650
You should find a temp to, you know,
cover for you before you go.

340
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,880
Oh Pan Sool, enough with the "you knows."

341
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,320
You can't take your money to your grave.

342
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,290
I keep telling you I'm taking it with me.
The Grim Reaper loves getting bribed.

343
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
The king of the fiery pits loves
a good bribe!

344
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,060
Even in the fiery pits, money talks.

345
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,130
Oh, for crying out loud!

346
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,660
Stop it, you two.
The customers are watching.

347
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,100
Anyway, like I was saying,
I'm taking one day off next week.

348
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,070
Right, you take the day off.
And you can go straight to the fiery pits!

349
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,470
You're coming with me.

350
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,310
What are you talking about?
I'm going to the good place!

351
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,940
Then I'll go there with you.

352
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,910
You got in so late last night,
I wasn't able to tell you.

353
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,680
About the Doil Department Store contract.

354
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,120
That's right. How did that turn out?

355
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,990
I'm sick of everyone asking me
about it everywhere I go.

356
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,620
Doil Department Store is so
full of themselves.

357
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,190
With their luxury wing and everything.

358
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,290
They think they're the number one
department store in Korea or something.

359
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,960
I closed the deal.

360
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,460
You did?

361
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,400
Kyung Chae worked so hard on that
and only managed a provisional contract.

362
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,170
Although it almost fell through.

363
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,380
The truth is, I was locked
in a warehouse yesterday.

364
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,510
Someone locked me in there...

365
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,610
to try and sabotage the deal.

366
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,220
Who would do such a thing?

367
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,450
It couldn't be...

368
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,960
Someone didn't want me to get the credit
for closing the deal.

369
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,090
And my collapse
during the live broadcast...

370
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,360
was also a deliberate incident.

371
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,960
What do you mean by that?

372
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:42,280
They rigged the raffle on the livestream
so we'd pick the spicy seafood stew.

373
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,280
They did it on purpose,
knowing I have a seafood allergy.

374
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,220
As you can see,

375
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,990
it's designed so that it's impossible
to pick any of the other products.

376
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,800
The shopping host scheduled for that day
suddenly went AWOL,

377
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,400
so I had no choice
but to do the taste test myself.

378
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,070
Are you telling me my daughter Kyung Chae
is behind all of this?

379
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,270
We found the shopping host
and confirmed everything.

380
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,280
That little brat!

381
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,750
So, that brings me to my next point.

382
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,550
I think it's time we made a decision...

383
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,750
about Kyung Chae's future with us.

384
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,400
I know you've all been wondering...

385
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,330
about the Doil Department Store deal.

386
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,330
We've secured the contract.

387
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,270
Incredible!

388
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,180
I tried to give you every chance,

389
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,240
but I was clearly mistaken.

390
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,050
I guess a leopard really
can't change its spots.

391
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,720
You need to reflect on what you've done
and show some remorse.

392
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,660
You need some time to do that,
Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

393
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,690
On that note,

394
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,000
I'd like to give you that time.

395
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,270
Listen closely, Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

396
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,270
This is an order from the CEO
of Mingang Distribution.

397
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,110
You...

398
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,940
are fired.

399
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,250
Fire me? Says who?

400
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,220
Whose company do you think this is?

401
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,290
You had until the end of the month
to resign with some dignity,

402
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,420
but clearly, that's not an option.

403
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,730
You...

404
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,290
are fired. Effective immediately.

405
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,210
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

406
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,400
Haven't you done enough?
Stop this. Right now.

407
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,230
No. I'm just getting started.

408
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,370
So, does this mean Jung Lucia is
calling the shots at Mingang now?

409
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,840
So you'd better grovel.

410
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,540
It looks like Lucia thinks of Se Ri
as her own daughter.

411
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,310
It's your birthday today?

412
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,810
Then again, who'd remember the birthday
of someone like me?

413
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,210
How can she and my Mi So share a birthday?

414
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,480
What is this fateful connection?

415
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,350
