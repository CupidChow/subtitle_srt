1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,610
Mr. Jo!

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,610
Mr. Jo!

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,910
Mr. Jo.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,020
Mr. Jo.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,050
Mr. Jo!

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,650
Mr. Jo, come on, wake up!

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,490
Mr. Jo!

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,830
Mr. Jo, wake up! Mr. Jo!

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,030
Hey! Mr. Jo!

10
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,200
Mr. Jo!

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,370
Mr. Jo!

12
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,610
You should enjoy being this happy today.

13
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,580
All the evil things you've done,

14
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,590
you'll be paying for them soon enough.

15
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,870
I barely got through that wedding.
Darn it.

16
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,410
Who knew I'd live to see my own
father-in-law's wedding?

17
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,680
It's all in how you look at it.

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,010
People live to 100 now. He's not that old.

19
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,480
And getting remarried
is hardly news anymore.

20
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,320
Hey, that's not cool.

21
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,560
I don't know what you were thinking
pushing for this ridiculous wedding,

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,420
but it'll come back to haunt you.

23
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,400
What's done is done.
I just hope they move out.

24
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,630
This is Dad's house.
We're the ones living under his roof.

25
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,500
We need to get our facts straight.

26
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,940
Exactly. Once Dad and Mom move in,
we'll be the outsiders.

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,510
Calling her "Mom" just rolls right
off your tongue, doesn't it?

28
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,820
Oh, dear.

29
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
Have a seat.

30
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,900
I told you we should've gone
to a nice resort to relax.

31
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,770
Some other time.

32
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,200
Who ever heard of a honeymoon
that's just one night in a city hotel?

33
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,070
Actually, my original plan was
to skip this and go straight home.

34
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,780
So unromantic.

35
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,980
What, you couldn't wait another day
to live with me?

36
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,880
Couldn't you tell?

37
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,980
What would I have done
if we hadn't gotten married?

38
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,770
I hear some grooms carry their new brides
up the hotel stairs.

39
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,740
It's a shame
this old groom can't do that for you.

40
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,740
There's nothing to feel bad about.

41
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,440
Nobody does that anymore.

42
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,680
Instead of following old trends,
we can just do things our own way.

43
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,260
Hold on.

44
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,750
Oh my.

45
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,750
Why am I suddenly so tired?

46
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,990
What's happening to me?

47
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,870
Chairman?

48
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
What?

49
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,300
Gosh.

50
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,040
- Oh my.
- Wake up.

51
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,760
My head hurts.

52
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,320
So, you're finally awake?

53
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,160
What happened? When did you get up?

54
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,060
I can't remember a thing about last night.
What's wrong with me?

55
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,500
Last night, did I...

56
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,000
No, let me...

57
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,440
Our courtship was short,

58
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,610
and we had our share of ups and downs.

59
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,610
Honestly, it feels like I've been
through a war.

60
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,580
Well, that's true.

61
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,180
But last night, did I...

62
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,890
I want to be a good wife to you.

63
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,630
I may not be your first love,
but I want to be your last.

64
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,500
Is that too much to ask?

65
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,460
Why would that be too much to ask?

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,130
What, are you worried
I'll start seeing other women?

67
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,300
Is that a promise?

68
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,610
Then that's all I need.

69
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,280
I trust you.

70
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,010
Please change into these.
You can wear something comfortable.

71
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,680
I wore a Hanbok because I wanted
to look like a new bride.

72
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,290
The Hanbok looks lovely on you.

73
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,590
- But by any chance, last night, did I...
- Get changed and come out.

74
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,290
I'll go take care of the checkout.

75
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,210
Last night,

76
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,680
as your woman,

77
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
I was truly happy.

78
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,350
Really?

79
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,560
Why can't I remember anything? Gosh.

80
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,330
I guess so.

81
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
Why haven't I heard from you?
You said you'd call.

82
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,570
You're not my only case, you know.

83
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,200
I can't just focus on you.

84
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,510
How can you be so nonchalant
about a murder investigation?

85
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,880
And someone is dead.

86
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,650
How is there not one news story about it?
What the heck are the reporters doing?

87
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,220
"Nonchalant?"

88
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,490
Who's being nonchalant?

89
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,960
What a ridiculous thing to say.

90
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,930
And another thing.

91
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,160
Isn't it obvious why there are no stories
in the papers or online?

92
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,700
To be blunt, a homeless guy died.
That's hardly front-page news.

93
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,800
What did you just say?
"Some homeless guy?"

94
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,110
Do you have any idea how many
violent crime cases we're dealing with?

95
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,280
Just wait. I told you I'd call.

96
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,910
Jo Pil Doo's death wasn't an accident.
It was murder!

97
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,280
We're investigating cases
in the order they came in,

98
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,050
so you'll have to wait.

99
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,590
How long do you expect me to wait?

100
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,920
Hello?

101
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Hello?

102
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,300
- Ma'am!
- Se Ri.

103
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,940
Why are you still calling her that?

104
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,310
Oh, right. My bad.

105
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,550
You're home.

106
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,080
Is that all you're going to say?

107
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,750
Aren't you going to greet her properly?

108
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,450
What do you want? A formal bow?

109
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,920
Fine by me. Go on, do it.

110
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,390
A simple hello is enough of a greeting.
Being too formal can feel cold.

111
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,530
It's nice when a mother and daughter
are like friends.

112
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,600
Mother and daughter like friends, my foot.

113
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,070
She's really living it up.

114
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,410
Being casual is fine,
but you have to know your place.

115
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,880
I'll handle it.
It doesn't look good when you intervene.

116
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,810
You think so?

117
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,310
Managing the household
is your job now, anyway.

118
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,750
I asked you to get lunch ready.
How's it coming?

119
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,850
She wasn't able to eat any breakfast.

120
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,490
It's ready, sir.

121
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,390
- Why don't you rest a bit before we eat?
- Okay.

122
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,800
It must feel like
you're in a stranger's house, right?

123
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,810
You need to start making it feel
like home.

124
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,680
I don't mind if the house feels strange,

125
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,880
but family as strangers is worse.

126
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,950
What? Why would they feel like strangers?

127
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,580
You already know everyone.

128
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,090
I was a subordinate to the president
and the vice director.

129
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,190
That was just your rank at the company.

130
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,420
In this house, you outrank them.

131
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,190
That's easy for you to say.
Do you really think it works that way?

132
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,760
Then what was the point
of us getting married?

133
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,130
Do whatever you see fit.

134
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,170
What's there to worry about
when I've got your back?

135
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,820
If I can just figure out
who owns this handkerchief,

136
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,260
then I can find out who murdered Mr. Jo.

137
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,270
- I'm heading out.
- Have a good day.

138
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,280
Let's have a word.

139
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,360
The food has way too much MSG in it.

140
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,690
And the side dishes are store-bought.

141
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,630
Nobody's ever gotten sick from eating it.

142
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,070
It's not something that
makes you sick right away.

143
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,630
But it builds up in your body
and will cause problems eventually.

144
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,970
Even if it's a hassle,

145
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,640
you should make side dishes yourself.

146
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,580
I have to step out for a bit.

147
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,140
Why not clean the house while I'm gone?

148
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,050
If the two of you split the work,

149
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,950
no, on second thought,

150
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,880
there's one more person who does nothing.

151
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,990
Who does nothing?

152
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,720
Are you talking about my husband?

153
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,320
But we have a housekeeper coming.

154
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,030
I know.

155
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,560
But managing help is very different
when you know how to do the work yourself,

156
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,030
and when you don't.

157
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,870
I can tell just by looking around.
Only the most obvious spots are clean,

158
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,340
but all the stains are still there.

159
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,340
You don't know what your cleaner misses
or where she cuts corners, do you?

160
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,120
I bet you've never once supervised
the helpers while they work.

161
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,920
The mildew in the bathroom says it all.

162
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,160
Well, I suppose...

163
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,490
That's why you should do it.
Think of it as learning the ropes.

164
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,760
You have to know the work
to manage them properly.

165
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,570
I'll be back in two hours.

166
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,440
Get to it, you two.

167
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,320
Honey. Darling. Come on, wake up.

168
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,150
Gosh, what is it?

169
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,220
You know I didn't sleep
a wink last night...

170
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,090
because of all the stress with my father.

171
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,500
You're not going to believe this.
That woman told me to do the housework.

172
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,170
I mean, why should I have to do something
I've never done in my life?

173
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,470
Who did? That woman?

174
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,970
She said I must know the work to manage.

175
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,140
She's going out,

176
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,010
and she expects it done on her return.

177
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,040
And you're supposed to help, too.

178
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,810
- She said you fool around all day.
- What? She really said that?

179
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,920
- Gosh, has that woman lost her mind?
- What do I do? Honey, should I do it?

180
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,160
Forget it. Who does she think she is?
Don't do it.

181
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,360
If she says anything,
just tell her I told you not to.

182
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,890
- Then I'm not doing it, okay?
- Don't do it.

183
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,630
So, how did the first night go?
You did as I instructed, right?

184
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,830
I did it too last night.

185
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,770
Make Min Doo Sik drink this.

186
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,740
It'll make sure he stays dull at night.

187
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,050
Anyway, now that you've signed away
your rights to the shares,

188
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,080
we need to find a way
to nullify that agreement.

189
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,990
I signed them because of the marriage,

190
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,450
but he probably had them notarized.

191
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,760
That means they're legally binding.

192
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,360
The only way is
for him to destroy the papers himself.

193
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,460
Exactly.
He has to have a change of heart...

194
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,470
and hand over
the Minkang Distribution shares to you.

195
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,040
For that to happen, there needs to be
some kind of catalyst for Chairman Min.

196
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,120
Are you taking a break
after finishing the chores I gave you?

197
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,150
No.

198
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,190
No?

199
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,390
What should I do, Manager Gong?

200
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,830
She's asking if we've finished
the chores she gave us.

201
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, you see...

202
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,970
It's just that neither Ms. Ja Kyung
nor I have ever cleaned before.

203
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,700
I'm quite sure I made myself
perfectly clear earlier.

204
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,670
My husband said
that you're just Father's woman,

205
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,510
not our mother,
and that you should know your place.

206
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,730
What the...

207
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,500
Are you out of your mind?

208
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,170
Who do you think you're talking to?
How dare you address me like that?

209
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,100
I am, legally and officially,
the lady of this house.

210
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,140
Then go and be his woman to my father.

211
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,550
Why are you messing with me
when we're not even related?

212
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,750
You expect me to call you Mother?

213
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,150
You were my subordinate until recently.

214
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,590
Anyone can see
how messed up this situation is.

215
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,390
Watch your mouth.
Unless you want water thrown in your face.

216
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,990
This woman is unbelievable...

217
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,400
- Let go of me!
- Ji Seop, no!

218
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
- I said let go!
- Ji Seop, stop!

219
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,200
- I swear, you won't get away with this!
- Ji Seop.

220
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,270
Let go!

221
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,510
No, stop!

222
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,580
Why is it just you two?

223
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,020
Where's your mother-in-law?

224
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,880
I'm not sure.

225
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,800
I'm home.
Why didn't you come out to greet me?

226
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,670
Have you been crying?

227
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,740
A new bride should be all smiles,
so why the waterworks?

228
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,510
Your son called me your woman...

229
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,510
and told me not to act
like the lady of the house.

230
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,780
I wasn't expecting to be treated
with the utmost respect,

231
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,990
but to hear him say it to my face,
it was just so hurtful.

232
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,350
What?

233
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,320
That little punk.

234
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,560
Hey! Min Ji Seop!

235
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,860
Get out here right now, you little punk!

236
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,110
- What did you say to your new mom today?
- Come on, Dad.

237
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,980
It's your choice to marry her
because you like her,

238
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,610
but expecting your children to treat her
like our mother is asking too much.

239
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,750
What did you just say?

240
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,850
She's younger than me. I can't do it.

241
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,550
Could you do it if you were me?

242
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,490
It's not natural. It's not right.

243
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,090
In a word, this family is a complete mess!

244
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,320
- Why, you little!
- Chairman Min!

245
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,260
Listen up, everyone.

246
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,070
Any disrespect to this woman
is disrespect to me!

247
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,770
Anyone who goes against her wishes
or thinks they're her equal...

248
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,010
will be thrown out of this house. Got it?

249
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,110
You need to be tougher on them.

250
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,180
They're treating you like a pushover
because you're always so polite.

251
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,650
That's enough. Please go back inside.

252
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,900
I'm so upset.

253
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,660
Don't be upset.

254
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll make sure Ji Seop never acts
so disrespectfully to you again.

255
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,770
It's not because of Ji Seop.
It's because of me.

256
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,210
I feel like I've caused nothing
but trouble by marrying you.

257
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,940
Don't say that.
Why would you think such a thing?

258
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,850
All I ever wanted was to be by your side.

259
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,420
I know that. Of course I do.

260
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,020
- That reminds me. Time for your tonic.
- What tonic?

261
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,860
Your herbal tonic.

262
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,190
They say it'll boost your energy
and clear your head.

263
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,730
I had a top doctor prepare this for you,
so you have to take it every day.

264
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,840
- When did you do all this?
- If I don't look after you, who will?

265
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,400
I'll bring it out.

266
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,370
- And when you're finished, I'll get more.
- Thanks to you, I'll live a long life.

267
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,310
You'd better live a long life.
Or are you planning to leave me behind?

268
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,380
- As if I'd let you go first!
- Oh please.

269
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,030
So, is everything taken care of?

270
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,930
Yes, sir. It'll be closed soon...

271
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,670
and classified as
an accidental death of a vagrant.

272
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,170
- Good. That's a relief.
- Oh, but Chairman Min,

273
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,780
there's something Jo Pil Doo said.

274
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,450
That Han Kyung Soo's son is undercover...

275
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,750
and has infiltrated your ranks.

276
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,820
Should I try and find out who he is?

277
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,690
That's not your concern.
I'll handle it myself.

278
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,820
- So you just back off.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

279
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,500
Who the heck could Han Kyung Soo's son be?

280
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Then again,

281
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,400
what could he possibly do
to get revenge for his father?

282
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,970
There are no witnesses or evidence.

283
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,810
What about that woman, Lucia? How is she?

284
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,980
It feels like some kind of curse.

285
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,150
I tried to kick her out of the company,
and instead, she's now in our home.

286
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,520
At least there's no chance
of her getting company shares, right?

287
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,090
I'm worried about that, too.

288
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,530
She must have signed a waiver
to marry my father.

289
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,360
If she's determined to reclaim the shares,
a simple waiver won't stop her.

290
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,760
You don't have to worry about that.

291
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,140
The waiver was notarized.
So unless Chairman Min nullifies it,

292
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,470
it remains legally binding.

293
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,170
My father would never nullify it, right?

294
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,840
Not unless cats start barking.

295
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,180
Not only did she try to make me do chores,

296
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,650
she threw a bucket of water on Ji Seop!

297
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,450
Really?

298
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,420
What in the world is wrong with her?

299
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,360
A newlywed bride, how dare she
treat her revered in-laws that way?

300
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,460
It's all because of that crazy old fool.

301
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,660
Our in-law is absolutely mad about women.

302
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,170
In a powerful family like that,
the wrong person can spell ruin.

303
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,400
What does your husband say?

304
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,970
He says she looks down on him
because he's unemployed.

305
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,180
Dad, what's the deal
with getting his job back?

306
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,480
Was your promise just a bunch
of empty words?

307
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,710
Your father was already planning to visit
your father-in-law.

308
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,720
That's right. I'm a meticulous planner.
I have a plan, so don't you worry.

309
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,190
He's like putty in my hands.
Putty. Soft, pliable putty.

310
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,260
Putty?

311
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,690
- Clay, maybe?
- He's always been my putty.

312
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,070
Yes, Manager Gong.

313
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,040
If you're about done there, hurry back.

314
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,900
Why? Did something happen?

315
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,710
The housekeeper isn't coming today.
I called and told her not to.

316
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,250
What? Why?

317
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,820
I'll explain later.
Just make sure the house is spotless.

318
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,020
It's not that I don't want to.
I'm telling you, I don't know how.

319
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,560
I mean, I've never done it before.
How am I supposed to do it?

320
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,290
Was anyone born knowing how to do this?

321
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,630
You can just learn as you go,
one thing at a time.

322
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,070
Oh, and get Ji Seop out here, too.

323
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,950
She says you have to come out and clean?

324
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,550
- Who says?
- Who do you think?

325
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,160
Now what?

326
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,400
It's a big house for two women to handle.
I figured the son should help out.

327
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,770
Ja Kyung, I left garlic on the table.
I want it all peeled.

328
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,340
If we leave it in the pantry,
it'll all go bad.

329
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,640
I doubt you have work clothes,
so put these on.

330
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,850
What? You expect me to wear this?

331
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,650
It doesn't get any better than this
for work clothes.

332
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,490
I'm on my way to see Chairman Min,
so if you don't want to work, say so now.

333
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,390
Oh, right. And the floors only get clean
if you scrub them by hand.

334
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,140
Oh, when did you get here?

335
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,440
Just now.
I thought these might wilt, so I came.

336
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,840
Why go to all this trouble?
You could've just had my secretary do it.

337
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,580
I just wanted an excuse
to see you again, Chairman.

338
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,080
So, does this vase officially become
my responsibility now?

339
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,520
Meaning no one else can touch it?

340
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,870
Gosh, what is this, seriously?

341
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,170
It's ruining my nails. Seriously.

342
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,470
Just do it for now.
Or do you want to face the Chairman?

343
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,580
It stings so much.

344
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,210
Seriously, this is like being tear-gassed.

345
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,420
Your eye makeup is running.

346
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,990
What? Where?

347
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,890
On both of your eyes.

348
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,920
On my left eye?

349
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,490
It stings!

350
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,130
It stings so bad!

351
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,970
Gosh, what's with her now?

352
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,770
Goodness.

353
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,470
Who even scrubs floors by hand
in the 21st century?

354
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,470
This is a special kind of torture.

355
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,350
Darn it...

356
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Well, well, look who it is.

357
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,390
Ma'am, what brings you here?

358
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,560
You should be more careful at home.

359
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,340
I'm just worried about you.

360
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,200
One person knowing your secret is enough,
wouldn't you say?

(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

362
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,470
What?

363
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,840
The case is closed?

364
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,350
What do you mean? How can it be over
after just a few days?

365
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,150
You can't stop the investigation midway!
This makes no sense, does it?

366
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,560
How can they clear him of criminal charges
without a proper investigation?

367
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,260
I'm not trying to pick a fight.
I'm just so frustrated.

368
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,360
I don't get why they're trying to bury
this case so quickly!

369
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,600
Hello?

370
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,240
I heard your phone call.
Did something happen?

371
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,810
Mr. Jo...

372
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,380
has passed away.

373
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
What?

374
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,990
He was murdered.

375
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,750
I think.

376
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,070
If he was murdered,
not an accidental death,

377
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,370
and right before applying for a retrial...

378
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,640
Something is strange.

379
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,380
You said if we could prove his alibi,
we could turn everything around.

380
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,750
At the crime scene...

381
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,660
I found this.

382
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm pretty sure it belongs to the killer.

383
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,190
I was going to give it to the detective...

384
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,530
but something felt off,
so I decided to hold on to it.

385
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,600
If I can just figure out
who this belongs to,

386
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,670
I think I might be able to solve this.

387
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Oh my.

388
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,290
This...

389
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,330
It's Chairman Min Du Sik's.
