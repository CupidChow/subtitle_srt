00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,410
Explain this to me right now.

(Episode 110)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,110
Tell me why those two are still married!

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,920
Could you give us a moment, Director Min?

(Mingang Distribution)

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,200
Why haven't you filed
the divorce papers yet?

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,860
Why?

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,330
Because it's illegal.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,140
You know exactly how you got
the chairman's signature.

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,570
Don't make me laugh.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,780
Because it was illegal?

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,750
That's rich, coming from you,
whose whole life is one big scam.

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,420
Sure, I had to claw my way up
from nothing...

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,250
and had to do some shady things
to survive,

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,560
but why are you, born with a silver spoon,
so eager to commit a crime?

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,460
Are you lecturing me right now?

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,090
You didn't do what you were supposed to,
and now you're crying "illegal"?

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,000
Do you have any idea what kind of mess
we're in because of you?

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,400
That woman, Lucia, is about to inherit
my father's entire fortune!

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,940
And he might not even make it
through the night!

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,870
He hasn't passed away yet.

22
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,340
Aren't you getting a little
ahead of yourself?

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,150
Stop right there.

24
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,250
Didn't you hear me? I said stop!

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,420
I'm not someone who stops and goes
at your command anymore!

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,220
Those are commands you give to a dog.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,090
From now on, I'll go when I want,
and stop when I want.

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,360
No matter who's telling me.

29
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,230

(Mingang Distribution)

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,950
I'll let go once you calm down.

32
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,280
How dare you...

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,890
If you keep this up, I can't let you go.

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,550
It's not because I'm afraid you'll hit me.

35
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,090
It's because I can't bear to watch you
humiliate yourself any further.

36
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,390
Humiliate myself?

37
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,060
Let's talk about who's really pathetic.

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,930
Marrying an old man you don't even love,
just to get revenge for your daughter?

39
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,740
Or scheming to take over the company?

40
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,070
Hey! Jung Lucia!

41
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,680
No, Baek Sul Hee!
Don't you dare mess with me!

42
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,410
I'm the one who made you who you are!

43
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,510
Please, don't be like this.

44
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,980
You and I...

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,420
may not be related by blood,
but we were more than family.

46
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,420
I thought of you as a mother,

47
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,130
and I was more heartbroken than anyone
over Ho Se's accident.

48
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm doing this for my Ho Se, too.

49
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,800
My son,

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,630
and my only blood relative, Se Ri.

51
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,570
I have to protect her!
I have to protect her from you!

52
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,270
Are we clear?

53
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,110
You little...

54
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,480
What do you think you're doing?

55
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,580
Let me go!

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,820
Why are you falling apart like this?
This isn't the person you used to be.

57
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,820

(Mingang Distribution)

59
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,790
What has gotten into Madam Jang now?

60
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,060
She thinks I'm going to do something
to harm Se Ri.

61
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,260
If she's going to be like this,
why don't we tell her the truth?

62
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,200
But I told you she would go after Se Ri.

63
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,830
Think about what Se Ri did to Mi So,
her own flesh and blood.

64
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,340
You think Madam Jang
would leave Se Ri alone?

65
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,040
But how long are we supposed to sit here
and take this?

66
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,540
This feels like just the beginning,
not the end.

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,410
Still, I won't let Se Ri get hurt.
Absolutely not.

68
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,580
Yes, I know. I get it.
I feel the same way,

69
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,620
but if we let
Madam Jang carry on like this,

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,950
things are going to get much worse.

71
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,220
It won't just end with the two of us
getting kicked out of this company.

72
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,990
Someone could end up getting killed.

73
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,490
Surely she wouldn't go as far
as taking a life.

74
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,660
After all she's done,
you still don't get it?

75
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,900
Madam Jang is not in her right mind
right now.

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,000
She's going to take out her anger
for her son on Chairman Min Doo Sik,

77
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,970
and if she thinks anyone
is a threat to Se Ri's future,

78
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,940
she'll try to eliminate them
by any means necessary.

79
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,040
We have to stop Madam Jang's rampage.

80
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,850
I know, but the problem
is we don't know how.

81
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,520

at a complete loss when facing her.

What about Lucia?

What about her?

90

You don't even know
what's going on with Se Ri?

91

And you call yourself her mother?

92

Se Ri's at home, of course.

93
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,500
Lucia got Se Ri a job at a cafe
as a waitress...

94
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,400
for a measly ten dollars an hour.

95
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,710
What?

96
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,840
Why would she do that?

97
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,780
Lucia is making Se Ri suffer
since she's not her real daughter.

98

And there are so many creeps
out there these days.

What if she gets a difficult customer,

100
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,020
gets into an argument,
and things get violent?

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,820
What then?

Why won't you listen to me?

103
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,360
I told you I'd take Se Ri to the States
and put her through college!

104

You haven't even told Se Ri yet, have you?

105
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,270
And you still expect my help?

106
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,700
It's just that...

107
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,270
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

108
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,310
What are you preoccupied with?

109
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,380
Lawyer Kim still hasn't filed
the divorce papers...

110
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,750

111
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,450

That you and Min Doo Sik
are still legally married,

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,830

And you're still hanging around?
Shouldn't you be on the run?

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,770
No. You won't find paradise
by running away.

This is my paradise,
the one I'm going to build right here.

120

Trashing the divorce papers
might've bought us time,

but if Min Kyung Chae proposes
my dismissal at the shareholders' meeting,

122
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,390
it'll pass.

It won't be that easy for her.

Do you think I took off my engagement ring
to Min Kyung Chae lightly?

135
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,990
No. For me,
it was like starting a new life.

So you knew the divorce papers
were never filed.

146
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,810
Does that mean you were conspiring
with Lawyer Kim?

147
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,680
It wasn't a conspiracy.
It was the right thing to do.

148

Forcing a thumbprint
from an unconscious man...

149
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,820
is a serious crime.

150
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,120
You should be grateful
that Lawyer Kim's judgment...

151
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,560
prevented something terrible.

152
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,900
Now that you know I am still legally
Chairman Min Doo Sik's wife,

153
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,030
you're going to tell me
where he is, right?

154
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,100
As his legal spouse,

155
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,240
don't I have the right to know
where my husband is and how he's doing?

156
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,010
Don't worry.

157
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,510
He's in a good place and well cared for.

158
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,380
I need to see that for myself.

159
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,720
If you don't tell me right now,
I have no choice...

160
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,250
but to call the police.

161
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,090
- You'll what?
- It's the only way I can find him.

162
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,230
You know it'll be a missing person case
if his wife reports it, right?

163
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,540
Ja Kyung hasn't called lately.
I wonder if something's wrong.

164
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,740
She's not calling
because there's nothing going on.

165
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,310
No news is good news, you know.

166
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,410
This much "no news" can't be good news.

167
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,380
For a mother, you don't have a shred
of maternal instinct.

168
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,720
I heard that
Ja Kyung's young mother-in-law...

169
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,220
dotes on Se Ri as if she were her own...

170
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,590
when she didn't even give birth to her.

171
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,320
I always thought that was a bit strange.

172
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,830

that girl is hardly an angel.

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,500
She's a bit of a handful, isn't she?
Though she has been quiet lately.

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,300
She was quite the troublemaker,
all on her own, wasn't she?

175
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,540
That's what makes this so amazing, right?

176
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,340
They're just mother and daughter on paper,
not by blood, but they dote on each other.

177
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,310
Exactly.
Fawning over her like that isn't normal.

178
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,050
Even your own kids can drive you
up the wall sometimes,

179
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,180
so it makes no sense to act like that
with someone else's child.

180
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,150
Not unless there's some secret
no one knows about.

181
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
What kind of secret?

182
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,860
What if Se Ri is actually
Chairman Min's wife's long-lost daughter?

183
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,930
Something like that.

184
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,530
Are you writing a soap opera?

185
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,230
You come up with absurd secret origins
because you watch them all day.

186
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,700
Why stop there? Let's make it juicier.

187
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,070
Tae Kyung and our in-laws are enemies,

188
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,700
Kyung Chae
is Ms. Stella's daughter-in-law,

189
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,140
and Sun Jae is Se Ri's biological father.

190
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,240
Want to take this soap even further?
Ji Seop is Manager Gong's son,

191
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,010
Ja Kyung isn't my biological daughter,
Tae Kyung is my son,

192
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,610
but they were switched at birth.

193
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,680
And for the grand finale of this mess,

194
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,820
Chairman Min Doo Sik and I
are half-brothers. Happy now?

195
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,720
That's hilarious.

196
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,520
It is? Maybe I should be a scriptwriter.

197
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,630
- Whatever. Just call Ja Kyung.
- See? Over-the-top dramas are the best.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,430
Ja Kyung?

199
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,570
No, nothing's wrong.
Your dad just wanted me to call.

200
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,370
Please.
As if anything exciting happens with us.

201
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,740
Right now, all we can think about
is Ji Seop's promotion.

202
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,640
But you said that was happening soon.

203
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,810
I thought it was a done deal.

204
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,450
It is, but I won't be able to relax
until it's official.

205
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,750
Of course he'll get it.
If not Ji Seop, who else would?

206
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,190
He will, right?

207
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,590
Mom, I'll call you back tomorrow.

208
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,000
Your parents will be so disappointed
if I don't become a director.

209
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,360
They're counting on it so much.

210
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,930
Hey, don't jinx it.
Why would you say that?

211
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,640
I don't know, it's just...

212
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,810
the days are just ticking by,
and the appointments are getting closer,

213
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,870
so I'm just getting a little anxious.

214
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,510
Don't be. You should've been
a director ages ago.

215
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,880
And it's not like it's some gift.

216
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,120
We're handing over all of our shares
for you to get that position.

217
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,990
But what will happen to Soo Jung
if I take over her position?

218
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,890
What kind of ridiculous nonsense is that?

219
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,490
Who's worrying about whom?

220
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,630
You're the most pathetic
of the Min family.

221
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,800
You're the weakest.

222
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,870
If you only knew.

223
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,570
- The doors are closing.
- Hold on, please!

224
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,710
Thank you...

(Mingang Distribution)

226
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,920
The doors are closing.

227
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,890
The second you walked
through the entrance,

228
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,960
you were radiant.

229
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,300
What are you on about
this early in the morning?

230
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,070
You just have this way of standing out,
no matter where you are.

231
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,470
Twenty-five years ago,

232
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,110
do you know why I chose you
out of all the women...

233
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,740
who were throwing themselves at me?

234
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,850
It's because you were
so incredibly beautiful.

235
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,190
Why are you so jumpy?

236
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,590
A stray hair.

237
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,430
Seriously...

(Mingang Distribution)

239
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,300
Does my touch still give you
an electric jolt?

240
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,030
The first time we slept together,

241
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,170
you were the same way then.

242
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,070
Shut up! You're such a pervert. Seriously!

244
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,560
Unbelievable.

245
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,060
Why are you following me?

246
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,730
If you keep this up,
I'm calling Tae Kyung.

247
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,960
You need to stop.

248
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,930
If I'm making an effort,
you should meet me halfway.

249
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,240
Do you think I let that punk hit me
because I'm weak?

250
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,670
No. If I got serious,
I could take him out with one punch.

251
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,440
I felt bad for his pathetic life,
so I let him win.

252
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,810
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

253
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,850
Now that you know Se Ri is our daughter,

254
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,450
you've suddenly had
some life-changing epiphany?

255
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,120
Of course I did.
I haven't been this happy in a long time,

256

thinking about messing over Min Kyung Chae
and the rest of the Min family...

257
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,300
For goodness' sake, snap out of it!

258
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,270
Fine. You're Se Ri's father,
so I'll put up with this much.

259
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,770
But if you cross that line,
I can't promise what I'll do.

260
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,340
And what exactly are you
going to do to me?

A woman should be more like you, you know?

268
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,900
She should play hard to get a little.
Right?

269
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,510
Just go already.

270
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,740

I'll have no choice, right?

Yes, so?

Go on, tell me.

You're curious?

275
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,820
Of course I am.

276
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,190

in store for me.

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,920
All right, then.

that didn't happen last time?

Why didn't you answer my call?

288

Because I thought
I couldn't deal with you.

like that?

what I'm going through right now?

on me yesterday.

You can't be this callous
just because she's not your own blood.

What on earth does she lack
to have to work here?

332
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,630
It's a life lesson.

333
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,610
She will learn how to get along
with all sorts of people.

That's ridiculous.

335

Don't pay her any mind. Just keep working.

342
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,100
Learn how hard it is
to earn your own money...

343
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,270
and learn how to get along
with the people you work with.

344
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,810
You can do that, can't you?

345
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,610
Yes. I'll see you at home later.

346
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,490
She told you to quit, right?

347
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,320
See?
Why are you wasting your time with this?

348
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,560
Take that apron off and come with me.

349
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,190
I needed to talk to you today anyway.

350
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,100
- About going to college in the States...
- If you're not ordering, please leave.

351
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,370
I have to finish my shift.

352
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,900
That's what Mom told me to do.

353
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,490
It'll take more than a glass of water
to calm me down.

354
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,290
Are you really that upset?

355
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,930
Lucia was just trying to do
what was best for Se Ri.

356
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,430
How is that for her own good?
It's not like she needs the money.

357
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,370
Why is she working a part-time job
in some random cafe?

358
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,270
That's what a lot of kids her age do.

359
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,410
- It's perfectly normal.
- No. My Se Ri is special.

360
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,440
Because she is my son Ho Se's daughter.

361
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,780
The girl who will one day own Mingang,
serving coffee?

362
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,150
Mother.

363
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,420
You've changed so much since you found out
Se Ri is Ho Se's daughter.

364
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,360
Of course I changed!

365
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,520
She's my grandchild.
Am I not supposed to look after her?

366
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,630
You're going overboard.

367
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,230
I'm worried you're going to get hurt
if you keep this up.

368
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,600
Don't you worry about me. I'm Stella Jang.

369
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,730
Do you know what it took for me
to survive in the States?

370
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,370
Mother.

371
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,410
Lucia says she's going to
report me to the police...

372
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,410
if I don't tell her where Father is.

373
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,680
Since that snake Kim Sun Jae betrayed us,
this could all come to nothing.

374
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,380
After all we went through
to get those divorce papers.

375
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
What are we going to do?

376
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,920
If shareholders learn of Father's health,
the acting chairmanship will be extended.

377
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,420
And if things go wrong,

378
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,590
the chairmanship could be
passed on to her permanently.

379
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,560
I was only appointed to this position
without the board's approval.

380
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,500
But she went through
the proper channels to get hers.

381
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,570
So Kim Sun Jae has sided with Lucia,
is that it?

382
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,780
He realized he had no shot
at marrying Min Kyung Chae,

383
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,580
so he switched sides?

384
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,410
What do I do, Mother?

385
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,280
Just be quiet for a second.
I'm trying to think.

386
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,470
It's so quiet.
I guess everyone's gone home for the day.

387
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,300
There's no one else in the office.

388
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,640
It feels like we're
the only two people in the world.

389
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,780
Tae Kyung.

390
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,410
Yes?

391
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,750
Kim Sun Jae is on his way up.

392
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
I asked him to come.

393
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,360
I need to make...

394
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,930
my feelings perfectly clear
in front of him.

395
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,400
Your feelings?

396
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,970
What are the three of us
supposed to do now?

397
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,780
What, are we going to get into
a fistfight like last time?

398
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Kim Sun Jae.

399
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,250
I need you to listen very carefully
to what I'm about to say.

400
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
I...

401
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,820
am in love with Moon Tae Kyung.

402
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,870
You being Se Ri's biological father
means nothing to me.

403
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,870
There's no way I'm starting over with you
for a pathetic reason like that.

404
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,640
You may have been my first,
but that doesn't mean you'll be the last.

405
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,710
The last man for me...

406
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,180
is him.

407
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,880
So, just give it up.

408
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,050
Stop using Se Ri as an excuse
to force your way into our lives.

409
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,350
Are you out of your mind?

410
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,960
I've never been more clear-headed.
Now go! Get lost!

411
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,760
Get out of my life and my sight!

412
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,890
You've completely lost it.

413
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,430
You're nothing without me.

414
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,800
Right now, I'm your savior, your deity.

415
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,800
Without me, you'll go down in flames
and hit rock bottom.

416
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,500
Let me spell it out.

417
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,270
If the shareholder's meeting is held,
you'll be fired.

418
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,340
I'll take care of it.
I don't need your help, so go!

419
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,680
How dare you...

420
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,000
Back when I didn't know any better,

421
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,000
I met you and ended up having your child.

422
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,440
Then you abandoned me.

423
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,170
At the time, I was heartbroken
and thought my life was over.

424
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,110
But not anymore.

425
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,310
In fact, I think it was
a blessing in disguise.

426
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,020
You...

427
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,890
want our Se Ri to be
the third-generation chairman, don't you?

428
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Not a chance.

429
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,790
I am never going to let that happen.

430
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
I'm going to raise our Se Ri...

431
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,230
to have a perfectly normal life.

432
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,540
I won't let her be a monster like you,
consumed by your ambition and greed.

433
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,770
So, just go.

434
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,710
If Kim Sun Jae abandoned Baek Sul Hee
20 years ago,

435
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,310
today, it's Baek Sul Hee...

436
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,450
who is abandoning Kim Sun Jae.

437
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
Sul Hee.

438
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,880
I never knew you were so brave.

439
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,180
There's more you don't know about me.

440
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,330
I've wanted to tell you...

441
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,860
that I loved you a long time ago.

442
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,150
Baek Sul Hee.

443
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,020
So this is how you want to play?

444
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,220
Fine.

445
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,890
Then the gloves are off.

446
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,640
You may not be happy to see me,
but that can't be helped.

447
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,880
I'm here today to tell you
something you need to hear.

448
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,180
And what is it that I need to hear?

449
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,320
I don't think I can say this sober.

450
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,300
Se Ri...

451
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,530
is not your granddaughter.

452
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,040
What are you talking about?

453
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,880
Min Kyung Chae's daughter, Min Se Ri.
Wait, she's not a Min.

454
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Her real name is Kim Se Ri.

455
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,010
She is Baek Sul Hee's daughter.

456
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,420
Which means...

457
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,790
Se Ri's father is not your son.
Understand?

458
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,190
And I bet you're wondering
why her last name is Kim.

459
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,430
Because she's my daughter.

460
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,130
The daughter of Kim Sun Jae.

461
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,350
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

462
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
