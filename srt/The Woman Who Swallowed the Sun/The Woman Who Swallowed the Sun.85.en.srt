00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,680
(Episode 85)

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,250
What are you thinking so hard about?

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,620
Just thinking about a few things.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,020
Are you bothered about
firing your eldest daughter?

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,760
She has nothing to do
with the company anymore.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,790
Bring her back then.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,660
Why would I? She's an ungrateful brat.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,900
She's messed with me
and hurt the company time and time again.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,870
But she has the largest stake after you.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,370
She's the second-largest shareholder.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,000
And besides,
she's part of the owner's family.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,210
That's why she should have done better.
It's infuriating just thinking about it.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,080
I was backstabbed
by the one I trusted most.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,380
If it had been Ji Seop,
I could've just brushed it off.

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,850
But this is the worst kind of betrayal.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,250
Then you should cut her off completely.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,820
That way, she won't be able to say
the company is hers for the taking.

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,960
She said that?

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,830
To Se Ri.

20
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,600
She said that since the will makes her
the acting chairman in your absence,

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,600
she'll take over your position one day.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,730
So she brought up my will, did she?

23
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,740
That's why I'm worried.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,470
Did you really put that in your will?

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,450
She's already greedy for the chairmanship,

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,080
and she just wants control of the company.

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,310
So I'm worried.

28
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,580
Who knows what else she might do.

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,390
And if something were to happen to you...

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,770
She thinks if I'm gone, Mingang is hers?

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

32
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,180
So that's why she tried
to send me to that nursing home.

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,450
That’s what she was thinking.

34
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,320
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

35
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,920
Hey, Lawyer Park, it's me.

36
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,160
I'm calling about my will.

37
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,260
I think it's time to make some revisions.

38
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,000
Hey, Lawyer Park. What's up?

39
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,240
Chairman Min just requested
to have his will amended and notarized.

40
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,010
What are you talking about?
Why the sudden change to the will?

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,810
How would I know?

42
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,280
He could have had a change of heart.

43
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,250
Did he say specifically
what he wanted to change?

44
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,620
He wants to delete the clause
stating that in his absence,

45
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,890
his eldest daughter will take over
as acting chairman.

46
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,590
What?

47
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,330
What did you say?

48
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,030
Did my father really say that?

49
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,330
He's scheduled a meeting
with Lawyer Park for next week.

50
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Darn it.

51
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,640
I'll meet you there right now.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm on my way.

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,280
Why does he want to revise
his will all of a sudden?

54
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,680
Don't you think that woman
put him up to it?

55
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,580
No. The only ones who know about
that clause are the chairman, me,

56
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,150
and you.

57
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
If it's not her,

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,660
it means as soon as she fired me,
he seized the chance to change the will.

59
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,230
Two of a kind, aren't they?

60
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,360
That's not the point right now.

61
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,200
If the will is changed,
it can't be undone.

62
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,830
That was our last hope.

63
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,440
So do something!

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,900
Are you just going to stand there
and watch?

65
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,410
My father is
going to pass away eventually.

66
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,310
No, even before that, if for some reason
he can't fulfill his duties as chairman,

67
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,880
I must be acting chairman to kick her out
and seize control of the company, right?

68
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,250
Do you want to see me go down like this?

69
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,190
If I go down, so do you, Kim Sun Jae.

70
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,360
There is one way.

71
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,290
What is it?

72
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,300
To stop him from changing the will...

73
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,500
and get you reinstated,

74
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,140
it's the last card I have to play.

75
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,340
What is it already?

76
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,770
But first, I have one condition.

77
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,750
(Mingang Distribution)

78
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,050
They say a crisis creates opportunity.

79
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,490
Now I finally understand what that means.

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,700
About CEO Min Kyung Chae...

81
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,330
Are you going to leave her in the cold?

82
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,370
Do you think you're in any position
to say that?

83
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,600
You're a big part of the reason
she was fired.

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,840
If you had advised her properly,
would she have gotten so out of control?

85
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,680
You have to be able to tell people
the hard truth sometimes.

86
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,850
All you do is stand by and suck up to her,
telling her only what she wants to hear.

87
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,220
I'm tempted to fire you along with her,
but I'm holding back.

88
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,560
Then don't hold back.
Go ahead and fire me too.

89
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,030
What did you say?

90
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,500
I'm CEO Min's man,
so there's nothing I wouldn't do for her.

91
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,700
That's why I'm trying to stop you
from changing your will.

92
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,130
How did you find out about that?

93
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,740
Chairman Tae of Yangmi Construction...

94
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,110
is currently under investigation
by the prosecutors.

95
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,810
Chairman Tae? Why, all of a sudden?

96
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,310
Because his slush fund manager
betrayed him.

97
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,010
A conglomerate head creating
an illegal slush fund.

98
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,050
When a story like that gets out,
who do you think gets hurt more?

99
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,390
The head of the company?

100
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,960
Or the underling who was just managing it?

101
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,100
So are you saying I could end up
just like Chairman Tae?

102
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,730
Look at this punk.
How dare you threaten me!

103
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,600
So what's your point?

104
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,040
As I said, I'm CEO Min's man,
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for her.

105
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,680
Call off the changes to your will...

106
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,350
and reinstate her as CEO.

107
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,090
Who does he think he is,
changing his will?

108
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,360
That's my last lifeline.

109
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
How did it go?

110
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,510
It went well.

111
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,980
My father really agreed
not to change the will?

112
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,050
When I set my mind on something,
I make it happen.

113
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,350
How on earth did you manage that?

114
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,590
Did you work some kind of magic?

115
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,990
Now, you need to give me an answer
regarding my terms.

116
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,660
Your terms?

117
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,600
Marry me.

118
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,730
Marry you?

119
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,700
After we're married,

120
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,840
we can turn Mingang Distribution
into a real powerhouse.

121
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,070
We'll get rid of pests like
Lucia and Moon Tae Kyung.

122
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,840
And for Min Soo Jung, Min Ji Seop,
we'll crush them and their family ties.

123
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,180
We should show the world
that the new owner of Mingang...

124
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,450
will be Min Kyung Chae.

125
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,020
I'll be right there to help you.

126
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,390
Sounds like a pretty good deal for you,
wouldn't you say?

127
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,420
So, what's your answer?

128
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,490
Fine.

129
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,460
What wouldn't I do
to become the owner of Mingang?

130
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,840
That punk, Lawyer Kim...

131
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,310
He's really going to hold this
over my head?

132
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,150
What are you thinking so deeply about?

133
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,720
Have you decided
what you're going to do about your will?

134
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,590
That's what's giving me such a headache.

135
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,560
Why? It's your decision.

136
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,930
Who's going to stop you?

137
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,530
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

138
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,260
It's too complicated
to tell you everything.

139
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,100
You'd rather I just cut
Kyung Chae out of the will, wouldn't you?

140
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,270
Does what I want really matter?

141
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,140
I'm not saying this...

142
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,980
because I hold a grudge
against your eldest daughter.

143
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,310
Yes, what she did to me was infuriating,

144
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,280
but what I truly can't forgive...

145
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,480
is that she tried to get rid of you
to become the acting chairman.

146
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,590
That's it.

147
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,690
Who knows what she'll try to pull next?

148
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,090
But you should do as you see fit.

149
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,230
If your hands are tied, what can you do?

150
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,780
Don't forget what I told you.

151
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,410
That the company belongs to me.

152
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,220
And I did remember your birthday.

153
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,680
How could I forget?

154
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,720
My own daughter's birthday.

155
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,520
It just slipped my mind.

156
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,420
I didn't actually forget.

157
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,130
I could never forget your birthday.

158
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,630
Not after what you mean to me.

159
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,600
What are you doing out here?

160
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,070
I was just on my way up to apologize
for missing your birthday.

161
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,410
You don't have to apologize.

162
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,940
What are you talking about?

163
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
I'm your mother,
and I missed your birthday.

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,580
Of course I'm sorry.

165
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,480
Let's go back to your room.

166
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,560
Don't you put strange ideas
in my daughter's head.

167
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,600
She just barely got her act together,

168
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,700
and I don't want her ending up
like her cruel sister.

169
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,770
"Cruel sister?"

170
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,000
It'd be a disaster if she became someone
who'd do anything...

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,170
to get what she wanted.

172
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,740
You're not going to pretend you don't know
what you did to me, are you?

173
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,860
You don't have to walk
on eggshells around me.

174
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,860
I'm not mad at you.

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,870
I got into an accident
because of a prank text someone sent me.

176
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,070
I was a little on edge that day.

177
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,170
And here I thought you were mad at me.

178
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,480
It was your birthday.

179
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,780
Someone I know...

180
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,750
also has the same birthday.

181
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,250
Who?

182
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
It must be fate.

183
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,490
How can I have the same birthday
as someone else?

184
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,560
Who is it? Is it someone you know well?

185
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,620
I'd like to meet them.

186
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,660
If you'd been born into a normal family...

187
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,630
and raised by normal, loving parents,

188
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,100
would things have been different?

189
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,140
Then maybe you wouldn't have done
such a terrible thing to my Mi So.

190
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,310
I still hate you and resent you.

191
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,070
But as much as I do...

192
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,280
What are you thinking about?

193
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,050
It's nothing.

194
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,590
You'll stay with me again tonight, right?

195
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,970
Yes.

196
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,770
What did you mean...

197
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,640
when you said
Chairman Min has changed his mind?

198
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,610
He was about to change his will
at any second,

199
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,810
but now he's hesitating.

200
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,180
Someone's whispering in his ear.

201
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,710
And I don't need to mention
who that someone is.

202
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,550
So what do we do now?

203
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,350
With this dirty money, Min Doo Sik
and Kim Sun Jae are in the same boat.

204
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,990
They're so tangled up,
neither can afford to cut the other loose.

205
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,990
Trying to drive a wedge between them
from the outside is a long shot,

206
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,860
so we need to exploit
a crack from within...

207
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,100
and make Chairman Min turn on Kim Sun Jae.

208
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,500
Is that even possible?

209
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,440
There is one way.

210
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,340
What if we let
Chairman Min Doo Sik know...

211
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,610
that Kim Sun Jae is keeping
a double ledger?

212
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,780
Last time, you noted the discrepancies
in Mingang's cash flow and funds...

213
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,820
and said there was no clear evidence.

214
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,090
That's why we need to make Chairman Min...

215
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,620
get suspicious of Kim Sun Jae on his own.

216
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,920
That would be great,
if we could pull it off,

217
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,860
but is there a way to do that?

218
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,730
I have an idea.

219
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,970
Yes, I'll see you there.

220
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,700
I'm on my way.

221
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,570
You seem to be a very busy man.

222
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,470
Is there a rule against me being busy?

223
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,640
Did you think I'd be moping in a corner
just because CEO Min was fired?

224
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,910
Your former boss was just forced out,

225
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,450
and you're at work
like it's any other day.

226
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,850
I'm just a little surprised.

227
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,120
Someone has to hold down the fort.
How else am I supposed to protect Mingang?

228
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,190
Mingang is in
a very precarious situation right now...

229
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,360
with all these impostors acting
like they own the place.

230
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,660
When CEO Min was dismissed
for all those scandals,

231
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,100
I imagine that wouldn't have been possible
without your assistance, Lawyer Kim.

232
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,770
I mean, when your boss makes a bad choice,
your duty is to stop them,

233
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,140
not play along.

234
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,070
Look here, Director Moon Tae Kyung.

235
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,910
Who are you to talk about "bad decisions?"

236
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,380
From where we're standing,
we're not the ones who are in the wrong.

237
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,510
You are.

238
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,380
Anyone can see you forced out the heir.

239
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,920
The CEO position was assumed legitimately
with the Board of Directors' approval.

240
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,360
You mean the position you got
by threatening the directors?

241
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,530
If they were afraid of being blackmailed,
they shouldn't have done anything wrong.

242
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,660
Is that simple concept lost on you?

243
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,560
We'll see who gets the last laugh.

244
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,650
- Are you heading out somewhere?
- I have an appointment.

245
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,920
Is Kyung Chae going out?

246
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,620
She said she has something to attend to.

247
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,690
Oh, please.

248
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,500
What's a jobless person got to do?

249
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,500
Goodness, Kyung Chae is
in big trouble now.

250
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,870
She can't just stay unemployed
like this forever.

251
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,370
And it's not like she can get a job
somewhere else.

252
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,810
I know all about it.

253
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,540
My husband was also fired by his father
and was jobless.

254
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,180
How could you compare Ms. Kyung Chae
to the vice director?

255
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,250
Why shouldn't I?

256
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,150
You know, I've noticed...

257
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,480
you have a subtle way
of looking down on my husband.

258
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,550
Ms. Kyung Chae...

259
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,520
will be back on her feet in no time.

260
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,660
She'll return, reclaim the CEO position,
and become the rightful owner.

261
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,630
Goodness, that's hilarious.

262
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,700
That ship has already sailed.

263
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,900
How could she possibly
go against someone...

264
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,840
whom the Board of Directors
approved as CEO?

265
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:30,210
Are you really saying Father
decided not to change his will?

266
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,880
It seems so.

267
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,280
How on earth did you manage that?

268
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,680
Did you threaten him?

269
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,720
But he's not someone
who'd give in to threats.

270
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,620
That's not what's important right now.

271
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,320
Right now, we have to secure
that will at all costs...

272
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,960
so that you can become
the acting chairman.

273
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,230
We have to.

274
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,400
How much longer can my father hold
that position?

275
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,230
We could wait until he passes away,

276
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,500
or something unexpected could happen
before then.

277
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,370
No matter what happens,

278
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,010
we must secure your position
as the acting chairman in the will.

279
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,540
Remember, it's the only way we're going
to survive this.

280
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,650
Us?

281
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,650
Yes. Us.

282
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,150
From now on, we're in this together.

283
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,770
Hey there, to all our wonderful
and beloved customers!

284
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,570
I'm the owner, Oh Pan Sool!

285
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,170
- How's everything tasting?
- Yes, it's delicious.

286
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,140
Thank you. I hope it's to your liking.

287
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,740
Thank you.

288
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,410
Yeon Ah, now this is personal service.
You should try it too.

289
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,010
What? Me?

290
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,820
What's the matter? Are you shy?
Feeling embarrassed?

291
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,450
It's not that.

292
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,850
It's just that
if we wander around like this,

293
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,090
I'm worried we'll disturb the customers
while they're eating.

294
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,920
- It's not disturbing at all.
- Hey, come over here.

295
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,130
Enjoy your meal.

296
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,860
Stop making a fool of yourself.

297
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,370
You're disturbing our customers
while they eat.

298
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,870
What in the world are you talking about?

299
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,970
Didn't you see them earlier?

300
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,540
They all said it was great.

301
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,440
They said seeing me
worked up their appetite.

302
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,680
What nonsense is this you're spewing?

303
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,950
If anyone got a look at your rotten face
while eating a hearty meal,

304
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,150
it would make them lose their appetite.

305
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,120
I don't know how you can be so clueless
about yourself.

306
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,890
What? "Rotten face?"

307
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,320
You shriveled-up old bean sprout!

308
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,260
I'm one of the top three most handsome men
in this neighborhood.

309
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,830
"Shriveled-up old bean sprout?"

310
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,960
All the good-looking men
must be dead then.

311
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,860
Stay quiet if you don't know anything,
my beautiful wife.

312
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,430
I'm about to be so busy with business...

313
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,900
that I won't be able to do this
even if I wanted to.

314
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,970
I have a board meeting
at Mingang Distribution,

315
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,470
and I'm arranging a special meeting
about a new investment.

316
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,010
So you're determined to invest more
in stocks?

317
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,640
You should focus on the Mingang stock
you already have.

318
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,680
I'll handle it, so enjoy
the shamanic ritual show with rice cakes.

319
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,150
I go to church,
so I don't watch those shows.

320
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,690
And I absolutely hate rice cakes.

321
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,250
Fine. Then watch a sermon
and eat some bread.

322
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,430
These are Mingang's cash flow statements
and fund reports from the finance team.

323
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,700
And why do you have these?

324
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,170
I received a tip.

325
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,170
I didn't think much of it at first,
but I looked into it just in case,

326
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,070
and I discovered
some suspicious circumstances.

327
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,910
"Suspicious circumstances?"

328
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,310
You'll see discrepancies in the cash flow
statements and the daily fund reports.

329
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,380
This proves someone is embezzling funds
from Mingang.

330
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,190
This can't be the work of just one person.

331
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,790
There must be someone giving the orders...

332
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,890
and a subordinate on the inside
managing it.

333
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,930
I know what you're implying,
so I'll take it from here.

334
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,200
You don't seem surprised.

335
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,030
I expected you to be furious.

336
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,070
Building Mingang to what it is today,
I've been through far worse than this.

337
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,810
This is hardly surprising.

338
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,140
If, like you said, there's someone
messing around with company money,

339
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,710
I'll just find them and make them pay.

340
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,380
Don't get any more involved.
Stay out of it.

341
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,520
But who's the informant?

342
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,320
I received an anonymous tip,
so I'm afraid I don't know.

343
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,890
I'll be on my way, sir.

344
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,100
You know, when I was in the States,

345
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,900
there was an incident where a legal member
whom the owners trusted...

346
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,230
embezzled the company's dirty money.

347
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,740
It seemed he threatened the chairman,
trying to take him down with him.

348
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,640
Besides, it was dirty money,

349
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,740
so they couldn't report him
or press charges.

350
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,980
The chairman really agonized
over it back then.

351
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,180
Of course, here at Mingang,

352
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,650
I'm sure nothing like that
would ever happen.

353
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,200
Why is Manager Gong going on
about Kyung Chae...

354
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,930
getting the CEO position back?

355
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,970
I almost had a heart attack hearing that.

356
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,970
Manager Gong has always doted
on Kyung Chae.

357
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,240
Anyone who didn't know better would think
they were mother and daughter.

358
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,710
But, darling,
like it or not, Lucia is the CEO now.

359
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,080
That means your entire career
is in her hands.

360
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,420
Yes, pretty much.

361
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,220
Then you need to get on her good side.

362
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,560
You have to impress her now
if you want that promotion.

363
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,290
That's why I'm trying my best
to do just that.

364
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,660
You think just trying hard will work?

365
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,960
You need a real strategy.

366
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,930
So, what's Soo Jung going to do?
She must have some kind of plan, right?

367
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,010
Why are you two coming into my room?

368
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,440
What are you going to do now?

369
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,910
The era of Min Kyung Chae is over,
and Lucia's has begun.

370
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,820
We need to figure out how to survive this.

371
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,750
Figure what out?
We'll just do as we're told.

372
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,520
That's not how it works, Soo Jung.

373
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,960
Both you and my husband's fates
are in her hands now.

374
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,230
So you want us to just suck up to Lucia?

375
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,600
Suck up? We may have to do
even more than that.

376
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,700
Right now, what Lucia says, goes.

377
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,830
Do you think Father will take our side?

378
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,700
Even if Lucia kicks us out of the company
like she did with Kyung Chae,

379
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,270
he wouldn't say a peep.

380
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,340
Just give me a minute.

381
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,580
I'm trying to think
about what we have to do.

382
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,040
For crying out loud!

383
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,750
How did we get to the point...

384
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,910
where we're worried about
being kicked out of our company?

385
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,120
What about Kyung Chae?
Is she just going to take this lying down?

386
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,420
Do you think she'd actually have
a brilliant plan?

387
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,360
It's probably just awkward
for her at home,

388
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,260
so she's just out and about all the time.

389
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,660
There was an incident where a legal member
whom the owners trusted...

390
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,000
embezzled the company's dirty money.

391
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,570
It seemed he threatened the chairman,
trying to take him down with him.

392
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,570
Besides, it was dirty money,

393
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,710
so they couldn't report him
or press charges.

394
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,880
The chairman really agonized
over it back then.

395
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,350
Could he mean Lawyer Kim?

396
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,750
No, that's impossible.

397
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,920
Even if he acts like Kyung Chae's lapdog,

398
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,790
he doesn't have the guts
to pull something like that on me.

399
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,830
Then again,

400
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,960
he's the type to make veiled threats,
even to me.

401
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,530
Is he waiting for me to die
to use the will...

402
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,030
and make Kyung Chae the chairman,

403
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,800
while he snags a top position for himself?

404
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Wait a minute...

405
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,950
But why is the amount so large?

406
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,350
I'm sure it wasn't this much
when I checked the ledger.

407
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Could it be?

408
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,870
Yes, Chairman.

409
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Right now?

410
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
Yes, sir.

411
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,850
You wanted to see me, sir?

412
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,520
Explain this.

413
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,660
I'm not sure what you want me to explain.

414
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,490
Surely you're not asking
about the discrepancy.

415
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,260
Of course I'm not questioning it.
It was on my orders.

416
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,300
Borrowed-name accounts, false-name shares,

417
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,830
shell corporations,
the slush fund ledger...

418
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,610
I told you to embezzle funds by any means
and manage it in absolute secrecy.

419
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,970
Those were my instructions.

420
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,880
Then what's this about all of a sudden?

421
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,180
But when you come to my house
once a month...

422
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,850
to have me check the slush fund ledger,

423
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,220
I'm certain these weren't the numbers
you showed me.

424
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,120
I may forget other things,
but I never forget numbers.

425
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,260
And I'm telling you,
the numbers were different.

426
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,790
You'd deceive me and cook the books?

427
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,070
I took a chance on a nobody like you
just because you had a brilliant mind,

428
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,870
and you'd stab me in the back like this?

429
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,140
I have no idea what you're talking about.

430
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,680
I even let it slide when you got arrogant
and forgot your place.

431
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,080
But that was only because your loyalty
was to Kyung Chae, not an outsider.

432
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,980
When that brat was after the chairmanship,
instead of trying to stop her,

433
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,490
you threatened me.

434
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,390
And now you're keeping
a second set of books?

435
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,690
A second set of books?
That's a ridiculous accusation.

436
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,060
We'll see how ridiculous it is
when I check for myself.

437
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,990
I'm innocent, Chairman.

438
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,700
How could I dare to betray you
and create a second set of books?

439
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,100
I was going to let it all go.

440
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,600
Even you trying to put me in a care home,

441
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,310
and your pathetic threat with the will.

442
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,240
As long as you were managing the ledger,

443
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,680
I figured keeping you was more useful.

444
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,780
Chairman.

445
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,650
Bring the ledger to me tomorrow.

446
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,150
We'll go through it together,
line by line.

447
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,820
If I find out you've been skimming money,
you'll live to regret it.

448
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,500
How did that sly old fox figure it out?

449
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,430
What do I do? He seems dead set on this.

450
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,840
If he finds out the truth,
he'd make me disappear without a trace.

451
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,830
(Mingang Distribution)

452
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,900
Why are you driving so erratically?
It's not like you.

453
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,340
Who are you?

454
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,940
Where's Mr. Kim?

455
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,980
Stop the car, now!

456
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,380
Who are you?

457
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,050
It's me, Chairman.

458
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,930
Just stay still and you won't get hurt.

459
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,960
Turn this car around right now!

460
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,700
I said, stay still.

461
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,500
Or you're going to get hurt.

462
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,650
You punk...

463
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,790
Darn it!

464
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,660
Let me go! Get off me!

465
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,230
Let go!

466
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,100
Let me go, you punks!

467
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,200
What is this? Let go of me, you punks!

468
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Let go!

469
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,380
Where are you taking me this time?

470
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,310
It'd be in your best interest
to come quietly.

471
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,280
If you make a scene, you'll get hurt.

472
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,180
Do you really think
you'll get away with this?

473
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,350
Let's just go quietly.

474
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,350
- See that he gets there safely.
- Yes, sir!

475
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,150
You punk! Get your hands off me!

476
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,590
You punk!

477
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,410
So long, Min Doo Sik.

478
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,180
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

479
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,130
You think I'm going to let this go?

480
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,130
The day I get out of here,
you're all dead.

481
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,700
That's not going to happen.

482
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,730
You'll live out
the rest of your days here,

483
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,000
and this is where you will die.

484
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,240
Are you going to kick me out
now that the chairman is gone?

485
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,510
If you don't want to get kicked out,
watch your step.

486
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,040
You think I'm just going to let you be?
Just you wait.

487
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,280
I can't speak for the others,

488
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,780
but I'm definitely taking you down
with me.
