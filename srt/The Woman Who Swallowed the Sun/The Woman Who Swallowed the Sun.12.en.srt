00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,540
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,950
(Mingang Distribution)

3
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,900
(Mingang Distribution)

4
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,250
I'd like to meet Kim Sun Jae from Legal.

5
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,180
I'm Baek Sul Hee. He knows me.

6
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,350
Just a moment, please.

7
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,660
Someone is here to see
Mr. Kim Sun Jae from Legal.

8
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,730
Baek Sul Hee. She says he knows her.

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,800
Okay, thank you.

10
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,200
He's in a meeting. You'll have to wait.

11
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,240
Nice to meet you.

12
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,750
I'm Moon Tae Kyung.

13
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,510
We meet at last.

14
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,320
I've been waiting for this moment.

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

16
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,850
I've hired many great talents...

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,460
and paid a fortune to scout people,

18
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,460
but you gave me the hardest time.

19
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,260
I apologize.

20
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,830
I had to tackle
some urgent personal issues first.

21
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,460
If you feel bad about that,
do your best for me.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,700
I expect a lot.

23
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,070
- This is...
- I'm Director Min Soo Jung.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,240
Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,240
Our goal is
to run the business like a family.

26
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,610
Just remember that familism
is at the center of everything.

27
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,350
I hope we can trust each other
like family.

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,110
Let's go somewhere quiet.

29
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,500
You lost all sense of reason.

30
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,100
Who do you think you are,
coming to my workplace and calling me?

31
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,210
What if the lady in the lobby notices?

32
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,610
What will you do about that?

33
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,780
Will you be responsible?

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,710
Why?

35
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,750
Are you afraid the lady will tell the CEO?

36
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,120
I see why you're antsy.

37
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,790
You want more than anything
to impress her.

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,760
You skipped all the fancy law firms
to work here,

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,530
so you must've had a plan.

40
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,970
There's no way
Kim Sun Jae would put his neck...

41
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,500
on the line for a meager salary.

42
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,070
Your goal is to win over Min Kyung Chae...

43
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,740
and join the royal family.

44
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,180
You can't deny it.

45
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,050
Why do you care what my goal is?

46
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,310
Remember your place.

47
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,580
You asked who my daughter's father was.

48
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,650
I saw the fear in your eyes...

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,820
when you thought she might be Kim Mi So.

50
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,730
You already gave me the answer
by denying my paternity.

51
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,060
You denied it multiple times.

52
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,900
But you didn't believe me.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,370
You still don't believe me.

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,800
I came here to confirm it for you.

55
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,570
Let's report the result...

56
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,270
to the CEO of Mingang.

57
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,840
You shouldn't refuse
if you have nothing to hide.

58
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,720
Why? Are you afraid...

59
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,690
that my daughter might be yours?

60
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,890
You have my number, right?

61
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,630
With your funds and contacts,
you can get it no problem.

62
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,270
The two witnesses you bought
who lied in the TV interview.

63
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,140
Arrange a meeting with them.

64
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,340
Or next time,
we'll meet in the CEO's office.

65
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,380
I'll bring the DNA report...

66
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,750
for both you and Min Kyung Chae to see.

67
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,380
My gosh.

68
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,850
You actually have changed.

69
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,050
You learned to blackmail people.

70
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,720
I can do even worse.

71
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,260
I won't wait long.

72
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,710
You said you didn't know her.

73
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,070
The mother of the teenage victim.

74
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,010
I don't like people who make secrets.

75
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,580
She's not mine, is she?

76
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,450
No way.

77
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,990
Whether she is or not,

78
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,190
this cannot come out.

79
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,060
Why did we have to
cross paths again like this?

80
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,630
Darn it.

81
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,200
Shoot.

82
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,050
At 3 p.m. Wucheon Crossroads, Cafe Brulee.

83
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,280
I set up the meeting.
The rest is up to you.

84
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,020
They won't change their statement
because you ask them to.

85
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,660
Appealing to their humanity won't work
when they were bought.

86
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,340
If you wait here, you can meet
Bo Ram and the cafe owner.

87
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,980
I'll come with you.

88
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,310
I don't want you to.

89
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,150
- I'll come with you.
- I said no.

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,750
I'm too worried to send you on your own.

91
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,050
Why are you worried?

92
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,320
Are you worried I'll beat them up?

93
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,060
You know that's not what I mean.

94
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,330
I'm still angry with you.

95
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,100
Why did you drag your feet
when you could arrange a meeting so soon?

96
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,700
Did you want to see me suffer?

97
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,040
It's not that.

98
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,670
I'll talk with them on my own,
and then I'll speak with you.

99
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,140
- Mi So.
- Please!

100
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,280
Let me go on my own.

101
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,960
I hope she can get through to them.

102
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,800
People who betrayed you once...

103
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,470
won't be able to come clean too easily.

104
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Goodness.

105
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,450
I picked on a rich girl,

106
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,280
got beaten up on purpose,

107
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,850
and blackmailed her for money?

108
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,690
Am I really like that?

109
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,390
Why did you lie in the interview?

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,260
You're an adult.

111
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,630
An adult shouldn't do this.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,270
Because of what you did,

113
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,340
I lost everything.

114
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,410
I hit rock bottom
because of one fake news report!

115
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,080
Come forward and say
you lied in the interview.

116
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,250
Sorry. I can't do that.

117
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,680
Why can't you?

118
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,950
I'm just asking you to tell the truth!

119
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,360
I have nothing more to say.

120
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,570
My dad was jobless for a while
after he was urged to retire early...

121
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,040
from his previous job.

122
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,570
He couldn't find work,

123
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,080
so we were barely paying rent.

124
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,710
My parents were always fighting.

125
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,980
My dad has a nice job now.

126
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,850
We're better off,
and my family's all smiles.

127
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,890
I haven't been this happy in a long time.

128
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,960
Can't you let it go
and go on with your life?

129
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,800
That's what you got
in return for the fake interview.

130
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,830
You sold me out to become happy.

131
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,870
Are you pleased now?

132
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,710
You were my best friend.

133
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,410
How could you...

134
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,810
push me over a cliff?

135
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,050
You could've settled
with that family for money.

136
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,620
They're rich and would've given you
whatever you asked for.

137
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,320
Why did you want to punish her?

138
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,060
Shouldn't she be punished
for doing something wrong?

139
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,660
To be honest,
now I think you're in the wrong.

140
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,230
You're still dragging things on.

141
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,030
- I'm what?
- You are.

142
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,700
It came this far.
You could just let it go.

143
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,740
So what if you got beaten up?

144
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,640
It didn't kill you.

145
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,040
Angry people get violent sometimes.

146
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,810
Wu Bo Ram!

147
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,280
Her dad is the chairman
of Mingang Distribution.

148
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,020
They're not like us.

149
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,150
You should let it go.

150
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,850
How can I let it go?

151
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,030
I feel so wronged
that I want to die if I could.

152
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,130
Would you not care if I died?

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,330
I have to get to class.

154
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,010
I can't live like this. It's not fair.

155
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,050
Tell me, Bo Ram.

156
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,820
Will you care if I die?

157
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,120
Tell me!

158
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,620
Will you care if I die?

159
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,130
Tell me!

160
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,470
You will care!

161
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,740
Don't threaten me with that.

162
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,980
That's your choice.

163
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,550
(Mingang Distribution)

164
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,840
(Mingang Distribution)

165
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,240
- Take this too.
- Okay.

166
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,250
Oh, dear.

167
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,050
Are you all right?

168
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,430
Yeon Ah. Why do I feel so anxious?

169
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,060
Should I have gone with Mi So?

170
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,630
I think I should go after her.

171
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,670
Okay.

172
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,220
(My darling Madam Baek)

173
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,490
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to...

174
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,040
(My darling Madam Baek)

175
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,880
It's not fair.

176
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,810
I'm so angry, and it's driving me crazy!

177
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,680
I know you feel wronged, honey.

178
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,920
I'm your mom. Of course, I know.

179
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,220
Where are you?

180
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,260
Will you come home?

181
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,490
Come home and talk to me.

182
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,030
Why should I suffer like this...

183
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,430
when I did nothing wrong?

184
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,740
Bo Ram says...

185
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,210
she thinks I'm in the wrong now.

186
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,110
She thinks it's all my fault.

187
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,880
How could she say that to me?

188
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,720
You said people who did wrong
would be punished.

189
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,690
That's how the world works.
That's what you told me.

190
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,360
You said everyone paid for doing wrong.

191
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,730
So why...

192
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,500
Why won't they be punished?

193
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,140
Are the rich allowed to get away with it?

194
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,640
I'll make them pay.

195
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,910
I'll punish them for you.

196
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,250
How? They don't even know
what they did wrong.

197
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,390
How will you punish them?

198
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,150
I'll do anything.

199
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,530
I can do anything if it helps
clear your name and makes you feel better.

200
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,530
I promise.

201
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,370
So come home, okay?

202
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,910
Don't even think about
doing anything foolish.

203
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Mi So.

204
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,080
Are you listening?

205
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,180
Mom.

206
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,920
Mom.

207
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,020
I'm sorry, Mom.

208
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,400
Mi So.

209
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,270
Mi So.

210
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
Mi So?

211
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,530
Mi So, no!

212
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,340
Oh, my gosh.

213
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,440
- It's a person.
- It's a person?

214
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,640
- A person?
- It's a woman!

215
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,030
Mi So.

216
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,000
Mi So.

217
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,930
The person you called is unavailable.

218
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,870
Connecting to voicemail.

219
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,520
Yeon Ah.

220
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,420
What should I do with Mi So?

221
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,320
You haven't found her yet?

222
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,860
We talked, but she hung up on me.

223
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,660
And now, she won't pick up.

224
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,130
I'm scared to death.

225
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,870
Then call the police first.

226
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
The police?

227
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,370
Silly me.

228
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,280
She'll be fine. Don't worry too much.

229
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,940
Go to the police station... No.

230
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,480
Go to the nearest patrol division.

231
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,120
Okay. I'll do that.

232
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,150
- How did she get in?
- Who is she?

233
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,320
She fell so fast...

234
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,620
and smashed the glass.

235
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,600
Hey, you.

236
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,930
Why is there a crowd over here?

237
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,330
There was an accident.

238
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,040
An accident?

239
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,770
Yes.

240
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,480
What?

241
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,010
Why did you let an outsider
into the building?

242
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,980
I'm sorry, sir.
She sneaked in before anyone noticed.

243
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,780
Did you identify her?

244
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,020
Let's see the CCTV footage
for the lobby and elevators.

245
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,460
(Mingang Distribution)

246
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,360
Shall we get right into discussing
the launch ceremony?

247
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,860
The ceremony is up to the company.

248
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,400
I want to put together a task force team
to manage the new business.

249
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,900
We handpicked
some of the smartest people...

250
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,010
from Business Strategy
and some other core divisions.

251
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,980
You can hire more staff
if you have someone in mind.

252
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,940
Okay. That sounds good.

253
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,010
I'd like my team...

254
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,250
to operate without scrutiny
or interference from other teams.

255
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,220
I don't need my own office.

256
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,890
I want to work with my team.

257
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,730
I offered you full authority,
so run the team as you wish.

258
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Great.

259
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,200
Oh, and I don't need
a secretary or driver.

260
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,470
I manage my own schedule,

261
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,700
and I'm a pretty great driver.

262
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,210
That's up to you.

263
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,470
(Mingang Distribution)

264
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,040
What perfect timing.

265
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,650
This is Kim Sun Jae,
a lawyer on our legal team.

266
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,480
This is Moon Tae Kyung,
the general managing director...

267
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,580
of the new business.

268
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,460
CEO Min.
I need to speak with you in private.

269
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,590
I will excuse myself, then.

270
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,560
No. Excuse us for a bit.

271
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,780
What is it?

272
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,320
It was during work hours,
so not many saw it in person.

273
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,860
I had them all sign an NDA...

274
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,330
and swore them to secrecy,
so it'll be fine.

275
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,690
Just when we're about to launch
a new business?

276
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,060
We need all the luck we can get.

277
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I'll take care of it.
Don't worry too much.

278
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,180
I'm so sorry.

279
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,180
I left you alone on our first day.

280
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,480
It's fine.

281
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,650
May I ask what that was about?

282
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,590
It was nothing important.

283
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,360
How about we go somewhere else?

284
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,930
I know a very nice teahouse.
I go there a lot.

285
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,860
Why don't we have some tea
and discuss the new business?

286
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,900
We can do that here.

287
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,830
A different atmosphere
might loosen us up...

288
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,540
enough to touch on non-business topics.

289
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,470
For example,
the reason you wanted to access...

290
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,480
our confidential files
even before you started.

291
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,850
Why do you want to know that now...

292
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,650
when you've already given permission?

293
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,890
I gave you conditional permission.

294
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,460
The condition is that
you meet the goals set by the company...

295
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,590
within four years of the launch
of the new business.

296
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,630
We started off pretty amicably.
Shall we continue the discussion?

297
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,170
I'll say this again.

298
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,040
If you speak of the unfortunate incident
that happened today,

299
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,680
you must compensate the company
for breaking the NDA.

300
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,720
Do you understand?

301
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,450
- Yes.
- Yes.

302
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,890
Any random rumor,

303
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,350
any line in the paper,

304
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,890
or any comment made online
that you think is anonymous...

305
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,630
will be thoroughly checked and traced.

306
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,260
You will be sued and blacklisted.

307
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,030
Remember, you might never work again,

308
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,270
not just in our industry but in any field.

309
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,170
Be sure to keep your lips sealed.
Do you understand?

310
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,410
- Yes.
- Yes.

311
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,670
Now, get back to work.

312
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,150
We can't open a case for that.

313
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,460
Wait.

314
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,020
We were on the phone,

315
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,760
but then she didn't pick up.

316
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
You spoke with her an hour ago.

317
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,300
Maybe she can't pick up now.

318
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,000
Give it a little more time.

319
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,030
It's more serious than that.

320
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,500
My daughter isn't in her right mind.

321
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,540
What if...

322
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,740
she decided to do something drastic?

323
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,540
(Human Rights, Impartiality, Kindness)

324
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,880
Hello?

325
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,110
It's me, Sun Jae.

326
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,580
I can't talk. Bye.

327
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,550
I called because I think
it was your daughter.

328
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,230
What do you mean?

329
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,000
What about Mi So?

330
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,230
There was an incident here today.

331
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,600
Go to Hankuk Hospital.

332
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Nurse.

333
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,590
Where's the girl who just came in?

334
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,590
From Mingang Distribution, right?

335
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,720
Yes.

336
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,190
Go to the morgue.

337
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,970
This isn't my daughter.

338
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,710
There's no way she'd be here.

339
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,080
It's not her.

340
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,880
Mi So was only hurt.

341
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,820
It can't be.

342
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,350
I came to the wrong place.

343
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,660
It must be another hospital.

344
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,140
Sul Hee!

345
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,780
What are you doing here?

346
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,450
My Mi So...

347
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,460
is in the morgue.

348
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,290
What?

349
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,100
That's weird.

350
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,240
Why isn't it a dream?

351
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,310
This has to be a dream.

352
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,050
- Sul Hee!
- Why isn't it a dream?

353
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,390
It makes no sense.

354
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,690
Why would Mi So die?

355
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,230
She can't die. Not my daughter...

356
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,630
She...

357
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,700
She was born prematurely,

358
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,200
and she survived the NICU.

359
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,270
All the doctors said she wouldn't make it,

360
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,780
but she clung to life.

361
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,640
She wouldn't die this easily.

362
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,550
No. This is a dream.

363
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,320
No! This isn't true.

364
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,990
No!

365
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,060
No. It has to be a dream.

366
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,030
This can't be true. It's not.

367
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,030
No!

368
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,160
Sul Hee.

369
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,810
- No!
- Sul Hee...

370
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,080
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

371
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,990
Who cares about one dead girl?

372
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,560
There's nothing I haven't seen
in my career.

373
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,330
I got tears and blood on my hands.

374
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,130
I'm glad and grateful
that you're before me.

375
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,900
What's wrong? Is someone dead?

376
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,470
You want Mi So to be dead, don't you?

377
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,600
Get a grip, Sul Hee.
Why are you like this?

378
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,610
My Mi So isn't dead.

379
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,970
My daughter isn't dead!

380
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,740
You speak as if
you're a member of the owner's family.

381
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,050
Who knows? I could become family.

382
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,910
- Mr. Moon Tae Kyung?
- Who are you?

383
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,420
Stella Jang. The queen of high society.
