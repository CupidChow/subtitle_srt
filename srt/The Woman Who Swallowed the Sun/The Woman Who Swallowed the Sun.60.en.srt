1
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,420
Are you insane?

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,990
Are you okay, Mom?

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,520
What?

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,290
"Mom?"

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,060
Yes. "Mom."

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,070
(Episode 60)

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,570
That's what she'll be
when she marries Dad.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,370
I can start calling her that now!

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,270
You've lost your mind completely.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,810
Who are you calling "Mom?"

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,710
Do you know who your mom is?

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,110
You're the one who has lost your mind.

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,150
Look at what you've done.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,020
Don't you see people are staring?

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,990
How could you pour wine on someone?

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,730
Why have you lost control of your senses?

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm disappointed in you.

18
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,330
I know you hate Ms. Jung,

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,600
but there are things
you just shouldn't do!

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,770
I might be a stubborn troublemaker,
but even I know that much.

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,190
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,620
It's okay.

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,160
Your presence was so reassuring.

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,430
That's the first time
anyone has said that.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,770
Everyone else wondered
why I was even born.

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,970
Who would say something that horrible?
You're so special and precious.

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,040
Oh, no...

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,410
It's okay.

29
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,710
Don't cry.

30
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,390
Is Se Ri home?

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
No.

32
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,960
Ms. Kyung Chae.
Is the chairman really getting married?

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,200
I was so shocked by the news
that I took a pill to calm my nerves.

34
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,000
Why are you back so late?
We've been waiting for you all evening.

35
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,670
The house was turned upside down.

36
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,640
Where's my father?

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,310
In his bedroom.

38
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,680
Get Soo Jung.

39
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,810
Here she is.

40
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,720
Hey. You'll join us too, right?

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,190
- To do what?
- "To do what?"

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,290
Stop acting on your own.

43
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,620
We don't stand much of a chance
even if we were to stick together.

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,670
We need to talk.

45
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,840
Father. What was that announcement about?

46
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,580
This is too much.

47
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,880
How could you think of marrying her?

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,980
Yes, Father.

49
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,650
You should've given us a heads-up.

50
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,650
We're your immediate family.

51
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,320
We're not distant acquaintances...

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,120
who'd show up for the buffet
with a monetary gift.

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,390
This makes no sense!

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,330
She's the same age as Kyung Chae,
so she's younger than me.

55
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,230
Do you expect me
to accept her as a stepmom?

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,030
Let's talk in the living room.

57
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,140
What did you flock over
to make a fuss about?

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,740
This is about everything.

59
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,510
It's so out of the blue.

60
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,440
Father. Will you marry her for real?

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,450
Are you expecting a fake wedding?

62
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,050
Father. Have you gone crazy?

63
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,780
Or have you gone senile?

64
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,790
How can you do this to your own children?

65
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,360
This wedding can't happen.

66
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,760
What right do you have to object?

67
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,860
Your marriage isn't just a personal event.

68
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,560
You're a public figure.

69
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,200
You can't forget that.

70
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,000
This kind of decision is an insult to us.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,100
What about you?

72
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,340
Didn't you insult me?

73
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,170
Should I let you off
for threatening an innocent person?

74
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,810
What if you end up doing something worse?

75
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,310
Just because you didn't like her,

76
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,610
you tried to have her kidnapped
and locked up. How could you?

77
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,080
Do you still think you have the right
to tell me not to marry her?

78
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,450
What's this about?

79
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,460
What kidnapping?

80
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,690
So you'll marry someone
from goodness knows where?

81
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,930
You have to give her a stake
in the company if you marry her.

82
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,100
She could use that to take over Mingang.

83
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,170
Lucia is a better person than you.

84
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,670
Father!

85
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,970
Don't say a word!

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,070
She saved your life,
so lie low and do as you're told.

87
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,780
She had proof of the whole thing.

88
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,180
She could've reported you
for attempted kidnapping.

89
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,050
I'd have taken the video to the police
if Lucia hadn't stopped me!

90
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,550
Then you'd have been charged
with conspiring to kidnap her.

91
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,690
You'd have lost your title
and your stake in Mingang.

92
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,060
Lucia talked me out of firing you.

93
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,260
You owe everything to her.

94
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,500
As of this moment,

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,530
if you say one more thing about Lucia,

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,140
know that I'll kick you out immediately.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,240
Not just from home...

98
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,070
but from the company too!

99
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,050
Hey, Soo Jung.

100
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,920
What was that kidnapping
Father talked about?

101
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,860
Kyung Chae tried to have Lucia kidnapped
to break up the relationship.

102
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,260
Kyung Chae can be so scary.

103
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,170
Kidnapping is something
I'd only expect to see in a movie.

104
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,000
It backfired spectacularly.

105
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,070
She gave Father more reason to fight back.

106
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,240
What man would sit back and do nothing
when his girlfriend got kidnapped?

107
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,790
Do you know what this aria is about?

108
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,830
I've heard it before,
but I don't know the story.

109
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,030
To be honest, no one
listens to classical music these days.

110
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,000
The Queen of the Night
gives her daughter a sword...

111
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,110
and tells her to assassinate her rival.

112
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,540
It's a song about fiery revenge.

113
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,010
That's freaky.

114
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,080
Se Ri. Could you get revenge for your mom?

115
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,850
I don't know.

116
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,590
You'll have to drive a sword
into your sister's heart.

117
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,060
The sword I give you.

118
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,000
Shall we hug each other to sleep tonight?

119
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,270
I'd like that.

120
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,640
Congratulations, Lucia.

121
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,510
Do you just have to
prepare to get married now?

122
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,650
Yes.

123
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,790
You have a great figure,
so you'll look incredible in a dress.

124
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,790
You don't even say hi
when you see an elder?

125
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,530
Would someone come after you
if you said hi first, Grandma?

126
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Not that again.

127
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,530
You have a lot to learn
from your new stepmom.

128
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,870
Why do you dislike me so much?

129
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,140
Think about what you're like.
Who could possibly like you?

130
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,810
What about you, Grandma?

131
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,510
Will you stop calling me that?
I wonder who you got that from.

132
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
At least I know I'm nothing like you.

133
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,720
You bet.

134
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,550
It would be a disaster
if you and I had anything in common.

135
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,790
Exactly. It would be a calamity.

136
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,930
What?

137
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,630
Oh, my gosh.

138
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,230
My blood pressure is spiking.

139
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,700
Oh, my goodness.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,200
She's a nice person.

141
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,740
As if she is.

142
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,770
She's just like my oldest sister.

143
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,840
She's a show-off too, isn't she?

144
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,480
Do you want to stay the night?

145
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,580
Can I really?

146
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,020
I'll call the chairman.

147
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,020
Why would I worry?

148
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,130
Wherever you are would be
the safest place in the world.

149
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll send her home in a taxi
after breakfast tomorrow morning.

150
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
Okay.

151
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,800
See you tomorrow at work.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

153
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,040
(Wedding of Chairman Min Doo Sik,
2 p.m., August 30, 2025)

154
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,160
We need to talk.

155
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
Are you going to...

156
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,080
marry Chairman Min?

157
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,680
I meant...

158
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,520
to tell you ahead of time.

159
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,580
Why?

160
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,090
Why were you going to tell me beforehand?

161
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,520
Was I...

162
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,530
special or important to you at all?

163
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,200
Director.

164
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,100
You can't do this to me, then.

165
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,540
Doing this to me
while saying I mean something to you...

166
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,670
You knew what I was up to.

167
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,310
And why I had to do this.

168
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,640
Even so, how could you do this to me?

169
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,120
Do I play no part in your life?

170
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,390
Is there no room at all for me...

171
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,920
in the numerous days
you have left to live?

172
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,670
An orphan has no parents.

173
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,870
A widow has no husband.

174
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,700
A widower has no wife.

175
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
There's a term for everything...

176
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,840
but a parent who lost a child.

177
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,380
It's because the pain...

178
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,850
of losing a child is beyond words.

179
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,450
That's the state I'm in.

180
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,860
How could I...

181
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,030
dare wish to be with someone like you?

182
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,430
You can. It's okay to want it.

183
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,330
Love doesn't care
if you deserve it or not.

184
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,840
When an animal loses its young,

185
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,740
it goes after the attacker...

186
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,580
and bites and claws at it until it dies.

187
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,550
Do you know what happens...

188
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,520
once it avenges its dead young?

189
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,330
They head to a cliff...

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,160
and jump.

191
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,670
Because they have...

192
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,840
no reason left to live.

193
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,580
I'll give you a reason to live.

194
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,220
Can't you live for me?

195
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,230
I'll be your reason to live.

196
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,200
You can be mine.

197
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,760
Ms. Baek.

198
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,870
I like you very much.

199
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,540
I like you a lot.

200
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,250
Not as Jung Lucia but as Baek Sul Hee.

201
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,720
This moment is the last one...

202
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,690
for you to turn back.

203
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,460
I'm pretty sure I said
I didn't want to see you again.

204
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,460
That's not the issue right now.

205
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,770
What is this?

206
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,200
Lucia gave the chairman...

207
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,200
a signed waiver giving up her rights
to a stake in the company.

208
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,800
It was notarized by a lawyer.

209
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,950
The chairman had called another lawyer
so that I wouldn't find out about it.

210
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,780
Don't you know what that means?

211
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,490
It means that Lucia is no threat...

212
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,960
even if she were to marry the chairman.

213
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,690
- So what?
- Don't antagonize him any further.

214
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,930
Let them get married.

215
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,270
She can't do anything anyway.

216
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,370
We can figure out a way
to deal with her after the wedding.

217
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,520
Hey. Why aren't you at work?

218
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,650
Oh, it's a Saturday.

219
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,520
Why are you so glum?

220
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,990
Today...

221
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,270
is the day she marries the chairman.

222
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,170
So they're tying the knot.

223
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,600
It can't be helped.
It's out of your hands.

224
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,810
You did your best to talk her out of it.

225
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,880
It's the detective.

226
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,780
Hello, Detective.

227
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,150
Right now?

228
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,390
Yes, of course I'm free.

229
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,990
I'll be right there. See you soon.

230
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,230
There's some good news.
The detective wants to see me.

231
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,330
He'll help me apply for a retrial
and call Min Doo Sik in for questioning.

232
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,530
Oh, that's great.

233
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,430
I'll go see him, then.

234
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,570
- Cheer up.
- Yes.

235
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,010
Let's go.

236
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,150
Where are we, Detective?

237
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,350
Why aren't we at the police station?

238
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
What the...

239
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,440
Who are you? Why did you bring me here?

240
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,480
Darn it.

241
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,910
Let me go. Let go of me!

242
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,550
Let go!

243
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,760
Hello, sir. I did as you said
and brought him here.

244
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,890
The place was deserted for a long time.

245
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,800
Nothing seems to live here.

246
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,000
Take care of him right away.

247
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,600
Okay.

248
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,500
No, wait. There's still some time.

249
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,210
I'll come over, so wait there.

250
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,680
I must witness his end myself.

251
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,480
Goodness.

252
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,690
Oh, gosh.

253
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,490
Who put you up to this?

254
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,330
Who was it?

255
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,600
You fool.

256
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,300
Figure out who you're up against
before you throw a punch.

257
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,370
You're not even in the same weight class.

258
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,600
How dare you try to take on a chairman?

259
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,310
Min Doo Sik told you to do this?

260
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,210
That scumbag.

261
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,110
Thank you.

262
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,020
Ms. Jung. You're beautiful.

263
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,690
You look like a real-life goddess.

264
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,290
Lucia.

265
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,290
Have a good life.

266
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,060
I will.

267
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,410
Is she my sworn enemy's wife now?

268
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,910
How am I to face you now?

269
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,350
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,650
And...

271
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,190
I love you.

272
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,910
Long time no see, CEO Min.

273
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,980
Oh, perhaps
I should congratulate you first.

274
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,080
I think you should be congratulated.

275
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,890
What do you mean?

276
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,720
You and Lucia worked together all along.

277
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,820
And you got what you wanted.

278
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,460
Why say that on this special day?

279
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,090
You're all thorny.

280
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,370
What a brat.

281
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,240
You haven't learned your lesson yet.

282
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,010
It might take suffering
under a stepmom who's your age...

283
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,940
for you to be put in your place.

284
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,410
My dear Stella Jang.

285
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,550
What brings you here, madam?

286
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,890
Who are you again?

287
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,330
Oh, it's you. We met somewhere.

288
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,000
This is Min Doo Sik's son's father-in-law,

289
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,170
and he owns a big chunk
of Mingang Distribution?

290
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,670
In that case...

291
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,310
I'm here as one of Mingang's
non-executive directors.

292
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
What about you?

293
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,380
Writers big and small
have one word for this.

294
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,540
"Destiny."

295
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,250
I'm connected to Mingang for many reasons.

296
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,850
It's almost a dream to know...

297
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,850
you're a non-executive director.

298
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,090
Is it? Then keep that in mind now.

299
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,290
We could meet more often...

300
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,290
if you were a non-executive director too.

301
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,730
"We?"

302
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,970
That's the word I love the most
out of every one in the Korean language.

303
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,930
Yes, "we."

304
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,770
You and me together.

305
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,810
I'd love to see you more often.

306
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,540
Here's one from me too.

307
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,110
And one more. And many more.

308
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,020
Oh, my gosh. There's a woman
right over there who is furious,

309
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,350
and she's glaring daggers.

310
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,190
It's your wife, isn't it?

311
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,860
Oh, I'm so scared.

312
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,130
I don't know that woman.

313
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,800
I'm sorry, but we must part ways today.

314
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,010
See you very soon again, Stella Jang.

315
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,580
You beautiful woman.

316
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,550
You should sell vinegar, not black goat.

317
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,290
- Tie him up.
- Okay.

318
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
Hey.

319
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,610
Let's finish him up after a smoke break.

320
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,010
- Okay.
- Sure.

321
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,710
(Moon Tae Kyung)

322
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,200
Hello, Mr. Jo.

323
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,530
Hello?

324
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,300
- Hello?
- Jo Pil Doo.

325
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,810
Hey, Jo Pil Doo.

326
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,680
Wake up!

327
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,810
You can't die on me already.
That wouldn't do me any good.

328
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,680
My gosh.

329
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,500
Do you think bringing me here
to beat me up...

330
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,570
will scare me?

331
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,480
(Moon Tae Kyung)

332
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,080
I'll report you all to the police!

333
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,080
You're such a fool. I am the police.

334
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,320
How can you call this in
when you don't know where you are?

335
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,820
You think I don't know?

336
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,690
I know where we are. We're at...

337
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,990
What made you so brave all of a sudden?

338
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,930
What good will being brave do you
when you'll die anyway?

339
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,640
We're at Yeonmyeon-dong 78, Wonchang-gu.

340
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,510
How do you know that?

341
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,810
I saw the address on the satnav...

342
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,680
when you drove us here.

343
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,090
Yeonmyeon-dong 78!

344
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,920
Turn left at the crossroads!

345
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,360
Do you think
anyone will come and save you?

346
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,400
(Moon Tae Kyung)

347
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,570
Darn it.

348
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,180
Mr. Jo.

349
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,050
Mr. Jo!

350
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,980
Wonchang-gu, 78, crossroads.

351
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,350
Yeonmyeon-dong 78,
turn left at the crossroads.

352
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Turn left.

353
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,430
You sneaky thing.
How long was that on for?

354
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,240
You don't scare me.

355
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,170
Tell Min Doo Sik...

356
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,370
that the son of Doeun Industries' CEO
Han Kyung Soo...

357
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,780
is right under his nose
and ready to strike.

358
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,450
I bet Min Doo Sik
would never recognize him.

359
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,980
The guy is pretending to be someone else.

360
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,160
Hello, sir.

361
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,540
Han Kyung Soo's son is ready to strike me?

362
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,940
It's only natural for a son
to want to avenge his parents.

363
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,240
No.

364
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,680
The big and strong
eat up the small and weak.

365
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,980
That's the law of nature
and order of the universe.

366
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,250
Who's the fool
who hid his identity to come for me?

367
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,120
Why would I tell you that?

368
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,460
It's worth waiting to see you get hit
when you least expect it.

369
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,430
You'd better do as you're told.

370
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,860
Or this is where you die.

371
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,770
I won't beg for my life
to someone like you.

372
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,040
You should think about it.

373
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,810
Why die like this
defending Han Kyung Soo's son?

374
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,380
He's nothing to you.

375
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,280
You're not even related.

376
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,720
Tell me who he is,

377
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,960
and not only will I let you live,
but I'll give you a lot of money too.

378
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,990
Don't you want to live abroad?

379
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,700
You could even marry a local woman.

380
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,070
How dare you?

381
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
You...

382
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,690
Darn it.

383
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,630
My gosh.

384
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,980
Goodness.

385
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,210
Go into hiding for a while.

386
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,450
Detective Park. Clean up thoroughly.

387
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,120
Don't worry, sir.

388
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,890
I'll put him down as a homeless man.

389
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,790
My gosh.

390
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,680
Mr. Jo!

391
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,150
Mr. Jo!

392
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,920
Mr. Jo!

393
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Mr. Jo!

394
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,030
Mr. Jo.

395
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,900
Mr. Jo.

396
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Mr. Jo.

397
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,200
Wake up. Mr. Jo.

398
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,070
Mr. Jo!

399
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,140
Mr. Jo!

400
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,380
Mr. Jo. Wake up.

401
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,250
Who did this?

402
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,550
Mr. Jo. I'm sorry.

403
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,520
I'm so sorry.

404
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,790
Mr. Jo!

405
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,420

406
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,260
