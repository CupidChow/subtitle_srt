1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,270
If you want to berate someone,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,280
figure out the circumstances
and see why they did what they did.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,880
First, try to see if they had
a good enough reason.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,310
Are you lecturing me?

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,280
I didn't mean to lecture you,

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,950
but I'm glad you've learned something.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,970
What are you doing?

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,240
Are you all right?

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,740
What's going on? What is this about?

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,350
I don't know what this is about,
but we're all at work,

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,110
and assaulting another
in full view of other employees?

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,090
You must know it cannot be justified,
whatever the reason.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,520
Shouldn't you first ask me
what it was about?

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,260
I just said that it can't be justified,
whatever the reason.

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,290
Are you condemning me?

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,660
That's for later.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,660
Apologize first.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,870
You want me to apologize to her?

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,970
Of course.

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,400
You were extremely discourteous.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,570
As a human being and as a CEO,

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,040
you showed a side of yourself
that you never should.

23
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,320
Before you humiliate yourself even further
in front of the employees,

24
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,120
apologize to her.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,940
Leave it, Director.

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,140
I don't need an apology.

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,210
You heard her.

28
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,440
She doesn't need an apology.

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,420
If you don't know what's going on,
stay out of other people's business.

30
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,200
You didn't have to get involved too.

31
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,560
What if things get blown up?

32
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,100
What do you mean?

33
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,900
Do you think I'll get fired
for standing up to the CEO?

34
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,870
If she wants to fire me over that, fine.

35
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,570
A company like this has no hope.

36
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,010
What was she so upset about that she...

37
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,050
It's nothing.

38
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,460
(Mingang Distribution)

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,900
What was that about?

40
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,400
Did that Lucia woman badmouth you?

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,500
And you caught her?

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,270
Did she badmouth our company?

43
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,370
Like leaving negative comments online.

44
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,140
She didn't embezzle, did she?

45
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,950
That's what she did.

46
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,480
How much did she take?

47
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,050
It must be a sizable sum
if you were that angry.

48
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,920
- Ji Seop.
- What? Talk to me.

49
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,660
You can't take on
Director Moon on your own.

50
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,930
I'll back you up, so don't worry.

51
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,560
Who does he think he is
that he demanded you apologize?

52
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,900
Are they working together?

53
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,970
Will they split the money she stole?

54
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,300
Get out.

55
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,670
I'm not in the mood for your nonsense.

56
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,940
Hey, I have massive news.

57
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,910
What happened this time?

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,680
Kyung Chae could get audited internally...

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,350
for assaulting an employee.

60
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,920
What are you on about?

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,280
What do you think I mean?

62
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,290
The Icy Witch Min Kyung Chae...

63
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,390
totally lost her cool.

64
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,190
In the lobby, in the employees' full view,

65
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,590
she slapped Lucia across the face.

66
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,700
Kyung Chae?

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,300
No way.

68
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,370
I'd have reacted the same way
if I hadn't seen it myself.

69
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,140
She never shows her emotions.

70
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,300
What I saw just now was a clear sign...

71
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,610
that she couldn't control her temper.

72
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,480
What was it about? There must be a reason.

73
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,480
I deleted the footage
from all the CCTV cameras in the area,

74
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,780
and I talked to the staff who were there
so that they wouldn't spread the word.

75
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,420
That's not the issue.

76
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,790
You said you had a source in the US.

77
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,890
It's not a personal source.
I know someone who knows someone.

78
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,590
What do you want?

79
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,190
When you looked into Lucia's past,

80
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,030
did you find anything odd?

81
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,800
Her past was way too clean.

82
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,370
Her diploma, thesis,
and bachelor's degree were all authentic,

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
and acquaintances and staffers...

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,010
who knew her in the US
talked about her life there.

85
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,580
Even people with conflicting interests...

86
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,710
didn't speak ill of her.

87
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,710
She's an immaculate human being, then.

88
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,320
If I want to dig deeper,

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,320
I must go through Madam Jang, then.

90
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,950
That's why I told you
to talk to Stella Jang.

91
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,560
On the outside, it may seem like
they're expats in the US...

92
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,330
with a superficial friendship,

93
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,590
but I'm pretty sure there's more to it.

94
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,860
In return for connecting me
to the private equity fund,

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,700
she made me hire Lucia
instead of asking for anything else.

96
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,600
Was it to spy on us?

97
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,800
Stella Jang must need Lucia for her plan,

98
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,970
and that's why
she needs Lucia to work here.

99
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,810
What do you think is her plan?

100
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,010
So...

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,880
What did you say or do
to get the CEO that angry?

102
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,820
May I ask?

103
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,350
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

104
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,190
Later. I'll tell you everything later.

105
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,530
Okay.

106
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,300
I'm always ready to listen.

107
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,900
Give me a sign when you want to talk.

108
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,070
Will you listen to whatever I say?

109
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,870
You bet. Anything.

110
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,610
I'll be an extra pair of ears.

111
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,640
Don't keep it bottled up.

112
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,080
It's bad for you.

113
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,150
Are you watching your company shares?

114
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,790
No, forget that.

115
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,430
Why don't you leave the shares with me?

116
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,200
I'll keep them safe for you,

117
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,900
and give them right back
when you get married.

118
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,330
Should I leave them with her?

119
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,540
I need a parent's signature
if I'm to sell them anyway.

120
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,860
What were you doing?

121
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,490
Nothing at all.

122
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
What?

123
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,330
Get ready to go out.

124
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Ms. Se Ri.

125
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,380
Why didn't you get changed?
We're traveling far.

126
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,480
Where are we going?

127
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,280
Let's go to a temple
and pray and bow 108 times...

128
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,550
to wish for the chairman's safe return.

129
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,420
Why would I do that?

130
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,490
I hate the smell of incense
and the sound of...

131
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,720
the wooden block even more.

132
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,060
I can't go on my own.

133
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,930
Don't go, then.

134
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,260
How are you all so calm and indifferent?

135
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,230
The chairman has been missing for days.

136
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,600
You're helpless, Manager Gong.

137
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,970
If something had happened to him,

138
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,340
we'd have heard
from the police or a hospital.

139
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,740
If he were abducted,

140
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,040
our phone would be ringing off the hook
with ransom demands.

141
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,210
Don't make such a fuss.

142
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,430
I don't know if it's something...

143
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,790
you want to forget
or remember from time to time,

144
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,900
but there was a time...

145
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,330
when you worked so hard,
you barely had time to eat.

146
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,070
That's how you made Mingang
what it is now.

147
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,910
I respected you for remembering...

148
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,710
the rice balls and rice wine bread
that could've meant nothing.

149
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,050
For someone young, she's thoughtful.

150
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,890
For someone young, she's vicious.

151
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,530
How dare she slap you?

152
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,130
It's not the first time
she slapped you, is it?

153
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,970
I think I saw her do this once before.

154
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,130
She did.

155
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,770
That's why they say people never change.

156
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,310
Send this to Lucia when the time is right.

157
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,580
Okay.

158
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,780
If the eldest is that messed up,
the youngest won't be any better.

159
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,950
It looks like Se Ri
will cause some huge trouble soon.

160
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,020
I need her to, so I can clean it up.

161
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,860
Will cleaning it up be enough?

162
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,660
You should wrap her
with a mom's warmth and love.

163
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,000
I should.

164
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,070
You won't visit the chairman today?

165
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,530
His children will barge in tonight...

166
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,970
now that they know where he is.

167
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,350
Why do you bother knocking
all the time? Come in.

168
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,950
How did you find me here?

169
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,790
Would we force you to come home
if we knew where you were?

170
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,330
How do you feel?

171
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,490
Doctor Kim says you're okay.

172
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,200
What are you doing here?

173
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,970
Why ask?
We're your children. We should visit.

174
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,870
We're so worried about you
that our lives are almost dismal.

175
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,440
My wife barely eats or drinks.

176
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,970
Why didn't you tell us you'd transfer?

177
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,610
We wouldn't have stopped you.

178
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,780
Exactly. He thinks we're nothing more
than a stuffed straw sack.

179
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,320
We were so worried
thinking he went missing.

180
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,380
How could you do this to us?
That was mean of you.

181
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,850
I transferred in secret
because I knew you'd be like this.

182
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,220
That you'd all come and yell in my ear.

183
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,630
Goodness...

184
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,530
Darn it.

185
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,370
Is the chairman all right?

186
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,140
He's not just all right.

187
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,840
I don't know what he had been up to,
but he looks great.

188
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,340
He even looks happy.

189
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,980
Why did he switch hospitals?

190
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,550
Wouldn't he be more comfortable at home?

191
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,050
Exactly. But no one knows
what he's thinking.

192
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,720
Someone should do a study on him.

193
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,690
Why didn't Ms. Kyung Chae
come home with you?

194
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,320
I don't know. She must have
some secret to discuss with Father.

195
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,300
Why didn't you go with them?

196
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,800
We need to talk.

197
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,070
You go first. How did you find me here?

198
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,610
She wouldn't have told you.

199
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,210
Did you have someone tail Lucia?

200
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,780
Shouldn't I?

201
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,710
How dare you step out of bounds?

202
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,350
Who do you think you are?

203
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,150
How can you say that?

204
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,890
How could you do this to us?

205
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,960
How could you see her behind our backs?

206
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,060
You can't let her
come and see you in private.

207
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,860
What would people say if they found out?

208
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,960
Who cares about that?

209
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,930
I can't do what I want out of fear
of what people might think?

210
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,270
What do you want to do?

211
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Date a woman
young enough to be your daughter?

212
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,900
Why can't I?

213
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,950
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

214
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
Hello, sir.

215
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,030
You didn't call or visit today.

216
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,130
You know why.

217
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,440
When I first saw you
in the lobby of this hospital.

218
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,370
When I saw you again in the restaurant.

219
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,810
At the temple
where I keep my wife's ashes,

220
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,680
and at work, where we kept crossing paths,

221
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,510
I didn't think it was destiny.

222
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,120
But I didn't think
it was a coincidence either.

223
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,950
It couldn't be a coincidence.

224
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,160
It felt as if someone
was setting the scene.

225
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,690
I know...

226
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,360
what you thought of me.

227
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,700
I knew you'd saved my life,

228
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,170
but I couldn't accept it right away.

229
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,710
I see how you feel now, though.

230
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,810
I suspected and doubted you
all this while.

231
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,710
I'd like to...

232
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,280
ask for your forgiveness.

233
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,420
What forgiveness? Don't say that.

234
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,690
I wouldn't dare expect that of you.

235
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,490
You said to me that...

236
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,060
I wasn't just anyone to you.

237
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,830
Do you remember?

238
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,600
I remember.

239
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,100
Do you still feel the same?

240
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,130
I'm not just anyone to you?

241
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,900
Tell me.

242
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,770
You're not.

243
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,480
That's fine, then.

244
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,180
Do as I say from now on.

245
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,580
Can you do that?

246
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,950
Yes. I'll do that.

247
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,220
You should go to sleep.

248
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,390
A good night's sleep
will speed your recovery.

249
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,460
Bye.

250
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,050
Mi So.

251
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,950
Mom is ready.

252
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,950
Watch me from where you are.

253
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,960
Who cares about that?

254
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,630
I can't do what I want out of fear
of what people might think?

255
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,470
What do you want to do?

256
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,570
Date a woman
young enough to be your daughter?

257
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,140
Why can't I?

258
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,220
(Mingang Distribution)

259
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,800
Wait for me.

260
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,210
Delete the chairman's number.

261
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,580
Don't call or visit him again.

262
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,020
Ignore any calls from him.

263
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,420
I won't repeat myself.

264
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,330
Why won't you answer?

265
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,670
Shouldn't you apologize first?

266
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,240
Shouldn't you show remorse first?

267
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,780
You lied to me...

268
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,010
without batting an eyelid.

269
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,880
The chairman...

270
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,280
Don't use him as an excuse.

271
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,220
For whatever reason,
do not approach the chairman...

272
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,650
My father. Stay away from him.

273
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,820
This is a warning.

274
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,530
You people never apologize for anything.

275
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,650
Where did the director go
that he hasn't come in yet?

276
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,450
He's the one who slacks off the most.

277
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,550
He has a meeting elsewhere.

278
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,190
He does not.

279
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,690
He's lying about
having a meeting to slack off.

280
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,960
Watch what you say.

281
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,900
Our director isn't that kind of person.

282
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,560
What?

283
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,300
Did I say something so nasty
that you'd talk to me like that?

284
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,370
Don't we all know
there's someone else on the team...

285
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,010
who disappears all the time
to do goodness knows what?

286
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,350
Did you say that for me to hear?

287
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,480
That's why you shouldn't
badmouth others behind their backs.

288
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,050
It's bad for morale.

289
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,290
I see you defend him all the time.

290
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,960
Has he been giving you some extra perks?

291
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,890
How much did he give you?

292
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,660
Yoon Seo. I believe
Mingang's Code of Ethics says...

293
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,930
that badmouthing and gossip
are also slander. Am I right?

294
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,770
Oh, yes. You're very right.

295
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,540
What the vice director just said
falls in that category.

296
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,040
In that case, we could
even report him to the Audit Team.

297
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,710
I don't think we even need to
hand in a recording.

298
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,980
We're all witnesses.

299
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,880
You're all ganging up on me.

300
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,910
Are you making me an outcast?

301
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,550
Do you know how bad that is?

302
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,290
- You look so nice and elegant.
- Thanks.

303
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,820
Your parents must be so pleased
to even look at you.

304
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,300
You're just as nice and lovely, madam.

305
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,560
"Madam?"

306
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,930
Did you call me "madam" and not "woman?"

307
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,540
It's the first time
anyone has called me that.

308
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,780
You have great taste and manners.

309
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,310
This is as stinky as a burp after eating
fermented skate and makgeolli.

310
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,610
You lose your mind around young men.

311
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,150
You'll pay off the money
you borrowed from me...

312
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,790
in CEO Jo's office?

313
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,420
Yes.

314
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,760
As you can see,
we don't live off of renting rooms.

315
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,790
I don't know what got into her,

316
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,960
but she wanted to rent out a bedroom.

317
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,400
I'm not a weirdo,
and I have solid references.

318
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,570
If you want,
I can submit the necessary proof.

319
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,810
Why would we need papers
when your face is your ID?

320
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,070
Can't you tell?

321
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,310
That's not the face of a fraud.

322
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,110
That makes as much sense as a stingray
throwing out its back dancing the hula.

323
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,750
If one's looks mean anything,

324
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,550
I'd be the president of the US.

325
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,380
A woman from any country
would fall for me.

326
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,420
For you?

327
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,790
You have the face
of a loan shark and nothing else.

328
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,830
Do you want to lose a molar
you kept in your head for over 60 years?

329
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,100
The problem is,
you're paying me back too soon.

330
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,770
"Too soon?" Rental agreements
are a minimum of two years long.

331
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,570
I'm talking about
the duration of the loan.

332
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,370
Private loans follow a contract,

333
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,540
but we just had a verbal agreement
since CEO Jo introduced you to me.

334
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
That means I lose out.

335
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,580
How about I pay you extra to cover...

336
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,480
the interest you miss out on?

337
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,750
I'll pay you double the monthly rent.

338
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,190
Double?

339
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,160
Sign the deal with him already.

340
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,230
Relax.

341
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,860
I'll think about it, then.

342
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,910
Gosh, is this real wild ginseng?

343
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,810
Of course it is. I dug it up.

344
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,420
How dare you come in here?

345
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,720
Pardon?

346
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,420
How dare an outsider like you
come in here?

347
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,120
Don't you see that camera up there?

348
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,060
Get out of this room!

349
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,730
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

350
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,500
Goodness.

351
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,210
That room is my husband's thingy room.

352
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,440
His "thingy room?"

353
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,480
What did he call it? Let me see...

354
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,220
Se... Segret.

355
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,950
"Segret?" Is that something in the room?

356
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,950
- Secret? His secret room?
- Yes, that's it.

357
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,090
He won't even let me in there.

358
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,930
At first, I thought he'd hidden
a young lady in there.

359
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,900
All the collateral
he collected is in there.

360
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,330
The collateral?

361
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,470
There are all sorts of things in the safe.

362
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,170
Contracts, promissory notes,
property deeds, and more.

363
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,740
Anyone who needs a loan from him
has to give up something.

364
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,850
Does he keep the collateral
from really old loans?

365
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,420
Not just that.

366
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,180
He has stuff from dead people too.

367
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,790
I wonder why he keeps stuff from people
who died before they paid him back.

368
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,290
Does he expect to collect after he dies?

369
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,660
Does he really have the collateral
he got from people who have since died?

370
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,930
You bet.

371
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,500
He won't even throw away
a scrap piece of paper.

372
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,330
He's worse than a ghost
when it comes to...

373
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,100
making money.

374
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,070
I'm a ghost that loves money.

375
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,040
You can have this.

376
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,310
Pay me double the rent
in advance and in cash, okay?

377
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,980
Yes.

378
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,220
Oh, and that room doesn't exist to you.

379
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,390
Okay.

380
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,830
You saved the chairman's life?

381
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,300
Is that why you're so proud?

382
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,070
What do you want to say this time?

383
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,210
Nothing good
will come from upsetting the CEO.

384
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,270
You might think
the chairman can shield you,

385
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,410
but soon enough,
the company will go to the CEO.

386
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,450
Are you telling me
to brown-nose her like you?

387
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,580
At least don't lie to her.

388
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,850
No one likes to be deceived,

389
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,720
but our CEO hates it to the extreme.

390
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,130
Don't you think it's wrong...

391
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,630
to follow someone to see where they go?

392
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,370
You wouldn't mind
if you had nothing to hide.

393
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,470
You're foolish.

394
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,470
You lie and deceive others,

395
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,780
and you think they fell for it
because they pretended to.

396
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,110
But the truth will always come out.

397
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,050
Mr. Kim Sun Jae.

398
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,250
I'm warning you. You should
refrain from saying nonsense...

399
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,290
without any context.

400
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,020
You're warning me?

401
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,960
It must be great to think
the chairman has your back.

402
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,630
What's going on?

403
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
You're picking on her again?

404
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,740
My gosh...

405
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,110
It must be nice
to have so many looking out for you.

406
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,020
What got into him this time?

407
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,750
It's nothing.

408
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,190
How did the meeting go?

409
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
Well...

410
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,590
I didn't have a meeting.

411
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,200
I had to move suddenly.

412
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,430
It's not a mistake or random occurrence.

413
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,630
It's more like a plan.

414
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,300
A plan?

415
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,470
Is it about your parents?

416
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Yes.

417
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,550
You must be extra careful, then.

418
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,080
You told me before that...

419
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,620
there's no rush.

420
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,320
You told me to go step by step.

421
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,890
I should give you the same advice.

422
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,360
Don't hurry. Take your time.

423
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,530
And remember someone walks behind you,
wishing you luck.

424
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,000
Is that person...

425
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,200
you?

426
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,670
Is there someone else?

427
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,420
I'm sorry for being a bother,

428
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,420
but I need a favor from you again.

429
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,490
You can tell me
whenever you need anything.

430
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,460
Isn't it a relief to finally know...

431
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,730
where the chairman is?

432
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,360
I can take the food to the hospital.

433
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,800
Make some invigorating dishes.

434
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,530
I'll put in all my skill, effort, and care
to make something...

435
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,500
for the chairman to wish him well.

436
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,310
I'm sorry for being a bother.

437
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,670
Since you won't let me pay you,

438
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,180
tell me what I can do instead.

439
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,010
I really don't need anything.

440
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,920
If you insist,

441
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,620
can I ask for one favor?

442
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,650
Yes, of course. Anything.

443
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,020
What is it?

444
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,560
This is my older sister.

445
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
I see.

(Searching for a missing person,
Baek Sul Hee, September 7, 1985)

447
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,070
Did you call the police?

448
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,510
Yes, but they didn't think
she was involved in any crimes,

449
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,810
so they concluded
that she'd run away from home.

450
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,980
If you ever see someone
who looks like her,

451
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,850
will you please give me a call?

452
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,720
You must be so upset.

453
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,620
Okay. If I see someone
who looks similar, I'll call.

454
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,430
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

455
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,630
Here.

456
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,170
What are you thinking about?

457
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,470
Nothing.

458
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,910
Why the long face?

459
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,880
Are you upset about something?

460
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,680
I don't believe
what I have to put up with.

461
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,150
That Lucia woman told me
to watch what I say.

462
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,650
She said I talked too much
for someone who slacked off at work.

463
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,190
Did she really say that?

464
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,150
Would I make it up?

465
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,320
I barely managed to hold back
from smacking her in the forehead.

466
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,360
No wonder you slapped her.

467
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,230
Why did you slap her anyway?

468
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,130
She deserved it.

469
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,070
She was nasty to you too?

470
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,570
Why does she think she's special?

471
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,910
Is it because
she saved the chairman's life?

472
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,710
I wish that were the reason.

473
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,180
What is the reason, then?

474
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,010
If she's proud
that she saved Father's life,

475
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,150
pay her a handsome amount.

476
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,680
That won't work this time.

477
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,250
She's after something bigger.

478
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,920
Like what?

479
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,830
You did as you were told
and came over right after work.

480
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,360
I said I'd do as you said.

481
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,430
You took your time to come around.

482
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,600
I'm stuck here all day long,
and I don't know what's going on outside.

483
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,270
That's why you should go home now.

484
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,840
I don't want to.

485
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,810
I'm sick of my kids,
and they all live with me.

486
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,980
I take a big risk coming here to see you.

487
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,620
Why? Who said what?

488
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,320
Who's complaining?

489
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,790
Tell me who.

490
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,950
It's not because someone complains.

491
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,220
If a rumor were to spread,
it could hurt the company.

492
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,960
What rumor?

493
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,200
That an old company chairman
is inviting a young woman to his room?

494
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,230
I wouldn't care about you
if I cared about that kind of talk.

495
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,070
Didn't you agree to do whatever I said?

496
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,970
I did.

497
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,040
Let me go wash my hands.

498
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880

My gosh.

503
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,900
You got slapped?

504
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,270
Well...

505
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,570
Someone from work
must've filmed and sent it.

506
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,080
Don't mind it.

507
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,340
Tell me!

508
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,650
Did Kyung Chae slap you?

509

I need a reason. Come up with something.

00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,460
I don't want you to get hurt.

516
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,520
It's reassuring to know
I have someone in my corner.

Don't you want to know who that is?
