00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,210
(Episode 16)

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,310
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,880
I forgot to give this to him.

4
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,830
Wait!

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,510
It is you.

6
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,350
Don't you remember me?

7
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,380
The scooter accident.

8
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,120
You looked after me.

9
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,260
How have you been? I'd been wondering.

10
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,170
At Mingang Distribution's
new business launch.

11
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,400
That was you, wasn't it?

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,970
I heard you say "Mi So."

13
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,980
Did something happen to her?

14
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,980
How could that be?

15
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,820
Does it involve Chairman Min's family?

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,400
Mr. Moon.

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,730
It's CEO Min.

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,770
Stay here.

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,370
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,940
I brought the resumes
and performance reviews...

21
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,140
of the people who might join your team.

22
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,510
To help when you're assigning tasks.

23
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,850
Oh, I see.

24
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,350
Why didn't you send someone else?

25
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,260
Why don't we have some tea? Come with me.

26
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,960
Hey, you.

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,390
Wait.

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,740
Turn around.

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,270
Let's see your face.

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,810
Turn around.

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,080
Why can't you show me your face?

32
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,350
I didn't know you were here.

33
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,750
The little rat managed to hide.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,950
Hey, you. Baek Sul Hee!

35
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,220
I'm glad we met here again!

36
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,130
What do you think you're doing?

37
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,230
You took my money and went underground.

38
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,630
Did you think I wouldn't find you?

39
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,800
- Let go of me!
- Why should I let go?

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,240
What are you doing?

41
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,240
Oh, my gosh.

42
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,740
Who are you?

43
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,650
Oh, no. You're not the woman I know.

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Have you lost your mind?

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,080
What was that about?

46
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,720
I don't know what that was.
What did I just do to you?

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,460
I mistook you for someone else.

48
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,030
I'm so sorry. My goodness.

49
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,260
Your eyes aren't there just for show.

50
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,970
You should've checked who I was first.

51
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,900
Who goes for the hair first?

52
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,540
You're right. That was so ignorant of me.

53
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,210
I hope you're not a guest here.

54
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,940
You're so vulgar and cheap
that I'd expect to see you...

55
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,510
in an alleyway market
and not at a five-star hotel.

56
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,450
I should tell the hotel
to screen their guests...

57
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,850
if they want to stay classy.

58
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,160
Oh, gosh.

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,360
What a temper.

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,540
That was so close.
What if she saw your face?

61
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,280
I got back from seeing someone
and came across you both.

62
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,450
Was it too suffocating to stay indoors?

63
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,050
Where were you going to go?

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,990
To see your sister?

65
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,860
I guess you would be worried about her.

66
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,360
Are you going to go home?

67
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,370
I want to hear her voice.

68
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,800
She's alone and I'm worried about her.

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,530
Hello?

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,830
Little sister. Just listen.

71
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,770
Are those people
still outside your apartment?

72
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,670
Yes.

73
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,380
Pretend you're talking to a friend.

74
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,810
Is this Yoon Joo?

75
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,480
It's been a long time, you brat.

76
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,850
I'm the person
who drove your sister home last time.

77
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,390
- Do you remember me?
- You bet.

78
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,390
Ma'am.

79
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm with your sister.

80
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,860
She's well, so don't worry.

81
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,960
Go somewhere quiet.

82
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,200
Okay.

83
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,600
Why haven't I heard from you in so long?

84
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,770
I almost died of suspense
waiting for a call.

85
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,380
Is Sul Hee really okay?

86
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,080
Put her on.

87
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,550
You can't talk to her right now.

88
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,390
Why not? Why can't I talk to her?

89
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,990
She can't speak.

90
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,890
She has shock-induced aphasia.

91
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,490
What?

92
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,000
That's how it is.

93
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,130
She was worried about you,
so I called you instead.

94
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,100
Put her on anyway.

95
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,810
She can listen while I talk.

96
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
She wants to talk to you.

97
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,680
Sul Hee.

98
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,180
Is that really you?

99
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,790
Are you listening?

100
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,520
I'm really okay.

101
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,090
Don't worry about me
and look after yourself.

102
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,930
We don't know what those people might do,

103
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
so don't ever get caught.

104
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,770
And...

105
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,600
the lady you're with seems nice.

106
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,170
Do as she says.

107
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,340
Okay. I'll do that.

108
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,410
Don't get hurt again.

109
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,680
I can't stand what they did to Mi So.

110
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,080
We don't want that to happen to you too.

(Mingang Distribution)

112
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,730
You haven't found her yet?

113
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,100
What's taking so long to find a woman?

114
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,570
I have a team watching her place.
We'll hand her to the police soon.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
Handing her over isn't the end of it.

116
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,600
She's a penniless single mom...

117
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,170
who lost her daughter...

118
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,670
and then her livelihood.

119
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,710
What if the media catches wind of it
and spins a sob story out of it?

120
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,250
Koreans are so emotional.

121
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,810
They can't stand to watch someone suffer.

122
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,650
Don't worry.
I'll handle it so that doesn't happen.

123
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,080
Spend when you must.

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,150
Bribe the journalists regularly...

125
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,320
and celebrate their anniversaries.

126
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,260
You must do that to run a business.

127
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,590
It's not the truth that matters.

128
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,660
It's about how you use the public.

129
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,460
I know that.

130

(Boarding Pass, New York)

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,040
Here are the tickets you asked for.

132
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,240
I must return to the US soon.

133
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,760
Will you come with me?

134
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,330
Think about it carefully.

135
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,720
I'm so darn bored.

136
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,750
Why must I be stuck at home?

137
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,950
Go upstairs.

138
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,790
I'm not allowed to leave my room now?

139
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,030
I'll bring you whatever you need.

140
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,200
There is one thing I need.

141
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,700
What is it? Name it and I'll get...

142
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,200
Freedom!

143
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,570
Ja Kyung. Are you going somewhere?

144
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,210
To see my parents.

145
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,310
I want to come too.

146
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,880
Why would you come?

147
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,150
Why can't I? I'm not a complete stranger.

148
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,380
You can go out
when your sister finds you an assistant.

149
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,080
I know that,
but when the heck will that be?

150
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,390
Kyung Chae is such a liar.

151
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,890
She was busy
with the launch of the new business.

152
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,490
That darn new business.

153
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,060
I wish it would just flop.

154
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,400
I know she's immature,

155
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,870
but how could she wish
for a new business to flop?

156
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,280
Who is she like that she's such a terror?

157
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,980
I can say for sure
that she's not like my father-in-law.

158
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,980
Tell me what happened at the launch, Dad.

159
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,150
I told you a mom burst in
and ruined it, didn't I?

160
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,190
Yes. Whose mom was it?

161
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,990
- What happened was...
- The girl...

162
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,690
who got into a fight with Se Ri last time.

163
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,060
My gosh. It was her mom?

164
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,360
Was she angry about the assault?

165
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,730
- She...
- She was furious.

166
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,230
She demanded her daughter be brought back.

167
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,400
My gosh.

168
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,100
Did something bad
happen to her daughter, then?

169
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,410
- She...
- She...

170
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,140
What are you doing, you beautiful woman?

171
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,340
You dare interrupt your revered husband?

172
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,580
I tried to tell the story
because you wouldn't.

173
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,720
Did you just see a crocodile
dislocate its jaw yawning?

174
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,720
You've grown up, haven't you?

175
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,590
I'm not exactly small for my age.

176
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,290
What's the occasion?

177
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,960
Why are you so formal? I don't like that.

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,830
This is what's appropriate.

179
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,970
What? We don't just have
a business partnership.

180
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,770
I married your cousin.

181
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,240
We're in-laws.

182
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,640
And we went to university together.

183
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,540
Right.

184
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,980
Then in private,

185
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,750
I can talk down to you...

186
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,390
since Ja Kyung is younger than me.

187
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,790
Is that what it's like?

188
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,360
Let's just be friends
from university, then.

189
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,130
Why did you want to see me?

190
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
The day of the launching ceremony.

191
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,870
Something crazy happened.

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,330
I want to know the story behind it.

193
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,970
It's better if you don't know.

194
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,640
You punk.

195
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,980
I'll decide if I'm better off not knowing
after you tell me the story.

196
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,550
My stomach hurts.

197
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,350
You act like you did all the drinking.
I bet Sun Jae is just fine.

198
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,090
Did you hide something on me?
Like a camera or something?

199
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,360
It's obvious.

200
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,560
So, what did he say?

201
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,900
I heard something really shocking.

202
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,800
No.

203
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,940
The person directly involved
should hear it too.

204
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,080
Hey, you. Get up!

205
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,020
You can't be so peacefully asleep.

206
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,890
What do you want?

207
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,290
That kid.

208
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,490
The kid you beat up
because you were in a foul mood.

209
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,490
What about that brat?

210
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,400
She's dead.

211
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,130
That's how angry she was.

212
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,000
So what?

213
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,810
You woke me up to tell me that?

214
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,740
My word. You're such a mess.

215
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,080
Who do you take after, really?

216
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,620
That's how you react to news like that?

217
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,320
(Mingang Distribution)

218
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,490
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

219
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,990
Min Kyung Chae speaking.

220
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,400
Hello, it's Stella Jang.

221
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,100
"Stella Jang?"

222
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,570
Oh, would you recognize me
if I told you...

223
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,770
I'm the woman who grabbed you
by the hair in the hotel lobby?

224
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,810
I know the name,

225
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,040
but the Stella Jang I know
is the queen of the US high society.

226
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,580
Yes. I'm that Stella Jang.

227
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,880
It's really you?

228
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,850
I'm so very sorry
for what I did that evening.

229
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,220
I wanted to apologize in person.

230
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,130
I knew I'd live to regret it if I didn't.

231
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,830
It's hard to believe...

232
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,330
I'm sitting across from someone so famous.

233
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,370
I hope you don't hold a grudge
about what I did.

234
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,670
I thought you were in the US.

235
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,510
I flew in for a short while
and must leave soon.

236
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,080
The truth is,

237
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,280
I attended the launch
of your new business.

238
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,120
Someone got me an invitation.

239
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,390
Then you must've seen what happened.

240
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,730
I'm so upset about that.

241
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,060
I worked so hard to prepare for the event.

242
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,330
Oh, dear. I made you feel even worse...

243
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,000
when you were already so upset about it.

244
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,610
Since we met, I hope we can have
an amicable relationship.

245
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,240
Who knows? I could be of help to you.

246
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,110
I have that much power and influence.

247
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm not a philanthropist,

248
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,200
and I don't need a new friend at my age.

249
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,270
I have a feeling...

250
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,740
we could join forces.

251
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,170
Whatever you decide to do,

252
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,910
I'll back you up.

253
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,120
Hello?

254
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,160
(Available to lease)

255
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,730
She closed the snack bar too?

256
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,740
- Who are you?
- My goodness.

257
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,470
Hey, aren't you the guy
who came by before?

258
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,040
After the scooter accident.

259
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,510
Yes, that's right.

260
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,180
I'm glad you remember me.

261
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,510
So...

262
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,580
Did Mi So's mom go somewhere?

263
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,850
I don't know where she is.
I just got a call saying she's well.

264
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,090
Oh, really?

265
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,790
I think I saw her at the hotel.

266
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,230
At a hotel?

267
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,030
You must've been mistaken.

268
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,200
She wouldn't stay at a hotel.

269
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,570
Could you give me her number...

270
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,100
so I could check?

271
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,510
She left her phone at home.

272
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,210
Then you can't reach her at all?

273
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,040
That's right. At least for now.

274
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,120
Oh, right. Caller ID.

275
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,820
I have the number they called me from.

276
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,820
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

277
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,400
Hello?

278
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,230
Hello?

279
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,040
Why did you answer the phone?

280
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,980
I should ask...

281
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,010
why you are calling me, Mr. Moon.

282
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,350
Someone gave me this number.

283
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,720
Are you with Mi So's mom right now?

284
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,660
Who?

285
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,090
Her sister gave me this number.

286
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,730
That you called about her.

287
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,530
I lent someone my phone...

288
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,670
because she asked
if she could use it to make a call.

289
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,370
Do you know where that woman is now?

290
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,470
How could I know
when she went her own way?

291
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,240
But...

292
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,610
aren't you a Mingang man now?

293
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,320
I don't think it would do you any good...

294
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,150
if the company found out
what you were up to.

295
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,450
"A Mingang man?"

296
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,590
Before that, I'm an ordinary person.

297
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,690
An ordinary person who is angered...

298
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,660
by injustice and wants to help
the unfortunate.

299
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,900
Anyway, I'm sorry for bothering you.

300
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,380
Why did you lie to him?

301
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,380
In case it would affect our plan.

302
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,180
I need to do whatever it takes...

303
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,490
to take that woman to the US.

304
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,560
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

305
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,160
Since we met, I hope...

306
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,200
we can have an amicable relationship.

307
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,700
Who knows? I could be of help to you.

308
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,710
Here's the list of businesses
we tried to sign up with.

309
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,080
As you can see,
their demands are pretty tough.

310
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,220
The running shoe brand
we failed to sign on.

311
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,390
Who did they sign with?

312
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,020
I think they went to JJ Mart.

313
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,160
A US high society influencer
called Stella Jang...

314
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,830
was an acquaintance of JJ Mart's CEO.

315
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,400
She helped them reach a deal.

316
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,330
An exclusive distribution deal.

317
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,830
That woman has some crazy connections.

318
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,970
JJ Mart scored a windfall
with that brand and made a fortune.

319
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,640
It would be a great advantage
if I knew her.

320
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,340
It would.

321
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,050
Why do you suddenly care about her?

322
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,760
Did I tell you how my son died?

323
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,670
He wasn't supposed to die.

324
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,940
He died with his eyes wide open.

325
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,310
I pulled down his eyelids in the morgue.

326
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,540
You're Mi So's mom, right?

327
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,580
I'm Ho Se's mom.

328
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,380
We moms have something in common.

329
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,290
If you lost money or your honor,

330
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,560
you can put that behind you.

331
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,790
You can't do that with a lost child.

332
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,730
Right after my son died,

333
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,070
it was the worst feeling ever.

334
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,240
It was as if life was a punishment.

335
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,270
Dozens of times a day,

336
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,140
I wanted to follow my son
to the afterlife.

337
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,620
Not anymore.

338
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,520
There's something I must do while I live.

339
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,690
Something you must do?

340
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,690
Don't you want to know?

341
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,360
I'll tell you when we land in the US.

342
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,300
I'll also tell you...

343
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,170
how I dragged myself out
of the torment 16 years ago.

344
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,810
Ms. Se Ri.

345
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,050
What are you doing? Go back upstairs.

346
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,860
Let me go out just this once. Please.

347
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,060
Se Ri. You're not trying to
sneak out, are you?

348
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,190
I want to ask Kyung Chae...

349
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,400
when she'll get me an assistant!

350
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,230
Stay at home. You'll only get told off.

351
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,770
Darn it.

352
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,310
Just let me go! Do you want to see me
have a fit and die?

353
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,780
Why would you say something like that?

354
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,710
Go back upstairs.

355
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,390
Ms. Se Ri!

356
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,960
I can't believe what she just did.

357
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,290
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

358
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,800
It's Min Kyung Chae.

359
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,170
To what do I owe the call, CEO Min?

360
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,710
I'll cut to the chase. I need a favor.

361
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,650
Go ahead.

362
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,580
I owe you already.

363
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,450
I know it's a tough one,
but I think you could help me.

364
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,220
I actually like it that you asked me.

365
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,560
What do you need?

366
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,190
Find someone for me.

367
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,560
It will take you less time than it does
for me to check the hotel guest list.

368
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,430
If I'm right,
the person I'm looking for...

369
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,970
is staying at your hotel.

370
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,600
Who's that?

371
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,310
Baek Sul Hee. The woman
who caused a scene at my launch.

372
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,880
Oh, that woman.

373
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,380
You know what she looks like.

374
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,580
I think she's hiding from me
in that hotel.

375
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,780
Okay, I'll look for her.

376
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,390
Let's talk again soon.

377
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,230
Min Kyung Chae asked me
to find you for her.

378
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,730
So soon after we became acquaintances.

379
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,300
What's that look about?

380
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,700
Did you make up your mind?

381
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,410
(Boarding Pass, New York)

382
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,320
I can't go.

383
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,220
I can't leave my Mi So behind.

384
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,690
That's fine.
Don't go if you don't feel like it.

385
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,660
I can't make you do what you don't want.

386
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,290
I'll see them and bring an end to it.

387
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,200
For Mi So's sake, I can't just let it go.

388
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,400
I don't know why you made that call,

389
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,140
but look after yourself, whatever you do.

390
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,610
Will you go home?

391
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,460
Mi So.

392
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,730
I'm done running away from those people.

393
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,900
I won't hide again.

394
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,300
That's what I always taught you.

395
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,100
I was a coward.

396
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,240
(Mingang Distribution)

397
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,110
Hello?

398
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,880
Amy. What's up? When did you fly in?

399
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,820
Hey, do you remember the kid...

400
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,520
whom I beat up for challenging me?

401
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,150
She just died.

402
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,260
How would I know why she died?

403
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,360
Maybe she felt like it.

404
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,200
Yes. That's what happens to people
who forget their place and act out.

405
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,570
I threw a pebble into a pond
because I was bored,

406
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,830
and it hit a frog and the frog died.

407
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,140
It's on the frog
for having the worst luck.

408
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,870
Who told it to be born a frog?

409
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,410
Don't you feel bad for me?

410
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,280
I was grounded because of her
and couldn't leave home for days.

411
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,220
Thinking about that girl gives me...

412
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,050
a boost of dopamine, though.

413
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,190
It was hilarious watching her
get beaten up.

414
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,090
Tears and snot dripped everywhere...

415
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,960
and she even begged on her knees.

416
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,200
It was awesome.

417
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,970
Have you lost your mind?

418
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,520
You're not even human.
How could you say that?

419
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,750
It's not fair that she died,

420
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,760
but to hear you say that about her?

421
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,390
Who the heck are you?

422
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,290
How dare you slap me?
Do you know who I am?

423
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,960
You must be punished for this.

424
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,800
I swear to take you down for what you did.

425
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,270
Let go of me, you psycho!

426
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,270
Come with me. Beg and apologize to Mi So.

427
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,610
Kneel before her and ask for forgiveness.

428
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,410
Let go of me!

429
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,920
Why did you go back there?

430
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,190
Are you naive or stupid?

431
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,390
After what they did to my daughter,

432
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,130
they're not remorseful at all.

433
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,800
Even now, they don't know
what they did wrong.

434
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,400
Those people will never change.

435
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,300
Don't expect that.

436
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,140
Did you think the law would help you?

437
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,170
So you went there to take them on?

438
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,010
You can't threaten them with the law
when they're above it.

439
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,550
You've been through enough to know that.

440
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,060
What should we do about this now?

441
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,830
Things just got way out of hand.

442
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,400
She'll retaliate
now that you hurt her sister.

443
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,530
The law is the least of your worries.

444
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,640
What matters is that
you just infuriated Min Kyung Chae.

445
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,820
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

446
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,630
I'll sort it out with something
more effective than the law.

447
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,200
Very well. Give it a go.

448
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,270
Come home right now
unless you want your sister to get hurt.

449
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,600
Don't think of calling the police.

450
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,200
Moon Tae Kyung.

451
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,010
He seems like a decent guy.
Make him yours as soon as possible.

452
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,910
It's almost time.

453
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,310
Let's wait just a little longer.

454
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,050
Don't do anything ever again.

455
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,850
You can never beat them in this life.

456
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,150
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

457
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,720
Are you out of your mind?
