(Episode 114)

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,910
What do you think you're doing?
Are you crazy?

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,650
Don't you know Se Ri has allergies?
Are you trying to kill her?

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,120
I know Se Ri better than you do.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,020
Cut it out!

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,320
Do you want her to end up in the ER?

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,690
Are you trying to kill her or something?

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,800
I don't have any allergies.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,860
So naturally,
she shouldn't have any either.

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,670
We share the same flesh and blood.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,900
Snap out of it!

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,380
Go on upstairs.
Take your allergy medicine, just in case.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,220
You sound like her mom.

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,920
I am her mom.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,390
No one can justify
what you're doing right now.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,000
You're a grown woman. How can you
lose control and take it out on a child?

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,370
And you call yourself her sister?

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,900
You wouldn't even treat
a stranger this way.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,870
Instead of taking it out on a child,
get your own emotions in check.

20
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,240
Before you do something you'll regret.

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,560
Se Ri, are you okay?

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,930
You're not breaking out in a rash,
are you?

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,560
Thank goodness.

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,070
I was so worried.
I was afraid you'd have to go to the ER.

25
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,600
What's wrong with Kyung Chae?
She's acting like she's lost her mind.

26
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,810
She knows I have a bad reaction
to certain foods I can't eat.

27
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,110
It's not like this is a new thing.
So why is she acting like this suddenly?

28
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,380
At times like this,
Kyung Chae feels like a total stranger.

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,120
I don't have to be just like her, do I?

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,790
I'm her half-sister,
so I probably take after my own mom.

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,060
It's from either my dad's side
or my mom's.

32
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,970
But why does she have to rub it
in my face like this?

33
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,500
Is it because I'm the child
Dad had from an affair?

34
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,210
Is it a crime to take after my own mother?

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,910
I'm the only one who can't eat things
my brother and sisters enjoy,

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,290
and the longer I live with them,
the more I see how different I am.

37
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,050
Does she think that's been easy for me?

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,590
Even Soo Jung, who’s also
an illegitimate child just like me,

39
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,830
has some family resemblance.

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,330
But I have none.
You have no idea how lonely I've been.

41
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,070
But I put up with it
because Kyung Chae was so kind to me.

42
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,310
But if she suddenly turns on me like that,
what am I supposed to do?

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,710
I want to be a part of this family
more than anything.

44
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,270
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

45
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,340
Kyung Chae!

46
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,330
Here’s the contract
that has been reviewed recently.

47
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,160
Legal has already given its approval.

48
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,100
What do I do now?

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,770
What in the world am I supposed to do?

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,240
Just bury it.

51
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,610
You've lived with it buried
for the last 20 years.

52
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,640
If it's to your advantage,
then that's what you have to do.

53
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,180
Isn't that the way you handle things,
Min Kyung Chae?

54
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,780
More than truth or facts,

55
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,380
you calculate which situation
is to your advantage...

56
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,650
and make your move
based on what you'll gain.

57
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,420
If you were going to tell me to bury it,
you shouldn't have brought it up at all.

58
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,230
What exactly do you know?

59
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,900
So what happens
when Pandora's box is opened?

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,600
Is there a more terrifying truth
hidden inside?

61
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,640
I thought I told you to ask
when you're sure you can handle it.

62
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,970
Then why did you tell me?

63
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,310
To watch me get destroyed?

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,540
You'd fall apart over this?

65
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,910
For 20 years, I've seen her
as my daughter.

66
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,350
You think I wouldn't fall apart?

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,280
Could you honestly say you wouldn't?

68
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Then again...

69
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,290
What would you know...

70
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,620
about a mother's love or compassion?

71
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,660
You're barely even human.
What could you possibly understand?

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,460
Did you treat me like your hound...

73
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,930
because I'm not human enough?

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,100
It was fine when you used me for games,
but I can't do the same to you?

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,440
You get to betray me,
but I can't do the same to you?

76
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,010
So you wanted me to get a taste
of my own medicine?

77
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,180
Is that why you told me the cruel truth?

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,410
Cruel?

79
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,280
You haven't even had a real taste yet.

80
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,080
You have no idea what's truly cruel.

(Mingang Distribution)

82
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,000
Why are you just moping here?
Aren't you going to your part-time job?

83
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,710
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

84
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,480
Now that I look closer, you look awful.

85
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,810
My goodness, what happened overnight?

86
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,210
Did something happen last night?

87
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,620
Kyung Chae...

88
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,090
got angry at me for not being like her.

89
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,520
She was acting so weird yesterday.

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,390
Anyone who saw her would've thought
she was crazy.

91
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,960
Ms. Kyung Chae said that?

92
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,870
It's not like it's a new thing
that I don't resemble my family.

93
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,500
It's been stressing me out
since I was a kid.

94
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,110
Anyone can tell Soo Jung is a Min,
but not me.

95
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,380
Honestly, that's why I've always acted out
and gotten into trouble.

96
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,480
Is that really why?

97
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,380
Of course. I'm not blind.

98
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,650
I know I don't look like my dad,
or like my brother or Kyung Chae.

99
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,650
How could I be okay with that?

100
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,520
That's why I could never
get my act together.

101
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,030
Hey, we need to get going.

102
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,370
Don't say anything else.
We're just there to see what Dad wants.

103
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,640
I know that.

104
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,110
There's no way the shareholders' meeting
is happening now,

105
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,710
so we just need to make it look like
we're on Dad's side.

106
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,110
I get it, okay?

107
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,920
Oh, Father!

108
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,390
You're really awake. Why did you...

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,020
No, that's not what I meant.

110
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,390
You should've woken up much sooner.
We were so worried about you.

111
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,530
I was so furious about
Kyung Chae moving you behind our backs.

112
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,970
How did you get in here?
I told them not to let just anyone in.

113
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,200
We pleaded.

114
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,870
We said we weren't just anyone
and had something to hear from you.

115
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,510
What is it you want to hear from me?

116
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,340
You want to hear me say
we should get rid of Lucia...

117
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,080
and make Kyung Chae chairman?

118
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,810
So you two are on Kyung Chae's side?
You want her out too?

119
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,220
Of course not. We wouldn't be here then.

120
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,320
We came for the exact opposite reason.

121
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,420
You're awake and perfectly fine now.

122
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,390
You wouldn't kick Lucia out, would you?

123
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,320
And make Kyung Chae chairman?
Are you kidding?

124
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,430
Not after what she did to you.
How could she dare?

125
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,000
If that's how you feel,
tell Kyung Chae to call off...

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,900
the shareholders' meeting
and all that other nonsense.

127
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,070
Tell her not to make me any angrier.

128
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,400
Hey.

129
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,580
Looks like Father is furious
with Kyung Chae.

130
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,810
See?
She still thinks she can pull this off.

131
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,380
That was all just talk
from before Dad woke up.

132
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,780
So what's Kyung Chae going to do?
All that for nothing.

133
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,780
Exactly. If it succeeds,
it's a revolution.

134
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,750
If it fails, it's a coup.

135
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,690
Kyung Chae failed.
And Lucia just got incredibly lucky.

136
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,690
If the shareholders' meeting
had been held,

137
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,630
she would've been fired for sure.

140
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,280
Hey, I have a message from Father.

141
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,410
- What is it?
- He said to cancel that nonsense meeting.

142
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,820
If you keep up this ridiculous nonsense
about dismissing Lucia,

143
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,250
you're going to be in serious trouble.

144
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Those were his words.

145
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,520
Seriously, you should've toned it down.

146
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,530
Your temper is why nothing works out.

147
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,030
And here I was getting my hopes up
for nothing.

148
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,930
I really thought you'd kick her out
and take over as chairman.

149
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,870
I really got ahead of myself.
Me, a director? As if.

150
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,610
By the way,

151
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,040
didn't you say Dad and that woman
were getting a divorce?

152
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,050
Why ask? That fell through, too.

153
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,350
Of course.

154
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,450
Is anything ever going to go right?

155
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,390
Hey, what's with her?

156
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,960
- She's completely zoned out.
- I know, right?

157
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,830
Any other time,
she'd be throwing a massive fit right now.

158
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,200
It's like something else is
on her mind, right?

159
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,770
Like something more important came up?

160
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,140
What could be more important
than this right now?

161
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,780
I told you to stay at your desk.
Everyone else is out in the field.

162
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,180
Who's supposed to watch the office?

163
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,220
I had a good reason to leave.

164
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,050
And what could possibly be so important
that you had to leave?

165
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,260
My father woke up.
As his son, should I have just ignored it?

166
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,620
You went to see the chairman?

167
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,330

called off.

168

It looked like he'll be discharged
and back at work very soon.

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,770
what's going to happen to Lucia?

171
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,340
What do you think will happen?
If my father returns as the chairman,

172
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,970
Lucia will go back to being CEO,
and Kyung Chae will be forced out.

173
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,940
Soo Jung keeps her director position,
and as for me,

174
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,310
I'm just...

175
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,810
Darn it.

176
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,250
(Mingang Distribution)

177
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Where are you?

178
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,070
Why do you care where I am?

179
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,470
Get to my office right now.

180
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,380
We need to talk.

181
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,180
That's too bad.
I'm afraid I'm too busy right now.

182
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,850
I'll call you later when I'm free.

183
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,660
I need to ask you something.

184
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,800
And I need you to be honest with me.

185
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,070
I'm just so popular today, aren't I?

186
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,340
Everyone's calling for me left and right.

187
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,740
Whatever it is, go ask Moon Tae Kyung,
your last man.

188
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,950
What would a ghost from your past
like me know?

189
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,620
Did you by any chance...

190
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,150
tell Min Kyung Chae that Se Ri wasn't...

191
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,690
her biological daughter?

192
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
And what if I did?

193
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,700
Are you crazy?

194
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
How could you tell her that?

195
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,270
Do you have any idea
what Kyung Chae did to Se Ri yesterday?

196
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,010
At this rate, I'm worried
she's going to destroy Se Ri.

197
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,710
She raised her as her own for 20 years,
only to find out she's not.

198
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,580
Do you really think
she's in her right mind right now?

199
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,080
That's why I told you
that you, me, and Se Ri...

200
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,850
should start over for real.

201
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,250
I said we could take over Mingang,
and that we should give it our all.

202
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,490
When I said we could be
a real owner family,

203
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,160
with my bloodline, not the Mins,

204
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,160
you're the one who threw it all away.

205
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,830
You ruined everything, and now what?

206
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,360
You're saying this is all my fault?

207
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,860
Hey, Baek Sul Hee.

208
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,970
If you'd committed, we could've been set
for the rest of our lives.

209
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,740
You're the one who chose the hard path.
Got it?

210
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,210
You didn't have to tell her everything!

211
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,610
Are you even human?

212
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,980
You don't deserve to be Se Ri's father.

213
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,010
I don't need any of that anymore.

214
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,180
That only mattered when Se Ri was the heir
to Mingang Distribution.

215
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,620
You said...

216
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,290
you'd never let Se Ri be the chairman
of Mingang Distribution, right?

217
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,230
Then I have no use for her either.

218
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,860
I only needed her as long as she was
going to be the owner of Mingang.

219
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,700
Tae Kyung was right.

220
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,800
You don't deserve a family.

221
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,000
You'll live your whole life alone,
and you'll die alone.

222
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,240
If you keep pushing my buttons,

223
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,840
I might just spill
who Se Ri was switched with...

224
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,050
and who her mother is.

225
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,750
I'm holding back for now,

226
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,350
but if you keep pushing me,
I can't say what I'll do.

227
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Seriously!

228
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,070
I don't know what to do.
Min Kyung Chae already knows.

229
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,800
Kim Sun Jae is really a lost cause.

230
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,370
I hoped it wasn't true.

231
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,380
Frankly, knowing him, it's a miracle
he hasn't told her everything already.

232
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,950
That won't last long.
Once he thinks it's really over for him,

233
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,650
he's the type who'll confess who I am
and take everyone down with him.

234
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,720
Then we need to make our move
before Kim Sun Jae blows everything up.

235
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,260
Canceling the shareholders' meeting
is just a temporary fix, after all.

236
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,430
By the way,

237
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,330
were you followed
by anyone suspicious today?

238
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,530
I'd be lucky if I weren't.

239
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,970
They're the men
Chairman Min Doo Sik hired.

240
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,500
They're not going to give up that easily.

241
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,940
I managed to lose them and just got home.

242
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,040
I was worried about the slush fund ledger
in my room.

243
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,590
You should eat something with that.

244
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,160
You skipped dinner
and have just been drinking.

245
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,370
What's gotten into you?

246
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,140
What gave you the right
to interfere in my life?

247
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
You must have enjoyed it.

248
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Watching me fawn over a child
that wasn't even mine.

249
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,820
I already told you.

250
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,290
If I were in the same situation,
I'd do it all over again.

251
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,300
Do you want me to say it again?

252
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,830
If the same situation happened
10 or 100 times,

253
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,270
I'd still switch the babies!

254
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,570
If it meant...

255
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,110
saving you, Ms. Kyung Chae,

256
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,880
I'll never regret what I did.

257
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,480
I can always accept my punishment later.

258
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,160
What happened...

259
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,130
to the baby from back then?

260
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,230
She stopped breathing.

261
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,070
I confirmed it myself.

262
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,400
Kyung Chae is crying?
I wonder what happened.

263
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,000
What? Kyung Chae is crying? Why?

264
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,530
I don't know.
She was sobbing in Manager Gong's arms.

265
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,470
I wonder if that's why.

266
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,610
Father said he'd make Kyung Chae pay
if she had to fire our stepmother.

267
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,310
Look how she tanked
the shareholders' meeting.

268
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,180
I bet there'll be an official document
on it tomorrow.

269
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,780
But why isn't your father coming home?

270
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,580
Does he prefer being at the hospital?

271
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,520
No, it's just less drama for him there.

272
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,120
Anyway, Kyung Chae really got
on Father's bad side this time.

273
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,860
She’s been acting in ways
that upset Father for a while now.

274
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,130
And it was bound to blow up
in her face eventually.

275
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,230
Kyung Chae's pulled
too many stunts on Father.

276
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,270
Still, for Kyung Chae
to cry over something like that?

277
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,570
And in Manager Gong's arms?
It doesn't make any sense.

278
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,170
Unless it could be about that other thing.

279
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,580
Come on, you know,
I told you about last time.

280
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,980
What, that again?
That Se Ri is Kyung Chae's daughter?

281
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,250
And that they were switched at birth?

282
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,020
Darling, you've been watching
too many soap operas.

283
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,650
Unbelievable.

284
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:00,090
Wait. If the shareholders' meeting is off,
and your stepmother doesn't get fired,

285
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,530
what does that mean for you?

286
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,400
- What about your promotion to director?
- What do you think?

287
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
It's dead in the water.

288
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,270
Darn it.

289
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,810
Tae Joo, long time no see.

290
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,010
- How have you been?
- I'm good. You?

291
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,450
You know how it is.

292
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,480
What brings you here at this hour?

293
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,060
I thought you should be aware
of something, Madam Jang.

294
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,460
The shareholders' meeting
I mentioned before...

295
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,030
has been called off.

296
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,500
Good for you.
That's good news for you, isn't it?

297
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,440
Now you can keep lining your pockets
without a care in the world.

298
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,070
You've got Min Doo Sik
wrapped around your little finger.

299
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,180
- Madam Jang.
- The heavens must be on your side.

300
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,410
Or maybe not?
Or maybe it's Mi So helping you?

301
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,750
No, that's not it.

302
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,820
You and Mi So don't share a drop of blood.
That doesn't make any sense, does it?

303
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,350
Min Kyung Chae...

304
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,390
also found out that Se Ri
isn't her biological daughter.

305
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,300
So now she'll understand
why you turned your back on her.

306
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,760
And? So what?

307
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,870
You came all this way
just to tell me that?

308
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,170
I'm sorry, but I don't want
to get mixed up with you anymore.

309
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,540
Fine. Call it a cruel twist of fate
or what have you,

310
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,880
but your daughter and my granddaughter
were switched.

311
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,850
Publicly, it may have been your daughter
who died,

312
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,580
but it was actually my granddaughter
who passed.

313
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,120
She threw her fragile self off a rooftop.

314
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,660
And when you really think about it,

315
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,390
wasn't it all because of your fault?

316
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,730
- Madam Jang.
- That's why I say this.

317
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,900
It's not like she did it on purpose,
and it's not like you put her up to it,

318
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,530
so I'm saying I'll let it go!

319
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,270
So don't come here
and make this harder on me.

320
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,970
I'm barely holding on as it is.

321
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,610
I came because I want us to...

322
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,150
go back to how things were.

323
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,720
I know it's difficult for you,

324
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,050
but I'm asking you to forgive me...

325
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,120
and take me back.

326
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,060
You've made a mistake coming here.

327
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,400
No, you really shouldn't have come at all.

328
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,100
From now on,
I don't care what happens to you...

329
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,370
with the Min family.

330
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,040
Even if you drop dead
right in front of me,

331
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,710
I'll look the other way.

332
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,830
So, Madam Jang is refusing
to take you back?

333
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,200
It must be too painful for her
when she thinks of Mi So.

334
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,370
And it won't be easy for her
to stop blaming Se Ri.

335
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,210
Still, she's going to end it like this?
After all you two have been through?

336
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,210
I know blood ties are important,

337
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
but come on.

338
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,050
I never took Madam Jang
for that kind of person.

339
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,110
Especially after I pleaded with her.

340
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,050
She doted on Se Ri,
thinking she carried her son's blood.

341
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,790
Now that things are different,
it must be hard for her to accept.

342
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,290
Times like these really confuse me.

343
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,990
Take Mi So and Yeon Ah, for example.

344
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,000
They aren't your blood relatives,

345
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,600
but those two...

346
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,440
mean more to you than anyone.

347
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
That's right.

348
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,940
I believe the bonds you choose
can be thicker than blood.

349
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,880
But that's just how I feel.

350
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,210
I can't force others to feel the same way.

351
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,920
Exactly.
And that's what makes this so upsetting.

352
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,490
Because I can actually understand
where she's coming from.

353
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,630
Why are you looking at me like that?

354
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,660
Please, take Lucia back.

355
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,700
You can't be at peace
with this either, Mother.

356
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,940
Tae Joo, you'll understand
when you have a child of your own one day.

357
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,340
Just how powerful blood ties can be.

358
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,740
By that logic,

359
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,480
I don't share a drop of your blood,

360
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,280
so it must seem ridiculous
for me to call you "Mother."

361
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,320
Why must you be so cynical?

362
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,650
I thought you were different, Mother.

363
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,460
When I was barely surviving
on the streets of New York,

364
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,590
you were the only one
who reached out to me...

365
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,600
to treat me like a human being.

366
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,970
More than anyone else,

367
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,300
you're the one who taught me
that some bonds are thicker than blood.

368
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,920
What are you thinking so hard about?

369
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,660
When you get that serious look,
it can only be one of two things.

370
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,760
Money or women.

371
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,900
Both. Darn it.
I'm thinking about our in-law.

372
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,830
I hear he's completely lucid again.

373
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,040
We have to think about
what's going to happen next.

374
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,010
Will he go back to being chairman,
or let his young wife keep the job?

375
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,110
You know how greedy that man is.

376
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,480
He's not the type to just give up
the chairman's seat.

377
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,680
I don't know. A near-death experience
can change a person.

378
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,550
He went to death's door and back.
You think he's going to be the same?

379
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,360
Oh, please. A leopard
doesn't change its spots.

380
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,260
Anyway, forget that.

381
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,690
You're still holding on
to your shares, right?

382
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,160
My dear wife, for the thousandth time,
yes, I still have them.

383
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,900
Since we were told that
those shares were needed,

384
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,270
I bet that household is
headed for trouble.

385
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,770
What are you, a psychic?

386
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,010
Go set up a booth. Stop meddling
in things you don't understand.

387
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,780
How is it meddling
when Ja Kyung and Ji Seop are involved?

388
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,850
- Answer your phone.
- Gosh.

389
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,760
Ja Kyung! What's going on?

390
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,930
So what does this mean for Ji Seop?

391
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,660
Good grief, it's such a struggle
to get that director position.

392
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,570
All right, I'll tell your dad.

393
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,470
- Goodness.
- What did Ja Kyung say?

394
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,040
She said the shareholders' meeting
or whatever got canceled,

395
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,340
so Ji Seop's promotion is out the window.

396
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,180
It was? The shareholders' meeting
was called off?

397
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,050
Well, now.
Why do you look so happy to hear that?

398
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,390
You're up to something.

399
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,620
I live so I can look to the heavens
without a single shred of shame.

400
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,800
I'm pained by even a breeze in the leaves.
I love all things destined to fade.

401
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,900
- Yang Mal Sook, Ja Kyung, and Stella.

(Mingang Distribution)

403
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,480
So the shareholders' meeting
is completely off, right?

404
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,880
Get out.

405
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,280
I can't even think about that right now.

406
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,220
This isn't like you. What's with you?

407
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,020
You'll be in danger if this happens.

408
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,520
I know it's weird for me
to be worried about you,

409
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,460
but if Dad comes back, even tomorrow,

410
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,330
this position will go back
to its original owner, that woman.

411
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,560
And you'll be forced out of the company.

412
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,300
I know. You don't have to spell it out.

413
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,970
You know that,
and you're still acting this way?

414
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,800
What's with you? You're spaced out!

415
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,670
I said get out!

416
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,610
You called for me?

417
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,850
Seriously, what's Kyung Chae's deal?

418
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,050
She doesn't seem to care about
the shareholders' meeting at all.

419
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,590
You think so?

420
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,460
Either something bigger happened,
or she's just lost in her own thoughts.

421
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,160
She isn't acting like this
because we're dating, is she?

She's in her room.

428
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,230
She even skipped her part-time job
and hasn't come out of her room.

What are you doing here at this time?

I'm so sorry.

431

I never should have treated you
that way the other night.

432
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,020
It was all my fault.

433
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,190
Is that why you're here?
To apologize to me?

434
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Yes.

435
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,230

It's okay.

I was a little shocked at first,

438
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,440
but I just figured you were
under an insane amount of stress...

439
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,540
at work lately.

440
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,510
You thought that?

441
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,010
You have a big heart.

442
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,750
- Understanding me and everything.
- If I don't, who will?

443

Honestly, there are times
you got on my nerves,

444
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,890
but there were way more good times.

445
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,560
When no one else treated me like a person,
you were the only one who cared for me.

446
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,830
You were always someone I could count on,

447
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,100
and you were like a mother to me.

448
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,740

00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,810
A mom.

450
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:50,010
When I was little, I used to wish
that you were my real mom.

451
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,680

452
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,950

to stake out in front of the company...

and ambush him?

and he's a tough fighter.
