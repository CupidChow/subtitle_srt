00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,610
(Episode 18)

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,080
Excuse me?

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,320
Hello?

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,690
Ms. Jung Lucia?

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,100
You dropped your passport.

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,800
Thank you.

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:32,970
Sure.

8
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,530
(The late Baek Mi So)

9
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,250
(Happy Side Dishes)

10
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,520
Your food is so good,
we got way more delivery orders.

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,890
That's because you're a good cook.

12
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,560
That's not true. The orders increased
after you joined the team.

13
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,900
I just can't seem to get anyone
to accept our delivery calls.

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,270
I can deliver too if it's close by.

15
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,940
Will you do that?

16
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,970
Sure.

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,050
(Searching for a missing person)

18
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,860
I miss you, Sul Hee.

19
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,300
People tell me to stop looking,

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,130
but I'll never give up.

21
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,500
I know you'll be well wherever you are...

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,610
and come back one day.

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,110
(Searching for a missing person)

24
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,810
(Baek Sul Hee,
Date of Birth, September 7, 1985)

25
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,180
(169cm, slim build, gray shirt,
brown cardigan, long jeans)

26
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,090
(Disappeared at 11:10 p.m.
on September 27, 2021)

27
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,060
I just checked into the hotel.

28
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,730
I'm not tired at all.

29
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,360
I'm used to traversing the US,
so it wasn't a long flight at all.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,370
When will you join me?

31
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,570
As soon as my business here is done.

32
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,170
Where are you?

33
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,870
In Macau.

34
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,770
I could take the evening flight today,

35
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,340
but it depends on whether
I'll be done by then.

36
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,010
See you soon. I miss you.

37
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,150
Don't act like an anxious puppy
when we weren't apart for too long.

38
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,450
I am a bit like a cute puppy, aren't I?

39
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,360
You're cracking jokes,
so I guess you're in a good mood.

40
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,060
Look after yourself
as you get over the jet lag.

41
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,460
I'm waiting for you.

42
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,810
You call this a sales report?

43
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,810
What have you done in the past four years
as head of the new business?

44
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,450
And you're still
the general managing director.

45
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,380
All businesses incur a loss at first.

46
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,120
We can turn a profit
as long as we overcome this hump.

47
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,450
Yes. It happens
when you're launching a new business.

48
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,020
Are you two lecturing me?

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,020
You think I don't know about business?

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,390
It's not that, Father.

51
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,590
I'm not your father right now!

52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,030
We're at work, not at home.

53
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,430
Calm down, sir.

54
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,570
If you don't think you can do it,
quit now.

55
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,800
Nothing's as stupid
as clinging to a failing project.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,610
We can make up for this
if you'll release some funds.

57
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,710
Wasn't what I already spent
more than enough?

58
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,750
You're taking up
most of Mingang's expenses,

59
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,450
and you still want more?

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,520
Don't you have a conscience?

61
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,650
Find an investor or get some easy cash.

62
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,990
I won't give you any more.

63
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,920
You might threaten the whole of Mingang.

64
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,760
It's like trying to fill a bottle
with no bottom.

65
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,460
CEO Min. If this is the best you can do,
step down as CEO.

66
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,330
Soo Jung managed to revive the store chain
that your brother almost sank.

67
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
(Mingang Distribution)

68
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,010
Don't let what he said get to you.

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,380
He was angry, and we had it coming.

70
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,580
I'm not taking it personally,

71
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,280
but I do think he's overly pessimistic.

72
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,020
That's my worry.

73
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,490
It's a fact that our results
are less than satisfactory.

74
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,330
The economy took a downturn,
and the market wasn't ideal...

75
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,030
when we launched the new business,

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
but our numbers are disastrous,
even considering the circumstances.

77
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,600
I got you into trouble
you shouldn't be in.

78
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,100
Instead of trying to console me,
let's get funding.

79
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,010
We're really done for
without more cash flow.

80
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,940
The new business must succeed,
whatever the cost.

81
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,010
That's how I can prove
I made the right choice...

82
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,680
to bring you in.

83
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,920
Goodness.

84
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,060
You should've done a better job.

85
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,930
The chairman
hasn't been that angry in a while.

86
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,430
Do you find this situation amusing?

87
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,270
Think about what you've done here
since you joined four years ago.

88
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,440
The industry talked about your hiring,
and the chairman welcomed you.

89
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,310
Shouldn't you have
accomplished something amazing by now?

90
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,050
To be honest,

91
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,020
people are saying
you're all bubbles and no substance.

92
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,250
Are you trying to say...

93
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,560
I got this position purely by luck
with no hard work on my part?

94
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
You might have been
at the top of your game...

95
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,890
back in the US, I'll give you that.

96
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,160
But you're not doing anything here
at Mingang, which is weird.

97
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,030
Did you...

98
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,000
join Mingang with another motive?

99
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,440
"Another motive?"

100
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,110
Another motive...

101
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,940
Just like you,
who can't be satisfied with being...

102
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,280
in charge of Legal...

103
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,010
and are looking for any chance
to join the Min family?

104
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,220
Don't worry too much.

105
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,920
I'm still as competent,

106
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,560
and I'll prove it to you soon.

107
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,030
Why would I worry about you?

108
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,600
The one I'm worried about...

109
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,560
is the CEO who also gets chewed out
because you're not doing your job.

110
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,440
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

111
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,240
How about using
Home and Mart's reserve fund?

112
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,510
Do you have to go that far?

113
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,050
What if I don't?

114
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,650
Should I let our new business flounder
because we have no working capital?

115
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,290
Why not take the opportunity
to rethink the business?

116
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,860
You know the chairman meant what he said.

117
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,890
I just need to turn this corner.

118
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,860
I can't give up now.

119
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,760
This isn't about your pride or ego.

120
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,900
My pride is Mingang's pride!

121
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,200
If the venture flops just four years
after the much-talked-about launch,

122
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,940
would that hit just me?

123
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,210
First, you must identify
the cause of the slump.

124
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,040
You must look back
and think where it went wrong.

125
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,610
How much...

126
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,710
do you trust Director Moon?

127
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,220
Not that again.

128
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,350
Aren't you sick of saying that?

129
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,690
Director Moon is loyal to me.

130
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,190
Do you suspect and doubt
my every intention...

131
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,460
because I'm not loyal to you?

132
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,460
You're someone our company needs.

133
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,630
No. Before that,
I want to be someone you need.

134
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,030
I'm sick of hearing that!

135
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,440
Have you noticed we always end up
saying the same things?

136
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,550
Welcome.

137
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,350
- You must be tired.
- No.

138
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,990
It's nothing compared to
flying in from the US.

139
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,820
It would've been nice
if you had come with me.

140
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,590
How did the investment deal go?

141
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,100
Have you ever seen Stella Jang fail?

142
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,870
You're amazing, Mother.

143
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,970
What? Say that again.

144
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,140
Did I mishear you?

145
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,370
I said "Mother."

146
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,010
I called you "Madam" all this while,
and that didn't feel right.

147
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,510
I like being called "Mother."

148
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,850
- Isn't it nice, Tae Joo?
- It is.

149
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,650
That makes her your big sister.

150
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,920
Tae Joo calls me "Mother" too.

151
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,560
Does that make you siblings?

152
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,530
I don't mind that at all.

153
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Lucia.

154
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,070
You did well over the past four years.

155
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,340
Are you sure you can do well
here in Korea, too?

156
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,050
Ms. Se Ri said she doesn't need to eat,
that she'll go on studying.

157
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,650
I guess she is studying, then.

158
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,520
Four years is enough time to grow up.

159
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,490
- Goodness.
- Why don't you eat some more?

160
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,430
I don't have an appetite.

161
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,400
You still don't feel well?

162
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,930
Are you unwell?

163
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,870
Focus on chewing and swallowing your food.

164
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,540
The chairman hasn't been
feeling well for a few days.

165
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,940
I offered to call Doctor Yoon,
but he told me not to.

166
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,740
How exactly do you feel?

167
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,150
You didn't mention it at work.

168
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,680
I can't show how I'm doing at work.

169
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,150
I'm the head of a massive company.

170
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,390
Even if I'm dying,
I must pretend to be fine.

171
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,630
You can't do anything
without a sense of responsibility.

172
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,890
Goodness.

173
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,630
Go on after him.

174
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,210
I'll check your blood pressure...

175
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,310
and call Doctor Yoon
if it doesn't look good.

176
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,720
Leave it. Don't make a fuss.

177
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,990
You should see him tomorrow.

178
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,120
I'll only get an earful of his nagging.

179
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,490
It doesn't take much
to get a short consultation.

180
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,490
You could end up seriously ill.

181
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,800
I'm Min Doo Sik and I'm fine.
Not even cancer can...

182
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,030
Goodness.

183
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,600
What exactly is wrong with you?

184
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,340
I'm not surprised you don't feel well.

185
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,010
The e-commerce business is a mess.

186
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,280
Kyung Chae is the problem.

187
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,710
If you egg her on,

188
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,380
she'll wipe a chamber pot with a napkin.

189
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,230
Here's some ginseng tea.

190
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,040
Thanks. You can go. You too, Manager Gong.

191
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,450
Give up if you're unable
to keep things afloat.

192
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,010
Why cling to it so foolishly?

193
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,350
Business isn't child's play
that you can give up on just like that.

194
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,250
We haven't done anything yet.

195
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,890
What did you do until now, then?

196
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,890
Why did you drag a stranger
into our family business?

197
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,590
I said from the start
that Director Moon was a bad idea.

198
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,700
Shouldn't you be grateful
you even have a job at the head office?

199
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,430
It wasn't your idea, okay?
Don't act like you're better than me.

200
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm just stating a fact.

201
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,470
Let's be honest. A vice-director position
is too much for you.

202
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,910
This is why Father brought me in!

203
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,470
You don't know what's what!

204
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,810
How dare you talk to me like that...

205
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,650
when you were in the red for four years?

206
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,710
You're in no position to say that.

207
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,050
You haven't beaten JJ Mart
ever since you took over the store chain.

208
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,990
Should I say they walked all over you?

209
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,190
What did you say, you witch?

210
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,720
Who are you calling a witch?

211
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,260
What's going on here?

212
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,730
I'm so glad you decided
to use your energy to fight.

213
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,770
Why don't you pull out
each other's hair too?

214
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,870
Where are your manners?

215
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,700
How dare you raise your voices
when I'm home?

216
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,870
Darn it.

217
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,250
Try to calm down. Your blood pressure
will go through the roof.

218
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,420
Every one of my kids
only cares for themselves.

219
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,820
I'll get you a pill to help you calm down.
Promise to see your doctor tomorrow.

220
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,460
Goodness.

221
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,390
Oh, dear...

222
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,330
How dare that brat yell at me
like she's older than me?

223
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,400
Try to understand.

224
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,830
Business is all about money.

225
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,840
Does she think
she can operate without any?

226
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,010
Father refused to help her out,
and that means it's game over.

227
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,080
This wouldn't have happened
if he'd promoted me to the position.

228
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,240
This won't do.

229
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,550
I should call Dad and tell him
to say no if Kyung Chae...

230
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,750
happens to ask him for money.

231
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,090
Yes, that's right.
She could go to your dad.

232
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,090
Okay, I got it.

233
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,190
Your sister-in-law has no cash flow
and might have to shut things down,

234
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,060
and you don't want me to help her.

235
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,230
That's right.
Kyung Chae needs to learn a lesson.

236
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,800
Wouldn't it have been nice
if she looked out for her brother?

237
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,430
Why did she make
someone else the director?

238
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,140
Call all the lenders you know,

239
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,570
especially Mr. Oh,
the biggest lender in Myeongdong.

240
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,310
Tell them not to help Kyung Chae.

241
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,110
I said I got it.

242
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,240
Do you think your dad is a fool?

243
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,850
Don't underestimate me.

244
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,680
I hear one thing
and realize a hundred facts.

245
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,120
I can tell what a message says
just by the ringtone.

246
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,720
Talk to you soon.

247
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,120
We could charge an incredibly high
interest on a loan like this.

248
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,230
Are you a constipated snail
trying to take a dump?

249
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,800
I won't loan her anything,
even for the highest interest rate ever.

250
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,000
I was just asking.

251
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,600
I don't like Kyung Chae at all
for the way she treats Ji Seop.

252
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,810
You must be hungry. Have some fruit.

253
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,280
You love apple mangoes.

254
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,550
You can eat it instead.
I have no time to waste.

255
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,550
You're studying so hard,
you might get into university next year.

256
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,920
I have to. That's why I'm studying.

257
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,490
You're grown up.

258
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,760
I see you're much more mature.

259
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,930
I'm 20 years old. I'm an adult now.

260
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,670
I can't be a teenager forever.

261
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,010
Why are you still here?

262
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,080
Let me get back to my books.

263
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,980
Okay.

264
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,010
Study hard.

265
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,150
I'm sick of this,

266
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,920
pretending for everyone.

267
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,330
Wait and see.

268
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,430
Once I'm able to sell my Mingang stock,

269
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,270
I'll get rid of it all
and leave the country.

270
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,940
Hello.

271
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,710
Hello.

272
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,540
The spicy dried pollack,
braised lotus roots,

273
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,110
and traditional tteokgalbi.

274
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,910
Why don't you come in for a cup of coffee?

275
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,580
Gosh, no. I won't be a nuisance.

276
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,480
I have to get back to work.

277
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,180
Come on in.

278
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,220
I'm pretty good at brewing coffee,
and I want to brag a bit.

279
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,390
Can I have a cup, then?

280
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
The aroma and flavor are
really rich, deep, and luxurious.

281
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,570
I'll wash the boxes for you to take back.

282
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,270
You don't have to do that.

283
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,310
Wait while you drink the coffee.

284
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,840
Okay.

285
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,650
Can I have some coffee too?

286
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,980
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hey.

287
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,050
It's the lady who can cook.

288
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,490
I'm glad you liked the food.

289
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,990
I'm not the only one.
The whole family likes your food.

290
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,190
Especially my father-in-law.

291
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,490
He lost his appetite recently,
but I'm glad you brought something.

292
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,500
Goodness.

293
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,080
What's the matter?

294
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,980
If you have something to say,
say it, instead of exchanging glances.

295
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Well...

296
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,250
Have you heard the rumor
that's going around about our team?

297
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,260
There's a rumor going around?

298
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,630
Are people talking about us?

299
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,860
Yes, you could say so.

300
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,370
They call us a team of paupers
minus a tin can to beg for loose change.

301
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,100
I can't say
we have enough funds to go around,

302
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,340
but we're not that strapped,
so don't worry.

303
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,110
What's important is,
the CEO is aware of the situation,

304
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,440
and she's looking for a solution.

305
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,510
Right?

306
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,420
We're Mingang's Online Business Team.

307
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,380
We wouldn't go down like this.

308
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,650
We won't.

309
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,850
We're warmed up, so let's boost sales...

310
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,890
and show everyone we can do well.

311
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,290
Let's do that.

312
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,830
Instead of getting worried and anxious,

313
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,100
work even harder on your duties
so we can do better from now on.

314
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Good morning.

315
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,380
Hey, Soo Jung.

316
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,850
I need to talk to you.

317
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,050
About what?

318
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,720
Kyung Chae will come to you for help.

319
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,850
She'll want the mart's reserve funds.

320
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,820
She called me as I was clocking in,
and I was about to go to see her.

321
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,530
See? I knew she'd call you.

322
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,500
You can't give in and give her any money.

323
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,400
You know how she sweet-talks people...

324
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,670
into giving her
what she wants when she's stuck.

325
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,110
What's up? You called me over for tea?

326
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,520
You like jasmine tea, don't you?

327
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,120
It's from the Mediterranean,
so it has a unique aroma.

328
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,190
Since when did you care about what I like?

329
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,030
Just get to the point.

330
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,090
Okay, then.

331
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,600
We know each other too well.

332
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,500
I'd like you to let me use
Home and Mart's reserve funds.

333
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,000
That's a high price for a cup of tea.

334
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,610
I'll think about it.

335
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,780
You'll what?

336
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,080
The CEO is making a request,

337
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,910
and you need to think about it?

338
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,320
What did you tell me
before the business launch?

339
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,190
You told me to stay away.

340
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,060
To focus on running the store chain.

341
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,920
So I did just that
and focused on the stores.

342
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,560
Do you know how much work it took
to make the failing chain profitable?

343
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,100
I know how hard you worked.

344
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,130
Then you shouldn't be like this.

345
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,140
To be frank, if the e-commerce business...

346
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,400
doesn't do too well,
you can call it quits.

347
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,670
Home and Mart is Mingang's identity.

348
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,710
If the online business fails,
our reputation will take a hit.

349
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,180
You should accept that much.

350
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,880
Plus, you're overstepping boundaries
by demanding another subsidiary's funds...

351
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,020
just because you're the CEO.

352
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,720
We're two separate entities.

353
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,090
So you refuse to help me?

354
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,920
I said I'd think about it.

355
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,460
Oh, right.

356
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,170
From now on, if you need something,
come to my office.

357
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,870
I don't like having to come to you
for something unrelated to my business.

358
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,860
(Hospital)

359
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,900
- Hello.
- Can you come right away?

360
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,500
Is something wrong with the patient?

361
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,770
I think...

362
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,940
You'll see when you get here.

363
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,210
Okay, sure. Bye.

364
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,420
I didn't think asking her for money...

365
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,150
would be so humiliating.

366
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,790
You should've expected that.

367
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,260
Did you think she'd give you
what you wanted willingly?

368
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,990
I got impatient.

369
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,490
I should've looked for an investor.

370
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,930
I told you that even if you were rushed,
identifying the problem...

371
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,470
should be the priority.

372
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,570
Even if you're lucky enough
to find funding,

373
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,600
it won't solve the actual issue.

374
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,110
Don't beat around the bush. Just say it.

375
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,550
I looked into Director Moon's
business and marketing strategy...

376
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,980
when he was at New Buy in the US,

377
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,990
and what he did to survive...

378
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,990
in the global market.

379
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,090
You did a background check on him?

380
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,190
Hello.

381
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,930
What happened?

382
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,500
I rushed over as soon as you called.

383
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,100
The patient had a heart attack,
which almost killed him.

384
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,440
- How is he now?
- His doctor...

385
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,310
managed to revive him,
and his vitals are stable now.

386
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,370
Oh, good.

387
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,510
Could I speak with the doctor?

388
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,880
He's making his rounds.

389
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,410
Oh, there he is.

390
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,550
Doctor.

391
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,150
You rushed over in shock.

392
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,420
He's okay now.

393
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,920
You can go in and see him.

394
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,790
Thank you.

395
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,460

397
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,440
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

398
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,870
Once you read this,

399
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,870
you'll see just how different...

400
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,340
Director Moon has been acting
at Mingang compared to...

401
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,080
when he was at New Buy.

402
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,090
(Hankuk Hospital)

403
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,190
I'll let you rest.

404
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,330
I haven't given up,

405
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,930
so you shouldn't either, okay?

406
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,060
I just got here.

407
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,790
The smell of sanitizer
is giving me a headache already.

408
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,200
Be sure to see the doctor, though.

409
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,160
I will, okay? Stop nagging.

410
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,530
My goodness.

411
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,110
What is he doing here?

412
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,410
His business is doing poorly
because he's not at work...

413
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,910
during work hours.

414
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,450
Darn it.

415
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,020
Manager Gong
worries about you a great deal.

416
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,590
She called to tell me
to check you over thoroughly.

417
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,150
She acts as if she were my wife.

418
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,190
Why don't you find yourself a new wife?

419
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,160
Don't be silly. I'm too old for that.

420
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,030
I need to see the results to be sure,
but you'll be fine.

421
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,400
Don't worry too much about work.

422
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Your children are all doing just fine.

423
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,010
They're not doing fine at all.
One business is about to crash and burn.

424
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,340
Life can be very fleeting.

425
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,110
One patient of mine
has been in a coma for four years.

426
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,880
We dragged him back from death's door
when he was brought in.

427
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,590
I can't say what will happen.

428
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,190
I feel bad for the guy, whoever he is.

429
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,860
That's why I'm saying
it's not too late for you.

430
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,630
The term "silver fox" exists for a reason.

431
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,960
Who knows?
You might meet your fated partner.

432
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,630
Goodness.

433
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,170
A fated partner? At my age?

434
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,970
My gosh.

435
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,910
Oh, dear.

436
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,850
Are you all right?

437
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,680
You're too clumsy for someone your age.

438
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,590
I'm so sorry.

439
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,450
You apologize, and that's it?

440
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,820
You can't do this at a hospital.

441
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,560
What if I'd just met with a doctor
who'd given me a terminal diagnosis?

442
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,760
Do you know how devastating
this would've been?

443
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,370
Didn't your parents teach you better?

444
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,240
I'm glad.

445
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,310
What?

446
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,440
I'm glad you're not terminal.

447
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,980
You're complaining angrily
because you're healthy and well.

448
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,350
So I'm glad.

449
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,150
I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

450
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,250
Forget it.

451
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,790
Wait. If you have some free time,

452
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,060
could we go somewhere
so I can apologize properly?

453
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,990
I'd also like you to apologize to me.

454
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,930
I'm only here to make you feel better,
so don't get any ideas.

455
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,100
To be exact,

456
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,610
I should blame the man who ran past
and shoved you into me.

457
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,540
I'm pleased to hear you say that.

458
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,380
Wait.

459
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,290
Why did you want me to apologize to you?

460
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,090
It's hard to come across
people like you these days.

461
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,360
People are busy finding someone's weakness
to use it against them,

462
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,000
or to use that
as an excuse to mock and ridicule.

463
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,630
That's what most people are like.

464
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,700
Still,

465
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,240
you shouldn't have mentioned my parents.

466
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,570
Oh, that was...

467
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,110
Yes. I'll apologize for that.

468
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,110
I'm sorry. That was rude of me.

469
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,720
To show that I accept your apology,

470
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,890
I'll buy you a new shirt.
Will you accept it?

471
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,190
I said you didn't have to do anything.

472
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,890
Let's go that way.

473
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,140
Welcome.

474
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,440
I'd like a gentleman's dress shirt.

475
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,970
Something luxurious
that doesn't stand out.

476
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,980
Is it for your father?

477
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,580
Please address him properly.

478
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,780
He's a customer, not a father.

479
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,790
I thought you were father and daughter.

480
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,690
Why would you think so?

481
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,020
Can't you tell at a glance
that we're unrelated?

482
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,290
What would you like me to say, then?

483
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,800
I told you just now. We're customers.

484
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,230
I don't think
that's what you really want to know.

485
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,670
You whispered with others
and glanced at us...

486
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,040
even before we came in.

487
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,170
As if we were a cheating couple.
Am I wrong?

488
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,780
I apologize, ma'am. I see I was wrong.

489
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,650
You must meet all kinds of people
while you work this job.

490
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,980
Some of them would be up to no good.

491
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,180
But you're wrong this time.

492
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,360
We're actually a dating couple.

493
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,460
Apologize to him properly.

494
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,860
He doesn't deserve your insolence.

495
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,130
I apologize.

496
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,430
It's fine.

497
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,670
Let's go somewhere else.

498
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,100
I don't want to shop here anymore.

499
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,520
I'm sorry. I didn't like her attitude.

500
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,890
Let's shop at another store.

501
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,990
It's fine. You practically got me
a whole new outfit.

502
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,430
I have an appointment nearby anyway
and need to go.

503
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,910
They say words take root
and become reality.

504
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,510
You shouldn't go around saying
you're dating just anyone.

505
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,250
I want that to become reality.

506
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,760
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

507
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,610
Unless you'll stay single forever,

508
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,080
why don't you find
a lady you like even now?

509
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,450
What will you do?
Your sister is flying high.

510
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,220
You can't flail around forever.

511
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,190
I know you're stuck,
but let's not be irrational.

512
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,750
Look into Director Moon
even now while you can.

513
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,690
Why would he
put himself at such a risk to do that?

514
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,690
What if he has another desperate cause...

515
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,260
that gives him that reason?

516
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,130
He doubts and tests everyone,

517
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,130
and he's so cold,
he keeps everyone at a distance.

518
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,170
But for someone like you, Lucia?
