1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,780
Did Kim Sun Jae
get the divorce papers signed?

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,080
Yes. Her signature is on them.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,020
He's good at that sort of thing, at least.
What's your next move?

4
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,270
What are you going to do with Lawyer Kim?

5
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,680
You're not actually planning to marry him,
are you?

6
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,780
I already told you.
That's not going to happen.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,550
Now I have to decide
whether to use him up or cast him aside.

8
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,950
Now that hunting season's over,
we don't need the hunting dog anymore.

9
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,170
I'll take care of it, so don't you worry.

10
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,240
I won't let you down.

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,080
As for Se Ri, your granddaughter,

12
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,220
I'll never let her call
just any man "Dad."

13
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,150
I wouldn't settle for anyone
less than someone like Ho Se.

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,990
That's a relief.

15
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,560
My own flesh and blood can't be calling
some random loser "Father."

16
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,460
I'll see you later.

17
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,530
Okay. I'll talk to you again.

18
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,700
Why did you do that?

19
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,170
You let Lawyer Kim listen in on purpose,
didn't you?

20
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,980
He must be devastated.

21
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,780
Because it's the quickest
and most reliable way.

22
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,580
Instead of hearing it secondhand,
it's better that he heard it himself.

23
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,760
He still seems to be
a very capable right-hand man to CEO Min.

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,130
That doesn't make him fit
to be Se Ri's stepfather.

25
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,600
He's too vicious to be the father
of my grandchild.

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,700
He won't take it lying down when he learns
you've thrown him out after using him.

27
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,970
As a lawyer, he could take legal action.

28
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,410
Being a lawyer is exactly
why he can't go by the book.

29
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,810
Everything he's done for us
has been illegal,

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,550
a sketchy mix of cutting corners
and bending the law.

31
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,580
If he exposes his opponent's secrets,
his own secrets will blow up in his face.

32
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,950
Is he really going to do that?
Not unless he's on a suicide mission.

33
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,120
So you manipulated CEO Min...

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,020
just to dump him
once he got the papers signed?

35
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,630
Of course.

36
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,000
Is this what they call
killing two birds with one stone?

37
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,030
I got rid of both Lucia and Kim Sun Jae
in one fell swoop.

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,340
Tae Joo, how about we go somewhere nice
and get something delicious to eat?

39
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,080
I'm starving all of a sudden.

40
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,150
How about some spicy stir-fried octopus?

41
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,230
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

42
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,640
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

43
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,650
So this is how
you're getting rid of me, Min Kyung Chae?

44
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,490
So you two were in on it together
the whole time?

45
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,030
You dare use me like this! How dare you!

46
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,300
After everything I've done for you?

47
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,270
Fine. You two have fun.
Let's see how far you get.

48
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,070
You probably think Jang Yeon Sook
is your savior right now.

49
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,040
You may think she makes you invincible,
but you're dead wrong.

50
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,580
As long as I have this in my hands,
nothing will go according to your plan.

51
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,810
Just you wait.

52
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,920
The person you have called is unavailable.
You will be forwarded to their voicemail.

53
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,260
Seriously, where could he be
and what is he doing?

54
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,830
He's not even picking up his phone.

55
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,530
(Mingang Distribution)

56
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,710
Kim Sun Jae, you mean?

57
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,610
I'm not sure what happened,
but he looked terrible.

58
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,620
It didn't seem like an off-site meeting.

59
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,650
It looked like he was
just storming out of the office.

60
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,360
Why would he act like that?
He should be ecstatic.

61
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,360
Just a little while ago,

62
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,030
I signed the divorce papers for him.

63
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,500
So you finally signed them.

64
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,440
Now I need to think about our next move.

65
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,910
Knowing Kim Sun Jae,
he'll use the law to his advantage.

66
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,740
Regardless of what Kim Sun Jae does,
our job now...

67
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,450
is to prove that Chairman Min Doo Sik
was forced to stamp those papers,

68
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,620
so we can get the divorce nullified.

69
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,790
Then, we need to find out
where Chairman Min is.

70
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,420
Even if the papers are filed,
the divorce isn't finalized right away,

71
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,260
so try not to worry.
Let's focus on what we can do.

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,630
Let's think about where they could be
keeping Chairman Min Doo Sik.

73
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,170
If Tae Joo were on the case like before,

74
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,800
we would've found him in no time.

75
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,640
What can we do?

76
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,410
If our ties with Jang Yeon Sook
are cut,

77
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,440
his connection to us is severed as well.

78
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,480
Darn it.

79
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,920
How much longer do I have to waste my time
on these useless proposals?

80
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,820
This is grunt work.

81
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,090
I'm about to become a director.
And I'm stuck doing this nonsense?

82
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,790
Seriously...

83
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,560
What are you muttering to yourself about?

84
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,170
About these proposals...

85
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,000
Can't someone else do this?

86
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,100
You're Vice Director, so you should do it.
Who else would do it?

87
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,370
There's no one else here either.

88
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,640
Everyone else is busy with meetings,
business trips, and their own tasks.

89
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,410
So the person who isn't busy should do it.
Am I supposed to do it?

90
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,880
The one who "isn't busy?"

91
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,650
Look here, Director Moon Tae Kyung.

92
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,220
Are you really that clueless?

93
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,690
You have no idea who you're messing with.

94
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,120
Don't you know your place?

95
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,560
Excuse me?
Who is it that doesn't know their place?

96
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,990
What are you going to be
that's got you acting so high and mighty?

97
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,960
I'm about to become...

98
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,930
Anyway, I'm about to move up,

99
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,040
so stop giving me a hard time.

100
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,010
You don't want to regret it later.

101
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,380
Why are you always popping in and out
of my office lately?

102
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,890
I was just wondering what the air was like
in the director's office...

103
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,260
and to check out the decor.

104
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,330
By the way, you've had Secretary Kang
for a long time, right?

105
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,290
What's he like? Is he any good?

106
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,260
If he's good, I might just keep him on.

107
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,630
Why would you need my personal secretary?

108
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,870
Don't you know you have to be at least
an executive to have your own secretary?

109
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,210
Also, this is my office.

110
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,780
Go back and enjoy the air over
at the online team.

111
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,810
Gosh, that mouth of yours.

112
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,380
Is it a crime for me to get a whiff
of the air in here?

113
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,750
Just because this is your office now
doesn't mean it'll be yours forever.

114
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,650
Get real!

115
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Have you no self-awareness?

116
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,030
The only way you'll get my seat
is when the inferno freezes over.

117
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Then what are you going to do?

118
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,800
Because it seems
the inferno has already frozen over.

119
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,270
What's that supposed to mean?

120
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,900
Kyung Chae... I mean, the CEO...

121
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,840
said she's kicking you out
and giving me your position.

122
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,480
- Says who?
- The CEO, of course.

123
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,710
Right, Ja Kyung and I decided to give
our entire stake to Kyung Chae.

124
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,680
You see where this is going, don't you?

125
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,350
Father's incapacitated, so he can't vote.

126
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,660
And if that happens,

127
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,790
Kyung Chae becomes
the majority shareholder.

128
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,530
Kyung Chae is going to be
the majority shareholder?

129
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,300
Do you get it now?
You totally backed the wrong horse.

130
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,230
That woman, Lucia? Her career is over.

131
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,540
If you hadn't sided with her
before the emergency shareholder meeting,

132
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,040
none of this would have happened.

133
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Darn it.

134
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,220
What was Ji Seop just telling me?

135
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,420
Did you really decide
to give him my position?

136
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,960
It's not like that position
had your name on it.

137
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,690
It should go to whoever
is better for the job.

138
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,330
You're doing this because...

139
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,060
I said I'd support Lucia
with my shares, aren't you?

140
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,130
But I never thought
you'd actually go this far.

141
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,800
We may fight like we're enemies,
but we're still family.

142
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,210
If you didn't want to take my side,
you should have at least remained neutral.

143
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,010
How could you possibly side with her?

144
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,480
Look at how she's torn apart
our family and this company.

145
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,580
Please, reconsider.

146
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,480
I won't give my stake to her.

147
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,950
Just let me keep my job as director.

148
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,260
No, it's too late.

149
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,430
That's always your problem.

150
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,490
You're always one step behind.

151
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,200
- Are you really going to do this?
- Get out!

152
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,970
Now go be a good director
for the little time you have left.

153
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,390
Chairman Min.

154
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,960
Do you see what this is, don't you?

155
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,200
All I have to do is file this,

156
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,530
and you and Lucia will be
nothing to each other.

157
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,770
See? The bond of marriage means nothing.

158
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,740
Of course, when you eventually wake up,

159
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,540
you could claim...

160
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,410
the thumbprint on the forms
wasn't made of your own free will...

161
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,410
and get the divorce nullified.

162
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,750
But that's a process, and it takes time.

163
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,190
And by then, Min Kyung Chae will have
already taken everything.

164
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,130
Even for you, going up against her
won't be easy.

165
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,760
But as long as I have this,

166
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,470
that changes everything.

167
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,270
You're Kyung Chae's dog.

168
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,540
But I wonder how long
you'll stay on her side.

169
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,110
I know exactly
what kind of person Min Kyung Chae is.

170
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,450
That's why I'm going to start
doing things my own way.

171
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,750
I'm not going to be a hound that's used
for a season and then abandoned,

172
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,020
but a mad dog that turns on its master.

173
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,210
So Kyung Chae is
really promoting you soon, right?

174
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,410
That's what I said.
Why are you so skeptical?

175
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,680
She said once she deals with Soo Jung,
she'll give me the position.

176
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,180
Unbelievable.

177
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,520
Everything is just falling into place.
Right, darling?

178
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,220
Honestly, who would've thought
we'd end up on Kyung Chae's side?

179
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,130
That's how know-it-all Soo Jung
got left out.

180
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,800
By the way, did you tell your parents
about my promotion?

181
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,130
Of course. Mom and Dad are thrilled.

182
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,070
No, wait. That's not enough.

183
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,040
We should visit
your dad's restaurant tomorrow.

184
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,610
It's about time I did my part
as a son-in-law.

185
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,240
- Okay, should we?
- Yes.

186
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,020
What Ji Seop said is true.

187
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,690
There's going to be
a management shake-up soon.

188
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,620
So does that mean you're really
getting pushed out?

189
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
I mean,

190
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
are you getting fired?

191
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,030
It seems my sister
has already made up her mind.

192
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,300
Wait, what's going to happen to me?

193
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,930
I'm your only ally at the company.

194
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,970
CEO Min is really taking this too far.

195
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,670
I mean, to her own sister...

196
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,070
Wait...

197
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,570
You're not going to let this slide,
are you?

198
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,910
Of course not.

199
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,180
It's time I exposed
CEO Min Kyung Chae's weakness.

200
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,720
Her weakness?

201
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,390
And what's that?

202
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,690
Se Ri is her daughter.

203
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,130
You mean Miss Se Ri!

204
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,730
It's just a hunch, though.

205
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,370
Everything's okay at the house today,
right?

206
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
You know you always call around this time?

207
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,410
That's because this is when
I start to worry.

208
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,610
It's when everyone in that house
is usually together.

209
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,440
It's like you're sleeping with the enemy.

210
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,180
Surrounded by those terrifying Mins,
I worry if you can even breathe.

211
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,020
I'm breathing, eating,
and sleeping just fine,

212
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,290
so don't you worry.

213
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,360
Every day must feel like
you're walking on eggshells.

214
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,420
Every single moment must be torment.

215
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,030
Living under the same roof
with people like them.

216
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,760
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

217
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,030
But I'm the one who's not okay with it.

218
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,770
Min Kyung Chae already showed up
with divorce papers.

219
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,540
I can just imagine how they must be
treating you over there.

220
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,980
I'm okay for now,
so stop worrying and get some rest.

221
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,950
The moment I'm not okay,
I'll let you know.

222
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,180
I'll say, "Please, get me out of here."

223
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,390
All right. Rest well,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

224
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,510
Tae Joo, it's me.

225
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,080
- Moon Tae Kyung.
- Yes, go ahead.

226
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,950
If Madam Jang is there with you,
just listen.

227
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,050
All right.

228
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,790
If you're free tomorrow,

229
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,460
could we meet briefly?

230
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Me? Why?

231
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,190
You should know why I'm asking to see you.

232
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
It won't take long.

233
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,570
Please come for Lucia's sake
and the bond you two shared.

234
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,140
You can pick the time and place.
Whatever's convenient.

235
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,300
- Who was that?
- Just someone I know.

236
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,930
They want to meet tomorrow
about something.

237
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,600
Who is this person you know?

238
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,640
It's no one you know, Mother.

239
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,270
Is that so?

240
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,350
Since it's come to this,

241
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,150
all I have to do is prove Min Kyung Chae
and Min Se Ri are mother and daughter.

242
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,590
If I can prove it's not just my suspicion,
but a fact,

243
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,130
then I can turn the tables
back in my favor.

244
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,510
What are you hiding behind your back?

245
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,310
Hiding? What would I be hiding?

246
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,980
I'm sure you just hid something.

247
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,220
I told you I didn't.

248
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,750
Fine, if you say so.

249
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,590
Why aren't you heading to work today?

250
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,260
I'm going to in a little while.

251
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,800
This is so annoying!
Why is it gone again?

252
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,470
What's wrong? Has something gone missing?

253
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,440
My toothbrush. Why is it missing again?

254
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,010
I'm sure someone stole it!

255
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,480
Look again carefully.
Who would want a used toothbrush?

256
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,980
That's what I thought,
so I brought them all out, see?

257
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,250
Look. Where's mine?

258
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,050
Why did you bring out
everyone's toothbrushes?

259
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,690
Because I'm annoyed!
It went missing last time, too.

260
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,630
Here, let me see. I'll help you find it.

261
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,300
Not this one...

262
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,470
What?

263
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,500
Wait. Come to think of it,
Kyung Chae's is missing too.

264
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,370
You're right. Kyung Chae's is gone too.

265
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,280
Who on earth took
Kyung Chae's toothbrush and mine?

266
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,760
I have Se Ri's and Kyung Chae's
toothbrushes now.

267
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,930
If we can use these
to prove they're mother and daughter,

268
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,640
then we'll get another chance.

269
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,770
Even if CEO Min...

270
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,840
really is Se Ri's birth mother,
how can we use that against her?

271
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,780
We'll publicly reveal...

272
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,050
that Se Ri is
CEO Min Kyung Chae's illegitimate child...

273
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,250
and that she's built her image
as a "career woman"...

274
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,150
with a pristine private life.

275
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,350
So she deserves
a huge public humiliation.

276
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,960
Should we have the Board of Directors
make an issue of it?

277
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,260
We need to blow this thing wide open.

278
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,630
We'll shake things up and attack her
until her CEO position is at risk.

279
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,500
We have to do everything we possibly can.

280
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,870
We'll leak it to the press
and mobilize an army of online trolls.

281
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,810
What should I do?
She just got her CEO position back.

282
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,010
I can't let something go wrong
for her again now.

283
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,790
This one belongs to Madam Jung.

284
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,090
This should do the trick, right?

285
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,270
What is it? Why didn't you knock?

286
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,610
Where is my head?
I was in such a rush, I forgot.

287
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,710
I wanted to get you some breakfast
before you leave for work.

288
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,680
I don't have an appetite, so please leave.

289
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,980
But if you don't eat breakfast,
you'll be starving before lunch.

290
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,950
Please, have some.
I made your favorite croaker soup.

291
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,220
Since when is croaker soup my favorite?

292
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,830
I'm telling you, I'm really not hungry.

293
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,360
Don't be like that.

294
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,460
At least have one bite for the person
who prepared it. Please?

295
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,400
- Come on.
- Goodness!

296
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,900
- Please, have one bite before you go.
- I said I'm not hungry!

297
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,600
You have to eat before you leave.

298
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,140
I hate it croaker soup!

299
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,980
- But you really should eat first.
- What are you going on about?

300
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,180
Here, sit down.

301
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,180
Here you go.

302
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,750
Here you are.

303
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,420
Go on, dig in.

304
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,850
Gosh, you're so thin.
I'm worried about you.

305
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,890
Don't worry about me.

306
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,720
I may be thin,
but I'm tougher than I look.

307
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,990
Finish the whole bowl.
Don't make me get mad.

308
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,860
Take your time and chew properly.
Now, eat up.

309
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Okay.

310
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,660
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

311
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
The person you are calling
is unavailable...

312
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,900
The person you have called is unavailable.
Please leave a message...

313
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,340
Kim Sun Jae.

314
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,170
Why on earth aren't you
answering my calls?

315
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,710
Since yesterday.

316
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,510
Legal said they haven't heard
from him either.

317
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,610
What do you think he's up to?

318
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,320
Does Min Kyung Chae know about this?

319
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,520
No, I don't think she does.

320
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,820
Seeing the CEO's secretary called Legal
to check if he had come in.

321
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,400
(Mo Tae Joo)

322
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,670
Let's meet at Lucepé at
the Mucheon Roundabout in an hour.

323
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,400
What's that text about?

324
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,470
It's nothing.

325
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,510
Thank you...

326
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,350
for agreeing to meet me.

327
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,420
Don't mention it.

328
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,080
I've been wanting to meet you
and talk to you as well.

329
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,050
Mother.

330
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,660
You call her Madam Jang, I believe.

331
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,600
As I'm always by her side, I know better
than anyone that she's on a rampage.

332
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,630
Which is why...

333
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,470
I have a favor to ask you.

334
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,300
This will probably be a difficult favor
for you to grant.

335
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,810
I came here fully prepared
for you to refuse,

336
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,240
so please don't feel pressured.

337
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,410
Somehow, I think I already know
what it is.

338
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,490
So, Lawyer Kim has been out of contact
and disappeared since yesterday?

339
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,790
Yes.

340
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,590
Seeing how he left dropping a bouquet
and a proposal ring right there,

341
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,690
I'm sure something must have
happened suddenly.

342
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,500
So, Kim Sun Jae is human after all.

343
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,730
After finding out his fiancée treated him
like her own personal hound,

344
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,300
he wouldn't be human if he stuck around.

345
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,410
I suppose something came up.

346
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,540
Why look for someone who wants to hide?
Just let him be.

347
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,450
You think you can't find another lawyer
as good as Kim Sun Jae?

348
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,690
I'll set you up with a lawyer
who will be helpful to you.

349
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,620
A real ace who will be a great help
to our work going forward.

350
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,460
But he's not the type to just disappear
without a word.

351
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,400
I said let's drop the subject
of Kim Sun Jae.

352
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,030
How about we talk about
something more exciting?

353
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,370
So, did you file for divorce?

354
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,710
- Hello, what can I get for you folks?
- We'll have two goat soups, please.

355
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,970
Two goat soups, got it.

357
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,410
Here you go.
Enjoy your meal.

358
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,780
- Sir!
- Dad!

359
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,850
Mother.

360
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,490
If it isn't the future director
of Mingang Distribution.

361
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,430
But Ji Seop, are you sure
it's a done deal this time?

362
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,530
This isn't the first time you've been
so sure and then it fell through.

363
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,570
Mom, please.
It's a done deal this time.

364
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,300
Stop being so sour.
Save the vinegar for the food.

365
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,870
So this time it's the real deal, right?

366
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,770
Yes, I'm telling you.

367
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,840
It's still confidential,
but it's as good as decided.

368
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,610
Soon, I'll be Min Ji Seop,
Director of Mingang Distribution!

369
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,380
- That's who I'll be.
- Am I dreaming, or is this real?

370
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,850
Ouch!

371
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,250
Ouch!

372
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,520
It's real!

373
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,190
Hooray for the Republic of Korea!
What are you doing? Join in!

374
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,660
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

375
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,830
- Hooray!

376
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,560
Attention, everyone!
We have some great news to celebrate!

377
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,630
This guy here is my son-in-law,

378
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,600
and he'll be
a director at Mingang Distribution,

379
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,940
Korea's number one company.

380
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,200
Let's applaud him!

381
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,710
- Congratulations!
- Thank you so much.

382
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,770
Thank you.

383
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,440
I'm in a great mood.

384
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,350
Everything you're eating is on me!

385
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,950
I'm ringing the golden bell!

386
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,420
Ringing the golden bell? Are you serious?
That's not just a few bucks.

387
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,190
This is how you're meant to spend money.

388
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,390
And if you all join me for three cheers,

389
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,190
I'll even throw in a plate
of our boiled pork for everyone!

390
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,990
- To our Ji Seop, hooray!
- Hooray!

391
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,830
- Hooray!
- Hooray for our restaurant!

392
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,970
- Hooray!
- Hooray for Oh Pan Sool!

393
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,030
- Hooray!
- Hey, bring out the boiled pork.

394
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,600
- Bring it quick!
- All right.

395
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,520
Shouldn't you be at work at this time?

396
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,220
Are you expecting someone?

397
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,490
You don't need to know, Manager Gong.

398
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,020
- Are you going to the market?
- Yes, I'm heading to the supermarket.

399
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,820
I'll be on my way.

400
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,870
She's really sweating it.

401
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,370
She's eager to use that paternity test
to stick it to Ms. Kyung Chae.

402
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,410
It's not going to go her way.
Not while I'm around. Not a chance.

403
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,220
- Excuse me, do you live here?
- Yes, I do. What is it?

404
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,690
I have a registered letter for
Ms. Min Soo Jung at this address.

405
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,830
That's the younger miss.
She's inside right now.

406
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,100
Just give it to me.
I'll make sure she gets it.

407
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
Thank you.

408
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,910
So this must be the DNA test result.

409
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,380
I don't even have to look.
It's obviously not a match.

410
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,250
After all, Ms. Se Ri and Lucia
aren't blood-related in the slightest.

411
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,550
So the results are a given.

412
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,460
Imagine her disappointment.

413
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,060
Serves her right
for messing with Ms. Kyung Chae.

414
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,330
An illegitimate child must know her place.

415
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,710
Maybe I'll just take a little peek.

00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,970
No, but why...

422
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,340
How can this...

423
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,240
How can Se Ri and that woman be...

424
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,850
All right, you're almost there.
Just one more push!

425
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,230
Goodness, she's the spitting image
of her mother.

426
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,240
Take a look, Kyung Chae.

427
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,510
Ms. Kyung Chae.

428
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Ms. Kyung Chae?

429
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,750
Ms. Kyung Chae, stay with me!

Please, help my baby.

Okay, hold on.
Please get in the ambulance.
