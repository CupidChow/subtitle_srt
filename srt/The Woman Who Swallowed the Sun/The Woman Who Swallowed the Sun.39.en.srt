00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,380
(Episode 39)

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,420
(Mingang Distribution)

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,430
We're here to discuss...

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,430
the problems that will arise...

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,430
because we failed to renew the contract...

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,070
with two major partners,

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,670
and figure out
a solution to those problems.

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,970
As you know, Miyeon and Woojin...

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,910
are two leading delivery companies,

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,210
and we've done business with them
for 30 years,

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,240
and that makes us family.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,780
It's unusual that both companies
refused to renew their contracts,

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,950
and we must decide on a solution
to prevent missing delivery deadlines...

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,720
if we can't find a distributor.

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,890
We'd appreciate your counsel.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,690
Before we discuss that,

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,290
we must see if the Online Business
Team's director should be penalized.

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,760
We lost two partners who'd been with us...

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,970
for 30 years.

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,100
We can't ignore that fact.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,420
First of all,

22
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,220
I would like to apologize sincerely.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,420
As the person in charge of the team,
I failed to renew the partnership deal,

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,290
and for that, I truly am sorry.

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,030
But there will be...

26
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,900
no crisis or backlog that you fear.

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,570
We signed deals with new companies
and took measures to ensure our goods...

28
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,940
will be delivered on time...

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,510
What new companies?

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,080
Are they as well-established
as Miyeon and Woojin?

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,080
No, but they'll do their best
if they're given the chance.

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,780
Our business relies heavily
on on-time delivery.

33
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,590
Who can say the companies...

34
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,860
you selected are as reliable
as our old partners?

35
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,360
That's right. We have
a complicated distribution system,

36
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,060
and I believe Miyeon and Woojin
were the only companies...

37
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,130
capable of handling the large quantities.

38
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,340
Everyone knows Miyeon and Woojin
guaranteed next-day delivery,

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,970
and that our company benefited from...

40
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,340
the trust that gave our customers.

41
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,510
This issue is too serious to ignore.

42
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,290
E-commerce companies
in European countries and the US...

43
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,720
no longer sign an exclusive contract
with one distributor.

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,130
In general, they sign multiple contractors
for security and stability.

45
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,300
For example, if they were
to do business with one contractor,

46
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,570
and that contractor
faced a serious problem,

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,930
it's hard to find a solution.

48
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,440
I'd say Mingang is facing that situation.

49
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,910
So you'll hire
a bunch of small distributors...

50
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,110
that helped people move houses...

51
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,340
and delivered products
for small online malls?

52
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,050
Don't we all have to start somewhere?

53
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,050
That's exactly how Miyeon
and Woojin got started.

54
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,560
The list before you...

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,730
shows the companies I selected.

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,430
I visited every one of them
to check their situation.

57
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,900
I reviewed their financial statements
and interviewed the CEOs.

58
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,170
I confirmed their potential.

59
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,740
I explained Mingang's system
and assisted them...

60
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,410
with a simulation...

61
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,440
so they could grasp
what we expected of them.

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,580
If we form partnerships with them...

63
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,150
and put them to work,
starting with our upcoming sale,

64
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,550
I'm sure we won't face
any of the problems...

65
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,720
you're concerned about.

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,720
You should have figured out a solution
to the mess. That's a given.

67
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,290
We always expect a director
to take responsibility for their mistakes.

68
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,730
Regarding the failure to renew
two partnership contracts,

69
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,540
if you agree to penalize
Director Moon Tae Kyung,

70
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,970
raise your hand.

71
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,920
Director Oh.

72
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,460
Please raise your hand to vote.

73
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,210
I'm against penalizing him.

74
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,870
Don't worry.

75
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,080
Mingang's board
has a unique voting system.

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,210
It requires universal consent.

77
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,950
"Universal consent?"

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,650
It's a Mingang tradition.

79
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,150
They might be separate corporate bodies,

80
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,420
but they come under one holding company,

81
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,960
so the same rule will apply.

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,830
Then, if just one person disagrees,
the vote doesn't go through?

83
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,330
Yes.

84
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,300
But this is just a temporary measure.

85
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,800
I can't guarantee the end result.

86
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,070
My connections don't stand a chance
against the people...

87
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,170
who are loyal to Father and Kyung Chae.

88
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,040
That means we gained some time.

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,680
Yes.

90
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,550
The rest is up to you.

91
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,080
Use the time I earned for you to survive.

92
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,220
Is there a reason
why you voted against penalization?

93
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,830
The thing is,

94
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,640
I don't think the fault
of failing to renew the contracts...

95
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,040
falls exclusively
on the director's shoulders.

96
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,070
It's like... From a macroscopic view...

97
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,780
Forget it. Why drag it on?

98
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,180
We have a conclusion.

99
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,610
The vote wasn't unanimous.
Why waste more time?

100
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,080
We'll postpone
Director Moon's penalization.

101
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,520
You. Select the companies we need...

102
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,350
and be sure business runs as usual.

103
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,690
If I hear there's even one tiny issue
with the delivery system,

104
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,230
you and your team
should be prepared to pay.

105
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,160
It wasn't you, was it?

106
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,630
You suspect me?

107
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,940
Do you think I got Director Oh to vote no
to save Director Moon?

108
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,370
It wouldn't be the first time
you coddled him.

109
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,640
I did.

110
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,780
But not this time.

111
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,380
I have a reason he must pay, you see.

112
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,310
I want to reform his team.

113
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,020
"Reform?"

114
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,420
I'll reorganize it.

115
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,090
You'll use that as an excuse
to break up the team and scatter them?

116
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,320
Why not?

117
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,930
I'm willing to fire the director
I worked hard to scout.

118
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,190
Who cares about a few employees?

119
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,760
If that doesn't work, I'll transfer him...

120
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,730
and set up a new Online Business Team.

121
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,570
And send Lucia far away in the process.

122
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm glad you get it.

123
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,840
That's only fair.

124
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,110
Do what you want.

125
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,610
You always did what you wanted.

126
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,880
What will you do about Director Oh, then?

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,720
There's no office you won't go into.

128
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,330
How dare you come and go as you please?

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,330
I turned a blind eye once.
That was your hint to lie low.

130
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,970
Why do you keep crossing the line?

131
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Is my leaving Director Min's office
"crossing the line?"

132
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,680
But then, you go in and out
of the chairman's office as if it's yours.

133
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,210
Did you decide to side with Soo Jung?

134
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,680
Do you think she can be your new lifeline?

135
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,620
It's not like that.

136
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,730
Oh, gosh.

137
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,740
What brings you to my shabby office?

138
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,640
You must want to know how the board voted.

139
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,680
Should I?

140
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,210
We're separate entities,
so technically it's none of my business.

141
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,020
You dared to get involved,
so you should hear the result.

142
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,290
Everyone knows Director Oh is tied to you.

143
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,430
What deal did you make with Lucia?

144
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,900
Why would I make a deal with her?

145
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,230
What should we give and take?

146
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,630
That's why I'm asking.

147
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,500
You have nothing to give or take,
but it feels like you did.

148
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,240
Don't frame me.

149
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,970
We just had a cup of tea a few times.

150
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,540
That had better be true.

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,740
If not,

152
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,410
you will have dug your own grave.

153
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,100
Director. What happened?

154
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,160
Did they penalize you?

155
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
No.

156
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,310
I managed to avoid that, thanks to you.

157
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,340
Good.

158
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,780
It's great, isn't it?

159
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,350
I knew it.

160
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,920
Did he just win a war?

161
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,820
Why would you applaud him?

162
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,430
My penalization was postponed,
so I'm not in the clear completely.

163
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,590
Let's all get to work.

164
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,860
We have to work with our new partners
on the upcoming regular sale,

165
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,770
so pay extra attention
to anything that involves deliveries.

166
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,540
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

167
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,220
Ms. Ja Kyung.

168
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,720
Ms. Se Ri. Sit up.

169
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,590
Come on.

170
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,960
Darn it.

171
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,170
Here. Open wide.

172
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,940
Leave it.

173
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,170
Eat up.

174
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,270
I said leave it!

175
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,210
Do you know how many meals you missed?

176
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,950
Are you on a hunger strike?

177
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,590
Yes, Se Ri. She made the effort
to bring you food.

178
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,760
Do you think I'd feel like eating?

179
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,460
Why wouldn't you?

180
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,690
Are you worried or bothered?

181
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,500
No. You have nothing to worry about.

182
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
You have the best life ever.

183
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,240
My gosh. Did you just glare at me?

184
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,410
Did I say something wrong?

185
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,540
You're Chairman Min's youngest princess.

186
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,810
Everyone knows you lie in bed all day,

187
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,210
stretched out like taffy
left out in the summer sun.

188
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Not a word if you don't know anything.

189
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,120
You don't know what my life is like!

190
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,090
Ms. Se Ri.

191
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,690
Ms. Se Ri.

192
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,590
You didn't even take your wallet.

193
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,030
Ms. Se Ri!

194
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,680
Wife.

195
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,220
The most beautiful wife in the world.
Will you stop it now?

196
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,990
I'll visit Sun Jae at work,
buy him a hot meal,

197
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,920
and be the dutiful uncle.

198
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,560
Will you really?

199
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,330
A man keeps his word.

200
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,200
I do what I say.

201
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,230
Sun Jae is a pitiful kid.

202
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,570
He lost his parents to cancer,

203
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,970
and he's all alone.

204
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,640
Yes, he's a poor kid.

205
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,740
But not as poor as I.

206
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,680
My wife is on strike,
and I've been surviving on cup noodles.

207
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,880
No man deserves that.

208
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,510
I'll just...

209
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,880
strangle myself with these noodles.

210
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,920
You should eat a decent meal.
I'll set the table for you.

211
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,120
With a side of Norwegian mackerel.

212
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,690
There's no time to go to Norway.

213
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,860
Let's eat out to celebrate
our reconciliation.

214
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,430
Eat out?

215
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,960
- Black goat.
- That sounds lovely.

216
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,870
It's nice and clean. Sit down.

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,070
Hello.

218
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,210
Is this for free?

219
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,610
- Yes.
- My gosh.

220
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,510
This must be the black goat extract.

221
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
That tasted nice.

222
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,420
It's so rich that it's filthy rich.

223
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,560
We make it ourselves here.

224
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,860
Go through the menu
and order when you're ready.

225
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,900
- Okay.
- Okay.

226
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,530
Do you know that this is the best for me?

227
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,870
It suits my needs.

228
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,940
"Black goat." It has an aura.

229
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,810
They have a unique call too.

230
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,780
Is it that good for you?
Is it good for women too?

231
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,750
It is. It's raised by the land
and blessed by the heavens.

232
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,020
Is it?

233
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,660
If we both eat this,
we might give Ja Kyung a sibling.

234
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,630
Did you just see
a zebra wash off its stripes?

235
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,260
My factory closed down years ago.

236
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,160
If we have a baby now,
we'll be way over 60 when it's 1.

237
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,930
I want a grandchild, not a child.

238
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,670
Oh, gosh. I'm hungry. I'm starving.

239
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Here it is.

240
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,210
Here.

241
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,140
- My gosh.
- It's here.

242
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,880
The goat soup you ordered.

243
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,980
- Thank you.
- Enjoy yourselves.

244
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,020
- We will.
- We will.

245
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,490
- Let's dig in.
- Okay.

246
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,090
The soup first.

247
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,660
It's hot.

248
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,860
Gosh, it's hot.

249
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,000
It's hot but tasty.

250
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,840
My word. The soup is awesomely thick.

251
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,700
It's not just awesome.

252
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,810
Gosh, it's delicious.

253
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,110
It's good.

254
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,450
I'm incredibly good at sniffing out money.

255
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,020
I smell it.

256
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,490
Should we open a goat restaurant?

257
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,130
This is what we should invest in.
Let's buy some more to go.

258
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,600
Excuse me. Can we order more to go?

259
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,330
All you have in stock.

260
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,000
That much? Are you crazy?

261
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,640
This is what a man should be like.

262
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,440
Excuse me. Wrap just one portion to go.

263
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,910
(Mingang Distribution)

264
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,310
(No goods beyond here)

265
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,380
Thank you.

266
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,550
He still looks at her like he cares.

267
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,980
The chairman?

268
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,080
Do you know
how Soo Jung's mom made me feel?

269
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,790
"I'll gouge out the eyes
of any woman who steals my dad's gaze."

270
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,090
"I'll dig out the heart
of any woman who steals my dad's heart."

271
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,500
I was just a kid,
and that was what I swore.

272
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,000
Father had Soo Jung out of wedlock,

273
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,570
and the stress killed my mom.

274
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,440
That's when I swore...

275
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,080
I would never forgive my father.

276
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,480
I'll never let him love.

277
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,250
I won't let any woman have him.

278
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,420
Even if he misses companionship and love,

279
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,890
I won't let anyone stay close to him.

280
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,730
I'll make sure he stays single,

281
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,030
lonely, and loveless,
and ends up dying alone.

282
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,640
You have an even clearer reason...

283
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,340
to get rid of Lucia.

284
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,720
Moon Tae Kyung got lucky this time,

285
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,550
but it's not over.

286
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,450
The result is set in stone.

287
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,920
Who decides whose end?

288
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,190
You people are so arrogant.

289
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,730
Does the CEO know...

290
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,730
who sabotaged the contract renewal?

291
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,600
Can you prove it was me?

292
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,170
Show the proof if you have any.

293
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,810
I told you...

294
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,470
that I'd cover up your secret
if you disappear,

295
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,210
and expose you if you don't.

296
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,910
Who you are, and why you came here.

297
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,090
Do you think I'm a pushover?

298
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,820
You're in no position to threaten me.

299
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,830
You're a nobody.

300
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,770
You can do what you want.

301
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,570
I'll do what I want.

302
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,370
You have too much guts for your own good.

303
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,470
Can you prove I'm Baek Sul Hee?

304
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,240
Like you said, I got a new identity.

305
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,680
What?

306
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,250
Oh, will you kidnap my sister
and get me to come clean?

307
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,020
Too bad.

308
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,250
She won't fall for your tricks
like before.

309
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,420
I asked the police to watch her...

310
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,190
and even hired bodyguards.

311
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,230
So talk all you want.

312
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,330
Go to the chairman, CEO,
or use the internal broadcasting system.

313
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,670
Tell everyone that I'm Baek Sul Hee.

314
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,640
You've lost your mind.

315
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,540
You made sure of that.

316
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,740
Keep one thing in mind.

317
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,810
If you kill me,

318
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,210
would I go down alone?

319
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,280
I'll drag you down with me,
so be prepared.

320
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,900
You really said that?

321
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,800
Aren't you going a bit too far?

322
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,630
I had no choice.

323
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,100
Pleading doesn't work on him.

324
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,370
Nothing works on him.

325
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,780
Did you find anything on him?

326
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,450
He cleaned up so well
that I can't find anything.

327
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,020
He must handle Min Doo Sik's slush fund
and secret ledgers.

328
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,190
It's not like we can
break into his place...

329
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,190
and steal whatever ledgers he has.

330
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,160
He'll expose who I am pretty soon.

331
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,860
I know how impatient he is.

332
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,730
We must get something on him before then.

333
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,540
Did Min Soo Jung save your lives
at the board meeting this time?

334
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,110
Yes, but it won't last long.

335
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,240
They'll do whatever they can
to fire Director Moon.

336
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,340
Try to stall that.

337
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,480
I promise to find something
on Kim Sun Jae.

338
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,920
If he thinks he's great,

339
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,950
well, I'm Stella Jang, who is greater.

340
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,790
I'll gladly take him on.

341
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,230
It's okay. I don't need to eat.

342
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,400
It's not okay at all.

343
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,970
We live together, and it's not right
to leave you out.

344
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,270
That's not nice.

345
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,410
Someone is channeling
Mother Theresa and the Pope.

346
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,440
We provide food and fruit.
He's more of a boss than a tenant.

347
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,050
Not again. I told you to be nice.

348
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,650
What if you end up
suffering in the afterlife?

349
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,720
You're in a better mood today.

350
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,790
Me?

351
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,450
Well,

352
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,860
my husband talked me out of it.

353
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,890
He's kind of sweet.

354
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,030
"Kind of?"

355
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,830
I deserve a Nobel Prize
for being the most doting husband.

356
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,630
Sir.

357
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,070
Can I ask you something?

358
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,870
Ask or not, whatever you want.

359
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,810
Okay, then...

360
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,740
The collateral people give you
in return for a loan.

361
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,050
What happens
if the borrower dies before they...

362
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,620
manage to pay off the debt?

363
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,490
- Then...
- He keeps the collateral.

364
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,920
They're all in that room.

365
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,630
What if the debtor's family comes
and asks you to return the collateral?

366
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,390
- Then...
- If they pay in full,

367
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,660
including compound interest,
they get it back.

368
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,560
Not again!

369
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,170
Are you my spokesperson?

370
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,100
Why do you interrupt? What do you know?

371
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,110
I wanted to save you the energy.

372
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,370
I'm fine.

373
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,410
Not speaking is much harder for me.

374
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,310
There's one thing I will never return,
even if they pay interest...

375
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,720
on top of compound interest.

376
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,850
The rest, I'll return when I'm paid.

377
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,490
There's just one?

378
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
Whose collateral is that?

379
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,360
Doeun Industries' CEO
Han Kyung Soo's collateral.

380
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,530
Why won't you return his collateral?

381
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,830
Because...

382
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,840
Why do you ask so many questions?

383
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,510
What I say goes.

384
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,580
Get me some sikhye
with extra floating rice.

385
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,950
You know I hate it when the rice sinks,
don't you, my queen?

386
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

387
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,250
Director. We'll go out
to see our suppliers.

388
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Okay. Stay safe.

389
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,700
We have to cover
a long distance today. Could we...

390
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,700
Sure. You can go straight home
when you're done.

391
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Yes. Thank you.

392
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,840
We're off, then.

393
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,040
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

394
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
What now?

395
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,580
"What now?"

396
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,920
You're so calm, it's almost shameless.

397
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,220
The crisis is averted?

398
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,260
You're in charge of the team
that messed up,

399
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,090
and you don't care
as long as you can stay?

400
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,770
The subordinates who just left
don't deserve this treatment.

401
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,870
Don't worry about my team.

402
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,870
Worry about your own tasks.

403
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,370
Do you really not know why I'm like this,

404
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,140
or are you trying to ignore it?

405
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,810
Most people would resign
in this situation.

406
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,950
It's obvious your team
will be dismantled if you stay.

407
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,850
Shouldn't you show
some kind of responsibility?

408
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,050
Are you saying you think...

409
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,890
I should resign?

410
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,990
That's the best solution.

411
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,390
I don't know who that's best for,

412
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,200
but I have no intention of quitting.

413
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,610
You're the shameless one.

414
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,010
You sabotaged the deal
so our partners would go elsewhere.

415
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,090
You don't seem to care
because there's no proof.

416
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,120
I should do the same.

417
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,790
I don't have to be intimidated.

418
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,830
You think I can't expose you...

419
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,900
because I don't have proof?

420
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,940
And that's why you talk back so freely?

421
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,510
Baek Sul Hee.

422
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,810
You got me very wrong.

423
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,080
Have a coffee.

424
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,850
My gosh.

425
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,060
Thanks a lot. This cheers me up.

426
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,430
Hey, where's mine?

427
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,700
You can have this one.

428
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,570
Is there something between you two?

429
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,410
What do you mean?

430
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,380
I have a good hunch.

431
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,840
There's something here.

432
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,410
There isn't, so get to work.

433
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,890
It's hot.

434
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,590
Darn it.

435
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,390
(Lawyer Kim Sun Jae)

436
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,630
Come to the second floor.

437
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,530
Even without proof,

438
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,300
I'll get people to believe
you're Baek Sul Hee.

439
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,440
How much do you trust me?

440
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,310
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

441
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,680
I asked you the same thing four years ago.

442
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,580
You might not remember.

443
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,950
When I asked, you said
you didn't even trust yourself.

444
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,180
What are you trying to say?

445
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,120
Come to the second floor
exactly ten minutes from now.

446
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,790
Then decide whether or not to trust me.

447
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,710
Our CEO will join us in ten minutes.

448
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,740
And I'll reveal you're Baek Sul Hee,
not Jung Lucia.

449
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,950
Let's fight.

450
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,920
My daughter Mi So.

451
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,160
Do you know what her goal was?

452
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,990
A lawyer.

453
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,100
She wanted to be a lawyer.

454
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,030
She was like her father.

455
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,000
Is that why they say
blood is thicker than water?

456
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,240
What are you talking about?

457
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,540
Do you mean...

458
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,410
your daughter was mine?

459
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,220
If I find out you're lying, I'll kill you.

460
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,120
Tell the truth.

461
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,760
Was she really mine?

462
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,460
Was she?

463
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,840
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)
