00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,750
(Episode 1)

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,290
There's nothing in here.

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,790
Hey. What is this?

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,830
(Miso Snack Bar)

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,060
Pick it up.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,700
What?

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,100
What are you staring at?

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,270
Pick it up. Come on.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,540
- My goodness.
- Pick it up.

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,210
- Why the glare?
- Those brats...

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,910
- Hey.
- Girls.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,750
What are you doing over there?
What's going on?

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,550
Stay out of it and go on your way, lady.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,660
What kind of situation is this?

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,060
One, two, three. The three of you
are bullying this one girl?

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,030
My word. You're really crass and cowardly.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,640
Why do you care?

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,470
Give me a second.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,840
Hello.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,010
How was the cheonggukjang?
I hope you liked it.

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,680
Your food never disappoints.

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,390
Our patrol unit's a regular for a reason.

23
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,320
The kimchijeon you gave us for free
was awesome too.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,590
I'm glad to hear that.

25
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,590
The bullies...

26
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,700
you caught in an alley
harassing a fellow student.

27
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,300
Didn't you send them all
to juvenile detention?

28
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,870
I just found
another group of girls who could do...

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,770
with a lecture from you, Officer Choi.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Is that so?

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,770
Put them on.

32
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,840
Hang on.

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,910
Ta-da. Here. Do you see them?

34
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,240
Here they are. Do you see them?

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,910
Do you see their faces?

36
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,980
They're running away.

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,150
Officer Choi!
Do you see their back profile?

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,590
My gosh.

39
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,860
Thanks a lot, Officer Choi.

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,500
Oh, dear. Look at the mess.

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,030
Are you okay?

42
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,070
- You're fine?
- Yes.

43
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,700
Goodness.

44
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,340
Here.

45
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,340
Thank you.

46
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,250
Just a moment.

47
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,790
Miso Snack Bar is
by the three-way junction.

48
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,590
We sell all kinds of food,
not just snacks.

49
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,790
Order whatever you want.

50
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,360
They won't charge you
if you say I sent you over,

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,060
so don't worry, okay?

52
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,760
Go on.

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,460
Thank you.

54
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,570
Don't let anyone hit you.

55
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,940
It would break your mom's heart
if she knew.

56
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,470
Oh, dear.

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,680
Hello, sweetie.

58
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,980
Can you find your way, Madam Baek?

59
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,320
I can find it with my eyes closed.
Semyung International High School.

60
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,420
I'll be on time. Don't worry.

61
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,120
Okay. See you later.

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,390
I love you, you love me, only you.

63
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,360
Mom loves you, you love me, only you.

64
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,570
See you soon.

65
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,300
Bye.

66
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,870
It's almost impossible to get into...

67
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,210
an international high school
without extra tutoring or classes.

68
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,310
An early admission during the semester...

69
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,420
is even rarer.

70
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,650
Mi So is a rare case in every aspect.

71
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,550
You must have taught your daughter well.

72
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,320
No.

73
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,020
I didn't do anything at all.

74
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,930
She does everything on her own just fine.

75
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,730
I didn't have to do much.

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,600
I see.

77
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,740
May I ask what your husband does?

78
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,270
Well...

79
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,040
I don't have a dad.

80
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,410
My mom raised me on her own.

81
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,150
She had me and raised me without a dad,

82
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,250
but she did enough for both parents.

83
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,660
How can you say such things so freely?

84
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,360
Like what?

85
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,630
About you being a single parent?

86
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,100
It's a fact that I'm a single mom's kid.

87
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,140
Are you proud of that?

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,140
I shouldn't be ashamed either.

89
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,340
You worked so hard to raise me.

90
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,480
Do you expect me
to feel inferior about it?

91
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,480
Mi So.

92
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,420
People in general don't think like you.

93
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,260
What can they say if I'm okay with it?

94
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,590
Tell others to worry about themselves
if they have time to kill.

95
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,960
Why pity me when I'm happy and proud?

96
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,630
That's called being nosy.

97
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,900
I don't know whose kid you are,
but you're so smart.

98
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,270
I wonder whose kid I am.

99
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,710
A mom with a kid like me
would feel so proud.

100
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,940
Come here.

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,150
What about after that?

102
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,380
After that,
I'll play a video game with Bo Ram.

103
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,050
- What? You little...
- Can't I? Come on.

104
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,390
Try it on.

105
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,360
- Forget it. Let's go.
- No.

106
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,600
Stop staring at it every time we walk by.
Just try it on.

107
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,900
No, thanks.

108
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,000
- Let's go.
- Wait.

109
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm not interested.

110
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,870
How are you so strong?

111
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,070
- Try it on.
- It's fine.

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,680
It's totally your style, Madam Baek.

113
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,890
Is it?

114
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,090
I like the design.

115
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,490
It's a nice color too.

116
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,190
How much is it?

117
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,690
(220 dollars)

118
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,670
Take the plunge and buy it.

119
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,370
Pay it over a few months.

120
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,970
No, thanks.
What about your college tuition?

121
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,040
I opened another savings account.

122
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,910
All that's left to do is save up.

123
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,680
Hi, Yeon Ah.

124
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,120
No, I'm almost there.

125
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,950
See you soon.

126
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,690
- I guess things are getting busy.
- Okay.

127
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,900
Now, I'm thinking I don't like
the color or design that much.

128
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,100
Let's forget it.

129
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,710
- Ma'am.
- What?

130
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,110
Don't you dare sell that dress.

131
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,280
I'll buy it when I get paid.

132
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,550
When will that be?
I need a deadline to hold it for you.

133
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,080
Next Saturday.

134
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,590
It's my mom's birthday.

135
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,190
- She's here.
- There she is.

136
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,160
Congratulations, Ms. Min.

137
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,200
This year again, female college students
named you as their favorite role model...

138
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,970
and their dream mentor.

139
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,040
That's two titles under your belt.

140
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,270
How many times has this happened?

141
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,470
Is this the third consecutive year?

142
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,280
I'm flattered
to receive this award every year.

143
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,080
Are you aware you have an online fan club?

144
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,050
I heard about that, but I've been too busy
to check it out myself.

145
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,190
Not only are you beautiful,
but you're also incredibly talented.

146
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,260
That's why you're a role model
for college students.

147
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,460
What would you say
to the people watching this stream?

148
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,730
As the only female CEO in distribution,

149
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,730
I look forward to seeing women
who are currently studying...

150
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,230
become my competitors.

151
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,040
My field is heavily male-dominated,
as you know.

152
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,610
I can't stand her.

153
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,880
I love children...

154
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,880
and wonder what it would be like
to be a mom.

155
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,380
Unfortunately, though,
I have no plans just yet.

156
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,150
- Who is she?
- Who do you want to share...

157
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,950
- Is she an actress?
- this happy moment with?

158
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,420
She sparkles from head to toe.

159
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,060
What are your plans for the future?

160
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,730
We plan to focus on our online...

161
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,770
(Miso Snack Bar)

162
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,210
Okay.

163
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,250
Let's go.

164
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,320
Hey.

165
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,930
Cutie, you can't die on me now.

166
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,400
Oh, come on.

167
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,670
Take me back to my neighborhood at least.

168
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,800
I can't do anything out here.

169
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,410
Oh, she's running.

170
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,650
Sorry.

171
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,060
This place is a mess.

172
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,700
Goodness.

173
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,270
We'll never make a living at this rate.

174
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,470
The regular sale just ended.

175
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,210
So what? We should just close up?

176
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,310
We only have customers
a few days a year when we go on sale?

177
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,880
Where's the general manager?

178
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,050
I don't know.

179
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,120
Oh, there he is.

180
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,890
Hello.

181
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Do you worry that
I might have low blood pressure?

182

What do you think the store looks like?

184
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,300
What? Well...

185
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,600
It's nice and quiet.

186
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,600
It's nice and quiet?

187
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,640
It should be crowded with customers.

188
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,840
This is a store, not a temple!

189
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,810
Don't you see there are...

190
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,880
more staff than customers?

191
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,020
You fool.

192
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,960
I can't believe
you think you can sell this.

193
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,390
Why you... What is wrong with you?

194
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,900
Didn't I tell you to check the produce
and seafood twice a day?

195
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,630
I have employees to do that.

196
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,540
Don't leave it to them. You do it.

197
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,370
Don't delegate. Do it yourself!

198
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,640
- You little...
- No, don't!

199
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,410
I want a detailed sales report.

200
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,710
Darn you.

201
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,650

You call this sales?

206
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,170

You know it's not just us.

208
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,340
Will you die too if our competitor dies?

209
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,110
Whatever happens to others,
you should think of how to survive.

210
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,540
You took the CEO position
without that kind of determination?

211
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,210
We're looking for a solution.

212
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,550
The online business
will make up for this loss...

213
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,150
and help our offline stores.

214
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,620
It's better not to get into a losing game.

215
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,860
We are behind our competitors,

216
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,620
but we still have a chance if we use that.

217
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,860
We can merge the pros of social commerce
and an open market...

218
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,760
with a new online platform...

219
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,200
and set up a unique sales strategy.

220
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,170
No one knows the distribution industry
as well as Mingang.

221
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,840
Why haven't we heard from Moon Tae Kyung?

222
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,780
He should drop everything
to rush over when I call.

223
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,240
This was your idea, Kyung Chae.

224
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,680
You wanted to leave the new business
to a management specialist,

225
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,650
and you said he was the right guy.

226
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,150
He'll be in touch.

227
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,020
We offered him a good deal.

228
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,460
He needs time to consider his options.

229
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
I told you to give him a blank check.

230
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,830
No one can refuse a fortune.

231
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,260
He makes more than anyone
at the US head office.

232
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,560
He won't move for money.

233
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,830
You don't know what you're talking about.

234
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,670
Rich people like money even more.

235
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,370
What about our father?

236
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,340
Does he put money before anything else
because he's a poor...

237
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,570
Darn you.

238
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,240
Get out!

239
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980

How are things?

243
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,490
What does Legal say?

244
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,900
We took care of all the legal matters
regarding the new e-commerce business.

245
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,200
Don't worry, sir.

246

kidnap them if you must.

248

I'm watching you.

249
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,140
Which of you
will manage to bring him to me first?

250
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,960
That Moon Tae Kyung guy.

251
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,460
He said he'd consider
our offer positively, right?

252
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,790
Yes. I heard so from someone close to him.

253
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,100
When he quit his previous US job,

254
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,830
he said he'd return to Korea
to work at a distribution company.

255
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,800
And he hasn't called us yet?

256
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,900
What's he thinking?

257
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,540
We're looking into him.

258
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,510
He'll be doing the same with us.

259
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,680
If you're right
that he doesn't move for money,

260
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,080
he must have a criterion that isn't money.

261
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,120
He'll want to see if we're a good match.

262
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,590

so Soo Jung doesn't get to him first.

anything noteworthy so far.

266

I hope she settles down in the US.

267

and got kicked out of Canada.

- Ta-da.
- It looks amazing.

accepted you,

I log enough school days.

I could study what I wanted in class.

No, thanks.

I'm dead pleased.

296
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,850
To be honest, you didn't study hard
because you knew your IQ made up for it.

than it is to study.

I told everyone to come home for dinner
unless it was unavoidable.

305

A family must eat together

309
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,960
She's secretive.

You don't have to draw the line.

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,960
I know you're loyal to my sister.

319
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,100
Because she's my superior.

320
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,600
She's not just your superior.

321
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,470
She's your woman too.

322

Oh, is it still wishful thinking
on your part?

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,040
Do you know...

324
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,680
my sister, CEO Min Kyung Chae,
is a very scary person?

What do you want?

328
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,420
I want to handle the e-commerce business,

329
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,490
which is why...

330
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,530
I need to reach Moon Tae Kyung
before Kyung Chae does.

00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,210
Why shouldn't you do that?

I don't care what happens.

338
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,390
I signed the form because you begged.

339
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,360
You just have to go on
pretending to be clueless.

340
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,030
What if you get caught?

Your mom zooms around ten times a day.

342
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,530
I won't get caught.

343
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,040
She'll never deliver your food
to a coffee shop.

344
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,600
I guess not?

345
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,510
Is the job manageable?

346
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,040
- Yes. It's fun.
- Goodness.

347
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,850
My gosh.

348
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,110
This darn scooter.

349
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,550
I had to push it uphill
from the crossroads.

350
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,090
Oh, no. The scooter's acting up again?

351
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,360
You shouldn't have bought it second-hand.

352
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,230
You could get into a bad accident.

353
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,030
I'll coax it well
so it lasts until the end of the month.

354
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,360
I'll get one next month.

355
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,130
When there's a scooter sale.

356
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,700
My gosh.

357
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,340
You got off school already?

358
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,470
Yes.

359
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,070
My homeroom teacher said I could leave
since he'd taken attendance already.

360
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,980
- I'm off to study now.
- Okay.

361
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,110
Don't tell.

362
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,590
- Study hard.
- Okay.

363
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,620
My arm is so sore.

364
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,260
Welcome.

365
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,530
What can I get you?

366
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,970
An iced Americano and a latte.

367
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,370
- For here?
- Yes.

368
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,340
(The Bank of Korea, 10 Dollars)

369
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,740
Those fools should pay me back on time
if they borrowed my money.

370
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,810
Small amounts add up to large amounts.

371
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,220
They bow and beg when they borrow
but act all haughty when their time is up.

372
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,780
They have no conscience.

373
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,590
Can you really criticize others
for having no conscience?

374
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,020
You make them pay you interest in advance.

375
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,890
That's as nonsensical as saying
a starfish dances the jitterbug.

376
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,830
I have a great deal of conscience.

377
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,300
Way too much which is why I'm so generous.

378
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,030
I saved countless penniless people
who were dying.

379
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,830
They couldn't afford treatment,
had to drop school,

380
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,400
and lost all lifelines
when their business failed.

381
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,110
My money served them
as a life-saving oxygen mask.

382
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,370
You don't know anything.

383
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,610
There you go again.

384
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,880
You make it sound like
you lend money for free.

385
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,550
People don't know it,

386
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,850
but private loans are
the most humane business there is.

387
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,550
Iron them properly! Put your soul into it.

388
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,320
You do it, then.

389
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,620
You make me do this every single day.

390
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,190
Yang Mal Sook. You should value money.

391
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,200
We should bow to it once a day.

392
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,970
"Thank you. I adore you."

393
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,400
Money is the only reason
our daughter married a chairman's son.

394
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,370
I haven't heard from Ja Kyung today.

395
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,310
Pick it up.

396
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,680
Hi, Ja Kyung.

397
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,250
My dear sparkling daughter.

398
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,420
I can't stand it anymore, Dad.

399
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,620
What is it now?

400
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,460
What do you think it is?

401
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,820
My father-in-law torments my husband.

402
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,490
I can't explain over the phone.

403
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,830
Not today. I'll come by tomorrow.

404
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,500
Okay. Come and vent to me.

405
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,270
I'll listen to whatever it is
that you have to say.

406
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,200
See you tomorrow.

407
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,980
I wonder why he bullies his son so much.

408
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,710
Ji Seop got chewed out by his dad again?

409
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,780
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

410
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,890
It's a college-level essay.

411
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,160
You call this a business proposal?

412
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,170
Redo it.

413
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,240
Ms. Min.

414
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,670
Do you even know
what version number this is?

415
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,140
If you don't want to do it,

416
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,840
stay away from the new business.

417
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,780
What do I have to approve by today?

418
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,620
Why are you still here, Director Min?
Get back to work.

419
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,130
Moon Tae Kyung flies in tomorrow.

420
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,730
I checked the passenger list.

421
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,310
He flies in tomorrow.

422
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,580
You did very well.

423
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,690
Be sure to keep my sister out of it.

424
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,260
I told you...

425
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,360
you were in the gray area.

426
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,240
I don't care that you overrate my sister,

427
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,200
but don't underestimate me.

428
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,670
If I set my mind to it, you're nothing...

429
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,770
Is that a threat?

430
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,340
I'm politely...

431
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,410
asking you for a favor.

432
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,710
So?

433
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,420
When is he flying in?

434
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,610
Hello?

435
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,480
Yes. I'm on the plane.

436
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,680
The plane has Wi-Fi.

437
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,850
My family will faint with shock
to hear I got expelled...

438
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,590
and flew in without telling them.

439
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,190
Especially my dad.

440
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,160
He'll string me up and kill me.

441
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,230
Oh, I don't know.

442
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,900
I'll see what happens. Who cares?

443
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,710
I hope my oldest sister will help me out.

444
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,580
I have her wrapped around
my little finger.

445
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,680
I've had enough of...

446
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,550
It's best to keep this turned off
for everyone's safety.

447
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,820
Have you lost your mind?

448
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,960
Give it back right away.

449
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,930
Should I call a flight attendant?

450
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,060
Or the captain?

451
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,460
Will you talk to them?

452
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,800
You look like a student.

453
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,140
Isn't business class a bit too much?

454
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,810
You should be glad
if you can even afford an economy seat.

455
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,410
Why do you care whether I fly business
or a dusty old broomstick?

456
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,150
It's none of your business.

457
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,320
You're the one dressed like a pauper.

458
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
What?

459
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,220
Excuse me.

460
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,590
I collected my hard-earned miles...

461
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,290
and got a free upgrade.

462
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,660
Mr. Pauper.

463
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,270
I paid for the ticket, so stay out of it.

464
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,570
No, it can't be your money.

465
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,800
It's your parents' money.

466
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,000
Fortunately for you, you were just...

467
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,540
born to really rich parents. Right?

468
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,710
Do you think...

469
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,540
it's easy to be that fortunate
and have rich parents?

470
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,310
Good point.

471
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,980
You look like
you were sent abroad to study...

472
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,190
but are coming back
after getting expelled.

473
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,460
Don't people say they hate you?

474
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,290
You don't know me.

475
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,930
I'm showing concern...

476
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,360
for a business-class neighbor.

477
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,500
We're neighbors?

478
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,400
I mind who I hang out with.

479
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,970
You're a nobody.

480
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,170
I'm a...

481
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,240
Gosh, that hurt. I feel almost dizzy.

482
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,940
Do you think you'll get arrested
for being polite?

483
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,840
You should have character.

484
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,940
Shut up!

485
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,550
Mind your own character.
I can't stand you.

486
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,680
You didn't have to shout.

487
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,250
Darn you.

488
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,430

489
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,160

(Welcome, General Manager Moon Tae Kyung)

491
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,130
You need something like this.

492
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,600
What are you doing here?

493
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,270
You look surprised.

494
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,440
What you know isn't a national secret.

495
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,740
Who told you?

496
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
Does that matter?

497
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,010
Well...

498
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,720
What you know and will know in the future.

499
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,320
I know too, and I'll hear all about it.
Is that a good enough answer?

500
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,460
If you get to him first and win him over,

501
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,930
do you think you can handle
the new business?

502
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,730
I know how you do things.

503
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,560
You resort to crass, dirty tricks.

504
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,770
Aren't you just as crass and dirty?

505
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,100
Why are you scouting him in secret?

506
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,110
You can't stand the idea
of the chairman acknowledging me.

The honor always has to be yours,

508
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,910
and I have to watch from a corner.

509

That's the picture you want.

510
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,220
But sorry.

511
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,320
I'm just as competitive as someone else.

We're sisters, and we're a lot alike.

513

Oh, right. We're half-sisters.

514
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,130
Do you want to pull out my hair?

515
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,970
That would be hilarious.

516
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,540
Save that for a dark alley,
not a bright airport.

You'll suffer a huge fall one day

519

As the mistress' daughter?

520
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,850

Goodness.

What is she doing here? That was so close.

540
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,460
Hello.

541
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,330
I'm looking for Jo Pil Doo who lived here.

542
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,800
I don't know that name.

543
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,300
I just...

544
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,270
I heard he moved here.

545
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,510
Do you know a Jo Pil Doo?

546
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,510
Jo Pil Doo?

547
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,150
Never heard of him.

548
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
Okay, thanks.

549
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,590
Oh, no.

550
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,820
What's going on?

551
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,290
Not again, Cutie.

552
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,230
Hey.

553
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,970
Don't do this, Cutie.

554
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,580
Stop!

(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

556
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,780
I've never seen Mom in my lifetime.

557
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,240
I don't even know what she looks like.

558
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,510
Do you know how lonely that makes me feel?

559
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,020
Lawyer Kim, you have many talents.

560
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,920
You did it once. You can do it twice.

561
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,090
You want me to be a double agent?

562
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,660
How do you think Soo Jung knew?

563
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,820
Who told her to be at the airport?

564
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,760
- Did you find them?
- I did find them.

565
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,460
He was looking for someone else.

566
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,730
Who?
