1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,780
(20 years ago)

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,150
(Ambulance)

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,260
- There's an accident up ahead.
- Really?

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,330
Yes.

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,830
I need to go check it out.

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,070
Ma'am, could you please watch
the baby for a moment?

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,440
- Of course.
- Okay.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,620
Sweetie, what's wrong?

9
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,720
Sweetie!

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,560
Why aren't you breathing?
Sweetie, no.

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,960
You can't do this. Come on.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,430
If something happens to you,
what about your mother?

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,870
Please, just breathe. Please?

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,010
Your mother can't live
if something happens to you.

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,210
Sweetie. I won't be able to live either.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,210
Please... Hey, someone...

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,640
(Episode 106)

18
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,910
- Is she in a coma?
- Yes, the adult is.

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,450
- Prep her vitals, stat.
- Yes.

20
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,820
(Paramedic)

21
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,460
Ma'am!

22
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,260
The medical staff is waiting.
Please go straight to the ER.

23
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,400
Hey, ma'am!

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,000
We're at the hospital.
Where are you going?

25
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,640
My baby is fine now,
so we'll just be going.

26
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,180
Ma'am!

27
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,880
Are you sure she's okay?

28
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,610
- Let me just check...
- I said she was fine!

29
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,880
The baby's mother is waiting,
so we have to go.

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,750
Hey, ma'am!

31
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,260
She received emergency treatment
at the hospital,

32
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,100
and she was fine right away.

33
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,000
Look, Ms. Kyung Chae.
She's a beautiful little princess.

34
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,540
You scared Mommy.

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,840
I thought I was going to lose you.

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,410
I was worried sick waiting for you.

37
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,020
If anything had happened to you,
I wouldn't have been able to go on.

38
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,290
After everything I went through
to have you...

39
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,590
How could I ever live without you?

40
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,360
That incident...

41
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,500
I had completely forgotten about it.

42
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,500
Why is that day coming back to me now?

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,640
This can't be happening.

44
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,580
Why is something from 20 years ago
surfacing now of all times?

45
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,610
I erased that from my memory.

46
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,950
What am I supposed to do now
that it's all coming back?

47
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,890
Then...

48
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,500
the baby's mother from that day...

49
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,560
is Madam Jung?

50
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,270
How can this be...

51
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,040
How...

52
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,440
Ms. Kyung Chae...

53
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,550
What am I going to do now?

54
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,920
The baby's mother
from that day is Madam Jung,

55
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,160
and Se Ri is her daughter...

56
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,930
How could a mother and daughter...

57
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,670
come full circle
and end up in the same house,

58
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,630
living as mother and daughter again?

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,240
It's unbelievable.

60
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,010
How could something like this
possibly happen?

61
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,740
How could this happen?

62
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,780
How?

63
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,550
Then...

64
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,520
What happened to
Ms. Kyung Chae's real daughter?

65
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,660
Back then, I'm sure...

66
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,850
Ms. Kyung Chae's real daughter
must have died that day.

67
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,620
Don't tell me...

68
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,560
she survived, and that woman raised her,
thinking she was her own child?

69
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,660
That can't be. Right?

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,000
If that were true, there's no way
she'd pretend she never had a child.

71
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,860
That can't be, right? It can't be.

72
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,800
What in the world is going on?

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,700
But still,

74
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,470
how could a birth mother and daughter...

75
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,170
end up in the same house, of all places...

76
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,010
How could this happen...

77
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,190
If Ms. Kyung Chae finds out the truth...

78
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,790
No!

79
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,290
No!

80
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,340
I looked into it,

81
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,710
and Lawyer Kim didn't come in
to work today either.

82
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,440
He must be in deep shock.

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,640
But so what? Business is business,
and personal is personal.

84
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,510
What's business and what's personal here?

85
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,490
He's useful when we're teaming up
to take over Mingang Distribution.

86
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,660
But he's someone to watch out for
and can't be Se Ri's stepfather.

87
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,190
Then, who do you think would be
a good stepfather for Se Ri?

88
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,330
Well...

89
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,600
If I had to pick from people around us...

90
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,770
Moon Tae Kyung?

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,700
I'd be okay with someone like him.

92
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,610
If you know he's a good person,
why do you give him such a hard time?

93
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,270
I told you that
we were on different paths.

94
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,480
If someone gets in my way,

95
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,350
I have to cut them loose,
even if they're good.

96
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,650
What else can I do?

97
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,490
Since you can probably guess
what I'm about to ask,

98
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,420
it makes it even harder to bring it up.

99
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,890
Since I'm the one
by my mother's side right now,

100
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,490
you want to know what my mother
and CEO Min are plotting,

101
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,500
and what their next moves will be.

102
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,400
You want me to tip you off. Is that it?

103
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,640
I'm sorry.
I know that for you, Tae Joo,

104
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,840
- it means betraying someone you care for.
- I'll do it.

105
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,240
I don't want my mother to commit
an even greater sin.

106
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,010
Thank you, Tae Joo.

107
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,610
So, what's the first thing I need to do?

108
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,080
Chairman Min Doo Sik.

109
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,620
I need you to find out
where he is right now.

110
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,860
By the way, Mother,

111
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,190
where do you suppose
Chairman Min is right now?

112
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,460
I don't know. He's likely fine somewhere.

113
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,760
Why do you ask?

114
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,400
You need to know as well.

115
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,570
We'd be in trouble if Lawyer Kim acted out
and caused trouble.

116
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,410
- Did Kim Sun Jae cause trouble?
- Just think about it.

117
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,580
He feels so betrayed by you and CEO Min
that he's skipping work without a word.

118
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,710
What if he decides
to sabotage everything...

119
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,810
and leaks Chairman Min's location
to the other side?

120
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,150
You have a point.

121
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,990
I wouldn't put it past a guy
like Kim Sun Jae.

122
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,420
Wait a minute. Then what should we do?

123
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,360
Should I ask CEO Min where Min Doo Sik is?

124
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,870
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

125
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,940
What? Did this old hound
suddenly become useful to you?

126
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,950
Now that I know how you really see me,
Min Kyung Chae,

127
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,990
I won't fall for your tricks anymore.

128
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,270
Why is Manager Gong here at this hour?

129
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,140
What is with her?

130
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,370
What am I going to do?

131
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,550
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

132
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,220
Please forgive me.

133
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,330
Please forgive me.

134
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,530
Are you crazy?

135
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,570
What do you think you're doing
going in there?

136
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,270
Manager Gong, what's wrong?

137
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,310
Let go of me!

138
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
Just let me die.

139
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,010
Ms. Kyung Chae and Se Ri will only be safe
if I'm dead and gone.

140
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,110
Stop it and just talk to me.

141
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,850
Please forgive me.

142
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm so scared.

143
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,760
How could this be happening
unless the skies are angry?

144
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,900
For something that happened 20 years ago
to come back around like this...

145
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,300
Come on, just say something
that makes sense!

146
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,140
No, I can't! I absolutely can't!

147
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
How can I say...

148
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,410
I switched the two babies
with my own two hands?

149
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,080
How can I say it? I'll never be able to!

150
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,610
I never can!

151
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,590
If I just die and disappear,
this will all be buried with me.

152
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,330
I have to die.
I have to die and disappear.

153
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,630
You want to die that badly?

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,860
Then fine, die! Come on!

155
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,070
- Please, spare me!
- Go and die!

156
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,870
- Please, spare me!
- Die!

157
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,440
Please, spare me.

158
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,440
I had forgotten all about it.

159
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,810
I had truly forgotten about it.

160
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,580
For 20 years,

161
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,380
it never once crossed my mind that
Se Ri wasn't Ms. Kyung Chae's daughter.

162
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,750
Not even once. It never crossed my mind.

163
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,720
So what do you want me to do now
after all this time?

164
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,220
I've been lying to myself this whole time.

165
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,060
I completely blocked it out.
So what am I supposed to do now?

166
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,300
Please, let me live!

167
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,870
Please, spare me...

168
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,240
I'll let you live,

169
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,110
so tell me the truth.
Don't leave a single thing out.

170
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,410
Or else, forget Min Kyung Chae.
I'll deal with you myself, right now.

171
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,320
Even if I don't kill you right now,
there are countless other ways to get you.

172
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,120
You know I'm a lawyer, right?

173
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,820
And you know what will happen...

174
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,520
if I use the full force
of the law against you.

175
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,290
So spill it while I'm still being nice.

176
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,870
(Jinwon Genetic Research Institute)

177
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,490
They are confirmed to be
biologically related?

178
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,060
Whose results are these?

179
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,830
Lucia and Ms. Se Ri.

180
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,430
What did you just say?

181
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,210
Please, let me live!

182
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,440
Please, let me live!

183
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,580
Did you come all the way here
just for that?

184
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,750
You could have just called.

185
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,550
I wanted to see you too while I was at it.

186
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,820
Anyway, where's Chairman Min?

187
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,390
He's at Hanmyeong Hospital.

188
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,830
I know a doctor in the VIP Ward there,

189
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,190
and the nurses are all aware
of our situation.

190
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,100
I'll let them know
you have clearance to visit.

191
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,970
I'd appreciate that.

192
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,570
By the way, I heard Kim Sun Jae
didn't show up for work again today.

193
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,510
Forget work.
He's not even answering my calls.

194
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,840
If he keeps missing work,
shouldn't you fire him?

195
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,950
I told you
lawyers like him were a dime a dozen.

196
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,350
I know many people who can support you.

197
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,080
You know how well-connected I am, right?

198
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,620
I know. You're a woman of many talents.

199
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,690
Still, I should give him
a little more time.

200
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,990
He's not the type to take it lying down
if I fire him.

201
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,100
You filed Chairman Min
and Lucia's divorce document, right?

202
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,300
Of course.

203
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,700
They should have been filed by now.

204
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,700
So, does that make it final right away?

205
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,600
I'm sure it'll take some time to process.

206
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,170
Are you leaving already?

207
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,340
Let's get together with Se Ri soon.

208
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,280
I miss her already.

209
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,450
Blood is thicker than water.

210
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,520
Just let me know when and where,
and I'll bring her.

211
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,160
Take me to Hanmyeong Hospital.

212
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,760
I need to see for myself
what that old geezer is up to.

213
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Yes, ma'am.

214
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,220
So the girl who jumped from the roof
that day...

215
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,450
was Min Kyung Chae's daughter.

216
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,620
So in the end, she devoured her own child
with her own two hands?

217
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,060
And Baek Sul Hee has no idea
she's seeking revenge for the wrong kid.

218
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,260
What an absolute mess. Unbelievable.

219
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,570
Wait a minute.

220
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,370
If Se Ri is Baek Sul Hee's daughter,

221
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,140
then that means she's my daughter.

222
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,140
Then, if Se Ri succeeds Min Kyung Chae
as chairman,

223
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,450
my own bloodline will be in control
of Mingang...

224
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,490
This is how it's all playing out?

225
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,520
Is this really happening?

226
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,300
Mingang will finally be mine!

227
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,890
You poor thing.

228
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,800
A once-mighty tycoon
who dominated the business world...

229
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,900
is lying here like a living corpse...

230
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,200
hidden where your own kids
can't find you. How pitiful.

231
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,940
You're as good as blind
with your eyes wide open.

232
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,980
That's why you should've had
a kinder heart.

233
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,910
Let's be honest.

234
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,720
Think of all the sins you've committed,
haven't you?

235
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,080
How did she know I was here?

236
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,990
Well, Chairman Min Doo Sik.

237
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,420
You don't recognize me?

238
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,630
People say...

239
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,160
I look a lot like my son.

240
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,570
You're not very observant, are you?

241
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,730
Twenty years ago,

242
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,740
the man Min Kyung Chae dated
in the States,

243
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,210
Jung Ho Se...

244
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,140
was my son.

245
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,110
Then you must be that punk's...

246
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,610
That's right.

247
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,980
To put it in your words,

248
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,190
I'm that scumbag's mother.

249
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,420
If you hadn't killed my son
and made it look like a car accident,

250
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,090
we wouldn't have ended up
in this twisted fate.

251
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,770
But guess what?

252
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,300
Se Ri turns out to be
my son's flesh and blood.

253
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,240
I guess that makes me...

254
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,140
her grandmother.

255
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,790
Manager Gong!

256
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,630
Where have you been all day?
I was so worried about you.

257
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,330
Me?

258
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,970
Of course I was worried!

259
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,170
You didn't answer your phone.

260
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,740
I was a nervous wreck,
thinking something terrible had happened.

261
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,310
But I'm just glad you're back now.

262
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,620
From now on, do exactly as I say.

263
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,660
It's the only way to save Se Ri
and yourself, Manager Gong.

264
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,430
First, you never switched
the two babies 20 years ago.

265
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,770
Se Ri is still Min Kyung Chae's daughter,
part of the Min family,

266
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,940
and the future heir
to Mingang Distribution.

267
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,940
Just as you've lived,
forget it ever happened.

268
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,910
You'll take that secret to your grave.

269
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,810
Otherwise, a lot of people will get hurt.
You know that, right?

270
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,820
Now, go home and act
like everything is normal.

271
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,790
But what about Ms. Soo Jung?

272
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,760
Don't worry about Director Min.
I'll take care of her.

273
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Se Ri.

274
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,730
No matter what anyone says,
you're Ms. Kyung Chae's daughter.

275
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,630
I'll protect that truth to my dying day.

276
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,370
You're absolutely not Lucia's daughter.

277
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,880
What were the results of the DNA test?

278
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,760
Just as you predicted,
did it confirm they're mother-daughter?

279
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,690
That whole thing already caused
a huge scene this morning.

280
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,030
I was late for work,
waiting on the results,

281
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,200
and I forgot it was the payment deadline
for our suppliers.

282
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,670
I got called into the CEO's office
over that, too.

283
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,470
My goodness, she gave me such an earful.

284
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,670
The point is,
I still don't have the results.

285
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,340
- I thought they were coming out today.
- I haven't seen them.

286
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,240
That's why
I'm going to visit the lab myself.

287
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,710
Let me go with you.

288
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,120
No. If we go together,
it'll just look suspicious.

289
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,220
And we can't have anyone finding out.
You should just stay here, Director Oh.

290
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,620
I'll go get the results and call you.

291
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,890
Okay, then please call me right away.

292
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,060
"Unwed mother Min Kyung Chae
and her illegitimate daughter, Min Se Ri."

293
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,100
I've already got reporters lined up
to make it a front-page story.

294
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,270
Where are you going, Director Min?

295
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,440
It's none of your business where I go.

296
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,080
Do I have to report my every move to you?

297
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,580
No, you don't have to report to me.

298
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,650
As long as what you're doing is legal.

299
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,190
A DNA test performed without the consent
of the parties involved...

300
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,760
is a violation
of the Bioethics and Safety Act.

301
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,960
Collecting a specimen without consent
and using the results of that test...

302
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,360
violates an individual's privacy
and personal rights.

303
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,670
Just so you know,
you can be held liable for damages.

304
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,340
How would you know that?

305
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,910
Also, please know that DNA test results
conducted without consent...

306
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,340
are also inadmissible
as evidence in court.

307
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,690
Furthermore,
the company that performed the DNA test...

308
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,520
could also face the same penalties
without proper consent.

309
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,960
I'd stay quiet if I were you.

310
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
You never know.

311
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,930
I might take pity on you,
put in a good word with the CEO,

312
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,340
and maybe even help you
keep your director position.

313
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,580
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

314
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,620
(Mingang Distribution)

315
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,720
You haven't answered my calls
or come to the office for days.

316
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
What on earth have you been doing?

317
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,860
I was thinking about the kind of person
you were, Min Kyung Chae.

318
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,330
And what you meant to me.

319
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,430
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

320
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,740
Well, you're back and in one piece,
so that's all that matters.

321
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,270
I was worried
you'd gotten into an accident.

322
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,540
- Were you worried?
- Of course I was.

323
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,210
I entrusted you with the divorce papers
for my father and Lucia.

324
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,610
You think I wouldn't be worried?

325
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,480
So that's what this was all about.

326
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,490
Right. I suppose
that's the main priority for you.

327
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,460
Don't worry.

328
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,290
I've filed the papers,

329
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,430
and the administrative procedures
will be finalized soon.

330
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
That's great to hear.

331
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,560
Once her name is off the family register,
I'll kick Lucia out of the house...

332
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,500
and finally run things my way.

333
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,340
So, are you saying Madam Jang
was at the company earlier?

334
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
It looked like she stopped by
the CEO's office.

335
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,550
It looked like Tae Joo was with her, too.

336
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,520
Actually,

337
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,180
I asked Tae Joo for a favor.

338
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,890
What did you ask Tae Joo to do?

339
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,490
Since he's Madam Jang's right-hand man,

340
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,960
I asked him to keep an eye on things
and share information with us.

341
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,530
What if something happens to Tae Joo?

342
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,330
Madam Jang is incredibly sharp.

343
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,500
That's why I told him to be careful.

344
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,270
I told him it was okay to refuse
if it was too much,

345
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,940
but he said he'd do it.

346
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,010
He said he wanted to stop
Madam Jang's rampage.

347
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,980
He really said that?

348
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,980
He even gave me a clear signal
on his way out.

349
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,480
Do you really think Tae Joo
will betray Madam Jang...

350
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,920
and come over to our side?

351
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,290
I guess we'll just have to trust him.

352
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,090
Especially if he thinks
it's for her own good.

353
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,230
Oh my. Slow down, honey.

354
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,800
You're eating like
you haven't eaten in three days.

355
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,870
I told you
I didn't even get to eat breakfast.

356
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
So that so-called Manager Gong...

357
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,440
just left for the whole day
without a single word,

358
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,610
and you've been starving all day?
Is that it?

359
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,080
That's what I said.
She's not even answering her phone.

360
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,820
Why would she do that?
She was always on top of the housework.

361
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,390
More than good.

362
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,560
She was so responsible that
sometimes it felt like she ran the house,

363
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,090
not just worked in it.

364
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,330
I have no idea why she's acting
like this all of a sudden. Seriously.

365
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,600
- Did she miss her pay?
- I doubt it. She makes six figures.

366
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,270
I think she's got a man.

367
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,940
What kind of crazy talk is that?

368
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
A man?

369
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,210
Come on, what else could it be?

370
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,180
Considering she's completely
ditching her chores to be out all day.

371
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,780
Whatever the reason, I can't forgive her
for letting my daughter starve.

372
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,290
- Here, eat up.
- Hey, have some of the squash.

373
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,520
- Right, the squash.
- The rolled omelet, too.

374
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,120
- And mushrooms.
- The rolled omelet.

375
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,760
And give her some of this meat.

376
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,560
Gosh, you give it to her. You do it.

377
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,130
Here, eat it yourself.
You're a big girl now.

378
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,270
And tell Ji Seop to come here later.

379
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,900
Should I? I'll tell him to come here
after work then.

380
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,070
Good idea.

381
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,010
To your parents' place?
All right, that sounds good.

382
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,710
I'll head right over when I'm done here.

383
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,480
Ja Kyung, I have to go.
Something urgent just came up.

384
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,790
Where have you been the past few days?

385
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,990
About that file we reviewed,

386
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,520
I've finished the legal analysis,
so you can go ahead with it.

387
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,090
I asked why you disappeared
for days without a word.

388
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,110
What are you doing here?

389
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,720
Baek Sul Hee.
You'd freak out if you knew,

390
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,020
but it's not a bad thing.
Just you wait.

391
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,320
Why are you staring at me like that?
State your business or get out.

392
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,090
I'm here for a reason.

393
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,730
The divorce papers
for Chairman Min Doo Sik and Jung Lucia.

394
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,200
I tore them up.

395
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,530
I'm here to tell you
that your divorce is off.

396
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,570
If you want to know why,

397
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,180
meet me tonight at 7 p.m. at Berimang
by the Mucheon Roundabout.

398
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,410
But...

399
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,310
you have to bring Se Ri with you.

400
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,120
What does Se Ri have to do with this?

401
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,580
Make sure you bring her.

402
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,490
If you show up alone,

403
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,850
I'll tell her everything
about who you really are.

404
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,500
Darn it. He has a million ways
to make my life difficult.

405
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,940
Maybe it's because
I haven't seen you in a few days,

406
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,680
but something about you
seems very different.

407
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,150
I do?

408
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,220
- Not at all.
- There's something I wanted to ask you.

409
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,120
About the bouquet and engagement ring
you dropped on the rooftop that day.

410
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,660
Oh, right.

411
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,490
Please, don't worry about it.

412
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,090
It was nothing. I just did it
because it's what people do.

413
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,360
Min Kyung Chae, it's over for you.

414
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,030
No matter how great you think you are,
what can you be without my help?

415
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,170
And that high-and-mighty Madam Jang.

416
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,170
That old fox is only helping you
because she thinks Se Ri is...

417
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,510
her son's flesh and blood.

418
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,410
What will happen when she finds out
Se Ri's my daughter?

419
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,750
What are you thinking so hard about?

420
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,220
It's nothing.

421
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,990
Meet me tonight at 7 p.m. at Berimang
by the Mucheon Roundabout.

422
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,560
But you have to bring Se Ri with you.

423
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,430
Make sure you bring her.

424
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,330
If you show up alone,

425
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,560
I'll tell her everything
about who you really are.

426
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,900
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

427
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,740
Se Ri.

428
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,450
Can you meet me outside for a bit?

429
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,090
Come to the front of the company building.
We can go to the meeting from there.

430
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,690
Are we meeting someone?

431
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
Yes.

432
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,260
You'll see.

433
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,270
Hello, are you Jung Lucia and Min Se Ri?

434
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Yes, that's us.

435
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,570
Right this way.
I'll show you to the family table.

436
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,710
The family table?

437
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,810
Yes, he specifically requested
the family table.

438
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,980
He said this family dinner
was long overdue...

439
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,580
and even gave us a tip to make it special.

440
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,620
Your husband is right over there.

441
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,990
He's been waiting eagerly
for his daughter.

442
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,020
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

443
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,450
(The newborn was filmed
under supervision...)

444
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,690
(and with consideration
for their rest and safety.)

445
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,540
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
