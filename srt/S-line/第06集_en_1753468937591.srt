1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
This

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,380
This

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,380
This

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,800
This

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,920
This

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,040
Iäº†

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,380
Ah

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,940
Oh

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think you dropped this earlier.

18
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I didn't do it.

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll leave it here.

20
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll go get it.

21
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I waited a long time.

23
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What's going on?

24
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, right.

25
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Happy birthday.

26
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's not 12 o'clock yet.

27
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm going to celebrate it properly tomorrow.

28
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have a favor to ask you.

29
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What is it?

30
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If you don't like it, you can refuse it.

31
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know if this is right.

36
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm not trying to give you a burden.

37
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm not trying to give you a burden.

38
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I just thought it would be nice if I could be with someone.

39
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have a question.

40
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah.

41
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Do you like me?

42
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah.

43
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh, right.

44
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't have anything.

45
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh.

46
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This?

47
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Seunggi.

50
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wait here for a second.

54
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I've always thought I was a cursed child.

64
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
A child who killed her parents.

65
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I wanted to be different.

66
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But nothing has changed.

67
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I was cursed.

68
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Everyone who was with me will die.

69
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Help me.

75
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You really didn't know about the Suna Ice Line?

76
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If I knew, of course I would have been a detective.

77
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I got a card every birthday.

78
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't have anyone to send.

79
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
At first, I thought it was my mom.

80
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I realized at some point.

81
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Someone's waiting for my birthday.

82
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The day I have to do something will come.

83
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I think that day is today.

84
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You gave me this glasses.

87
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And Suna.

88
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They're all the same, aren't they?

89
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is there anyone at school at this time?

91
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I ordered your teacher to come out, but he's not coming out.

92
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm not a person who doesn't have Lee Gyujin.

93
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
As a job, I have to go to school and find something.

94
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Detective, over there.

95
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hey, sunglasses.

96
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I almost died.

97
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What happened?

98
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Who did this?

99
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You told me to come to school.

100
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But I don't remember after that.

101
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What happened to me?

102
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll tell you later.

103
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let's go out first.

104
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm here with the detective.

105
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Detective.

106
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Detective.

107
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's go.

108
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What the hell is this?

109
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What?

110
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Didn't we come down?

111
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Let's go.

112
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What is it?

113
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Why are you on the same floor again?

114
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Help me!

115
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I think it's the end of school.

116
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You're stuck?

117
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Why?

118
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Where is it?

119
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Huh?

120
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There's no one.

121
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
There's no one.

122
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What happened to me?

123
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I met him.

124
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I was lucky.

125
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I think you dropped this earlier.

126
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Did you give it to me on purpose?

127
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
How do you feel now?

128
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Huh?

129
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Do you still want to die?

130
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Or do you want to kill me?

131
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What are you talking about?

132
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You know what it means on your head, right?

133
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Don't you want to get rid of it?

134
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Red lines.

135
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Everyone will see the world that Jun-hee sees with glasses.

136
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Sooner or later, without glasses.

137
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:10,000
When that time comes, don't you wonder what people will do?

138
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It will be a weakness that cannot be hidden from someone.

139
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And other people will try to use it.

140
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So I came to help Jun-hee.

141
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:40,000
After that, I found the meaning of a new life.

142
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm going to cut off my last sin.

143
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's the day.

144
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The day the world turns red.

145
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We'll all be born again.

146
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Sorry.

147
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's my mistake.

148
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I love you a lot.

149
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
Kyung Jin.

151
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,000
There's something I didn't tell you.

152
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
To be honest,

153
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,000
I've been seeing something weird since I was born.

154
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Is this...

155
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I like it.

157
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,000
Where did you get that?

158
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,000
I found it on the bus stop.

159
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I don't want to.

160
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But...

161
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I heard you can see the S-line without glasses.

162
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Is it true?

163
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
What?

164
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,000
The night shift said so.

165
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Night shift?

166
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Don't you want to save Seon Ah?

172
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
No!

174
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Put down the knife.

175
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Put down the knife!

176
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Put down the knife!

177
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Detective.

178
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
How was the world without glasses?

179
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Wasn't it beautiful?

180
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
If you wait a little bit,

181
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
the whole world will soon be red.

182
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Ordinary people can't kill me.

183
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Did you kill Seon Ah on the roof?

184
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
If Seon Ah wasn't in the hospital,

185
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
would you have seen her properly?

186
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I gave you a chance.

187
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Let go of me!

188
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
No!

189
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
No!

190
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Where am I?

191
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What are you...

192
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
What's wrong with your eyes?

193
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Stop!

194
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Stop!

195
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Stop!

196
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Why did you do this?

197
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Didn't you always wonder?

198
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Why were you born to see the red line?

199
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's for today, Hyunwoo.

200
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You're not cursed.

201
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You're a gift and a blessing.

202
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Don't lie.

203
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
People kill each other.

204
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Your friends and family die.

205
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
How can you send a slime

206
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
when such things happen?

207
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
People are curious.

208
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You still don't know, Hyunwoo?

209
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The S-line.

210
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Don't you feel the desire of people

211
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
who want to see the S-line?

212
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm just a representative of that desire.

213
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Hyunwoo

214
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Mom.

215
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm sorry

217
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
for being too late.

218
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I also

219
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
had my glasses.

220
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You're here?

221
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Did you eat?

222
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What's wrong?

223
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's my fault.

224
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Hyunwoo,

225
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
it's your fault.

226
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Hey!

227
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Hyunwoo

228
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Hyunwoo

229
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Hyunwoo

230
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Your death

231
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
will be a blessing to humanity

232
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
that can bring the eyes of God.

233
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's late.

322
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You've already

323
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
proved your existence.

324
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
We

325
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
did everything we could.

326
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Dad.

327
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Dad.

328
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Dad.

329
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,500
Ha...

330
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,500
Ha...

331
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
Ah...

332
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
Yeon-woo!

333
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Are you okay?

334
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Let's go.

335
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Doctor...

336
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Huh?

337
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Doctor!

338
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Let's go see the seahorse together.

339
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Wow!

340
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
The sky is so bright.

341
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Ah! My head!

342
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Ah!

343
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
What is this?

344
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
What is this?

345
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
What is this?

346
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
There's a lot of this.

347
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
What is this?

348
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
What is this?

349
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Someday,

350
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Everyone will see the world you see.

351
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm going to the gym.

352
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
The world where everyone sees the S-line.

353
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Eventually, I became an ordinary person who wanted that.

354
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
A huge movement of about a year has shaken the world.

355
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
People tried to figure out why there was an S-line,

356
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
but they couldn't find the answer.

357
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Sun-hwa eventually woke up.

358
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
In a world full of S-lines,

359
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
she was born again without an S-line.

360
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Sun-hwa and Detective Han didn't ask each other anything.

361
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
They just comforted each other that they were alive.

362
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Why are you coming in?

363
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
What are you going to eat?

364
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm going to sell chocolate with my uncle.

365
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Why? What's chocolate?

366
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Look up, uncle.

367
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Didn't you see the chocolate?

368
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Everyone's looking at you.

369
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And I...

370
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I became alone again.

371
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm going to the gym.

372
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I'm going to the gym.

373
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I'm going to the gym.

374
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm going to the gym.

375
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm going to the gym.

376
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I'm going to the gym.

377
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I'm going to the gym.

378
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I'm going to the gym.

379
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I'm going to the gym.

380
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I'm going to the gym.

381
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm going to the gym.

382
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm going to the gym.

383
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm going to the gym.

384
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm going to the gym.

385
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Let's go.

386
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Let's go.

387
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Let's go.

388
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
What's the matter, An so?

389
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Come with me.

390
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
He said he's going to the gym.

391
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
An so?

392
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I think he was growing up to be fitful.

393
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
He was fat.

394
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I told you.

395
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:57,120
Rev Jonathan

396
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:15,060
What shall we do?

397
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:29,060
Try listening to it.

398
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,700
But somebody keeps calling me

399
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,700
I need to find what it means

400
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,820
Can you believe this?

401
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,460
That everyone gets read for reasons

402
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,140
There's nowhere else to hide

403
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:20,540
The past, fate, I think we gotta understand

404
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,180
Between the lines

405
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,380
Is this real deal or not?

406
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,780
Don't you ever judge

407
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,780
You don't pray for church, it hurts

408
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,540
How could we know?

409
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,540
Our mistakes see

410
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:45,060
As you are denying

411
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:49,060
We're connected to the light

412
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,780
Like a sign in the sky

413
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,780
So clear, there's no need to seek

414
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,780
I follow the line

415
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,780
That takes me to the land of the truth

416
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,980
Can you believe this?

417
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,580
That everyone gets read for reasons

418
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,180
There's nowhere else to hide

419
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:28,180
The past, fate, I think we just gotta understand

420
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,060
Between the lines

421
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:36,060
What is real, what is not?

422
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,060
How are you so sure?

423
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,060
Still insecure by myself

424
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,060
How could we know?

425
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,060
It's on the fire

426
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,060
Everending lullaby

427
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:56,060
We're tangled with the lies

428
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,060
Denying

429
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:09,060
Yeah, we're tangled with the lies

430
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:36,060
Thanks for watching!
