1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, my God.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Kang Sung, open your eyes.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Kang Sung.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sun-ah.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sun-ah.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why were you at school at that time?

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
To find Sun-ah.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
To find her?

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I got a call.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm going to school.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why were you at school at that time?

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't know anything else.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sun-ah.

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's not a suicide.

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm already going to school.

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to school.

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you still not here?

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Someone call me.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to school today.

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm calling, but I can't get it.

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
How do you manage the student?

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This happens at school.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you want to die, you should go home and die.

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not dead yet.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What are you talking about?

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Are you responsible?

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, I'm responsible.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We're all the same.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But why are you turning it into a student's fault?

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Who's blaming the student?

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're blaming the student.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I know.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Come to me.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm not going to tell you.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Stop.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're not going to blame me.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Are you okay?

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Anyway, make sure you don't tell anyone about this.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You guys should shut your mouths.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hey, I'm a senior.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey, your teeth are yellow.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Your teeth are so yellow.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's like a radish.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hey, why aren't you going to school?

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm so sorry.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I didn't come out as soon as I dropped Kang Seon-ah.

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm bored.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't know.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Teacher, it's all my fault.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's our class.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No, it's not.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Isn't he the one who almost got a school violence last time?

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But the teacher still doesn't answer the phone?

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I know.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is a strange thing.

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I've never done this before.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm tired of it.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Is there anything good?

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I always give up on school and commit suicide.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Teacher Kim.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Didn't you say you were going to have a date?

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Did you get the wedding date?

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I got a wedding.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Here, here, here.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Ahyul, ahyul.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You have to say hello to your uncle.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You have to say hello to your uncle.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Ahyul.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Are you shy?

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Is that all the luggage?

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll be back in a week.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I put the rest of the luggage on the floor.

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What Canada?

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's a good job.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Sit down.

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's your first time in my house, right?

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How is it?

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's good.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Did you move last year?

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No, it's been over two years.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's already like that.

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This is all thanks to Kim Byung-chul, right?

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Should I call my brother?

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Huh?

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's okay to be out in this day and age.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Of course. He's my brother.

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And I'm busy with work, so I don't have time to see my face.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Look.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You said you were going to school a little more until you left Korea, right?

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah.

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Wait a minute.

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Kang Seon-ah.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Get up and get some sleep.

108
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're looking for evidence, right?

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Kang Seon-ah.

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I know her a little bit, but she's not a normal girl.

111
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Suicide?

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't make me laugh.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And Kim Hye-young, who bullied Kang Seon-ah every day,

114
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
went to school the next day.

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Kim Hye-young didn't go to school the next day.

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is really weird, too.

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Who are you?

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm No. 5, Lee Kyung-jin.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
This isn't suicide, it's a suicide.

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The person closest to me was the most suspicious.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Kang Seon-ah was a bully.

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No, I think there were some kids who played with me recently.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm not dead.

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Huh?

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Seon-ah's alive.

131
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, right.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You've gotten close to me now that you've seen me.

134
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Where did you get these glasses?

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I got them from the shop.

136
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
When?

137
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Last year?

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But why haven't you worn them?

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I had contacts on and my eyes hurt.

140
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Excuse me.

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes?

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you know whose glasses this is?

144
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm not sure.

145
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why?

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No, it's just that it's in my seat.

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Then it's yours.

148
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Try it on. I think it'll look good on you.

149
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay.

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I should've taken care of it in advance.

153
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know what the kids are thinking.

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you think it's a suicide?

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't know.

156
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You think it's a suicide?

160
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Pardon?

161
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I haven't been identified yet.

162
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh.

163
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Anyway, I'll help you if I need help.

164
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Tell me anytime.

165
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Is the student who bullied Seon-ah at school?

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Uh...

167
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
She's missing.

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Missing?

169
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

170
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Then where's this guy?

171
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He came out of Seon-ah's bag.

172
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think he got into an accident.

173
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll go get Seon-ah.

174
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Lee Ji-won?

175
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes.

176
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll ask you a question.

177
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What's your relationship with Seon-ah?

178
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We're not in a relationship.

179
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You two take pictures and go on dates?

180
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
She asked me to hang out first.

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Do you hang out with everyone?

182
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

183
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's just...

184
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's interesting.

185
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The girl who bullied Seon-ah suddenly changed her personality 180 degrees.

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I knew she was interested in me.

187
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Did you two have any weird feelings?

188
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's just...

189
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's normal.

190
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What did you do at the cafe?

191
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Can I be honest?

192
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We kissed while talking.

193
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I was going to go out, but she stopped me.

194
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And?

195
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And where did she go?

196
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, right.

197
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
She came out of the picture and ran like a crazy person.

198
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think she said something was missing.

199
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's have a toast.

202
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

203
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Cheers.

204
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Cheers.

205
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Cheers.

206
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Cheers.

207
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let's drink.

208
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm sorry I got angry.

209
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't say that.

210
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You can call me Cheonam.

211
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes, call me whatever you want.

212
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You know what?

213
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You two don't look alike.

214
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You two look so good together.

215
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Cheers.

216
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Can I ask you something?

217
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes.

218
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You were getting married.

219
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Why did you break up?

220
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Honey.

221
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's okay.

222
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We were living together.

223
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I saw her before we got married.

224
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I came home with her and she was in bed with her friend.

225
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, my friend.

226
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Cheonam, you did a great job.

227
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You know, it's good for your ancestors to know this before marriage.

228
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I like you. I really like you.

229
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Let's have a drink.

230
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Give me a drink.

231
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Are you okay?

232
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm not drunk.

233
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's okay.

235
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm just texting because of work.

236
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What did you teach Cheonam?

237
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I teach English.

238
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh, very nice.

239
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Sounds good.

240
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I often meet foreigners because of work.

241
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Do you know what foreigners like the most when they come to Korea?

242
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Guess.

243
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You called your sister after a long time, right?

244
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes, I didn't get it.

245
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay, keep in touch with me.

246
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You said you only have two left after your parents passed away.

247
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes, I should.

248
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh, my God.

250
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Cheonam, where are you going?

251
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
We're on the 10th floor.

252
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh, yes.

253
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Cheonam is not a good drinker.

254
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Hey, this isn't suicide.

255
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You didn't even investigate it.

256
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You're going to die.

257
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Hey, this isn't suicide.

259
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You didn't even investigate it.

260
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Detective Han, what are you talking about?

261
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You've never seen a doctor's testimony in the hospital.

262
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Let's be honest.

263
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Did you know your nephew was bullied?

264
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
There's a possibility of suicide.

265
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So we need to investigate more.

266
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It might not be just a suicide.

267
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Ji-woo said to stop from above.

268
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's a very bad thing for the school foundation.

269
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There's a serious suicide in school right now.

270
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Murder?

271
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This is ridiculous.

272
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I know your heart better than anyone.

273
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's move on.

274
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Are you going to do this even if your brother is lying down?

275
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You punk.

276
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You crossed the line.

277
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You crossed the line first.

278
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What?

279
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Hey, Han Ji-woo.

280
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Han Ji-woo.

281
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh, shit.

282
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I can't solve that.

283
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's hard in the United States.

284
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, you're wearing glasses.

285
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It looks good on you.

286
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yes.

287
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I guess Mr. Gu hasn't contacted you yet.

288
00:23:44,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I know.

289
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:11,000
What do you think you'll do if you find out that someone you know is bullying you?

290
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I don't know.

291
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But can you be sure that I'm right?

292
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I want to see everything go smoothly.

293
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Like a morning drama.

294
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Why are you going so late?

295
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Uncle, are you sleeping?

296
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You should hold my hand.

297
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Who is Mo Tae-seok?

298
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Oh, you came by the wrong number.

299
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's the address.

300
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
No, it's number 401.

301
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Sometimes they enter the wrong address.

302
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'll go get it for you.

303
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
No, I'm just going in with Ahyul.

304
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You can just give it to the security.

305
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah.

306
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Do you want to try?

307
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh, brother.

308
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm home now.

309
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I think I'm going to fall out.

310
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You said you could buy more.

311
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm not sure.

312
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
No, it's not mine.

313
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This is yours.

314
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I don't know.

315
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Ahyul, should I say hello to Grandma?

317
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah.

318
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Say hello to Grandma.

319
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Where's your brother?

320
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
He's in the army.

321
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What are you doing today?

322
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I usually go to the factory in the spring and sleep for two or three days.

323
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Are you happy to be married?

324
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, I'm just raising a child like everyone else.

325
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You're like a dermatologist.

326
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You're good at making money.

327
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Kim Jungwoo has changed a lot.

328
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
He's been nagging.

329
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I should have seen this.

330
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Jungwoo, you...

331
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You're not saying that your parents are not there, are you?

332
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
No, I'm not.

333
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I told you I was meeting someone else.

334
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So it's nice to be with you and my mom.

335
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'll be with you when I get married.

336
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You're not talking to the people in that house, are you?

337
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yeah, well, sometimes my little father calls me.

338
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Are you crazy?

339
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I forgot how my mom and dad were doing.

340
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Why are you thinking about contacting her?

341
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I mean, I...

342
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't think you knew because you were young, but...

343
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I was just going to marry Sooyeon.

344
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We've been together for six years, so I was just going to move on.

345
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's a mistake.

346
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I know you're getting more and more selfish.

347
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But one day, I kept thinking about my dad's face.

348
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Dad must have said it was wrong at first.

349
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I wonder if it was how my mom felt.

350
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I can see the face of the person I hate the most on the face of the person I love the most.

351
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I still like Sooyeon.

352
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I miss you.

353
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But I can't see it because of my dad.

354
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
How can you bully me?

355
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I think he's crazy.

356
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What's going on?

357
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
My God, I never had a day of silence.

358
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I never imagined it.

359
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Is that right?

360
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
How come you're like this?

361
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What?

362
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,900
Hey, hey, hey, Sung-ji! Come here, come here!

363
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,100
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

364
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,700
Hey, what are you doing?

365
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,400
Hey, what are you doing? You lost!

366
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,900
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

367
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,900
What are you doing?

368
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,200
I am Bang Sung-jin, a Korean language teacher at Bangju High School.

369
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,200
I have maintained an inappropriate relationship with students.

370
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
I am sorry to my family,

371
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:20,200
and I am trying to end my life because of the shame and guilt that will come when this is revealed.

372
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,200
I am sincerely sorry to everyone for causing trouble.

373
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Oh, don't touch that.

374
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
I'm wearing gloves.

375
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
What?

376
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
What's the time of death?

377
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Well...

378
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,200
We need to do a autopsy to know, but it's said that he has been dead for three days.

379
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
I don't think he died here.

380
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
What?

381
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,200
He was standing on the floor of the parking lot, and it doesn't make sense that he was found three days later.

382
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
The picture of him at school was uploaded today.

383
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
It means that he knew about the explosion in advance.

384
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Who's going to be behind this?

385
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Hey, class president!

386
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
We're going to eat tteokbokki. Do you want to come with us?

387
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Sure.

388
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
What?

389
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
You always make a fuss.

390
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Are you interested in me?

391
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Or are you interested in our Hyun?

392
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Hey, get in.

393
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
What are you doing?

394
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Who are you?

395
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
A neighborhood resident.

396
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
It's illegal to park here. Get in.

397
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Hey, mister.

398
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Why are you telling me to get in?

399
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Mister?

400
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Hey, mister.

401
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Isn't this kidnapping?

402
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
What kind of kidnapping is this?

403
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
I'm not a kid.

404
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
I'm a kid.

405
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
I'm a kid.

406
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
I'm a kid.

407
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
I'm a kid.

408
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
I'm a kid.

409
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
I'm a kid.

410
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
I'm a kid.

411
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm a kid.

412
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Kidnapping?

413
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Why would you kidnap someone like this?

414
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
This is totally crazy.

415
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Hey, 112.

416
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Call the police.

417
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Okay?

418
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
You want me to call the police?

419
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Wait.

420
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Oh, my.

421
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
The police are here.

422
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Get in.

423
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
You're still not jealous of a friend?

424
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
I'm not doubting you.

425
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
You told me yourself.

426
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
That there's no reason for him to kill himself.

427
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Why do you think Seon-ah went back to school that night?

428
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Have you ever seen Seon-ah's glasses?

429
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
I've never seen them.

430
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Have you ever seen them?

431
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Glasses?

432
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Hey, tell me the truth.

433
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
What on earth are the glasses?

434
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Is Seon-ah also related to those glasses?

435
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Glasses.

436
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Please find it.

437
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Then I'll tell you.

438
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,200
What are you going to tell me?

439
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Taxi.

440
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Taxi.

441
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Taxi.

442
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Oh, let's eat.

443
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Let's eat.

444
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Are you done?

445
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Before you eat, tell me what this is.

446
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
What is it?

447
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
It's pretty.

448
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
I'm so embarrassed.

449
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Let's see.

450
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
Hello?

451
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Yes, it's Jung-woo.

452
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
What's up?

453
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Are you busy?

454
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm on a meeting right now, so I can't really answer the phone.

455
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Where are you?

456
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Right now...

457
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
It's not Seoul.

458
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
I'll call you later.

459
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Dae-young.

460
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
My sister can't reach you.

461
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Oh, really?

462
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Then...

463
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,200
I'll try to contact my sister.

464
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Okay? I'll hang up.

465
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
I'm sorry.

466
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Wait a minute.

467
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Who are you?

468
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Room service.

469
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
Wait a minute.

470
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Let go.

471
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Let go.

472
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
What are you doing?

473
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,200
You think this is what you're doing right now?

474
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Well...

475
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Well, it's...

476
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,200
It's a situation that's quite understandable.

477
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
This is my personal situation.

478
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
No, it's not that.

479
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,200
I don't think it's good for you.

480
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
You're so confident.

481
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Shouldn't you apologize first?

482
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
I'm sorry.

483
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
I don't have anything to say.

484
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Wait a minute.

485
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Okay.

486
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
I'll clean up here today.

487
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Really.

488
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,200
But give me a little time.

489
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
I promise you.

490
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Please clean up today.

491
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Otherwise, I don't know what I'm going to do.

492
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Wait a minute.

493
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,200
Don't tell your sister.

494
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
When will I see you again?

495
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,200
I finally call you and see you face to face.

496
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
What's the matter with foreigners these days?

497
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
I'll call you often.

498
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Don't worry.

499
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Call me if you have any problems.

500
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,200
I'm going crazy because I'm going to get hurt.

501
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,200
Hey.

502
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
It's not long.

503
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Just use it.

504
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
It's okay.

505
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Go.

506
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
My brother still hasn't contacted you?

507
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,200
Huh?

508
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
He'll come when the time comes.

509
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I guess there's something going on.

510
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
Call me.

511
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Don't come out.

512
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
I'll go.

513
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,200
How was the morning drama?

514
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,200
No.

515
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,200
I don't know.

516
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,200
Maybe.

517
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,200
The school is not in the right mind.

518
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,200
It's a little bit weird to say that you're going to go to Kim.

519
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Thank you for the time.

520
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,200
Did you find Kim Young-young?

521
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,200
No, not yet.

522
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,200
Who posted that picture?

523
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,200
Well, there are a lot of people who will post it.

524
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,200
There's already a story that they were on social media.

525
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Chae-ri.

526
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Chae-ri.

527
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
I'm sorry.

528
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
I miss you.

529
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
Chae-ri.

530
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
You crazy bastard.

531
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,200
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

532
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Thank you.

533
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,200
How did you get here?

534
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,200
I'm going to go inside.

535
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,200
I'm sorry.

536
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,200
Wait a minute.

537
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
Hey, customer.

538
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Hey, customer.

539
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Stop, stop, stop.

540
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
What's wrong with him?

541
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,200
Someone please report the police.

542
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Wake up.

543
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
Wake up.

544
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Open the door.

545
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,200
Hey.

546
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Are you okay?

547
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,200
Open the door.

548
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,200
Are you okay?

549
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
I'll take care of this.

550
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,200
I'll take care of this.

551
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,200
You and Ayul.

552
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,200
Jungwoo.

553
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,200
Why did you do that?

554
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,200
What do you mean?

555
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,200
Why did you do that?

556
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,200
What's wrong with you?

557
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,200
Why did you do that?

558
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
You.

559
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,200
Brother.

560
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,200
Huh?

561
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Are you okay?

562
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,200
Brother.

563
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
Suddenly, the police came and hit me.

564
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,200
Suddenly, they hit me in the car.

565
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,200
Okay, okay.

566
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,200
I'm sorry.

567
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,200
Let go of me, you bastard.

568
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,200
What is it?

569
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
What is it?

570
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,200
Are you a human?

571
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,200
What are you doing?

572
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,200
Stop it.

573
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,200
Stop it.

574
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,200
Stop it, Jungwoo.

575
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,200
What does that mean?

576
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,200
No, they're crazy people.

577
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,200
Go.

578
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,200
Go.

579
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,200
He's not my husband.

580
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,200
He's not Kim Pyeongchul.

581
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
His name is Oh Taeseok.

582
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,200
You're her husband.

583
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,200
I came running because I was afraid I would kill her pregnant wife.

584
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,200
Jungwoo.

585
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,200
I.

586
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,200
I.

587
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,200
I'm her bad woman.

588
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
What do you mean?

589
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,200
You said so.

590
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
You're a bad woman.

591
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,200
I'm a bad woman.

592
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,200
Go back to the way you were.

593
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,200
Jungwoo saw me and Chaerin.

594
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
He told me to stop cleaning up.

595
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,200
Chaerin is pregnant.

596
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,200
I think she's right.

597
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,200
Jungwoo.

598
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Jungwoo.

599
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,200
Jungwoo.

600
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Jungwoo.

601
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,200
Jungwoo, don't leave me.

602
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,200
I'm going to kill you.

603
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,200
I'm going to kill you.

604
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,200
Mom.

605
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,200
Why are you crying?

606
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,200
Does it hurt?

607
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,200
No.

608
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
It's nothing, Ayul.

609
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,200
Why would you use Yuseo so heartlessly?

610
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,200
Yuseo.

611
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,200
Yuseo?

612
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,200
Where are you going?

613
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,200
Sir.

614
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,200
Your house wasn't here.

615
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
I'm sorry.

616
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,700
decorative

617
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,200
Hey, sunglasses.

618
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,200
Plus!

619
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,780
Why aren't you answering your phone?

620
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,540
Is your phone a decoration?

621
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,460
Are these the glasses you were talking about?

622
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,200
The glasses you were wearing, are those the glasses?

623
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,540
What do you mean, you can see it with those glasses?

624
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,740
S-line.

625
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,380
S-line?

626
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,280
Swły angularorted

627
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,780
But Park Sun Ha kept a thing to her3

628
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,580
A friend Legion

629
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:41,380
So, what do you mean someone took Seon-ah's glasses and called her to the roof and pushed her?

630
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,380
I think she was threatening him with a S-line.

631
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,380
I've never had sex before.

632
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,380
Teacher, do you have a girlfriend?

633
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:56,380
Teacher, I've been in a relationship with many men.

634
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,380
What's wrong with the glasses?

635
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,380
I can tell what color you are if you wear glasses.

636
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:06,380
A murder case was committed in Gangam-dong last night.

637
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,380
Then, is there a possibility that there are several glasses?

638
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,380
Several glasses?

639
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:02,380
Like a sign in the sky, so clear there's no need to seek

640
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:10,380
I follow the line that takes me to the land of the truth

641
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,380
Can you believe this?

642
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,380
That everyone gets read for free since

643
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,380
There's nowhere else to hide the past

644
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,380
I think we just gotta say

645
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,380
Between the lines

646
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,380
What is real, what is not

647
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:37,380
How are you so sure, still insecure by myself

648
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,380
How could we know

649
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,380
It's on the fire

650
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:48,380
Everending lullaby

651
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:52,380
We're tangled with the lies

652
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,380
Denying, yeah we're tangled with

653
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,380
The lies

654
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:23,380
Thank you for watching!
