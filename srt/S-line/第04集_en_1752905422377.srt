1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
The immediately falando

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, sex...

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
No.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
When you have sex, the lines are connected between people,

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and when you wear glasses, you can see the lines?

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You were able to see the lines since you were born?

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hey!

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What kind of nonsense is that?

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You high school students, I know you're scared these days,

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
but you're a detective. Don't underestimate a detective.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hey, wait, wait.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I said I couldn't believe you.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So, you mean someone took Seonhwa's glasses,

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and called her to the rooftop and pushed her away?

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Probably.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Who? Why?

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't know.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm not sure if Seonhwa is the type to commit suicide,

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
but I think she's threatening people with the S-line.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She must have had a lot of enemies.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Then, is there a possibility that she has several glasses?

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, there's been a series of similar incidents

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
like the one that happened in your house recently.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Wait.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Do you think the whole world looks red?

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Almost.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, that's why you're wearing sunglasses.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It must have been hard for you to live, too.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It must have been hard for you to live, too.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Seonhwa.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Seonhwa.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What are you doing?

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't sleep, okay?

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Focus again.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There are two types of sexual hair color.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
One pair of sexual hair color, and the other 22 pairs of sexual hair color.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sexual hair color is not our sexual...

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you okay?

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why?

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I mean, I woke up screaming in the classroom.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Hey, that's because you're so weak.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's go on a weekend with the wind.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why?

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why?

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You don't want to, right?

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I have something to do.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What is it?

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I have to work.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Work?

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What kind of work?

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Stop asking.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You might not want to tell me.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Miseong.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Miseong?

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Miseong.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes?

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I told you to do this again.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What if you get it wrong again?

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's so frustrating.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Go and do it again.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sigh.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I've never had sex before.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've never had sex before.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I've never had sex before.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I've never had sex before.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Where is your hometown, Miseong?

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Busan.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You don't use any dialect.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I tried to fix it.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why?

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm preparing to be an actress.

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
An actress?

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I've been casted on the street.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your music teacher has a girlfriend?

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why?

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Are you interested?

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's cool.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Do you want to know if I have a girlfriend?

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Just eat.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Such a famous gentleman, 라fat styleَ

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,700
dollars

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,160
Excuse me.

154
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
It's a guest room.

155
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,160
Didn't he just go straight tourgu?

157
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,300
I thought she'd take a minute to get there.

158
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,160
dog

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,040
Thankcaك

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,960
Thank you.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I heard you always go to the hotel.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
How did you get here?

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's go next time.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Kim Hae-young who was bullying Seon-ah

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
ran away after pushing Seon-ah away.

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The military is gone.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There was no trace of using a card or phone.

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I didn't even see it.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Then,

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the possibility that Mr. Koo-geo

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
pushed Seon-ah away and committed suicide

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
out of guilt?

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's the most convincing thing to say now.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The last call from Koo-geo was from school.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But,

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
until the Koo-geo was found dead,

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
it was still missing.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And the family said

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
that they were very afraid of the police

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and that it was impossible to push someone in front of the railing.

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I can't believe it all.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Then who is it?

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hey.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Seon-ah is the one who...

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's not suicide.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm not just trying to convince you.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There's something that's bothering me.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Seon-ah has changed since she started wearing glasses.

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What's wrong with glasses?

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If you wear glasses,

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
you can tell who you're with.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Really?

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What's real?

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What are you doing?

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Do you want a room?

197
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes.

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's 60,000 won.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Ta-da!

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
How did you...

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hey.

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Your friend is working. You should come visit.

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I can't. You're minors.

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Hey.

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Aren't you a minor?

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I told you.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's illegal.

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I told you.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Do you have a guest?

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Can I go upstairs?

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hey!

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's too cold.

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's too cold.

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Hey.

217
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why did you come in?

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's fun.

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Go.

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's thrilling.

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
A room.

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
206, please.

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Did you come alone?

224
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I saw him somewhere.

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Okay.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I had a relationship

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
with many men.

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But...

230
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
after you came,

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I couldn't fill my empty heart

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
just by having a strange relationship with someone.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I was scared

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
that I would never

235
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
have you.

236
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I want to have sex!

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Right.

239
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You don't have a boyfriend.

240
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't have one now, but I had a lot before.

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What do you mean, a boyfriend?

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You talk too much about clothes.

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Huh?

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What?

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You're right.

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What?

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You know the girl who came alone?

248
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The employee of our school's executive office.

249
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you remember?

250
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Ahn Kyung-soo.

251
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's her?

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're a totally different person.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But I can't avoid my eyes.

254
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let's be quiet.

255
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's be quiet.

256
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's be quiet.

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Shin Hyun-wook.

258
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
When he was young,

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Mom killed Dad and ran away.

260
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What is that mental patient doing?

261
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What is that mental patient doing?

262
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I have something to ask you.

263
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Does Sun-ah have

264
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
an S-line?

265
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Isn't that personal privacy?

266
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
She does.

267
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Then, is Sun-ah's S-line

268
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
connected to the girl who's supporting you?

269
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
No.

270
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't know who she's connected to.

271
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But

272
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't have one this time.

273
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Who is she?

274
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The person who's connected to Sun-ah

275
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is the one who's connected to Sun-ah?

276
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you think she pushed Sun-ah?

277
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Well,

278
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
there's a possibility.

279
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Last night, in Gangam-dong,

280
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
a murder took place.

281
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The victim was arrested

282
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
not far from the scene,

283
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
but unfortunately, the victim was already dead.

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The victim, who was caught on the scene,

285
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
said that he was clean now,

286
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
even though he committed the crime,

287
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and continued to make mistakes.

288
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So, it's possible that he's wearing several glasses.

289
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Several glasses?

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

291
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

292
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

293
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

294
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

295
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

296
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

297
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

298
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

299
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

300
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

301
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

302
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

303
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

304
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000

305
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000

306
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

307
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The victim's face is covered by a black mask.

308
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh.

309
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I didn't know because I love music.

311
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You must be happy.

312
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You know a lot of good music.

313
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So what?

314
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm always playing with the kids at school.

315
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're here, right?

316
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh.

317
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You remember.

318
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yes.

319
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What's your dream?

320
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Guess.

321
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't think I'll ever forget you at school.

322
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Actor?

323
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Are you sure?

324
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes. How did you know?

325
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I thought I'd know everything by body.

326
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh, yeah.

327
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's so amazing.

328
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I can do really well.

329
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm sure you can.

330
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm sure you can.

331
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm really good at it.

332
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's what you're born with.

333
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Right?

334
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Are you going home?

335
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yes.

336
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What about you?

337
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Oh.

338
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I went home because I had work to do.

339
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Do you have

340
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
time?

341
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I thought you liked it when there were no people.

343
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
How did you know this place?

344
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I was a swimmer until middle school.

345
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I quit swimming, but sometimes I came to swim secretly.

346
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Do you know how to swim?

347
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No.

348
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm not good at swimming.

349
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm not good at swimming.

350
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm not good at swimming.

351
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm not good at swimming.

352
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm not good at swimming.

353
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm not good at swimming.

354
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm not good at swimming.

355
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm not good at swimming.

356
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm not good at swimming.

357
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm not good at swimming.

358
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm not good at swimming.

359
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm not good at swimming.

360
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm not good at swimming.

361
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm not good at swimming.

362
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm not good at swimming.

363
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm not good at swimming.

364
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Are you okay?

365
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Hey, hey.

366
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's done. Let's eat.

367
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's done.

368
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's delicious.

369
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But can I eat here?

370
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yes, if you don't get caught.

371
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
If Lee Kyung-jin was here, he would have asked me to cook ramen for him.

372
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But why did you do that?

373
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Oh, if you don't want to talk, you don't have to talk.

374
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Sorry.

375
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm sorry.

379
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm sorry.

383
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I've been seeing something strange since I was born.

384
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
There's a red line on top of people's heads.

385
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Like this?

386
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah.

387
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Then do I have one too?

388
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You don't have one.

389
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I don't have one, and so does Kyung-jin.

390
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Do you believe what I'm saying?

391
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah.

392
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Why?

393
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
There's no reason to lie.

394
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's weird, isn't it?

395
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah.

396
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's not ordinary.

397
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
As expected.

398
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's cool.

399
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm too ordinary.

400
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Even if I disappear tomorrow, no one will know.

401
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What if you disappear?

402
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I don't know.

403
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't know.

404
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
If you disappear, at least Kyung-jin and I will know.

405
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah.

406
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

407
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm not.

408
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I look like a conman, Mr. Kang Soomi.

409
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh my.

410
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's been a while since Chi-woo came.

411
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's been a while, too.

412
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Why didn't you answer the phone? I missed you.

413
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm sorry.

415
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm sorry.

416
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I didn't answer the phone. I missed you.

419
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Well, I'm not good at crime.

420
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Wasn't it at first?

421
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I was just a brave man.

422
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Are you a shy person?

423
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's over, right? Can I see it?

424
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yes.

425
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Take the phone.

426
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
When did you...

427
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What are you doing?

428
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But you don't see anyone these days?

429
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Did I meet someone yesterday?

430
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
No, I didn't meet you, but you were always busy.

431
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I was.

432
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Is it a small relationship?

433
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I have someone I'm curious about.

434
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But I don't want to sleep.

435
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
What's wrong with you?

436
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What's wrong?

437
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Can't I just have someone I'm curious about?

438
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The room.

440
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Room 206, please.

441
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Room 206, please.

442
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yes, I have a relationship with many men.

443
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes, I have a relationship with many men.

444
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yes, I have a relationship with many men.

445
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yes, I have a relationship with many men.

446
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I have a relationship with many men.

447
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
At first, I liked that I had a place to relax.

448
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I thought I could be a famous actress even tomorrow.

449
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But my ears hurt more and more.

450
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It didn't matter that someone else's voice was heard in the next room.

451
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The problem was my voice.

452
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I was afraid that the sound I make and move would be heard by someone else.

453
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It was the same at school.

454
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I was afraid that someone would hear me laughing at the teacher.

455
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Then I found this place.

456
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
An old motel that looked like there would be no one in the middle of the night.

457
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I was free in this room.

458
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And one day, I found glasses.

459
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I was perfect when I looked through the glasses.

460
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I was perfect.

461
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And at some point, I became an audience.

462
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
This room is perfect.

463
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
My perfect world.

464
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm going to sleep.

465
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I'm going to sleep.

466
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm going to sleep.

467
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Why can't you do it all of a sudden?

468
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I just remember the old days.

469
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's new.

470
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Didn't you miss me?

471
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's on TV.

472
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm going to sleep.

473
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm going to sleep.

474
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm going to sleep.

475
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Ouch!

476
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Are you okay?

477
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm going to sleep.

478
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
How about tomorrow?

479
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm going to sleep.

480
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'll extend the time.

481
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
What time?

482
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
206.

483
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm going to sleep.

484
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm going to sleep.

485
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
How is it?

486
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Does it suit you?

487
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You're here.

488
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yes.

489
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You came early.

490
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Miss Mi-seong?

491
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Teacher.

492
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
This music.

493
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It's the music we listened to together, right?

494
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
How did you get here?

495
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Teacher, I...

496
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Teacher, I have something to confess to you.

497
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
What?

498
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Teacher, I...

499
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I've been in a relationship with many men.

500
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
What are you talking about?

501
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yes.

502
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I've been in a relationship with many men.

503
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
But...

504
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But...

505
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Since you appeared...

506
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I couldn't fill my empty heart with just having a strange relationship with someone.

507
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I was scared.

508
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I was afraid I would never have you.

509
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Yes, that's...

510
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh, my God.

511
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What the hell is going on?

512
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yes, I have a relationship with many men.

513
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Did you just throw it at me?

514
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yes.

515
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Oh, Mi-seong.

516
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
What's wrong?

517
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's weird.

518
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I put some medicine in the water in advance.

519
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It will get better soon.

520
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm sorry.

521
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Yes.

522
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I have a relationship with many men.

523
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
But since you appeared...

524
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I couldn't fill my empty heart with just having a strange relationship with someone.

525
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Yes, I have a relationship with many men.

526
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But since you appeared...

527
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I couldn't fill my empty heart with just having a strange relationship with someone.

528
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yes, I have a relationship with many men.

529
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Oh, my God.

531
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Oh, my God.

532
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm sorry.

538
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm sorry.

540
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm sorry.

544
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm sorry.

545
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Yes.

548
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I have a relationship with many men.

549
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh, my God.

550
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Are you okay?

551
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Oh, my God.

552
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Oh, my God.

553
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
You hit me and took my clothes.

554
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Where are you?

555
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
It hurts.

556
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Call the police.

557
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh, my God.

558
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You didn't have any glasses at the scene, did you?

559
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yes.

560
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Have you seen their S-line?

561
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
The employee was not here before.

562
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I don't think she was in contact with the music teacher.

563
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Why are you doing this?

564
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I don't know.

565
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I don't think I'll ever know.

566
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Then this case also seems to have something to do with glasses?

567
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I think it was the glasses that the employee was wearing at school.

568
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I think it was the glasses we were looking for.

569
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Every time Lee Sung-jung came, it was a completely different look from school.

After wearing glasses,

574
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I think I felt like I had become a special person.

575
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Detective, no one is polite.

576
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's why glasses are dangerous.

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000

What's wrong with him?

631
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
He's a man who wants to do things that he can't do.

I was going to tell you first.

635

The moment I put on these glasses...

636

Wow, that's true.

Throw away your glasses.

640

I think the sexual assault case has happened.

641
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Do you have any sexual experience?

No.

643

Why are you lying?

644
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
There are a lot of accidents these days.

645
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Detective!

646
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
What are you talking about?

647
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You're wearing glasses.

648
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Would you like to have dinner with me?

649
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
What?

650
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I'm sorry.

651
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
