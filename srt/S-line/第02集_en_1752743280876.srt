1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
WHAT?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,600
Oh!

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,240
Oh!

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,200
Oh!

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,140
Three months ago, when they killed my dog as her mother...

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,560
My story is there!

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
The end

8
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
It's over!

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Hurry up!

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Let's go!

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
See you later!

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Bye!

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Guys, be careful! You might get hurt!

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Oh, right!

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
You're late, Miss.

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Miss!

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Look at me!

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Thanks, Mr. Jeon!

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Hey!

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
What's today's menu?

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
How would I know?

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,400
And why do you keep calling me class president?

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
What do you mean? You've been the class president since middle school.

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
So, today's menu is...

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
What?

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Tell me!

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
I don't know.

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
What?

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
You're such a crazy person!

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Shut up!

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
What's wrong with you?

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
What's wrong with you?

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Where should we go on the weekend?

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
I want to go to school.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Okay!

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Last year, the percentage of sexual intercourse was 5.9%.

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Considering that the population of the population registration at the time of the statistics office was 3,96,947,

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,400
the number of youth with sexual intercourse experience was more than 170,000.

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Only 170,000.

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Hey!

45
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
You drew it so pretty!

46
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Draw it like a real one!

47
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Let's go.

48
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Seon-ah is angry.

49
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Oh, no.

50
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
To Ji-won.

52
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Hi!

53
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,400
You don't know who I am, but I've been liking you for a long time.

54
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Hey!

55
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Guys!

56
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Guys!

57
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Hey!

58
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Seon-ah.

59
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Even so, violence is bad.

60
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,400
If you run in there like that, the teacher can't defend you.

61
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm going to kill you.

62
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Huh?

63
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Teacher, I want to go home now.

64
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm going to kill you.

65
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Aren't you being too mean?

66
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
What?

67
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
What now?

68
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Why did I come home so late?

69
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I almost died.

70
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm sorry about the urgent matter.

71
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,400
I'm going to write a report saying I shot a gun.

72
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Oh, shoot a gun and if you save a person, write a report.

73
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Shoot a gun and if you protect the criminal's human rights,

74
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
the media will talk about it.

75
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,400
I don't feel good about this or that.

76
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
But why are you looking at this again?

77
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
You caught the culprit.

78
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
I'm sick of it.

79
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
What?

80
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
I don't understand why you killed her.

81
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,400
They were all women who had something to do with it.

82
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,400
One of the crazy people who are angry at the broken women.

83
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
And there's a date violence case.

84
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
That's why you went to the academy.

85
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
That was last year.

86
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Why now?

87
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
It's hot.

88
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
It's hot.

89
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,400
He kept saying he was saving someone.

90
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Is it true that he doesn't have a religion?

91
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Yes, people around me said he's far from religion.

92
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Math teacher and religion.

93
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,400
They don't go well together.

94
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
I'm sorry.

97
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Son?

98
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
What the hell?

99
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
What the hell is this?

100
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Did you eat?

101
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Where are you going at this hour?

103
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
What the hell?

104
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
What is all this?

105
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
What the hell?

106
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
What the hell?

107
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Get in. I'll take you to the car.

108
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
What the hell?

109
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
What the hell?

110
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Come on.

111
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
It's time.

112
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I want to eat some fried chicken.

113
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
I want to eat fried chicken all day.

114
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Come on.

115
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
What the hell?

116
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
What was that noise?

117
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Did you eat?

118
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
What a bitch.

119
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
What the hell?

120
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
What the hell?

121
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
What the hell?

122
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
What the hell?

123
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Hey, quiet.

124
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
A new friend came to our class today.

125
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Her name is Shin Hyun-hyeok.

126
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Hyun-hyeok, would you like to introduce yourself?

127
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Would you like to introduce yourself?

128
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Then,

129
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
get along with the kids.

130
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
If you don't know anything, ask the class president, Jun-sung.

131
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
You can sit in the empty seat.

132
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Go and sit.

133
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Get ready for class.

134
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
What the hell?

135
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Why can't you talk?

136
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
What's wrong with you?

137
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
What the hell?

138
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Glasses.

139
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Glasses.

140
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Glasses.

141
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm sorry.

142
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
What's so urgent?

143
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Nothing.

144
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Would you like to see me after class?

145
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Call me.

146
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Okay.

147
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Oh, what's up?

148
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Oh.

149
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Oh.

150
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Oh.

151
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Glasses?

152
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Yes.

153
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Well, I don't know.

154
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
I've never seen you wear glasses.

155
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
What's wrong with you?

156
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
I don't have money to give you.

157
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Don't touch it.

158
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
What?

159
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Are you going out now?

160
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Fuck.

161
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Is that so embarrassing?

162
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Now you're embarrassed.

163
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
What?

164
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Why am I embarrassed?

165
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Tell me.

166
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Why am I embarrassed?

167
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Tell me.

168
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Tell me.

169
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Why am I embarrassed?

170
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Stop it.

171
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
What's this?

172
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Is this your set?

173
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
What the fuck?

174
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Are you going to jump?

175
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
No.

176
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Let's run together.

177
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Are you going to let go of this?

178
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Hold me.

179
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Fuck.

180
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Promise me.

181
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
You won't touch us.

182
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
I promise.

183
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
I promise.

184
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
I won't touch you.

185
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
I told you.

186
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Let go.

187
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
You crazy bitch.

188
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Are you okay?

189
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Fuck.

190
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Why are you so stupid?

191
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Who asked you to help?

192
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
I'm still angry with you.

193
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Why am I angry with you?

194
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Don't mind my business from now on.

195
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
What are you doing?

196
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
I'm sorry.

197
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Would you like to see the first class?

198
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
The class will be over soon.

199
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
No.

200
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
No?

201
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
If I didn't come, I would be scared.

202
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Then I'll let you know if I think of something.

203
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Yes.

204
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
But...

205
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
And...

206
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
What?

207
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Oh.

208
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Why?

209
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Hurry up.

210
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Hurry up.

211
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
You crazy bitch.

212
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Why are you here?

213
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Excuse me.

214
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
I heard that you came here often.

215
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Do you remember?

216
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Yes.

217
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
What brings you here?

218
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Oh.

219
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
I'm Detective Han Ji-ok from Bang Joon-ho's police station.

220
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
I have something to investigate.

221
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
This is my regular customer.

222
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
He's a police officer.

223
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
He's a police officer.

224
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
He's a regular customer.

225
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
He's a regular customer.

226
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
He's a regular customer.

227
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Was there anything unusual?

228
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
I don't know.

229
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
He always went out alone.

230
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
He always went out alone.

231
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
But he seems to be

232
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
talking to himself a lot.

233
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
I thought he was drunk.

234
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
But he's fine when he's going out.

235
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
But he's fine when he's going out.

236
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Talking to himself?

237
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
He kept talking about numbers.

238
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
He kept talking about numbers.

239
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
So,

240
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
like counting numbers,

241
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
one, two, three.

242
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Like this.

243
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Then he got in trouble with another customer.

244
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Then he got in trouble with another customer.

245
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven.

246
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven.

247
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven.

248
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Again.

249
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
One, two, three.

250
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
That guy is a little weird.

251
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Excuse me.

252
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Do you have anything to say to me?

253
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Wow.

254
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
That's a lot.

255
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
How do you know that?

256
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
You're crazy.

257
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
You're crazy.

258
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Hey, I think that person

259
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
was wearing glasses.

260
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Hey, I think that person

261
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
was wearing glasses.

262
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Thank you.

263
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
He still carries a notebook.

264
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
He's cute.

265
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Wait a minute.

266
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
He can't carry a notebook?

267
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
He's not carrying a notebook.

268
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
He's carrying a notebook.

269
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
He's carrying a notebook.

270
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
He's carrying a notebook.

271
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
He's carrying a notebook.

272
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
He's carrying a notebook.

273
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
He's carrying a notebook.

274
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
He's carrying a notebook.

275
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Look.

276
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
He didn't come out of the school earlier.

277
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
How can you pretend to know when you know the kids?

278
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
What is he doing?

279
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
He's carrying a notebook.

280
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Crazy bitch.

281
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
What?

282
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Nothing.

283
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Is it because you're tired these days?

284
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Your skin is very damaged, right?

285
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Is it?

286
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
No.

287
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Teacher.

288
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,400
What are you going to do if you get caught dating me?

289
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
I don't know. What should I do?

290
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm going to run away with Hye-young.

291
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
What should I do?

292
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I think I forgot.

293
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I'm a minor.

294
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,400
I'm not the one who's being punished for that, you idiot.

295
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Did you see the news yesterday?

296
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,400
The high school girl teacher had sex with a male student.

297
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
You're so talkative.

298
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,400
The teacher is a problem, but I really don't know what the kids are thinking these days.

299
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
The teacher is pretty, so there are no men who just go in.

300
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,400
What are you talking about?

301
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Teacher, that's sexual harassment.

302
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Is that so?

303
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
I'm sorry.

304
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
It's okay.

305
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Is it okay for men?

306
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Our high school girl teacher looks nice, too.

307
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Be careful.

308
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Don't get caught by weird kids and get caught.

309
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,400
I'm not going to tell the kids.

310
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Let's go.

311
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Let's go.

312
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Teacher, aren't you going to class?

313
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Yes, I have to go.

314
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
I'm going to class.

315
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Do you need about 2,000 won?

316
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Well...

317
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I want to get out of this boring house.

318
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Get out of the house?

319
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Why?

320
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Just?

321
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
I'm sick of it.

322
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,400
This house, the neighborhood, the people...

323
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,400
I don't have a family anyway, but I'll live alone someday.

324
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Isn't your family?

325
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Hey, what kind of family is my uncle?

326
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
He doesn't even care about me anyway.

327
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
But you do have a family.

328
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
What about you?

329
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Do you think your mom is alive?

330
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
I don't know.

331
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Well, if she was alive, wouldn't she have called?

332
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Good job.

333
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Mom, you're like a pig.

334
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,400
What kind of person is this?

335
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
It's a battery in your water.

336
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Hey, Kim Hye-young.

337
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Are you going to sleep in class and go to the bathroom?

338
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
You're so bad.

339
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
What are you doing now?

340
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
What are you doing?

341
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Huh?

342
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
What are you doing?

343
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
What were you doing earlier?

344
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Did you catch me on purpose?

345
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Don't you know anything?

346
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Who's threatening you?

347
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Look.

348
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
You got a picture, didn't you?

349
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
That's Kang Seon-ah.

350
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Kang Seon-ah?

351
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Kang Seon-ah in your room?

352
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
How do you know our relationship? Did you tell her?

353
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
How do I know that?

354
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm a victim, too.

355
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Why are you talking to me?

356
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Kim Hye-young!

357
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
What's your habit of talking to your teacher?

358
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Teacher...

359
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
I'm sorry.

360
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
It's been a while.

361
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Then I'll go to class.

362
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Stupid.

363
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
What do you do with Kang Seon-ah?

364
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
But how did you really do it?

365
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
What picture?

366
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
What picture?

367
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Where did you get it?

368
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Ha...

369
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
I told you to be careful!

370
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
What are you doing?

371
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Why?

372
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Why? Do you know why I'm saying this?

373
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
You're going to break up with me and play with that bitch?

374
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Were we dating?

375
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Hey!

376
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
I told you?

377
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
The picture came out because I told you.

378
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I told you. You told me. Think about it.

379
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
I told you.

380
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
It came out because I thought about it.

381
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Hey, didn't you tell me?

382
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Lower your voice. Lower your voice.

383
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Hey, didn't you say you were going to drink and stuff?

384
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Are you crazy?

385
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
These glasses...

386
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Why?

387
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Did you wear glasses before?

388
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Yeah.

389
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Just because my eyes got worse.

390
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
What are you doing?

391
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Give it to me.

392
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
You can see it, right?

393
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
If you wear these glasses.

394
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
What are you talking about?

395
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
The red line.

396
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,400
You can see it too?

397
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Then...

398
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
How many lines are there on my head right now?

399
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
One.

400
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Five at most. Two of Kim Hye-young.

401
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
One of them is nine lines.

402
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
More than ten lines of the chase.

403
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
The amount of physical strength and math.

404
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Tell me more.

405
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
How?

406
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Where did you get these glasses?

407
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
I just picked it up.

408
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Write it down.

409
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
It's real.

410
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
I told you to give it back to me.

411
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Give it back to me.

412
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
This is dangerous.

413
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
What's so dangerous about glasses?

414
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
You know the incident that happened near your house, right?

415
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
That man was wearing glasses too.

416
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
He saw the S-line.

417
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
S-line?

418
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Oh, there's a name.

419
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
So what?

420
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,400
I'm not curious about who this belongs to.

421
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
This is mine.

422
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
I'm not curious about who this belongs to.

423
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Ms.

424
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Yes?

425
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
You know Sun-ah from your class, right?

426
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Kang Sun-ah.

427
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Yes, why Sun-ah?

428
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
How's your friend?

429
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
She's been acting weird lately.

430
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Oh, really?

431
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
She hasn't been acting weird lately.

432
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Should I talk to her?

433
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
Oh, really?

434
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
No, then I'll talk to her.

435
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
You're looking at my S-line, right?

436
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
No.

437
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,400
But do you know how to get rid of the S-line?

438
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
I don't know.

439
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Well, I guess I just have to kill the enemy.

440
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Are you going to keep the glasses?

441
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Of course.

442
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,400
I'm going to show them how low-class they are.

443
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
I'm going to show them how low-class they are.

444
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Are you sure?

445
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Is this your first time?

446
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
No.

447
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Are you okay?

448
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
Who is it?

449
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
My friend.

450
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Where do you want to go?

451
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
What?

452
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
I think it's a corner.

453
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
What are you doing?

454
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
I can't.

455
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
What is this?

456
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
This is mine.

457
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,400
So you just shut your mouth.

458
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,400
I'm going to show you how to get rid of the S-line.

459
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
It's really good.

460
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
The screen is really...

461
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
But it really looks good on the top.

462
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
What's wrong?

463
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
It's okay.

464
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,400
Excuse me, did you see the glasses over there?

465
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
I'm sorry.

466
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Hello?

467
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
It's you, right?

468
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
You took them, right?

469
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
What are you talking about?

470
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
The glasses!

471
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
The glasses are gone!

472
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
The glasses?

473
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
What do you mean?

474
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
It's late.

475
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Where are you?

476
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,400
I'm going to school.

477
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,400
I'll talk to you later.

478
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
School?

479
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Why are you going to school at this hour?

480
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Hello?

481
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Hey!

482
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
I'm sorry.

483
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,400
It's been a while since I've been on the rooftop.

484
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
How did you know it was me?

485
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,400
Oh, Kim Hye-young told you.

486
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
No one saw you coming, right?

487
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Why are you asking me that?

488
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
What about you?

489
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
You're not really living like that.

490
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
All of a sudden?

491
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
Then,

492
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
can I live like you?

493
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
You were a bully anyway, right?

494
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Not anymore.

495
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Please, Seon-ah.

496
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,400
I have a child, and if I didn't have much, I'd be born a second child.

497
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,400
What are we going to do if I get fired here?

498
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,400
And where do I get 2,000 won for my teacher's salary?

499
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:22,400
You know I was bullied by Choi It-seul.

500
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,400
You guys think I'm a teacher, too.

501
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Because of Choi It-seul's parents.

502
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Seon-ah, I'll apologize for that.

503
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
I'm serious.

504
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Don't be ridiculous.

505
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,400
Seon-ah, then should we do this?

506
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
Please delete the picture on your phone.

507
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Then tomorrow, I'll do whatever you want.

508
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Did you send it?

509
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Did you already send it?

510
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
What are you talking about?

511
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Why?

512
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Why?

513
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Seon-ah.

514
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
Seon-ah.

515
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
Seon-ah.

516
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,400
You're looking for evidence, right?

517
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
Who are you?

518
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
I'm Oh Ban, Lee Kyung-jin.

519
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,400
You think it's suicide?

520
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Do you know whose glasses are these?

521
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,400
Try them on. I think they'll look good on you.

522
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,400
You were preparing to get married.

523
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,400
Why did you break up?

524
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,400
I saw it just before I got married.

525
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
My friend was in bed with me.

526
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
You know, you know,

527
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
this is what you do before you get married.

528
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
This is what you do for your ancestors.

529
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
What if you find out that

530
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,400
someone you know is cheating on you?

531
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
What do you think you'll do?

532
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,400
I'll tell you everything

533
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,400
and I want to see you go to the end.

534
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,400
Don't you ever judge

535
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,400
You don't pray for judge

536
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
It hurts

537
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
How could we know

538
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Our misdeeds

539
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,400
As you hard deny

540
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,400
We're connected to the light

541
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
Like a sign in the sky

542
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,400
So clear there's no need to seek

543
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,400
I follow the line

544
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
That takes me to

545
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,400
The land of the truth

546
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Can you believe this

547
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,400
That everyone gets read for reasons

548
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,400
There's nowhere else to hide

549
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,400
The past, late

550
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,400
I think we just gotta stay

551
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
Between the lines

552
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,400
What is real, what is not

553
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,400
How are you so sure

554
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,400
Still insecure by myself

555
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
How could we know

556
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
It's on the fire

557
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,400
Everending lullaby

558
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,400
We're tangled with the lies

559
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,400
Denying

560
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,400
Yeah, we're tangled with

561
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,400
The lies

562
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
Thanks for watching!
