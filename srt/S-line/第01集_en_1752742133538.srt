1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

3
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,020
oh

4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Paragoh Out

5
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,780
resonators i go

6
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,780
I said I'm not going to ride it!

7
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,780
Yang Seon!

8
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,780
Yang Seon

9
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,780
Yang Seon

10
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,780
Yang Seon

11
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,780
Yang Seon

12
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,780
Yang Seon

13
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,780
Yang Seon

14
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,780
Yang Seon

15
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,780
Yang Seon

16
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,780
There are things you don't have to see in life

17
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,780
Eat

18
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,780
No

19
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,780
There are things you can't see

20
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,780
I've been looking at these lines since I was born

21
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,780
Can you tell me the truth?

22
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,780
No, no, no

23
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,780
It's precious, but it's related to my manager and my girlfriend

24
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,780
As I grew up, I naturally learned what these lines meant

25
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,780
What did you say?

26
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,780
I also learned that I'm the only one who can see these lines

27
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,780
I was a cursed child who saw what others couldn't see

28
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,780
I made my mom crazy and killed my dad

29
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,780
The red lines that were natural to me began to have meaning

30
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,780
I was a cursed child who saw what others couldn't see

31
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,780
The moment I learned that the fact that I saw the red lines could kill people

32
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,780
I closed my mouth and closed my eyes

33
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,780
I wanted to give up everything

34
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,780
But I didn't die

35
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,780
I survived every time as if someone was teasing me

36
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,780
One day, I became completely alone

37
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,780
I decided

38
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,780
If I had to live anyway, why did I have these lines?

39
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,780
I wanted to know who made these lines

40
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,780
Who is looking at these lines instead of me

41
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,780
And how can I get rid of this curse

42
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,780
The doorbell rings

43
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,780
Excuse me, are you there?

44
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,780
I moved to Apdong a few days ago

45
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,780
I was going to make rice cake, but people don't eat rice cake these days

46
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,780
So I bought some fruits

47
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,780
Do you like fruits?

48
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,780
I didn't eat fruits when I was young, but I couldn't eat them after I grew up

49
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,780
I'll leave it here, so make sure you eat it before it gets rotten

50
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,780
I'm going to make rice cake

51
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,780
I'm going to make rice cake

52
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,780
I'm going to make rice cake

53
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,780
I'm going to make rice cake

54
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,780
I'm going to make rice cake

55
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,780
I'm going to make rice cake

56
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,780
I'm going to make rice cake

57
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,780
I'm going to make rice cake

58
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,780
I'm going to make rice cake

59
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,780
I'm going to make rice cake

60
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,780
I'm going to make rice cake

61
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,780
I'm going to make rice cake

62
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,780
I'm going to make rice cake

63
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,780
I'm going to make rice cake

64
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,780
I'm going to make rice cake

65
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,780
I'm going to make rice cake

66
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,780
A few days ago

67
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,780
The rice cake was frozen

68
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,780
I'm going to cut it into small pieces

69
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,780
I'm going to make rice cake

70
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,780
I'm going to cut it into small pieces

71
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,780
What the...

72
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Hey, I'm sorry.

73
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,780
What?

74
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,780
Nothing. See you later.

75
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,780
Did you scratch my car again?

76
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,780
Hey, is today some kind of day?

77
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,780
Why are you here at this hour?

78
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,780
I know. What are you doing?

79
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,780
I was going to sing an uncle's song after a long time.

80
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,780
You can't do anything that people don't do.

81
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,780
Oh, that high school student's nephew?

82
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,780
High school students these days are the best.

83
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,780
I'm the best.

84
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,780
But what can I do? I'm the only one.

85
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,780
Then what if Detective Han gets married?

86
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,780
Marry?

87
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,780
I'm going to cry at my wedding.

88
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Why are you going to my wedding?

89
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,780
Because you're my colleague.

90
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,780
Why?

91
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
I suddenly thought of something to do.

92
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,780
What?

93
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,780
Did you suddenly think of something to do?

94
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,780
I thought you were addicted to sex, but you're pretty picky.

95
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,780
Sorry.

96
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Seon-ah, I told you not to flirt.

97
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,780
Why are you going so far?

98
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,780
Hey, give it to me.

99
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,780
Come here.

100
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,780
I told you to flirt.

101
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,780
You're a jerk.

102
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,780
Seon-ah, are you okay? Seon-ah, are you hurt?

103
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Seon-ah, stand up.

104
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,780
Seon-ah.

105
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,780
You didn't bring the money I told you to bring.

106
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,780
Why are you so stubborn?

107
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
You did it.

108
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Hold this.

109
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,780
Oh, Seon-ah.

110
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,780
Seon-ah, you have to pay more.

111
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,780
Get up.

112
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Oh, it's heavy.

113
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Get up.

114
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
Hey.

115
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,780
You said your uncle was a cop.

116
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
It's obvious.

117
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,780
And why are you ignoring my phone and text messages?

118
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,780
It's really heavy.

119
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
Are you laughing?

120
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,780
If you call me again,

121
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,780
I'll really lose you here.

122
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,780
Okay?

123
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,780
Hey, Seon-ah.

124
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,780
Yes?

125
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,780
What's the news?

126
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,780
29-year-old woman is living alone.

127
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,780
She was a manager at a nearby cafe.

128
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,780
What about her family?

129
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,780
No siblings.

130
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Only two parents.

131
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
They live in the countryside.

132
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,780
What about her kids?

133
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,780
Well, I'll check it out.

134
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,780
I put the floor mat on the table, but the things are still there.

135
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
The body is clean.

136
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,780
Do you think I put a British model there?

137
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,780
Huh?

138
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,780
This place looks good.

139
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,780
Is it a famous place?

140
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,780
No.

141
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,780
It's a famous restaurant that only residents know.

142
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,780
Check.

143
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,780
Yes.

144
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,780
Detective Han.

145
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,780
I saw the evidence of residents on the first floor.

146
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,780
The man in the helmet went up to the villa where the woman lives last night.

147
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,780
What?

148
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,780
I think he's a delivery man at a restaurant.

149
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,780
Hey, I don't know what his purpose is.

150
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,780
He has money and no signs of sexual assault.

151
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,780
He doesn't like to go to the victim's house.

152
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,780
He's just a cheap guy.

153
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,780
Is he just a cheap guy?

154
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
There's no such thing as cheap.

155
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,780
What happened to the delivery man?

156
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,780
He ordered it from her house a lot, but she never ordered it that day.

157
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,780
Have you investigated her relationship?

158
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,780
She said she had a boyfriend, but it seems to have ended almost a year ago.

159
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
Shall we look for it?

160
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
Yes.

161
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,780
Hello, everyone.

162
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,780
This is An Ju-young from NFL News.

163
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,780
I will give you the news of Tuesday, July 25th.

164
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,780
A murder case occurred in a villa in Sinu-dong this afternoon.

165
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,780
A woman in her 20s was killed.

166
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,780
Recently, a third murder case took place near Sinu-dong.

167
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,780
But there is no evidence to identify the culprit yet.

168
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,780
The police are also suffering from the investigation.

169
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,780
Even the residents of the neighborhood are nervous.

170
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,780
This is a report from reporter Park Sung-heon.

171
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:28,780
Today, a woman in her 20s who lived alone in a villa in Sinu-dong was found dead.

172
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:37,780
The police are investigating the case of a forced entry into the house.

173
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,780
Recently, a woman in her 30s who lived alone in a villa in Sinu-dong was found dead.

174
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,780
It's hard to forget the person who has hundreds of S-lines.

175
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,780
But it's not that I can't see the person who has only one S-line.

176
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:58,780
If I were the person who was trying to do something in a murder case...

177
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,780
I didn't hear anything strange.

178
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,780
But these days, I'm in the living room every day after night.

179
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,780
I'm so tired that I can't even eat.

180
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,780
I'm so tired.

181
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,780
Yes, this is 111.

182
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,780
The man in the hair dress in the last edit...

183
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,780
Yes, I'm listening. Tell me.

184
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,780
Hello?

185
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,780
Hello?

186
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,780
Hello?

187
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,780
I'm sorry.

188
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,780
You're not coming, are you?

189
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,780
What is this?

190
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,780
What is this?

191
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,780
What is this?

192
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,780
What is this?

193
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,780
What is this?

194
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,780
What is this?

195
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Oh my gosh.

196
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,780
You didn't go to school?

197
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,780
I'm sorry.

198
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,780
Give me some money.

199
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,780
Use this later. I'll get you more.

200
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,780
How much more can you give me?

201
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,780
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

202
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,780
Are you getting beaten up?

203
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,780
It's a post-mortem.

204
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,780
How much more can you give me?

205
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,780
Why do you need money?

206
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,780
I'm sorry.

207
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,780
Hey.

208
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,780
What?

209
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,780
I got a call yesterday.

210
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,780
They reported about your grandma.

211
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,780
You never mentioned that the delivery man could be a suspect.

212
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,780
Where's the location?

213
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
Wait a minute.

214
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,780
This is Sinu-dong.

215
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,780
Wanseong Villa, Na-dong.

216
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,780
Isn't this your house?

217
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,780
Na-dong?

218
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,780
I'm Han Ji-wook, a police officer at Bangju Police Station.

219
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,780
Are you in there?

220
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:58,780
I've never seen so many people in S-line up close.

221
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:08,780
Hello.

222
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,780
It's no use.

223
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,780
It won't come out.

224
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,780
It's famous for its trash in the neighborhood.

225
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,780
There are people who throw away the trash.

226
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:26,780
Hello.

227
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,780
It'll be a minute.

228
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,780
You reported to the police yesterday, right?

229
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,780
If you've seen anything, please tell me.

230
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:46,780
It could be an important evidence of the murder that occurred nearby.

231
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:56,780
Excuse me.

232
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,780
Student?

233
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Do you have parents?

234
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,780
I saw it wrong.

235
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,780
What?

236
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:10,780
I saw it wrong and reported it.

237
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,780
Can you tell me more about the situation at the time?

238
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,780
I saw a man in a helmet going into the opposite side of the building.

239
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,780
I thought the woman was dangerous.

240
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,780
A woman?

241
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:29,780
The woman who moved in 204, next to the man.

242
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,780
There's been a lot of cases these days.

243
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:39,780
But she was a lover.

244
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,780
Aren't you a student?

245
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,780
You're not going to school?

246
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:56,780
These days, these guys are really...

247
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:06,780
But how do I know that I'm doing it over there?

248
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:36,780
I'm sorry.

249
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:06,780
I'm sorry.

250
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:36,780
I'm sorry.

251
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:46,780
Fuck.

252
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:16,780
Fuck.

253
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:26,780
Fuck.

254
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:36,780
What's this?

255
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,780
I'm not buying it.

256
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,780
Why?

257
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,780
I'm not buying it.

258
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,780
You're going to keep going.

259
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,780
It's amazing.

260
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,780
How much is it?

261
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
That's not Korean.

262
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,780
My mom bought it.

263
00:27:50,780 --> 00:28:00,780
Don't be ridiculous.

264
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,780
Hey.

265
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,780
You know the boyfriend of the woman who killed Shin Ho-dong?

266
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,780
It's a high school teacher named Woo Jung-min.

267
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:16,780
His address is 303 Wanseong Villa, Nadoong.

268
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,780
Isn't it weird that it's so close?

269
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
And the murder case last month.

270
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:27,780
She was also in the same gym with Woo Jung-min a few weeks ago.

271
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,780
It's the same.

272
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,780
Nadoong 303?

273
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,780
Do you have a picture?

274
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,780
Yeah.

275
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,780
I don't think it's coming out.

276
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,780
It's famous for being a garbage dump in the neighborhood.

277
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,780
There are people who clean up the garbage.

278
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
303, this bastard.

279
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:55,780
It means that both the murdered and the woman were at the funeral.

280
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,780
It's a coincidence, right?

281
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,780
Right?

282
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:10,780
We don't just leave these coincidences.

283
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:20,780
Hello?

284
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Yes.

285
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
You go ahead.

286
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,780
I'll stop by yesterday.

287
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:38,780
Yes.

288
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:51,780
Are you a family member of a patient?

289
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,780
The new caretaker disappeared while we were away for a while.

290
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,780
I'm looking through the internal data right now.

291
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:19,780
You must have been surprised, but please wait a minute.

292
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:29,780
What should I do?

293
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,780
Come on, come on.

294
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,780
Oh, sir.

295
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,780
Why did you go up there?

296
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
Oh, my God.

297
00:31:33,780 --> 00:32:00,780
I'm sorry.

298
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:27,780
What the hell is this?

299
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:37,780
What?

300
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:47,780
What?

301
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:56,780
I'm on my way.

302
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,780
Is it weird here?

303
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
What's weird?

304
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,780
Are you here?

305
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,780
What's weird?

306
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,780
What?

307
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Hello?

308
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
Dongsik.

309
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
Oh Dongsik.

310
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:32,780
What is this?

311
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:12,780
There's only one left.

312
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:55,780
Oh, my God.

313
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:18,780
I'm sorry.

314
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:41,780
I'm sorry.

315
00:35:41,780 --> 00:36:04,780
I'm sorry.

316
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:36,780
I'm sorry.

317
00:36:36,780 --> 00:37:05,780
I'm sorry.

318
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:15,780
You're here?

319
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,780
Jungmin.

320
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,780
How have you been?

321
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:51,780
What are we going to do?

322
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:58,780
We're all on our way to salvation.

323
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:08,780
Stop it.

324
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:19,780
You're Marci Picchi.

325
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,780
Poke it with that.

326
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
Poke it.

327
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,780
Huh?

328
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,780
I told you to poke it.

329
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Are you going to poke it?

330
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:44,780
Huh?

331
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:07,780
What are you talking about?

332
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Where's the glasses?

333
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
Where's the glasses?

334
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,780
It's okay.

335
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,780
I'm not wearing it.

336
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:25,780
Where's the glasses?

337
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
It's okay.

338
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,780
I'm not wearing it.

339
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:38,780
Where's the glasses?

340
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:44,780
Hey!

341
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,780
Hey!

342
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,780
Let go of me.

343
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:57,780
What?

344
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:19,780
What is this?

345
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:29,780
Hey!

346
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:38,780
I wish I didn't have to.

347
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:48,780
Die.

348
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:34,780
Die!

349
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:44,780
I'm sorry.

350
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:14,780
I'm sorry.

351
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,780
I'm losing my hands.

352
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,780
Did he see the mess line like I did?

353
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:54,780
What should I do?

354
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:04,780
Glasses?

355
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:14,780
I'm sorry.

356
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:27,780
You don't really have to go to the hospital?

357
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:33,780
Who is the dead man?

358
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,780
I'll tell you later.

359
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,780
I have to go to the police station anyway.

360
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,780
Uncle.

361
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
What's going on?

362
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:49,780
Hey, why can't you contact me?

363
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:57,780
Sunglasses in the middle of the night...

364
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:07,780
Do you know each other?

365
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,780
Why?

366
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,780
Don't come in if you're not going to pay.

367
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:23,780
Am I your ATM?

368
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:29,780
What's wrong with you at school?

369
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,780
Tell me.

370
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,780
What's the difference?

371
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,780
If there's a problem, you have to solve it.

372
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,780
Solve?

373
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,780
How do you solve something?

374
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
What are you going to solve?

375
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,780
You're pretending to be a guardian and you're going to school with me?

376
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,780
You're going to disappear anyway.

377
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,780
Since when did you take care of me?

378
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,780
What the hell?

379
00:44:51,780 --> 00:45:00,780
This girl is really...

380
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:08,780
But why was she out of the house?

381
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,780
How do you know her?

382
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,780
Middle school classmate.

383
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,780
When she was young, her mom killed her dad and ran away.

384
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:33,780
Don't you know?

385
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,780
Thank you.

386
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:44,780
I thought the first S-line I saw could save people.

387
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:54,780
What should I do now?

388
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,780
Guys, be careful.

389
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,780
A new friend came to our class today.

390
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:25,780
His name is Shin Hyun-heuk.

391
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,780
I can see you.

392
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,780
If I wear this glasses.

393
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,780
Red line.

394
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:35,780
You can see that too?

395
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,780
But why are you looking at this again?

396
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,780
You caught the criminal.

397
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,780
It's frustrating.

398
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,780
What?

399
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,780
I don't understand why you killed him.

400
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,780
Are you going to keep your glasses?

401
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,780
Of course.

402
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,780
Did you eat something wrong?

403
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,780
You're embarrassed now.

404
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,780
Why am I embarrassed?

405
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,780
Sun-ah, no matter what, violence is bad.

406
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,780
I'm going to kill you.

407
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,780
I'm going to kill you.

408
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,780
I'm going to kill you.

409
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,780
I'm going to kill you.

410
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,780
I'm going to kill you.

411
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,780
I'm going to kill you.

412
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,780
I'm going to kill you.

413
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,780
I'm going to kill you.

414
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,780
I'm going to kill you.

415
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,780
I'm going to kill you.

416
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,780
I'm going to kill you.

417
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,780
I'm going to kill you.

418
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,780
I'm going to kill you.

419
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,780
I'm going to kill you.

420
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,780
I'm going to kill you.

421
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,780
I'm going to kill you.

422
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,780
What is now?

423
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,780
How are you so sure?

424
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,780
Still insecure by myself.

425
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,780
How could we know?

426
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,780
It's on the fire.

427
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,780
Everending lullaby.

428
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,780
We're tangled with the lies.

429
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,780
Denying.

430
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:47,780
Yeah, we're tangled with the lies.

431
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:15,780
Thanks for watching!
