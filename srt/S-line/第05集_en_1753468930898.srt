00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Huh?

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,080
Hope you press like and subscribe if you like this video!

00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Uncle, wake up!

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,440
Uncle, wake up!

47
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,740
Uncle!

48
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,740
I'm not doing anything.

49
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,020
No.

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,340
Kang Seon-ah.

52
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,960
There was nothing I wanted in life.

53
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,360
All I wanted was a life that wasn't

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,540
a mess.

55
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,140
That's all I wanted.

56
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,140
But the things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The things I wanted to get away from came back to me as a homework.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
When did he...

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's amazing.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hey, come here.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why?

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Come here.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Look down.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why?

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Look down.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why?

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What?

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When did you say you met Jae-hye?

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
At university.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Before that?

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Didn't you have any friends?

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I did.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How many?

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
One.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're a different person from me.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's so weird.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why are you wearing glasses all of a sudden?

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you trying to see me as the criminal?

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You don't look good in them.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I know that.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's going on?

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you a student at Bangju High School?

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Come here.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Come here.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Can a detective do this?

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Bring me the warrant.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're talking like a warrant.

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you going to arrest me?

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're asking me to go to the friend's hospital.

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I have something to check.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Who's your friend?

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What do you check?

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm not sure.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Come here.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Wait here.

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wait.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Can I go now?

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Wait.

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you know that you're Seon-ah's other boyfriend?

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Boyfriend?

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Can't you be a detective?

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't know about boyfriends, but I think there are people who hate them.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is that you, detective?

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't talk nonsense and say it straight.

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You know, I just talk like this.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm going to kill the devil-like bastard later.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think I hate Kim Hye-young more than I hate her.

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Isn't it Hyun-woo's birthday next week?

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
When is it?

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
November 1st.

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's do a live broadcast.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't like it.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why?

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I've never done that before.

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But I'm sorry, but you don't have a choice.

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Do you want to see me first before we all meet?

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm so happy.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I bought a new ribbon.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't like it.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You don't like it?

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ji-won.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What are you talking about?

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ji-won.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hey, Ji-won.

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey, don't you have practice today?

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why did you come to school?

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm going to school.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm going to school.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm going to school.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm going to school.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm going to school.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Are you crazy?

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Why are you so emotional today?

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's wrong with her?

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Do you want me to try it?

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why aren't you coming?

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hey.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I think the minor assault case has happened.

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Soomin can go in there.

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I think it would be nice if you could go in there too.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Who is it?

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
A week ago,

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I went to my senior's house and drank with him.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I was close with him who practiced idol together.

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We were drinking together,

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and I lost my mind for a moment.

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
When I woke up,

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I was wearing underwear upside down.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What about your brother who was with you?

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He left a message saying he was going out first.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Have you ever been in a relationship before?

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No.

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why are you lying?

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What?

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Nothing.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's go see my senior tomorrow.

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hello.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I didn't graduate from high school.

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What are you talking about?

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I thought I would go to high school after graduating from school.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I know.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There are a lot of accidents at school these days.

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Detective.

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hello.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hello.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What are you talking about?

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're hiding it alone.

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's nice to see you again.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But it's not a good thing, is it?

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
How is Seon-ah?

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
She's still at the hospital.

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm thinking of going with the kids.

190
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Is it okay?

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's still a little...

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, I see.

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But you're wearing glasses.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It looks good on you.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It looks good on me?

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Your ears are red.

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You know Seon-ah from the 7th grade, right?

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No, yes.

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes.

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Seon-ah.

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What's the relationship between the first-year-old and Yoon Jin-ho?

202
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Just...

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I know a lot of them.

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I was a trainee with them before.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Did you drink with them at your own office on the evening of September 20th?

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes.

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Where are your parents?

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They're abroad.

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I came in to study there, and I'm living alone.

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Can you high school students drink like this?

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What's so confident about it?

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry, detective.

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I was studying and I got stressed out.

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Are you here as a victim of sexual assault?

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Do you know?

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Is that what Yoon Jin-ah is?

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I didn't sleep with her.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't want to sleep with her.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Kids these days are scary.

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
They look so scary.

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What will come out of the investigation team?

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm going to be scared.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm going to be scared.

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I was going to tell you first.

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Give it to me.

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is evidence of the case, so I can't give it to you.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Can I just use the evidence like that?

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I should test what it's for.

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Then I should send it to the surveillance team.

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's right.

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But the moment I put on this glasses,

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Wow, that's true.

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I got goosebumps all over my body.

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
How lucky is it that I trust you now?

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You trust me too.

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't believe you.

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Throw it away right now.

239
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Calm down.

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What's wrong with you?

241
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Detective.

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You don't know even after seeing Seon-ah?

243
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And that man upstairs.

244
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I said I found that glasses at the scene.

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You don't know?

246
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Every time an incident occurs, it's connected to glasses.

247
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's dangerous to have it.

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hey, you're good at talking.

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's why I have to use it more.

250
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And what's the use of glasses?

251
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Glasses are not dangerous.

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't know how to make glasses detective.

253
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What's going on?

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What's wrong with Hyun-woo?

255
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's nothing.

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He's my neighborhood.

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Our Hyun-woo is a really special kid.

259
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Would you like to have dinner with me soon?

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Pardon?

261
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No, I'll contact you.

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hello.

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You're early.

264
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Have a seat.

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yoon-jin.

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I brought him here myself.

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But he didn't want to work hard.

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So I told him to quit if he didn't want to.

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't force him to do that.

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He's a science star.

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What kind of student is Yoon-jin?

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What kind of student is Yoon-jin?

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm just saying.

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm just saying.

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He's not that talented.

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If he's not talented, he needs to work hard.

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But he can't do both.

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And he likes to play.

279
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He's always drinking with other trainees.

280
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Can't you just stop talking about this?

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't just let him go.

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Don't judge him yet.

283
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I hate this kind of thing.

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What is it?

285
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's a truth-telling workshop.

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And they're both minors.

287
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's a sensitive case.

288
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I can't just let them go.

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
100% sure lie detection.

290
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Is there anything like that?

291
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It doesn't make sense.

292
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What?

293
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Nothing.

294
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Do you like the Seon-hwa teacher?

295
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What?

296
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What are you talking about?

297
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm just saying.

298
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I was a bit lazy.

299
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I always ask to see you.

300
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm a senior in high school.

301
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm not even a trainee.

302
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Can I see your text?

303
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Sure.

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I deleted all your texts.

305
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I washed all your underwear.

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I reported you a week after the incident.

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Did you ever think it would be unfavorable to you?

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I told you.

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I didn't want to believe it.

310
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You could be arrested for nothing.

311
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Detective.

312
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm Jina's brother.

313
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's not Jina's fault.

314
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Wait.

315
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Wait.

316
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'll ask you one last time.

318
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What is the relationship between you two?

319
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Are you sure there was a relationship between you two?

320
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You don't have to send this to the prosecutor.

321
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What?

322
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Hey, sunglasses.

323
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Why aren't you singing today?

324
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
When did I ever sing like that?

325
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What?

326
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Hey.

327
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
A gift?

328
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It might not be a gift.

329
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I saw your case.

330
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's not your fault that your parents did that.

331
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm just afraid you might think that way.

332
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This is what it looked like.

333
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's different from the face I remember.

334
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Do you want to find your mom?

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Seon-ah said that.

336
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
If she were alive, wouldn't she come to see me?

337
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
As you said, these glasses might be dangerous,

338
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
but it could definitely help someone.

339
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Just like you saved the woman in room 204.

340
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So who are you looking for?

341
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You know the friend named Yoon Jin-ah in your class?

342
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes.

343
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
She reported it as sexual assault.

344
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I confirmed it as a false accusation.

345
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
With this.

346
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
There was no S-line between the two.

347
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
She said she had no sexual experience,

348
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
but she had four S-lines.

349
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
She was so mean because she was an idol.

350
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
She's a teacher.

351
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What Yoon Jin-ah said could be true.

352
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
She didn't have any S-lines a week ago.

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Hey.

354
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Did you hand over the case already?

355
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
No, I'm cleaning it up.

356
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Don't hand it over yet.

357
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What?

358
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm starting over.

359
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't think this is right.

360
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Seohan.

361
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's the police. Are you in there?

362
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Seohan.

363
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Hello, detective.

364
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Can I come in for a second?

365
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes, please.

366
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Wow, the house is so clean.

367
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yes, I have a little bit of a headache.

368
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Did you drink here?

369
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I was sitting here and eating and fainted, so I laid down on the bed.

370
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Do you have any alcoholics you drank?

371
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
No, I don't have a personality to collect things like that.

372
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Guys.

373
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Yes?

374
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I have to leave early tomorrow morning.

375
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Can I sleep a little?

376
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yes.

377
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I went back by chance, but there were glasses in the bathroom.

378
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What if the detective had the glasses delivered intentionally by someone?

379
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's impossible.

380
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
How do you know I'll go there again?

381
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm not sure.

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm not sure.

383
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm not sure.

384
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm not sure.

385
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm sorry. How do you know I'll go there again?

386
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Everything doesn't make sense now anyway.

387
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm looking at the S-line.

388
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That glasses.

389
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
There must be someone who brought the glasses in the bathroom.

390
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Who is that?

391
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I don't know.

392
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I don't know.

393
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I don't know.

394
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't know.

395
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't know.

396
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't know.

397
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I don't know.

398
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I don't know.

399
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I don't know.

400
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't know.

401
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't know.

402
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't know.

403
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I don't know.

404
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I don't know.

405
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
What if the detective has the glasses delivered intentionally by someone?

406
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That's impossible.

407
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm not sure.

408
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm not sure.

409
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't know.

410
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I don't know.

411
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't know.

412
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I don't know.

413
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I don't know.

414
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't know.

415
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't know.

416
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't know.

417
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I don't know.

418
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But why are you here again?

419
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I left something at work.

420
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Aren't you scared?

421
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm a little scared.

422
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You said you saw something weird in my eyes.

423
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yeah.

424
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Now...

425
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Your head...

426
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh, my God.

427
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Don't do it.

428
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If I get an S-line...

429
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
If I'm with you...

430
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What?

431
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I think it'll be okay if I see something weird.

432
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Let's find out.

433
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Who did this in the morning?

434
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That's nice.

435
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,180
Why not.

436
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,300
I think that's a good idea.

437
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,900
We broke it.

438
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'll be there.

439
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Okay.

440
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Thank you.

441
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
How long will it take?

442
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
From the National Institute of Technology.

443
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's fast.

444
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yes.

445
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
No, but how did you think of finding a blanket?

446
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That sheet.

447
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The color of the sheet kept getting in the way.

448
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It doesn't look good on the house.

449
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's not a trash can, so I had to take care of it.

450
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That means there's something wrong with it.

451
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Oh, but...

452
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I don't understand.

453
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It means that you learn to escape from mutual interaction with others.

454
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Seo Hanyu, come out.

455
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I can't see you.

456
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You're not giving me food?

457
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm hungry.

458
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'll ask you again.

459
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Why did you throw away the bed sheet?

460
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I have a constipation.

461
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I think I said five times that I couldn't sleep in a blanket because I had that constipation.

462
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
How do you explain Yoon Jin-ah's blood?

463
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I don't know.

464
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I don't know if she spilled her nose while sleeping or if she had a period.

465
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Hanyu.

466
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You know you didn't do anything.

467
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I completely believe you.

468
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Do you know why?

469
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Handsome kids like us don't leave the girls alone.

470
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yoon Jin-ah said she was the first one to get infected.

471
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You weren't even interested.

472
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Honestly, it's not my style.

473
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Other girls say they're pretty, but I said I'd come anyway.

474
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I gave him some leftover alcohol at home, and he drank it all by himself.

475
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Do you have alcohol at home?

476
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
What was it?

477
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I like whiskey, too.

478
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Green paddock.

479
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So?

480
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He was drunk and went crazy because he didn't want to go home.

481
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
He said he wanted to drink more.

482
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So I bought him a beer at the convenience store.

483
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Then he took it right away.

484
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's a good thing I got a shot.

485
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
How do you buy alcohol at the convenience store?

486
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
They don't check the convenience store.

487
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Go check it out.

488
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Glampid?

489
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Hey, this is the only parking lot that's properly protected from the office.

490
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
There are a lot of people who come and go because there are so many generations.

491
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
The time Yoon Jin-ah went in, the time she went to the convenience store, and the time she left in the morning.

492
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's all the same.

493
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
How long does it take to get beer?

494
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
About 5 to 10 minutes?

495
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Then someone goes into the room in the meantime.

496
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Then there's an S-line.

497
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That means he was already unconscious before drinking beer.

498
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
What line?

499
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Huh?

500
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
No.

501
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Hey, stop that.

502
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
When did these guys come in?

503
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
About an hour ago?

504
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah, here.

505
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
There was a CCTV on the back door of the office, right?

506
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
No, there's none.

507
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Turn it back.

508
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
One, two, three.

509
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:56,000
One, two, three, four, five.

510
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Six to seven.

511
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Four to five.

512
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
One, two, three.

513
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You bastards.

514
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Let's go.

515
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh, my God.

516
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's a waste of time.

517
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Please call a lawyer.

518
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What are you doing?

519
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Hey.

520
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Can you send me the video?

521
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Okay.

522
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I'll send it to you.

523
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Can you please send it to me?

524
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I didn't do anything.

525
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Please send it home.

526
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm really going to die.

527
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Please.

528
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'll take you home.

529
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Let's go.

530
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Detective.

531
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Huh?

532
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's the other side of my house.

533
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah, I know.

534
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Where are you going?

535
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Hey, how's the second car?

536
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It's okay, right?

537
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Can you tell me where you're going?

538
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Why does the signal take so long to change?

539
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Why are you here?

540
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Do you know where this is?

541
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Detective, get down.

542
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
What should we eat?

543
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What?

544
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Do you want a glass of soju?

545
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Hey, we don't have much time.

546
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The case will be solved soon.

547
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
He doesn't have a reason to be here.

548
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's good to keep talking.

549
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But you should write your impression.

550
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Why?

551
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Don't you know?

552
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That's just before the five o'clock.

553
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,000
We just have to write our impressions as serious as possible and wait.

554
00:38:49,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I think it's only 10 minutes.

555
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Detective, come out for a second.

556
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
What?

557
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
No, wait a minute.

558
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Where are you going?

559
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
No, just in front of here.

560
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Just a second.

561
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I can't.

562
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Where are you going?

563
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Can you really send me home?

564
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
No, no, just look at the case director and then go to the police station.

565
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Oh, my God.

566
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:33,000
He's very self-confident.

567
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Oh, my God.

568
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Isn't he running so fast?

569
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yes.

570
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Detective.

571
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Huh?

572
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I really want to go home.

573
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'll take you home.

574
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'll go to the police station first.

575
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Why?

576
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
What about the kids?

577
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I sent them all.

578
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Why?

579
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I don't think there's anything special.

580
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
What about me?

581
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Why don't you send me home?

582
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You don't think there's anything special?

583
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh, my God.

584
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Oh, this isn't it.

585
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh, my God.

586
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh, this isn't it.

587
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Get hurt. Calm down.

588
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Oh, my God.

589
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Detective.

590
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:56,000
If you really tell me the truth, I won't get caught.

591
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Well, let's see how you say it.

592
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I did.

593
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I didn't do it alone.

594
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm so unfair.

595
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
No, he planned everything.

596
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I told him that Yoon Jin-ah was pretty, but he suddenly called the kids and asked how much he would give if he did it with Yoon Jin-ah.

597
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I just thought it would be nice to drink together, so I went.

598
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
But when Hanyu passed by in the pharmacy...

599
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
No, detective.

600
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
No, Hanyu ordered it all.

601
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That Hanyu.

602
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So I didn't do it alone.

603
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I just did it with everyone.

604
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Can you please look at me?

605
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Everything was done by Hanyu.

606
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I just did it because my friends did it.

607
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Hanyu was sitting and watching from the beginning to the end.

608
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
This is yours, right?

609
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
What is it?

610
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It came out of your room.

611
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,000
There's no sign of digestion.

612
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Did you give this to Yoon Jin-ah?

613
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Do you have any evidence?

614
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I just had this for fun.

615
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Then should we see if the court is having fun?

616
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Did the kids solve it all?

617
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:38,000
That there are four witnesses?

618
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm not the one who did the liver, but those bastards.

619
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah, and you're the main character.

620
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You're a piece of trash.

621
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Detective.

622
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah?

623
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Are they being punished?

624
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
We did everything we could.

625
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
The court will decide for itself.

626
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It would be best if you put on these glasses to the judge.

627
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You can't see the truth even if you wear glasses.

628
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah.

629
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
If I have a lot of West Line like you, I won't be okay, right?

630
00:43:48,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Are you making me pay again?

631
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You can walk down here, right?

632
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I have to go somewhere in a hurry.

633
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yes.

634
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
When did it disappear?

635
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Why are you always like this?

636
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Are you sure you're not in the hospital?

637
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I...

638
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I found it on the roof last time.

639
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Can you come in and see it?

640
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It's our first time seeing him, but I don't know how he got in.

641
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Mr. Danim?

642
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Dongsik, please give me Lee Gyu-jin's ID.

643
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:16,000
What?

644
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:26,000
What?

645
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Father.

646
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Father, how did you get here?

647
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Son, I'm here.

648
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:21,000
What?

649
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,000
What should I do?

650
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Take your hands off.

651
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Take your hands off!

652
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
What did you do to Seon-woo?

653
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Tell me.

654
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
What?

655
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Tell me.

656
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Son.

657
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Son.

658
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Son.

659
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:42,000
What are you doing?

660
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:52,000
What are you doing?

661
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:02,000
What should I do?

662
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:32,000
What should I do?

663
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Son.

664
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Please help me.

665
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I have a favor to ask you.

666
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
If you don't like it, you can refuse it.

667
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Do you like me?

668
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:47,000
If I'm with someone, I just thought it would be you.

669
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I think you dropped this earlier.

670
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Doctor, please help me.

671
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm not coming out even if you ask me to.

672
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I'm not a person named Lee Gyu-jin.

673
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You know what it means in your head, right?

674
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:30,000
If you don't like it, the whole world will be stained red.

675
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'm sorry.

676
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm sorry.

677
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I'm sorry.

678
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I'm sorry.

679
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I'm sorry.
