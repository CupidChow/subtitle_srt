1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,720
What do you have to say

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,040
about the statue
last night?

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,440
We feed you

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,960
and give you
a place to live,

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,680
is this
how you repay us?

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,840
Stop.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,440
What happened
last night?

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,880
It was my fault.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,880
I wasn't careful enough
with the statue.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,920
Maybe someone was jealous
of us and did it.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,620
Where were you
all day yesterday?

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,100
We were worried
about you.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,640
Go back to your room
and rest.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,120
Come with me.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,440
I got something new.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,880
The barbs are small.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,400
It barely leaves a mark.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,800
I think

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
you'll be fine
after a day or two of rest.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,580
You should try it.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,860
You go out once,

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,620
and you forget
all the pain?

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,280
You're part
of this family.

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,800
You only
have two choices.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,840
Be loyal,

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,800
or die.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,720
Behave yourself,

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,600
and keep making
your sculptures.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,440
Stop thinking
about killing yourself.

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,400
You know it, don't you?

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,560
That bracelet
tells me everything.

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,840
If you dare
think of dying again,

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,720
I'll make you suffer
a hundred times worse.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,960
In a few days,

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,640
I'll send Kevin over.

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,440
Be obedient.

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,120
Mr. Napat.

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,280
Well... That waiter...

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,880
If you can't find him,

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,240
you'll be the target.

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,440
Calm down.

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,200
I don't know why

43
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,160
he's so hard
to trace down.

44
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,520
How about this?

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,360
Give me...

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,080
Three days.

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,240
You must find him,
no matter what.

48
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
Even if he's dead,

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,520
bring me his corpse.

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,200
I'll see for myself.

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,840
Who are you, really?

52
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,760
Where are you?

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,600
(Dad,)

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,360
(no matter
how much you beat me,)

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,080
(I'll endure it.)

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,880
(Until one day,
I'm strong enough)

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,360
(to escape this place)

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,880
(forever.)
