1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,480
Mom!

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,000
After that car accident,

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,440
your mom didn't die,

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,600
but she lost
all her memories.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,880
And I think
the best thing for now

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,480
is that
you don't shock her.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,080
Her mental state
is still unstable.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,560
Let him go.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,160
Can we talk now?

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,680
What do you want me
to do?

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,400
Let me warn you.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:29,920
You will never

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
escape this family.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,480
Even if you die,

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,120
your last drop of blood
belongs to us.

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,280
Don't think

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,080
just because you met
the heir of a mafia,

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,320
you can shake off
my control.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,000
Even if I can't kill
your mom,

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,640
I can make her suffer.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,240
No!

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,360
Please don't hurt her.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,840
I'll do anything.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,680
I'll die for you.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,120
I don't want you dead.

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,680
But if you can't
please Napat,

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,480
I'll send you
to the underground club

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,200
to learn how to
please him properly.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,400
It's pointless.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,400
Napat doesn't care
about anyone.

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,800
I never expected him
to love you.

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,680
What I need is for him

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,520
to get addicted
to your body.

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,200
Napat has
some kind of taste.

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,360
You'll have
to loosen up,

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,200
be bold,

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,160
and use more skills
to draw him in.

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,160
Understand?

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,040
Let go!
