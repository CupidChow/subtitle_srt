1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,120
Napat,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,360
I want to leave Burin.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,400
Well,

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,600
I planned to
take you away.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:09,960
No.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
I don't want to
go with you.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,440
I want to go somewhere
no one knows me.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,160
You don't want to be
with me?

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:18,880
No,

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,760
I don't.

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,480
If you don't want to,

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,600
why did you sleep
with me that day?

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,280
Ramin, I was
your first man.

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,880
People like me

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,440
never have the right
to control my own life.

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,800
Just once,

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,600
I wanted to
have a choice

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,200
like everyone else.

19
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,320
So you mean,

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,800
if it had been anyone

21
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,280
who saved you that day,

22
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,920
you would've slept
with them?

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,440
Yes.

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,640
It just happened
to be you that day.

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,880
So all this time,

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,040
you never had
any feelings for me?

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,720
You never liked me?

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,760
Never.

29
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,560
I deceived you.
I used you.

30
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,800
At the fencing hall

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
and at the club,

32
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,000
I only wanted Chai
to see that

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,640
and go report back
to you.

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,920
Everything was just
to deceive you.

35
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,880
I used my own body

36
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,360
as a bargaining chip.

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,480
I thought

38
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,520
you'd accept the terms
of our deal.

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,960
Ramin,

40
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,640
did you ever once think
about it seriously?

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,600
Did you think
it was just a deal?

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,120
Did you think
everything I did for you

43
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,480
was business?

44
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,440
Do you have a heart?

45
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,800
You can't even look me
in the eyes.

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,240
I know

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
you still like me.

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,520
You still want me.

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,400
You can't fool me.

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,720
If you want me,

51
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,400
I'll sleep
with you tonight.

52
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,840
I'll stay and serve you

53
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,160
until you're satisfied.

54
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,400
I only beg you
to let me go after that.

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,520
Who would want
something like that?
