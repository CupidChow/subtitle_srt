1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,080
What are you doing, Dad?

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,840
Don't think I don't know

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,560
Napat broke the agreement
because of you.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,240
That's why Neil
was arrested on his turf.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,640
I spent the whole night

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,600
wiring money to charities

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,320
to help Neil's case,

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,720
pretending to be sick
and hiding out here.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,080
I'll make Napat pay.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,040
Tell him

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,040
to transfer 100 million
to me now.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,000
No matter how you get it,

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,280
get me that money!

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,520
Now!

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,840
One hundred million?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,480
That's too much. I don't
think he would do that.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,360
In that case,

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,920
think about
your mom's face.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,040
Go.

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,700
(Napat)

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,840
What's wrong?

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,200
I can't believe
you're calling me.

23
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,720
Miss me?

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,600
I need 100 million.

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,840
What's your
account number?

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,960
You didn't even ask

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,840
why I need so much?

28
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,480
If you want it

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,280
and I can provide it,

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,440
why waste time asking?

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,680
Send the account.

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,080
Hmm.

33
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,160
Is the money in?

34
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,140
(Transfer Successful)

35
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,240
It's in.

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,600
Thank you.

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,080
See you later.

38
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,120
Wait.

39
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,760
You took the money.

40
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,760
There should be
something in return.

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,760
Answer the question
I asked you earlier.

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,600
Can you give me more
time to think about it?

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,680
You're shy.

44
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,240
Well, then.

45
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,920
I'll wait for you.

46
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,080
(Napat, don't be
so good to me.)

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,120
(I really can't be
with you.)

48
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,320
Why are you smiling?

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,360
Spit it out if you have
something to report.

50
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,360
Mr. Napat,

51
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,040
that's 100 million.

52
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,320
You transferred it
without even asking.

53
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,160
Why act

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,080
so thoughtlessly?

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,400
Not to mention,
his family's been

56
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,280
keeping us in the dark.

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,160
He never planned

58
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,040
to be honest with us.

59
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,880
How could I not know
about those things?

60
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,600
Mr. Napat,
you knew and yet...

61
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,920
I like him.

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,280
If he wants something
from me,

63
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,960
why would I refuse?

64
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,800
As for his family,

65
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,400
I'd rather he tell me
everything himself.

66
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,120
Besides,

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
I haven't told him
the truth yet.

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,720
He doesn't know

69
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,360
who I am.
