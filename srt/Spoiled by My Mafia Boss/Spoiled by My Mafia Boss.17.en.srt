1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,520
This way, please,
Mr. Napat.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,160
Hold on, Somchai.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,040
This isn't the way
to the meeting room.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,400
Oh, Mr. Napat.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,960
I've brought the people

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,160
you asked for.

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,200
They're waiting for you
in the room.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,920
What are you
talking about?

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,560
Mr. Napat,

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,240
don't you want
some company tonight?

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,360
I picked the exact type

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,120
you like.

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,000
Send them all away.

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,280
I don't need them

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,520
tonight.

16
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,320
It's not like

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,560
I don't have anyone
to accompany me.

18
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,960
Are you serious,
Mr. Napat?

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,160
Don't tell you

20
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,280
you've fallen
for that guy?

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,760
Say nothing

22
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,000
you shouldn't.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,640
And don't tell Ramin,
got it?

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:43,720
Yes.

25
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,600
Mr. Napat,

26
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,360
what about the people
I brought?

27
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,160
Didn't I say
to send them away?

28
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,920
Oh.

29
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,920
Or, if you want to
keep them for yourself,

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,400
I'll allow it.

31
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,120
Enjoy.

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,480
(Forget it.)

33
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,440
(He should rest.)

34
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,380
(If you need anything,
come find me. Good night.)

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,880
(Why would I want him to
come to me?)

36
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,600
(Why am I craving
his body?)

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,160
(Am I actually hoping)

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,160
(he'll come to my door)

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,080
(not because he has to,
but because he wants to?)
