1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,680
Ramin

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,240
I know

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,240
that you want to go with him

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,680
But you're dreaming.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,920
Don't do anything, Ramin.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,840
I'm begging you.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,720
Don't do anything to Ramin.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,480
Your mother really loves you.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,200
My brain doesn't work.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,240
Still thinking about protecting the child

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,920
So you can abandon her?

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,960
Don't do this.

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,760
I don't want to hurt my mother.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,760
Don't you oppress me.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,520
Let go of my mother.

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,480
Let go of my mother.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,880
Then you have only two choices.

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,440
First way

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,280
You go live with the governor now.

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,840
Another way

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,080
Let me shoot your legs and cripple you.

22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,360
Then take him and hand him over to the governor.

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,320
mother

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,360
Ramin hurriedly ran away.

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,280
My mother pretended to be sick for many years.

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,840
Waiting for the day to take revenge on this evil person.

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
With my mother's own hands

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,280
victory

29
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Bad people like you will go to hell today.
