1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,720
You blew up
the whole building?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,320
It's only
a few hundred million.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,040
Compared to
what they did to you,

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,560
the abuse,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,760
I wish I could blow it
to smithereens.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,280
It's 900 million,
Mr. Napat.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,440
Press it again.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,040
What else
do you want to blow up?

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,880
Do you like it?

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,840
Not bad.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,040
If you think
it's not bad,

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
kiss me.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,240
Mr. Napat.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,680
Cheers.

15
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,320
Police!

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,080
Let go of me!

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,600
Come here.

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,040
Krit family heir Neil
was arrested last night.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,080
The investigation shows

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,320
he's suspected of
drug trafficking

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,680
and murder.

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,000
Stop reading the news.

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,240
Time for your meds.

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
If you don't take it now,

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,200
it'll get cold.

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,680
Can you stop
being like this?

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Don't you have
your family business to run?

28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,680
You stay with me all day.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
I'm the second son.

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,840
My brother can handle it.

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,520
Right now, my main job
is to take care of you.

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,640
Your situation
has changed.

33
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,240
Your brother's
been arrested.

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,720
Now you're
the only one left.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,920
What are you going
to do next?

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,200
Oh.

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,720
you'll probably inherit
the family business.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,680
How about this?

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,520
Let's make
our relationship public.

40
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,480
Then no one will
bully you anymore.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,360
Mr. Napat,

42
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,920
you have family matters
to attend to.

43
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,080
I'll be right back.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,360
But

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,680
I don't think

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,360
I can be with you.
