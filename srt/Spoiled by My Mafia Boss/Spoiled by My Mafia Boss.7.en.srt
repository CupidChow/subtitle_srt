1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,640
You're lucky today.
You're back early.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,800
I heard the Phisit family's
second son's coming.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,200
The governor's waiting
for him personally.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,400
The second son?

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,240
What does he look like?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,480
I've never
seen him either,

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,000
but you can
keep an eye out.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,120
The one walking in front
of a group of bodyguards

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,680
must be him.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,320
(So he's a bodyguard.)

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,560
Wait.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,840
Why is your face red?

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,920
Got a rash?

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,200
Maybe it's the steam.

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,640
I see.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,520
Let's go back.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,760
Let's go.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,320
Mr. Napat,

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,600
I'm terribly sorry.

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,200
You hadn't replied
to my messages,

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
so I came in person.

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,760
As we

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,720
discussed before,

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,760
your family has agreed

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,960
to support my re-election

26
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,520
and provide protection.

27
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,600
But today,

28
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,600
I came because I heard

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,880
you like fencing.

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,440
I've found
a skilled fencer.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,120
I'd like to invite him
to spar with you.

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,520
Would you be interested?

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,920
(If he comes here, maybe
he'll like fencing.)

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,640
(And maybe I
get to see him again.)

35
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,800
Sounds good.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
I like

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,240
your suggestion.

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,840
Great!

39
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,520
We sincerely invite you
to come tomorrow.

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,040
We'll make sure
you're well entertained.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,440
Kevin said
your fencing skills

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,760
are pretty average.

43
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,880
My skills aren't
as good as Neil's.

44
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,520
Dad,

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,440
I heard Mr. Phisit

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,520
is ruthless and decisive.

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
Are you sure
Ramin can handle it?

48
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,240
Heh.

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,480
Don't worry.

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,920
I never planned for you

51
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,920
to actually fight
Mr. Napat.

52
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,040
You're just a toy
we're sending him.

53
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,040
Mr. Napat

54
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,120
enjoys tormenting people.

55
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,520
If you can please him,

56
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,640
that'll be a great help
to the governor.

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,760
(I knew you'd send me.)

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,600
(And it wouldn't be
for anything good.)

59
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,840
(But I need to meet
someone like him.)

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,400
(Only he has the power
to help me.)
