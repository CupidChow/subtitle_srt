1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,400
Get lost
if you still want to live.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,280
(That voice...
Is it him?)

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,240
You work here?

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,960
This is the VIP room.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,800
How did you get in?

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,360
You pointed a gun at me.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,440
So you're just a thug
from the mafia.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:27,880
Hmph.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,320
And who was the one

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,080
pressing a chisel
to my throat?

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,040
You really hold grudges.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,960
You're something else.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't have much time.
Hurry up.

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,480
Why did you...

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,920
Stop?

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,400
I need to go.

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,760
Wait.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,640
You haven't told me

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,920
who you are.

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,800
Leaving just like this?

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,200
How heartless.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,960
No way.

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,480
I must bring you back.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,440
Oh, Mr. Napat.

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,640
I've been looking
for you.
