1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,720
I really want you dead.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,080
Only if you die

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,480
can I be sure I'm safe.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,880
No, Napat!

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,640
It doesn't matter
if I die.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,720
You've done enough
for me.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,480
All I ask is that you
avenge my parents.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,720
Shut up.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,480
Do you think

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,080
you can kill me
that easily?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,720
If you don't blow
your brains out,

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,600
I'll count to three

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,080
and shoot Ramin.
One shot at a time.

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,680
No, Mr. Napat!

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,680
You're the only heir
of the Phisit family.

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,640
You can't do that!

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,880
One.

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,280
Two.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,800
Kill me.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,320
Just kill me.

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,000
He's done enough for me.

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,040
I'll repay him
with my life anyway.

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,880
Three.

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,160
Ow!

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,520
Father,

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,160
our family has ruined

27
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,560
Ramin's family.

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,080
That's why his life
is so miserable.

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm willing to
trade my life for his.

30
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,160
No!

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,600
No, Napat!

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,800
If you die,

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,680
I won't be sad at all.

34
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,680
Ramin,

35
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,120
did you ever love me?

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,720
Never.

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
I was only deceiving
and using you.

38
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,600
Even if you die,

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,440
I won't shed
a single tear for you.

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,680
What a fool.

41
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,520
You're crying,

42
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,880
you know?

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,280
I'm your lover.

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,280
I have the duty
to protect you.

45
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,040
No!
