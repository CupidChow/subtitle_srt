1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,640
Can you take it off?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,640
Of course.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,880
Are you sure
you want me to?

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,520
(Should I trust him?)

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,840
(If he can remove it,)

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,120
(will he always
protect me?)

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,320
(Forget it.)

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,960
(With where we stand now,)

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,600
(it's not
the right time yet.)

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,200
I was kidding.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,680
This bracelet

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,280
is a symbol
of my family.

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,000
How could I remove it?

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll get going.

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,880
Is my skill that bad?

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,160
He always leaves
so coldly.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,040
He didn't even hesitate.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,840
Napat, the Phisit family's
notorious playboy.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,720
The second son
of the family.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
The current head
of the family is Lock.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,520
He holds
absolute authority.

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,080
Nothing happens
without his approval.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,040
He's mysterious and has
never appeared in public.

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,960
(Napat is second in
command in the family.)

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,920
(How much influence
does he have?)

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,520
(Can he be of use to me?)

27
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,720
Is that bracelet

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,640
a shackle?

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,480
Yes.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,200
Can you take it off?

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,480
If you remove it

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,680
and pass the first test
I set for you,

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,040
I'll follow through
with the plan.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,640
And you

35
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,320
will slowly become
the blade in my hand.
