1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,080
Did Chai send you
to kill me?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,600
Yes.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,480
This is the only way

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,560
to gain his trust.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,520
Only then can I find proof

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,480
that he killed my parents.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,440
I want him dead.

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,160
I want him ruined.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,480
Then kill me.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,040
Can you do it?

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,120
I don't want to kill you.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,840
I just want you
to fake your death again.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,440
Then

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,400
leave Burin

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,080
and never come back
to this filthy place.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,080
Are you worried
about me?

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,040
I am not.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,880
What are you doing?

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,600
Helping you.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,800
Come.

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,960
Let me help you.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,040
This is easier for you.

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,080
Shoot me.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,640
Make it quick.

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,240
If you've already hurt

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,880
my heart this much,

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,240
then take my body too.

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,880
It's useless anyway.

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,480
Shoot.

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,040
I told you.
I don't want to kill you.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,080
I just don't want you
involved anymore.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,320
Why won't you
understand?

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,360
I understand everything.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,560
You could've killed me

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,880
to win Chai's trust,

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,200
but you didn't.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,000
You told me
to fake my death.

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,360
You could've asked me
to join your revenge,

39
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,480
but instead
you worried about me

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,720
and pushed me away.

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,320
I didn't...

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,360
You love me.

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
When will you stop
hurting yourself and me?
