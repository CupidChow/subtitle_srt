1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,360
You said
you would help me.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
Why did you let something
happen to yourself?

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,800
You lied to me.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,680
Didn't you say
you'd never leave me?

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,800
But in the end,

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,000
you were just like
everyone else.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,160
What are you doing?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,600
Dad,

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,480
I'm ready
to get married now.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,680
Dear, give me an hour.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,520
Let's go.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,200
(From now on,)

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,480
(I'll be locked in
that basement forever.)

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,520
(I'll never
be free again.)

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,560
Groom,

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,520
do you take Miss Lily
as your wife?

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,360
Since you're a dog
raised by Chai,

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,720
from now on, you'll
be our family's dog.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:14,960
Or what?

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,960
You plan to run away,

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,040
little doggie?

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,520
Do you take Miss Lily
as your wife?

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
I...

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,600
If you dare say yes,

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,400
go ahead and try it.
