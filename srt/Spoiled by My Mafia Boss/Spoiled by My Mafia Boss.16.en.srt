1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,320
Alright,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,000
get some sleep.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,600
I'll be
in the next room.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,080
If you need anything,
just knock.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,120
Okay?

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,760
What's it?

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,440
You don't want me
to leave?

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,640
No.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,400
I have to

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,600
obey

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,400
the governor's order.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,240
If I don't..

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,240
Tell him

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,080
your mission is done.

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,480
I'll have Somchai

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,320
handle the rest.

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,000
(Am I just a tool
to you?)

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,520
(Once you're done with me,
you cast me aside?)

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,720
Go to sleep.

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,480
What's wrong?

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
What else do you want
from me?

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,120
Thank you.

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,200
Just that?

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,880
Not enough.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,880
Mr. Napat,

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,880
everyone's
waiting downstairs

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,240
for the weekly meeting.

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,800
Hmm.

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,280
I'll be right there.

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,280
Your phone.

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,560
Use it.

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,040
And don't
disappear again.

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,160
Sleep well.

34
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,200
I'm here.

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,080
Can I really
win your heart?

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,800
Will you ever
help me willingly?
