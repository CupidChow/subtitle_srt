1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,960
Do you want me?

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,560
No.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,040
I just...

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,800
I'm afraid of the dark.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:10,920
What?

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,280
You're afraid
of the dark?

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,440
Yeah.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,520
I couldn't

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,000
sleep.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,680
Good thing you came.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,040
I feel a lot better now.

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,920
(He knows I'm scared.)

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,520
(So he used that
as an excuse.)

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,680
You don't have to
lie to me.

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,320
Says who?

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,520
Hey,

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,640
you know what?

18
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,680
My family rarely

19
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,160
sends me out on jobs

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,680
because of this.

21
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,520
I can't sleep well
in unfamiliar places.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,720
But when I pat
your back like this,

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,560
I don't feel
so scared anymore.

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,840
Sleep.

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,440
(Why?)

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,960
(Why does it feel
so warm)

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,160
(every time I get close
to him?)

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,160
How's it?

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,000
Is the food enough?

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,920
If you want something else,

31
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,840
just say it. I'll have
Somchai bring more dishes.

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,320
This is a lot. The three
of us can't finish.

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,760
Oh.

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,560
Right.

35
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, yes. Recently,
a fortune-teller said

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,200
eating alone

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,560
brings great luck.

38
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,880
So I'll go

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,480
accumulate some luck.

40
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,040
Please excuse me.
I'll take a piece.

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,640
I'm going.

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,160
Go ahead and eat.

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,400
You like meat, right?

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,000
Have some.

45
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,280
It's really good.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,600
My Ramin

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
is so cute.

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,600
You really love
coconut juice.

49
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,800
I'll go get more.

50
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,360
(Why is it taking
so long?)

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,800
(Did something happen?)
