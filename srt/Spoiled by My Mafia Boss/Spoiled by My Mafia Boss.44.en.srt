1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,240
Sir,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
you were right.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,080
Ramin

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,480
can't be trusted.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,480
But right now,
he's seriously injured,

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,920
and Napat

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,400
has to take care of him.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,120
He won't have time
to interfere.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,920
We should use this chance

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,680
to move the goods out
from the port.

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,160
We can earn
a few more million.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,400
I don't think

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,800
Napat

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,240
means to go against us.

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,240
He just wants a share.

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,200
Once we move
the goods out,

17
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,480
we can give him
a little.

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,600
Then we'll see if

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,680
he's still willing

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,600
to stand against us
for Ramin's sake.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,080
I knew

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,120
you'd found something.

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,920
That's why you've
been acting strange.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,400
Yes.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,520
I know
you killed my dad.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,320
I raised you
for twenty years.

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,320
How could I not know
what you were thinking?

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,240
Since you've found
the box,

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,760
I'll open it

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
for you.

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,840
Take a good look

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
at what's inside.

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,960
I admit

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,920
I killed your dad.

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,400
But I was
following orders.

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,560
Do you know

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,280
who gave that order?

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,240
It was the head
of the Phisit family.

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
His name is Jet.

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,480
The Phisit family?

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,080
Why?

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,360
At first,

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,600
I did have some ties
with the Phisit family.

44
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,800
But Jet

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
supported me

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,080
because he wanted
the freight zone

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,760
that belongs to
the governor.

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
He could make
a lot of money from it.

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,120
So he ordered me

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,840
to kill your dad,

51
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,680
take his seat,

52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,840
and become
the new vice governor.

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,040
Who is Jet?

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,960
I think

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,880
Napat should answer that.

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,720
Who is Jet?

57
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,040
Jet is my father.
