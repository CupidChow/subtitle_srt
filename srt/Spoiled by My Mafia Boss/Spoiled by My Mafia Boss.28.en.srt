1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,280
Good thing you know
how to be useful.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,680
I called you here

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,080
because I want you
to meet someone.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,520
Nice to meet you, sir.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,760
Why did you want
to see me?

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:17,920
Ramin,

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,640
there's something I need
you to take care of.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,960
You already know,
don't you?

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,200
Neil and Miss Lily

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,440
were engaged,

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,560
but now he's in prison.

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,680
If this engagement
is canceled,

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,640
it'll affect our funding

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
and public support.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,680
Since Neil is in prison,

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,920
you'll take his place
and marry Lily.

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,320
I know
you're in a relationship

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,360
with Napat,

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,360
I won't stop you.

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,800
This marriage

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,360
is only for show.

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,720
You can continue
your relationship with him.

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,400
I won't interfere.

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,560
That way,

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,320
it'll be easier for you

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,240
to request financial
support from him for us.

27
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,080
I don't think so.

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,800
You're part
of the family,

29
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,920
aren't you?

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,280
Dad, but...

31
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,520
Why did you hit him?

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,040
If his face gets hurt,

33
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,880
how's he supposed
to attend the wedding?

34
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,320
Let's go celebrate.

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,120
(I can't marry
the governor's daughter.)

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
(Or else,
I'll never escape.)

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,920
(I have to take Mom
and run.)

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,160
(I need Napat
to save Mom.)

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,200
What's wrong?

40
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,640
Dear Ramin,

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,200
miss me?

42
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,760
I need you
to save someone.

43
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,760
Bring her out
as fast as possible.

44
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,960
I'll send you
the address in a moment.

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,440
And take me with you.

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,240
Right now.

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,040
Hello?

48
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,080
Hello?

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,840
(Ramin,)

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,840
(I'll do anything
you ask.)
