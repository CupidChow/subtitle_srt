1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,120
Hold your gun steady.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,760
Aim carefully.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
Find your rhythm.
Breathe with it.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Treat the target
like your enemy

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,760
or the person
you want to kill.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,960
You only get one shot.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,800
Don't suppress your rage.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Let the gun
vent your anger.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,720
Release it.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,080
You'll feel better.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,920
Just as I thought.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,320
You've been carrying
too much pressure.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,720
Why are you teaching me
to shoot?

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,440
A person bent on revenge

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,720
should at least know
how to protect themselves.

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,600
I may not always be able

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,360
to look after you.

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
So you must learn
to defend yourself.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,760
This gun has been with me
for ten years.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,480
It's my lucky charm.

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,080
I'm giving it to you.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,680
What will you use then?

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,360
I'm strong enough.

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,880
Take it.

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,600
Ramin.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,560
If my father

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,000
really killed your dad,
what would you do?

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,240
A murderer

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
must pay the price.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,200
If that's the truth,

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,440
as a son,
I must protect my father.

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,800
And as a son,

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,720
I must avenge my dad.

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,520
Promise me,

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,000
before you
find out the truth,

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,600
don't kill my father.

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,800
And promise me

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,720
you won't harm me

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,200
until I've
uncovered the truth.

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
I'll wait for your answer
at the Phisit residence.
