1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,180
(Wedding Schedule)

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,760
Ramin,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,080
I know

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,600
you're asking Napat
for help.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,640
You'd better give up
on that idea.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,340
(Phisit Family Son)
You should look over

7
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:16,440
(Caught in Traffic Accident)
the wedding schedule.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,880
(He got into
an accident?)

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,080
(No... Impossible.)

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,840
Dad,

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,880
if Napat is injured,

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
then I'm no use
to the governor anymore.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,680
He can just

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,000
have Lily marry
someone else.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,080
I'm begging you.

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,760
I won't leave you.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,000
For Mom's sake,

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,280
I'll stay by your side.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,560
But Dad,

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,200
please don't send me
to the governor.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,280
What are you afraid of?

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,880
Have you
already realized?

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,040
I'm about to win, sir.

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,880
Win?

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,720
Are you sure?

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
The governor
is something else.

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,000
He likes you,

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,960
so he's marrying
his daughter to you.

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,760
If you've
figured that out,

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,560
you should

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,520
serve him well.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,600
Make sure he's satisfied
every night.

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,720
Only then will
my position remain secure.

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,240
Understand?
