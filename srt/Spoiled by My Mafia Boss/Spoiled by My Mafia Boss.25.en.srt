1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,840
You need to dress
your wound.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,320
It's bad if it scars.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,160
Is it disgusting?

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,760
Seeing it hurts me.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,920
Why

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,360
are you so kind to me?

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't know.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,560
Maybe you put some
kind of spell on me.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,360
All I know is

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,760
I'll always
treat you well.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,960
Well, then...

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,880
What about my brother?

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,560
Have you
thought it through?

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,960
I have.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,640
Sit.

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,280
Why did you bring me here?
Is this about Neil?

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,160
That club over there
is where he always goes.

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,520
Mr. Napat,

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,720
Neil has taken the bait.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,880
Press it.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,360
Come on.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,560
It's a surprise.
