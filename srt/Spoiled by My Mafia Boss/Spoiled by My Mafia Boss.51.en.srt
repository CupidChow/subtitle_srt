1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
Are you ready
for revenge?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,120
Darn it! Out of gas!

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,680
For the sake
of your parents

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,640
and for yourself.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,920
You did it.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,520
Ramin!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,600
Ramin!

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,400
Call an ambulance!

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,880
Ramin!

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,000
Ramin!

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
Breaking news.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,000
This shocking case
once caused

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,840
widespread panic in Burin
twenty years ago.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,960
The truth has finally
come to light.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,480
Vice Governor Chai
planned the murder

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,640
of his predecessor, Tee,
for personal gain,

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,760
and imprisoned his wife
until her death.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
An old box of letters

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,040
revealed
this brutal secret.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,920
The governor was also
removed from office.

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,040
The Burin City

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,560
will soon begin reforms.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,760
Don't hold it in.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,880
If you want to cry,

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,800
just cry.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,440
Everything will be okay.

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,480
From now on,

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,240
nothing will happen
to you again,

29
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,480
my Ramin.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,920
I promise.

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,960
From now on,

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,360
I'll stay by your side
forever.

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,120
You don't have to
be afraid anymore.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,920
Thank you.

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,400
Mmm.
