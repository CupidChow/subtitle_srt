1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,280
The governor
sent you, didn't he?

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,680
Yes.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,640
I approached you
on purpose from the start.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,560
I knew you were Napat.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,760
That's why
I got close to you.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
Enough.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,800
I was toying with you.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,040
Haven't you realized?

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,280
I've slept with you
twice.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,400
If you don't kill me now,

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,720
I'll tell everyone.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
I'd like to see

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,040
if your men still
obey you after that.

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,560
You have nerve.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,360
I like that.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,200
I was fooling you.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,000
Aren't you mad?

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,520
Relationships

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,880
always involve
some kind of gain.

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,880
If you want something
from me,

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,040
that's good.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,720
At least I'll get to
see you more often.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,120
You left in a hurry

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,040
last time.

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,760
Don't run away
this time.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,760
I think we should go.

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,800
People are waiting
for you outside.

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,080
They've been waiting
quite a while.

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,200
So what if they
wait a little longer?

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,800
I should go.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,560
Well,

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,840
you look like a prisoner
trying to break out.

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,920
And that bracelet,

34
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,680
is it a shackle?

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,600
Yes,

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,680
this bracelet
is my shackle.

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,160
Can you take it off?
