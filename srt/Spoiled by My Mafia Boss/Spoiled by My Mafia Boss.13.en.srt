1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,920
When I'm with Ramin,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,560
I don't want anything
getting in the way.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,720
We'd never disturb you,
Mr. Napat.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,840
I mean

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,360
that bracelet
your son's wearing.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,280
Take it off.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,680
Now.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,480
Hmm. Good material.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,640
Must've been
custom-made.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,040
(He took it off.)

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,560
I was stretching my hand

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,880
and accidentally
fired a shot.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
I hope you don't mind.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,120
We wouldn't dare.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,040
It's our honor

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,640
to witness your skills.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,000
We'll take our leave.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,520
Dad, how could Napat
humiliate you like that,

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,880
all for Ramin?

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,000
Calm down.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,560
Once Napat

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,400
loses interest in him,

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,840
you can
deal with him then.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,000
Darn it!

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,480
He really believes

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,960
a big shot would be
interested in him?

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,680
One day,

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,320
he'll regret it.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,480
From now on,
you stay with me.

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,760
Wherever I go,

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,720
you follow.

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
You trust me that much?

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,280
Aren't you afraid
I was sent by them?

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,320
Aren't you afraid
I'll kill you?

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,640
Could you really do it?

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,440
Like this?

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,560
Are you scared now?
