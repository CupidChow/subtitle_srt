1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
You're still
just as fast.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,840
I just have something
to talk to you about.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,400
What's it?

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,400
Bring down my brother.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,960
Sure.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,360
You're not asking me why?

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,280
No need.

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,800
If it's for you,

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,600
I'll do anything.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,680
(His hand is so warm.)

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,040
Let's go.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:31,720
Wait.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,440
Where are you
taking me to?

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,880
Somewhere

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,680
you'll feel safe.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,760
Mr. Napat, the young man
you asked me to look into

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,360
is Mr. Ramin.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,560
He's Mr. Chai's
adopted son.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,640
He's always
been reticent

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,760
and usually stays home.

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,440
So it makes sense why

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,600
I couldn't find him,

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,360
no matter how hard
I looked.

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,040
Did you hear that
from Ramin,

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
or someone else?

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,040
I asked his family.

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,800
If he really liked
staying home,

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,760
he wouldn't have dared
to do something like that.
