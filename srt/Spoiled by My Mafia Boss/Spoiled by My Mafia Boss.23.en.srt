1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,880
Someone almost died
at the club.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,560
Who was it?

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,360
Mr. Ramin's brother,

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,680
Mr. Neil.

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,600
He assaulted a hostess

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,120
and nearly strangled her.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,520
She's been taken
to the hospital.

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,640
If you want to cover up
for those politicians,

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,480
you'll have to
handle it yourself.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,000
Are all the guests
Burin politicians invite

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,400
insane?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,560
Mr. Napat,

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,840
there's one more thing.

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,760
Well...

15
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,680
Mr. Ramin was there.

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,680
What do you take me for?

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,360
How would you
be in a place like that?

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,000
Here you go.

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,920
Whip him.

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,280
I love hearing
people moan.

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,480
Come on.

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,360
More.

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,640
More.

24
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,400
Oh.

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,600
How do you feel now?

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,560
You're pretty tough,

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,520
little boy.

28
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,080
The tougher you are,
the more excited I get.

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,360
Go ahead

30
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,960
and keep pretending.
Once we've had our turn,

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,800
you'll beg to die.

32
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,720
No!

33
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,000
Please don't hurt me!

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,400
I beg you!

35
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,360
I'll give you
anything you want.

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,120
Go ahead and scream.

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,880
I can barely
hold myself back.

38
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,320
I'll start first,
little boy.

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,440
Don't kill him.

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,160
(I can't get away.)

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,720
(I can't get away
this time.)

42
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,880
Who are you?

43
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,360
Do you have a death wish?

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,040
Let him go.

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,480
What's your problem?

46
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,280
You think
you can interrupt us?

47
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
Do you even know
who we are?

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Looks like you don't know

49
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
who I am.
