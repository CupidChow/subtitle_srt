1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,520
(Darn it!)

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,280
(I planned to take
Chai hostage)

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,920
(and confront
the Phisits.)

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,520
(But he ran away.)

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,440
Darn it.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,560
You're here.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,400
You came with questions.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,760
I have answers

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,480
that will satisfy you.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,240
But before that,

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,320
Napat

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,800
will bring someone

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,760
specially for you.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,560
Napat.

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,240
I hope this will be fair

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,120
to everyone.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,800
(We still think alike)

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,200
(even in a situation
like this.)

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,240
I want to know

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,680
why you ordered Chai
to kill my dad.

22
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,200
I read

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,360
the letters between you.

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,840
Did you really do it?

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,960
The letters

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,400
Chai kept

27
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,840
are only part of them.

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,320
He probably doesn't know

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,000
I kept

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,880
the other half.

31
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,280
Impossible.

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,200
Before I escaped
that night,

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,000
I burned his study.

34
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
This box

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,880
was Napat's

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,600
favorite.

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,640
That night,

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,560
he ran out of the study

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,040
holding this box.

40
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,920
That's why

41
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,120
all the confidential
documents

42
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,680
inside this box

43
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
survived.

44
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,200
Maybe it was fate.

45
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,080
It's a guide

46
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,320
for the one he loves

47
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,480
twenty years later.

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,280
Chai came to me first.

49
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,480
He forged documents
and evidence

50
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,040
to make me

51
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,160
believe

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
your dad planned

53
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,760
to go against
the Phisit family.

54
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,880
Besides

55
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,200
getting favors from us,

56
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,320
he decided to
hand us over

57
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,760
to the authorities

58
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,280
to gain favor.

59
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
Back then,
the Phisit family

60
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,720
wasn't as powerful
as it is now.

61
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,520
To protect myself,

62
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,720
I had to make

63
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,720
the wrong decision.

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,600
Lad,

65
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,760
the person who ordered
to kill your dad

66
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,080
was me.

67
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
If you want to kill me

68
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,480
to avenge him,

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,760
then do it.

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,280
See?

71
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,640
Did you hear that?
He admitted it.

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,640
He's the one
who gave the order.
