1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,280
Kill Napat.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,880
He didn't just turn
against the governor,

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,880
he wrecked
his business too.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,360
If you succeed,

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,080
I'll forget

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
the past.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,120
And you

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,040
will still be
my only good son,

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,040
just like before.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,240
Do you believe
what Ramin said, sir?

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,640
Whether it's true or not

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,000
doesn't matter.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,120
I'm only using him

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,920
to draw Napat out,

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,400
then let my killer
finish him.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Napat's true identity

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,160
is Lock.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,040
I won't allow him
to get in my way.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
He must be eliminated.

20
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,990
(Transfer Failed)

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,440
Darn it.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
Looks like I have to
see him myself.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,000
Why did you do this?

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,320
Why refuse the transfer?

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,040
I came to return
your 200 million.

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,720
I don't need your help
anymore.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,120
So you came back

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,560
just to return the money,

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,600
or you missed me?

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,800
I'm only here
to return the money.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,040
Don't overthink it.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,560
But I was told

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,960
by the flight attendant
on the private jet

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,800
that someone
was crying like crazy.

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,680
Wasn't that because

36
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,120
you missed me?

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,200
I...

38
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,200
I didn't.

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,520
You know what?

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,760
Your body doesn't lie.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,760
Otherwise,

42
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,520
what's the hard thing

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,480
pressed against me?

44
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,600
Do you mean

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,040
this?
