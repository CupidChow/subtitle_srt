1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,120
Are you playing me?

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,560
You think any of this
is a game?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,160
You should know this.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,080
It might change
your plan.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,160
You mean

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,080
my dad was shot dead?

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,360
And your mom too.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,120
She saw her husband
murdered.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,640
She couldn't bear it.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,720
So Chai locked her
in the hospital

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,760
for twenty years

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,760
as a hostage

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,360
to threaten you.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,880
Somchai risked a lot

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,600
to get
this autopsy report.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,000
The one
who forced the hospital

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,080
to issue a fake autopsy

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,200
was Chai,

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,240
your adoptive father.

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,800
He adopted me

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,720
and treated me
like a slave,

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
and he may very well

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,600
be the one who killed
my parents?

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,000
Do you want to
investigate?

26
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,360
If he did kill
my parents,

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,680
I'll make him pay
a terrible price

28
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,880
for what he's done.

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
I'll help you.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,720
No, Lock.

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,480
You've done enough.

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
I'll transfer
the 200 million back to you.

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,400
From now on,

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
we're done.

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,720
(Napat,)

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,560
(thank you for everything
you've done for me.)

37
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,240
(Revenge
is too dangerous.)

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,640
(You've already crossed
the governor because of me.)

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,480
(I won't drag you
into more danger.)

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,480
Your mom died
because of me.

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,080
And you still want to
come back?

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,560
Ramin,

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,160
you think I'm so foolish
I'd believe you?

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,960
Did you and Napat
plan this together?

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,760
You're here to take
my life, aren't you?

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,920
Dad,

47
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,880
after Napat ruined
the wedding, he left me.

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,520
If it weren't for him,
Mom wouldn't be dead.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
He lied and
used my feelings.

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,200
Now I see
his true colors.

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,040
Dad,

52
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,880
I really have nowhere
to go.

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,440
If you hate him
that much,

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
go back and kill Napat.
