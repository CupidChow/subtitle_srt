1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,120
Mr. Napat!

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,120
Mr. Napat,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,480
are you all right?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,600
(He's fine.)

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,000
Mr. Napat,

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,760
this is
my daughter's wedding.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,200
I don't want
any trouble here.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
If they get married,

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,400
I'll make sure

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,320
no one here

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,920
leaves in peace.

12
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,480
Mr. Napat,
if you do this,

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,280
you should know

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,880
what consequences
you'll face.

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,080
And what about

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,440
your shady business?

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,360
What?

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,640
All the cargo ships

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,360
have been seized?

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,160
You're just
a substitute.

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,840
You don't have
real power.

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,040
How did you

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,560
suddenly gain control
of these waters?

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,880
If you don't hand over
the man I want,

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,880
forget about getting
your ships back.

26
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,240
Are you going to
ruin things between us

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,160
over Ramin?

28
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,280
You know what?

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,480
If you do this,

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,680
you'll never set foot
in this city again.

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,160
Burin is nothing

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,240
compared to him.

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,920
I think we should
leave this wedding.

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,720
Mom.

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,480
Mom.
