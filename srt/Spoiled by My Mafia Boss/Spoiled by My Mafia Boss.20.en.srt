1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,600
Looks like you failed
to win Mr. Napat's heart.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,920
I told you.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,480
He's a flirt.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,000
Isn't that Lily,
the governor's daughter?

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,880
Hard to predict, right?

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,400
Do you think

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,800
he'll choose you

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
or the governor's
daughter?

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,840
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,760
Dad said we work
for the governor.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,720
Which means

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,800
your mission is over.
I came to take you home.

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,960
Napat hasn't left yet.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,440
I don't have to
go back now.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,000
Dad knew

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,240
you wouldn't come back
so easily,

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,840
so he told me
to show you this photo.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,280
You!

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,480
Let's go.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,440
Let him go.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,400
Mr. Napat.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,920
Well...

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
I'm here
to take Ramin home.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,400
You're very busy.

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,560
It's not good for him
to disturb you.

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,240
He's

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,680
not going back.

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,800
What happened?

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,400
Nothing.

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,840
Go wait for me inside.

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,440
Neil,

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,200
we should go back.

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,160
Wait.

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,840
Didn't I say
you're not going back?

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,440
Do you not want
to stay with me?

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,360
You have so many people
around you.

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,120
It doesn't matter
if I'm not one of them.

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Mr. Napat,
he's rejecting you.
