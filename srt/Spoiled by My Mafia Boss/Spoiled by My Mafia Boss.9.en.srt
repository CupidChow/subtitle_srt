1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,880
(Why did he
suddenly get weak?)

2
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,760
Did Mr. Napat get drunk?

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,360
You're quite skilled.

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,160
You beat me.

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,320
Mr. Napat, you must've
gone easy on him.

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,440
You beat me in front
of so many people,

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
you'll have to pay
for that.

8
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,120
How should I pay?

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,800
Find me a room.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,080
All right.

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,520
Wow, Mr. Phisit
is so cool!

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,440
I wish
I could be held like that.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,680
So thrilling.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,360
This way, please.

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,800
He's from
the Phisit family.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,200
Getting involved with him
won't end well.

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,680
You're Napat?

18
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,920
Ouch!

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,280
What's wrong?

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,360
You're afraid now?

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,800
I've slept
with you twice.

22
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,360
What's there
to be afraid of?

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
The governor
sent you, didn't he?
