1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,840
You want me more
than anyone else.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,520
Why deny it?

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,400
(He's right.)

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,440
(I want him even more.)

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,560
(I want him so badly
right now.)

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,800
You know my body
better than anyone,

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,680
so why not know
your own heart?

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,120
Don't be sad, Mr. Napat.

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,360
I've called over
a dozen male models.

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,840
Somchai.

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,440
Get out.

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,880
Out!

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,520
Yes.

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,920
You don't have to go.
I'll go.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,520
If you don't fake your death
the day after tomorrow,

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,560
I'll shoot you dead.

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,760
Somchai,

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,440
do you know

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,560
how hard it was
for him to meet me?

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,800
And

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,720
do you know

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,440
how hard it is

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,120
to keep him calm?

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,560
Get out.

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,560
Get out!

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,560
Yes.

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,520
Mr. Napat,

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,440
please

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,320
do me a favor today.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,200
I need to win
the final lot.

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,240
They're investigating
my finances.

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,200
I still hope to secure
funding from him

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,560
to support
my trading business.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,760
Right, Mr. Napat.

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,120
I think we should

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,000
let the past be the past.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,360
Let's support him
this time.

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,760
Besides, many people

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
has come to the auction.

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,000
At least give
the governor some face.

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,640
No problem.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,040
Now, we come to

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,720
our final lot.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
This is

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,360
an exquisite work of art,

46
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,840
the Sacred Dagger.

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,320
Forged from pure gold
2,000 years ago.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,720
Well preserved.

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
Since it first appeared,

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
the gems in the hilt

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,400
have shone
with dazzling light.

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,000
Whoever owns it

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,000
will hold the highest,
unrivaled power.

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,560
The bidding starts now.

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,800
The starting price is
10 million baht.

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,040
Fifty million.

57
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,000
Fifty million.

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,160
Sixty million.

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,080
Sixty million.

60
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,840
One hundred million.

61
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,960
One hundred million.

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,680
I'm helping you
drive up the price.
