1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,280
Well, Mr. Ramin,

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,920
you even put on
a bulletproof vest.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,160
All geared up,

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,680
and you pretended
to faint?

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,600
I wore it

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,840
because I was afraid
Napat might shoot me.

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,760
Let me
tell you something.

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,640
If he really wanted to
shoot you,

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,400
he wouldn't be using
that gun.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,000
You said you were
going to kill me.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,360
So, why did you
take the bullet for me?

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Mr. Napat,

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,960
the one who took
the bullet for you

15
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,200
and saved your life,

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,360
was fully armed

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,280
from head to toe.

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,960
At most,
he got a scratch.

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,760
Did he have protection
on his head?

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,840
You talk too much.

21
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,440
Get out.

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,360
You kick me out
when you don't need me.

23
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,520
Somchai.

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,440
Alright, alright.

25
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,520
I'm going.

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,480
You risked your life
for me,

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,400
yet you still insist
you don't love me?

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,680
I just don't want to
owe you.

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,240
So

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,480
you're saying

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,440
you were playing
with my feelings?

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,080
I wasn't.

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,400
Can you leave Burin?

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,080
Stop going up against
the governor because of me.

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,680
They might

36
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,800
come after you.

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,920
Are you

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
worried about me?

39
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,960
Yes,

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm worried about you.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,960
You're finally
admitting it.

42
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,200
You really love
pretending.

43
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,400
I'm not.

44
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Enough with
the cheesy talk.

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,680
There's another reason

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,760
I did that.

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,040
Right now,

48
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,000
Chai definitely thinks
I'm seriously injured.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,720
He'll invite

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,240
the governor to his place
for a meeting tonight.

51
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,360
I have to use this chance

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,360
to sneak in
and find the proof.

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,040
The proof
he killed my dad.

54
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,520
I'll go with you.
