1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,440
That day, I asked you
to kill Napat

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,480
because I wanted you

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,400
to avenge your dad.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,040
All these years,

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,680
you're still
useful to me.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,240
I raised you.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,640
You shouldn't resent me.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,320
You should've hated
Napat's father instead.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,560
Ramin.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,520
Mr. Napat,

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,200
in fact,

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,600
I planned to
take this secret

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,640
to my grave.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,600
But you insist on going
against the governor.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,480
Now,

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,480
you have to choose
to protect your father

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,280
or run back to Ramin.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,800
Make your choice.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,400
Are you okay?

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,240
It's almost dawn.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,720
I suddenly want to
see the sunrise.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,160
When we first met,

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,800
we watched the sunset
together.

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,480
And now,

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,920
we're sitting here
watching the sunrise.

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,520
How nice.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,560
For as long
as I can remember,

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,360
I was locked
in a dark basement

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,640
and raised like a beautiful,
obedient sculpture.

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Compared to that,

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,360
sunsets

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
bring darkness.

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
But I like sunrises more.

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,080
They bring the light.

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,240
Finally,
this day has come.

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,560
You're willing to
tell me your past.

37
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,080
There's something
I haven't told you.

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,200
I want to say it now.

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm afraid

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,080
I won't get
the chance later.

41
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,000
Our time together
was short.

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,560
There's nothing
to regret.

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,520
There's one more thing

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,840
we must do together.
