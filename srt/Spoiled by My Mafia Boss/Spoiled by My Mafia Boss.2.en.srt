1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,440
Didn't you hear me?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,160
Get out.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,560
And keep your shut.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,440
Today,

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,080
you saw nothing,
you know nothing.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Got it?

7
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,900
OK.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,320
Let's invite
all the guests

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,960
to celebrate

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,040
Mr. Neil's promotion.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,440
What is this?

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,000
How could this happen?

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,680
Where's Ramin?

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,920
This is your first gift.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,960
The second one
will be even more fun.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,760
That darned Ramin!

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,800
It must be him.

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,400
Get him!

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,640
(It's your unlucky day.)

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,920
I think

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
you'd better leave here.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,360
Need any help?

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,040
I just threatened you,

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,520
and now
you're being nice?

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,680
Of course,

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,880
I have conditions.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Sleep with me.

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,600
If you can get me
out of here,

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,120
I'll sleep with you.

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,200
They can't get in.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're safe.

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,280
The top-floor suite has
been reserved by a guest.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,480
Are you his driver
or bodyguard?

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,920
It doesn't matter
who I am.

35
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,400
But you said
you'd sleep with me.

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,240
What position
would it be?

37
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,680
That depends on
where you want to do it.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,200
From the living room
to the bedroom.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,200
From the study
to the kitchen, yes?

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,240
That wild?

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,600
Once we're inside,

42
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,400
it gets even wilder.
