1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,840
I'm not killing you yet.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,640
I want you to admit
your crime in public.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,600
Confess that you planned
my dad's murder.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,080
After that, I'll kill you

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,360
and send you to
apologize to my parents.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,920
Alright, alright.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,120
I'll

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,320
confess in public.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,040
Just don't

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,160
kill me yet.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,040
No!

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,560
I predicted this.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,120
You love Napat,

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
and you worry about him.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,560
You even want to protect

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,200
his dying father.

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,760
Don't you dare touch him!

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,800
If you lay a finger
on him,

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,640
I swear I'll shoot you
full of holes.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,840
I swear on my life,

21
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,680
you'll die in agony.

22
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,920
Do exactly as I say,

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,440
and I won't hurt him.

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,320
Bring me a car.

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,280
Ramin goes
with me first.

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,360
Once I'm sure I'm safe,

27
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,640
I'll let him go.

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,000
Get the car.

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,440
The car is over there.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,760
Let him go.

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,960
Stay right there.

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,480
Don't come any closer.

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,040
I said, let him go.

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,560
Patience.

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,280
I have three conditions.

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,440
First,

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
transfer
fifty million to me.

38
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,360
Now!

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,160
It's done.

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,200
What's next?

41
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,200
I know

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,480
you'll try

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,840
to stop me on the way.

44
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,480
If Ramin doesn't go
with me,

45
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,840
I won't survive.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,640
So

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,640
he goes with me

48
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,560
until I'm safe,

49
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,640
then I'll release him.

50
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,280
How can I trust you?

51
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,760
If you don't trust me,
test me then.

52
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,080
Fine.

53
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,440
I promise.

54
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,640
And the third condition?

55
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
The third condition?

56
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,240
Blow your brains out.

57
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,000
Right in front of me.

58
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,000
I really want you dead.

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,560
Die!
