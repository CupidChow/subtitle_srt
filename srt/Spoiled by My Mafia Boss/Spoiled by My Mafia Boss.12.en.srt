00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,320
Dad,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,800
I completed my mission.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,840
Can I go back now?

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,080
I heard Mr. Napat
is a playboy.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,920
No one keeps his interest
for more than a week.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,720
Dad sent you to him,

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,120
but he sent you
back himself.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,280
Looks like
you messed it up.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,320
He has no interest
in you at all.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,120
Let go, Neil.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,640
I raised you

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,240
to be useful to me,

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,200
but you're useless.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,480
You trusted him
too easily.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,120
How could someone
of low birth

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,880
attract someone as noble
as Mr. Napat?

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,480
Hello, Mr. Somchai.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,560
Mr. Napat.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,440
We'd like to ask
a small favor, Mr. Chai.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,360
During Mr. Napat's stay
in Burin,

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,000
he'd like Mr. Ramin

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
to keep him company.

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,000
No problem at all.

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,880
As long as Mr. Napat

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,800
is interested in my son,

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,000
we would be honored.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:20,960
Hi,

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,600
Mr. Napat.
