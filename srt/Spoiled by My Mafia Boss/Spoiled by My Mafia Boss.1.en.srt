1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,420
Madam, you

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,240
(Neil)
raised him so well.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,720
He became deputy chief
at such a young age.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,360
He has
a brilliant future.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,720
(Ramin)
You flatter me.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,560
Please look out for Neil
from now on.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,240
I will.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,240
Cheers.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:18,600
Sure.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,680
Ramin,

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,720
the ceremony's
about to begin.

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,840
Bring the gift over
for your brother.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,480
Be careful.

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,480
Mess this up

15
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,840
and you're done for.

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,960
Yes, Mom.

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,320
(You want a good gift?)

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,600
(I'll make sure
you get one.)

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,360
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,100
(Napat)

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,560
It's fine.

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,760
Mr. Napat.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,880
(Somchai)
Why do it at the vice

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,640
(Somchai)
governor's son's banquet?

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,400
Didn't I tell you?

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,480
Traitors can't be
allowed to live.

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,120
You should leave first.

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,560
I'll go alone.

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,240
Also,

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,800
I'm hoping for some fun.

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,200
Mr. Napat, you can't
just do as you please.

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,400
I'll be worn out.

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,120
Come with me.

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,600
Yes, Mr. Napat.

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,720
Go inside.

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,800
Mr. Napat, I didn't
do anything wrong.

37
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,960
Don't kill me,
Mr. Napat!

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,160
I was wrong.
I really was wrong!

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,600
Anyway,

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,240
traitors must die.

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,240
Please don't, Mr. Napat!

42
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
I beg you. Don't!

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,720
What did you see?

44
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,320
I saw nothing.

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,720
Please spare me.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,200
Spare me, sir.

47
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,040
What did you just say?

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,680
You don't have
a gun now.

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,840
Leave,

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,840
or I'll kill you.

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,680
(No one has ever dared
threaten me like that.)

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,320
(Interesting.)
