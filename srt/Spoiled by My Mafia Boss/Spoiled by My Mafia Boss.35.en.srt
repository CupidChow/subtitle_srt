1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,480
Ramin,

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,840
would it kill you

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,240
to have feelings for me

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
even once?

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,960
I was such an idiot.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,480
You played me

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,760
completely.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,000
What did you
take my feelings for?

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,360
A toy?

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,040
Every time you were in
trouble, I'd help you.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,640
I'd always calm you
as fast as I could.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,240
I must've been

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,200
crazy.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:40,840
Yes.

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,800
I don't want to
be a tool

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,240
or anyone's toy anymore.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,880
Before my mom
passed away,

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,800
she wanted me to run.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,600
My only wish is
to leave this place.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,320
You didn't just
not love me,

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
you never trusted me.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,160
You never believed

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,640
that I could protect you.

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,160
You're the Phisit family's
second son,

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,920
the rebellious one.

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,120
How could I entrust my life
to someone like you?

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,560
Do you know Lock?

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,880
Of course.

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,640
Lock is
your elder brother.

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,800
The one
who holds true power

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,600
in the Phisit family.

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,720
Why is Lock's badge
on you?

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,120
Because I am Lock.

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,160
Napat is the name

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,040
I used to hide
my identity since birth.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,960
Didn't you ever wonder

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,040
why everyone said I died
in that car crash,

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,840
yet I returned
without a scratch?

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,640
Lock,

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,400
you purposely spread
the news of the accident.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,360
The other branches
of the family

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,200
believed you were dead

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,080
and came after me.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,760
But all those traitors

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
have been dealt with.

46
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,440
My trip to Burin

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,960
was to release my trail.

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,760
I didn't expect them

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,960
to be so impatient
and act so recklessly.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,160
You must've been
frightened, Dad.

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,160
It's no big deal.

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,240
Yes,

53
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,440
for someone like you,

54
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,680
my plan was nothing

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,160
but a little trick.

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,240
With you taking over
the business,

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,400
I can rest easy.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,480
Dad,

59
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,160
there's something

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,720
I want to tell you.

61
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,480
I think I may have

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,760
fallen for a young man.
