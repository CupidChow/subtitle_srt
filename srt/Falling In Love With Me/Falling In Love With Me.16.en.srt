22

give my necklace back to me.

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,160
Be gentle.

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,880
This necklace was given
to me by Mr. Tang.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,720
Why do you care?

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
So it really has magical powers?

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,320
You...

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,760
How did you know?

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,440
Of course, it was Mr. Tang who told me.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,760
Fine.

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,480
I can give you the necklace,

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,920
but you have to tell everyone

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,360
that I did not plagiarize.

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,760
Your song was written by me back then.

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,760
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,760
I can't do that.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,560
Lin Xiaoqing, it's been three years.

38
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,000
Why are you always so selfish,

39
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,280
only thinking about yourself?

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,160
I used to consider you my best friend.

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,040
And you?

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,280
Missy, go back to school.

43
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:23,008
(I Am a Singer-songwriter) (Audition)
You have no talent as a singer.

44

Erbao, don't be sad.

45

Let's leave.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,800
Her singing was so bad.
I gave her the lowest score.

47
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,920
After all, it is a competition.

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,360
Right, she doesn't have much talent.

49
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,920
Her voice is just too mediocre.

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,040
Yes.

51
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,920
Erbao, don't be sad.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,280
Failure is the mother of success.

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,880
We can come back next year.

54
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,080
Don't be sad.

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,640
Hello.

56
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,360
Are you Lin Xiaoqing and Tong Erbao?

57
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,560

What?

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
Let me compete alone?

62
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,880
Lin Xiaoqing, right?

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,320
Both your voice and looks are very good.

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
We have discussed it.

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,400
If you participate alone,

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
we'll let you advance.

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,640
But...

68
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,680
Think about it
and reply to me within today.

Erbao, don't worry.

71
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
We agreed to be a band,

72
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,800
and the song was written by you.

73
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,560
How could I possibly sing it alone?

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,840
It's all because I didn't sing well.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,160
Don't worry. We'll try again next time.

76
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,240

to be a musician in the future?

113
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
did anything memorable happen?

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,400
Lin Xiaoqing, can you answer it, please?

115

Thank you.

116
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,680
Since you're so sad,

117
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,360
why not expose her?

118
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,840
That song

119
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,240
was written by you.

120
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,760
It makes no sense.

121
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,440
If I were the one singing that song,

122
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,960
I wouldn't advance,

123
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,320
let alone win an award.

124
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,760
They're right.

125
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,680
I sing badly,

126
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,480
and I'm not good-looking.

127
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,040
But you can write good songs.

128
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,640
You should believe in your talent.

129
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,360
Never mind.

130
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,160
An ugly duckling
is just an ugly duckling.

131
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,000
Unless there's magic in the world,

132
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,040
it can never change into a swan.

133
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,840
I was once like you,

134
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,800
but this necklace accompanied me
in achieving my dream.

135
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,000
Maybe

136
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,240
it will bring you good luck.

137
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,960
Really?

138
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
If you truly love music,

139
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,800
then don't stop singing.

140
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,360
One day,

141
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,640
someone will fall in love
with your voice.

give me back the necklace.

144
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,160
Just hate me all you want.

145
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
I will absolutely not
give you back the necklace.

146
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,440
Lin Xiaoqing,

147
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,160
believe it or not...

148
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,040
What are you going to do?

149
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,040
No way.

150
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,040
Mr. Tong, is Tong Yuxin here?

151
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,960
Erbao?

152
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,160
She hasn't returned home yet.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,840
why don't you like me?

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
What do you think, buddy?

173
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,440
It's almost your turn.

174
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,240
Are you nervous?

175
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Go back to your work, Shen.

176
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,280
Let me tell you.

177
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,240
One day,

178
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,680
I will become the chief director.

179
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,400
(I Am a Singer-songwriter)
At that time, can you be my award presenter?

180
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,136
What do you think?

181
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,400
What if I don't succeed then?

182
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,440
Drop the act.

183
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,520
In terms of songwriting,

184
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,840
who is better than you?

185
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,040
Anyway,

186
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,880
I gotta go backstage.

187
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,840
Keep it up!
