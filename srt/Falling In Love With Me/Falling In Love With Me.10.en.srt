Yuxin,

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,600
I really don't think it is a big deal.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,040
Look, although we're trending,

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,120
within ten minutes,

46
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,400
I've taken them all down for you.

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,960
I really think...

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
Hello, Mr. Zhen.

50
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,800
Cheer up.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,880
Even without the necklace,

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
it doesn't mean

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,280
you can't be a singer any more.

54
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,760
You know nothing at all.

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,120
You don't know
how much effort I've put in

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,880
and how much ridicule I've endured

57

Yes.

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120

94
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,160
Sure.

95
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,600
Sir.

96
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,040
Could you take a photo for us?

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,200
Alright.

98
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,120

Thank you.

104
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,080
I think you will definitely be

105
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,840
the champion of the competition.

106

I have a competition tomorrow.

109
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,160
I came to familiarize
with the place.

110
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,600
But

111
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,040
I don't sing very well.

113

there's nothing to be ashamed of.

My dream

115
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
is to write songs that everyone loves

116
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,040
and become an amazing singer.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,080
I wish your dreams come true.

What can I say about you?

123
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,600
I gave you the chance to prove yourself,

124
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
but you

125
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,120
gave me a strike instead.

126
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,880
Mr. Zhen,

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
Yuxin didn't strike on purpose.

128
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,944
- It's the pressure...
- Enough.

129
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,360
No need to explain it for her.

130
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,680
You can't sing, can you?

131
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,040
Then just don't sing.

132
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,408
Cancel the contract.

133
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,440
You're not cooperating with the company

134
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,600
and have caused us great losses.

135
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,320
Based on the contract,

136
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,680
we have the right
to terminate your contract in advance.

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,680
In consideration of
our three years of collaboration,

138
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,640
I won't ask you for a penalty.

139
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,840
Sign it.

140
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,000
Mr. Zhen,

141
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,360
please give Yuxin another chance.

142
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,320
Yuxin,

143
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,320
speak up.

144
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,800
Okay.

145
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,200
You're right.

146
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,560
I'm not good at singing.

147
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,680
I'm not fit to be a singer.

148
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,920
I agree.

149
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,919
Tong Yuxin.

150
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,960
I did misjudge you.

151
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,520
You are but a failed prodigy
that can't be helped.

152
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,559
Wait.

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,760
Who are you?

154
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,120
Who let you in?

155
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,240
Hello, Mr. Zhen.

156
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm Lin Tongyu.

157
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,840
What?

158
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,680
Lin Tongyu?

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,760
You, you, you...

160
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,800
You're the genius composer
whose songs are worth thousands

and world-class music producer,
Lin Tongyu?

162
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,320
Tong Yuxin is my student.

163
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,280
She is talented,

164
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,760
but hasn't found the right method.

165
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,760
I hope you can reconsider it, Mr. Zhen.

166
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,800
There's no doubt
about your capabilities.

167
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,360
But for Tong Yuxin...

168
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,600
If she gets one of the top three positions

169
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,120
in the next competition,

170
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,040
will you give her another chance?

171
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,960
Okay.

172
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,280
I will give Tong Yuxin

173
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,320
another chance

174
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
out of respect for you, Mr. Lin.

175
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
But Mr. Lin,

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,360
I hope that besides this,

177
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
you could agree to
cooperate with our company

178
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
and write a song for our new talent.

179
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,560
What do you think?

180
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,840
Okay.

181
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,520
Thank you.
