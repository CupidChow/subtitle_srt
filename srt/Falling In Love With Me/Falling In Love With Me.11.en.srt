=Episode 11=

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,800
Are you really Lin Tongyu?

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,280
The one who writes songs

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
for the excellent singers?

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
I didn't mean to
hide my identity from you.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,800
I've kept it a secret

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,080
because I wanted to quietly do music.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,000
So didn't you expose yourself due to me?

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040
So you must work hard.

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,280
Don't let me down.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,760
But only three months left

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,680
before the competition.

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,640
Can I make it?

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,680
You're actually very smart.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,760
It only took you a week

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,280
to get full marks
in the music theory exam.

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,600
And you're talented in songwriting.

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,680
I've listened to all your songs
from the past three years.

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,200
Two of them are actually quite good.

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,760
Though your singing is very poor,

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,720
that's not something
that can't be changed.

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,960
Really?

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,440
Believe in yourself.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,440
And trust me too.

40
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,000
But

41
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,320
weren't you always hating me before?

42
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,720
Why are you helping me?

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,240
Because...

44
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,240
Tong Erbao.

45
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,600
Mom.

46
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,320
You've been deceiving us
for three years.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
Three years.

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,520
If it weren't for you showing
your face on the live stream

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,840
and being recognized by your cousin,

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,040
we'd still be in the dark.

51
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,840
We thought you were working
in a publicly traded company.

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,200
Sit down.

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,960
Take deep breaths.

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,600
Careful with your blood pressure.

55
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,440
Don't argue in front of outsiders.

56
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Erbao,

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,040
take us back to your room.

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,040
What do you mean by my room?

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,600
This is my house.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,160
The whole villa?

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,840
You naughty girl.

62
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,320
You bad girl.

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,440
It's rented.

64
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,480
- Take it easy.
- Oh, my God.

65
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,000
Auntie.

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,480
Don't be so upset.

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,400
You shut up.

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
Pack your things
and come home with me now.

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,800
I'm not leaving.

70
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,320
I still haven't learned how to sing.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,120
Sing. Sing.

72
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,360
Your life is nearly ruined by singing.

73
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,560
Look at what people on the internet
are saying about you.

74
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,760
Erbao,

75
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,240
wake up.

76
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,360
With your voice,
you are simply not cut out for this.

77
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,280
We're just ordinary people.

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,880
What's wrong with being ordinary?

79
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,960
Does being ordinary mean
we can't pursue our dreams?

80
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,920
Ordinary people are even more afraid of
taking wrong paths.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,520
You're only in your twenties.

82
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,640
When you're in your thirties,

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,080
without a good education background,
a job, or a boyfriend,

84
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,560
you'll be doomed.

85
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,400
Anyway, I'm not leaving.

86
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,320
You...

87
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,640
Uncle.

88
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,560
Auntie.

89
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,800
Tong Yuxin is grown up now.

90
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,440
She has her own opinions.

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,120
You can't force her into everything.

92
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,560
Who are you?

93
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,280
He's here to teach me vocal music.

94
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,120
I think people like you
who are into music

95
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,480
are all somewhat dubious.

96
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,160
Auntie,

97
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm a lecturer at the music academy.

98
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,040
Legitimate.

99
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,680
- A lecturer?
- A lecturer?

100
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,200
How old are you, young man?

101
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,120
Do you have a girlfriend?

102
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Dad, Mom,

103
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,960
he's just here to teach me vocal music.

104
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,120
What are you talking about?

105
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,760
He's not your boyfriend?

106
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,760
Then pack your things

107
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,320
and come home with me now.

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Dad, Mom,

109
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,240
you can't do this.

110
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,640
Anyway, I will not leave with you.

111
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,000
Look at her.

112
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,680
She has been so spoiled.

113
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,640
I told you

114
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,840
we shouldn't let her work alone.

115
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,600
Alright, alright.

116
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,480
It's all my fault.

117
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,520
I promise to listen to you from now on.

118
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Baby.

119
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,040
I am aged and you still call me baby.

120
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,320
You will always be my baby.

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,320
Erbao can only be second.

122
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,920
Don't be angry, baby.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,560
Baby.

124
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,760
Be good.

125
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,560
Alright, baby.

126
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,600
Don't be angry.

127
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,360
Be good.

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,280
Uncle. Auntie.

129
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,880
I have to go.

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,880
I'll leave now.

131
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,840
Okay.

132
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,200
Don't be angry.

133
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,480
Dad. Mom.

134
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,880
I'll see him off.

135
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,440
Tong Erbao.

136
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,880
After you come back.

137
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,120
All right, don't be mad.

138
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,480
Don't be petty with her.

139
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,520
Calm down.

140
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,200
Your fault.

141
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,160
She has grown up.

142
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,440
Not three or five years old.

143
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,120
Listen to me.

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Have they always been like this?

145
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,040
Don't wash our dirty linen in public.

146
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,920
Don't even mention it.

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
I think

148
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,280
they are quite cute though.

149
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:43,920
Let's go.

150
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,600
Where?

151
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,560
Do you want to

152
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
go back with them?

153
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
What else can I do?

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,760
Well,

155
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,600
you want to elope with me?

156
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,920
Tong Yuxin,

157
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,920
answer me a question.

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
Is music really your dream?

159
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,320
Do you want to stay here?

160
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,000
I have a solution.

161
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,400
What is it?

162
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,760
Of course, it's

163
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
studying.

164
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,280
Studying?

165
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,600
What time is it now?

166
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,360
It's been six hours
and she hasn't returned.

167
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,080
You've spoiled her.

168
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,960
This time, I must take her back with me.

169
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,440
Don't rush.

170
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,000
I promise I will listen to you
from now on.

171
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
You naughty boy.

172
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,560
You guys.

173
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,960
It's already late.

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,880
A man and a woman alone.

175
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,000
Get off.

176
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,960
What are you doing?

177
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Dad, Mom.

178
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,160
We are studying.

179
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,200
- Studying?
- Studying?

180
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,280
You met late in the night.

181
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,080
Why did you study?

182
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,440
Are you even a man?

183
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
Uncle, Auntie, I'm sorry.

184
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,440
I asked Tong Yuxin here...

185
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,760
It is not Mr. Tang's fault.

186
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,960
I just love studying.

187
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,440
What's wrong with learning to sing?

188
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,560
No, it's me.

189
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,080
I wanted to teach Tong Yuxin.

190
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,880
She's really talented

191
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,800
and hardworking.

192
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,600
You should give her a chance.

193
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,960
Baby.

194
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
What do you think we should do?

195
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,480
Tang.

196
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,440
You really do have faith in her,

197
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,000
don't you?

198
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,080
Alright.

199
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
I'll give you three days.

200
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,720
(WeSing)
Within three days.

201
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,480
Erbao,

202
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,480
sing your "I Like You So Much"

203
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,200
to SSS grade on the app.

204
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,040
If you can't do it,

205
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,920
go back home with me right away.

206
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,040
Deal.
