What are you doing?

Right.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,000

less than half an hour together.

Give it back.

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,640
You must explain it first,

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and the necklace can't be taken off.

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
A kiss will remove it.

36

40
