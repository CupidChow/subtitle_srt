What?

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,200
Go home.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,160
No, Mom.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,400
Let's go home.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,800
I haven't practiced singing yet.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,360
Practicing what, Erbao?

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,520
Face the reality.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,120
No.

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,120
I can't give up.

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,800
Mom, Dad,

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,640
please give me one more chance.

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,400

I'm not going.

34
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:35,800
Wait.

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,200
She can't go.

36
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,280
Why?

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,360
Tong Yuxin,

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,720
I like you.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,520
Tang,

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,120
do you mean...?

41
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,280

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,680
and Mrs. Tong,

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,760
I'll back Tong Yuxin up.

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,480
From now on,

45
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,160
whether she wants to sing

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,600
or not is up to her.

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,440
She can do whatever she wants,

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,400
as long as you

49
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,720
agree to let her stay with me.

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,320
Tong Yuxin,

51
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
do you accept me?

52
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,280
Look how happy she is.

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,120
I...

54
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,840
Tong Yuxin, Tong Erbao,

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,040
I like you!

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,080
Tong Yuxin, Tong Erbao,

57
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,400
I like you!

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,160
Be my girl...

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,080
There are so many people.

60
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
What's going on?

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,880
Stay calm.

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
We'll see.

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,800
Who are these two?

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,760
They are my parents.

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,200
Dad, Mom,

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,240
my name is Liang Tete.

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Please sit.

68
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,240
You look quite young.

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm a junior in college.

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
A college student?

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
You're the same age as Erbao.

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,000
It's pretty good.

73
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,600
Our girl didn't even get into college.

74
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,840
What's the big deal?

75
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,000
I think Erbao

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,680
is better than many college students.

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,160
No, cousin, why are you here?

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
Cousin?

79
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,400
Mr. and Mrs. Tong,

80
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,040
my cousin doesn't know any better.

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,280
I'll take him away.

82
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,880
I'm not a kid.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
What do I not know?

84
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,120
What I mean is

85
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,480
my feelings for Tong Yuxin are serious.

86
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,480
Then tell us

87
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
what you like about Erbao.

88
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,120
She is very kind,

89
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,160
very serious

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,640
and very talented.

91
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,080
She writes great songs.

92
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,200
She's very attractive
when she plays the guitar.

93
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,920
That's me?

94
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,880
Yes.

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,480
I see.

96
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,480
It's all inherited from you, Mrs. Tong.

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,920
That's true.

98
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,240
Aren't you a sweet talker.

99
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,080
Tang,

100
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,040
what about you?

101
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,560
What do you think is good about Erbao?

102
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,800
In my eyes, she is good

103
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,960
in every way.

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,160
Yutong, are you bewitched?

105
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,480
Okay.

106
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,360
You guys can go back.

107
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,440
Let us have some peace.

108
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,440
Mom, we're not leaving then.

109
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,560
You now have
a personal thing to deal with.

110
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,240
Shouldn't we stick around and see?

111

Yutong,

I want to pursue Tong Yuxin.

What did you say?

119
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,320
She's my first love
whom I've been looking for all along.

120
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,120
She's the reason
why I want to be a singer.

121
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,120
Yutong,

122
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,240
I want to be with her.

123
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,640
You'll help me, won't you?

124

I won't show up at your wedding.
