Please rest assured.

I will have money soon.

The surgery fee will be paid
in a couple of days.

41
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,280
No.

42
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,280
I have some good news to tell you.

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,320
Xiaoqing,

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,240
someone paid the fee for your mother.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,760
Why did you rush me here?

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,760
Who asked for your meddling?

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,080
I'm about to get married to Zhen Defu

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,760
and I'll have lots of money.

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,600
I don't need you to pay for my mother.

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,800
Why didn't you tell me about it?

51
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,560
If it hadn't been for an old classmate
who saw her in the hospital,

52
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,240
I still wouldn't have known it.

53
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,160
What's the use of telling you?

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
Should I suffer the embarrassment
of borrowing money from you

55
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,320
and asking for your pity?

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,160
What happened exactly?

57
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Why did your mother become comatose?

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,680
This.

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,160
Auntie.

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,560
Auntie.

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,440
Why are you here?

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
I saw the location
you posted on your Moments.

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,959
I really can't escape from you.

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,480
Auntie,

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,040
please save my mom.

66
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,120
She's seriously injured.

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,000
If she doesn't have surgery soon,
she will be gone.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,360
Xiaoqing,

69
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,760
I want to help you,

70
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,680
but I really have no money.

71
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,480
Besides, the doctor said

72
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,360
your mom suffered a severe head injury.

73
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,280
We don't know if she can wake up.

74
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,520
It will cost much in the future.

75
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,000
But she is the only family I have left.

76
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,440
I really can't give her up.

77
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,160
Auntie,

78
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,280
don't you have
a good relationship with my mom?

79
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,280
So what?

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,560
Each family has its own worries.

81
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,720
Do I have to bankrupt myself for you?

82
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,400
Auntie, I promise

83
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,720
I will pay you back in the future.

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,840
Please save my mom.

85
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,920
I have nobody but you to turn to now.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,240
Fine.

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,840
Take these.

88
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,960
Never bother me again.

89
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,520
One day, I will be rich.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,680
I'll never need to beg any of you.

91
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:42,624
(Director Jia of the Competition)

92
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,800
Hello.

93
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,400
Hello, is this Lin Xiaoqing?

94
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,280
Have you made up your mind

95
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,480
about what we talked about?

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,120
I know you two have a good relationship,

97
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,600
but if you win the championship,

98
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,520
you'll get 100,000.

99
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,560
It's a pity to give up.

100
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,480
Okay.

101
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,800
I'm in.

102
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,640
Right.

103
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,640
I'm selfish and vain.

104
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,640
All I care about is money.

105
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,640
But if I weren't selfish,

106
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
I wouldn't have a mom anymore.

107
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,880
Why are you doing this?

108
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,520
Anyway, thank you for this time.

109
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,520
I will repay you as soon as possible.

110
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,240
Are you really going to marry Zhen Defu?

111
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,640
Of course.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,040
As long as I marry him,

113
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,240
I will be a rich lady.

114
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,920
No one will look down on me again.

115
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,480
But his feelings for you are fake.

116
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,480
If one day he wakes up,

117
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,680
what will you do?

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
As long as I keep singing,

119
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,560
how can he wake up?

120
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,040
Magic will one day lose its effect.

121
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,760
At that time, you will know

122
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,200
what you lose is more
than what you gain.

123
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,680
Don't be a busybody.

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,840
Xiaoqing.

125
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,080
Xiaoqing,

126

128

My darling,

129
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,040
my love for you is surging.

130
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,440
I can't help it anymore.

131
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,760
From now on, everything I have is yours.

132

Xiaoqing, I love you.

133
