You need to learn to
control your breath and your breathing.

Let's do it again.

69

I've sung it hundreds of times.

Why are you being so angry?

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,880

What difference could three days make?

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,960
I worked hard for three years

78
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,120
and I couldn't even pass
the preliminary selection.

79

Tong Yuxin,

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,880
are you going to give up?

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,480
Can you stop pushing me?

82
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
My parents are right.

83
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
I can't even score high
in a singing app.

84
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,880
I'm not fit to be a singer.

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
Does he think everyone is like him

86
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,960
born with talent and a good voice?

87
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,480
He enjoys whatever he wants.

88
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,560
He barely understands
the pains of us ordinary people.

89
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,040
You're absolutely right.

90
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,360
Liang Tete,

91
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,960
what brings you here?

92
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,240
After your last live stream,
I wanted to find you.

93
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,320
But my brother didn't want me
to disturb your practice.

94
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,800
You look pretty worn out, don't you?

95
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,600
Let's go.

96
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,640
Where?

97
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,920
Of course, to have fun.

98
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,920
Go.

99
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,720
- Where?
- Go.

100
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,200
Tang Yutong said

101
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
all of these are junk food.

102
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,128
They're bad for my throat.

103
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Well,

104
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,200
the most important thing is to be happy.

105
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,320
When we finish,
we'll take a walk in the park

106
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,240
and go shopping.

107
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,960
Well, thank you.

108
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Let's dig in.

109
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,040
(I'm sorry.)

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,040
(The number you dialed
is temporarily unanswered.)

111
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,640
(Please try again later.)

112
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,680
It's spicy?

113
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,400
I can't eat it.

114
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,520
It's bad for my throat.

115
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Didn't you say
you're not singing anymore?

116
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,760
Oh, right.

117
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,840
I'm never singing again.

118
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,200
How is it? Delicious?

119
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,640
If I don't sing anymore,

120
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,280
I won't be your idol then.

121
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,600
Even if you don't sing.

122
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,040
Even if you are an ordinary person,

123
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,320
I still want to be your fan.

124
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,480
I don't expect you
to skyrocket to success.

125
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,480
I just want you to be happy every day.

126
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,680
By the way,

127
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,320
what will you do if you stop singing?

128
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,920
I don't know.

129
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,480
I should have listened to my parents

130
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
to study properly
and aim for a good university.

131
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,280
Now I don't know anything.

132
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,920
I can only go back home
and open a store.

133
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,640
It is good.

134
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,240
I'll invest in your store.

135
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,880
Wish you to run a supermarket soon.

136
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,760
Are you cold?

137
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,328
I'll go buy two cups of bubble tea.

138
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,360
Wait a moment.

139
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,720
(Do you remember the dream
you told me about back then?)

140
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,880
My dream is to write a song

141
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,160
everyone loves

142
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,600
and become an amazing singer.

143
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I wish your dreams come true.

144
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,920
Thank you.

145
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,520
Keep going.

146
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,240
Excuse me, miss.

147
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,040
I need to take a leak.

148
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
Could you watch my guitar for me?

149
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,840
I...

150
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,160
Okay.

151
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you.

152
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,520
What am I doing?

153
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,080
(I did misjudge you.)

154
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,320
(You are but a failed prodigy
that can't be helped.)

157
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,280
Are you...

158
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Sorry. I'm in a hurry.

159
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,120
I need to leave now.

160
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:55,450
