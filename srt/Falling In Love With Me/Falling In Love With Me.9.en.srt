17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,000
When the chord root is
the lowest note played...

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,480
Tong Yuxin.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,080
It is called a root position chord.

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,480
The bass note is the lowest note.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,760
The root note might be the bass note.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,760
- Tong Yuxin.
- Like us...

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,320
Lin Xiaoqing must have been bewitched
the day she confessed to me.

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,560
No wonder you raised
the difficulty of my test paper.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,960
You never intended to
give me back the necklace.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,480
With the necklace,

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,160
you can make your goddess
fall in love with you.

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,320
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,920
I will score full points.

30
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,520
I will not let you succeed.

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,320
You seem very confident.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,600
Remember my mnemonic.

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,480
Among options, choose the shortest

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
or the longest.

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,880
If two are long and two are short,
choose B.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,280
For the same length, choose A.

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,120
If unequal in length, choose D.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,920
If uneven, choose C.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,320
Why are there
no multiple-choice questions?

40
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,280
You are powerful,

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,360
but he is more powerful.

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,080
It is 3 PM.

43
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,080
You have ninety minutes.

44
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,160
Now,

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,000
the exam begins.

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,800
Eighth note.

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,360
Time's up.

48
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,640
The exam ends.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,360
I haven't finished. Wait.

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,600
Yutong,

51
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,720
we are family after all.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,120
A tiger does not eat its cub.

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,520
If I score 60 points,
let's count it as a pass.

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,040
Sounds good?

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,640
This is not how idioms are used.

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,360
When will the results come out?

57
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,880
In a minute.

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,360
Well...

59
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,640
Hello?

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Tong Yuxin.

61
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,560
Something's wrong.

62
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,320
The company said

63
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,080
they are pushing
your livestream to today.

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,280
It starts at 6 PM.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,480
6 PM?

66
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,920
What's going on? Where are you?

67
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,520
Why haven't you arrived yet?

68
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,480
Mr. Zhen,

69
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,760
didn't we agree to go live tomorrow?

70
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,480
Tomorrow?

71
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,320
I have other plans for tomorrow.

72
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,560
What? Isn't it a live singing session?

73
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,240
How many times have you done this?

74
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,080
What's the difference?

75
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,280
I really can't do it today.

76
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,240
I...

77
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
I have a stomachache.

78
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,120
A stomachache isn't a sore throat.

79
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,600
My throat hurts as well.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,640
You seem to be talking normally.

81
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,400
Tong Yuxin,

82
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,120
stop making excuses for yourself.

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,760
Ever since you had issues
with your singing,

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,320
the company has handled
countless complaints.

85
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,640
The PR Department
is about to have a breakdown.

86
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,800
I've told you

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,400
that this live session is

88
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,640
your last chance from the company.

89
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,120
Either you go live on time
to prove yourself,

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,640
or you can terminate your contract.

91
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
There's only one minute left.
Where is she?

92
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,400
Oh my goodness.

93
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,720
Oh my.

94
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,920
Hurry up.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
Only one minute to go.

96
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Hurry up.

97
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Hurry up.

98
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,840
Come on.

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,680
Three.

100
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,720
Two.

101
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,600
One.

102
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,640
Go.

103
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,720
Hello, everyone.

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm Tong Yuxin.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,040
Welcome to watch my live stream.

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,200
(So this is what Tong Yuxin looks like.)

107
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,760
(Just average.)

108
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,600
(She hasn't done a live stream
for several days.)

109
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,880
(I thought Tong Yuxin
was done for and quit the internet.)

110
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,800
(Tong Yuxin, keep going.)

111
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,000
(Teach them a lesson with your singing.)

112
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,400
(I'm afraid it won't,)

113
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,200
(as it will completely wreck your ears.)

114
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,120
(Her singing is perfect as an alarm.)

115
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,280
(I'm sure you'll wake up immediately.)

116
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,640
Yuxin,

117
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
start singing.

118
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,320
Hurry up.

119
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,800
(Hurry. I'm waiting to enjoy the joke.)

120
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
(Sing that one called "I Sound So Bad".)

121
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,040
(Don't tell me you're afraid to sing.)

122
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
(I've already covered my ears.)

123
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,400
(Sing quickly.)

124
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,960
Your tone is rather dull,

125
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,920
and you are lacking
in the variety of it.

126
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,160
Your songs are well written,

127
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,720
but a singer needs to sing.

128
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,560
Yuxin, Yuxin.

129
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,920
Sing now.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,240
Sing.

131
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,400
Stop talking.

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,440
Tong Yuxin.

133
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,880
What's wrong?

134
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,840
I can't do it.

135
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,720
I'm scared.

136
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,320
I can't sing.

137
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,168
Don't be afraid.

138
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,720
They're right.

139
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,400
I sing badly.

140
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,680
I have no talent.

141
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,200
I'm not worthy of being a singer.

142
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
They're all wrong.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,440
Look.

144
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
You scored full points
on my music theory test.

145
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,160
Do you know how hard
my music theory test is?

146
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,080
You're very smart.

147
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
As long as you work hard,

148
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,880
you can do anything.

149
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,480
Full points?

150
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,440
That's great.

151
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,360
Actually,

152
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,440
I guessed on two of the questions.

153
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,400
I was so scared I got them wrong.

154
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,760
Now,

155
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,320
you can take back what's yours.
