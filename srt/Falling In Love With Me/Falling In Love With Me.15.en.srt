17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,640
Hello.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,320
Dear,

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,840
could you help me arrange

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,520
another date with Zhen Defu?

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,800
I think I was bewitched last time.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,320
I promise I'll behave well next time.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,440
You offended the man last time.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,240
How could he possibly
want to see you again?

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,120
Xiaoqing,

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,400
I've said it before.

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,280
This kind of opportunity
is once in a lifetime.

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,960
Once missed, it's gone forever.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,720
That's it.

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,680
Wait.

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,040
Well,

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,000
can you lend me some money?

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,920
I've been really strapped
for cash lately.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,680
What did you say?

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,120
Hello?

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,696
Hello.

37
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:42,280
I can't hear you.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,960
- The reception is bad. I can't hear you.
- Hello?

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,760
We'll talk next time.

40
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,400
(Xiaoqing, are you there?)

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,840
(Xiaoqing,)

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,960
(when will you pay me back?)

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,120
(Xiaoqing,)

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,160
(reply to me.)

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,120
Yutong,

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,760
I've thought it over.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
Although you're my only cousin,

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,200
Tong Yuxin is also my only love.

49
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,000
I will never let go.

50
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,600
Then try it.

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,040
So you'll teach me how to shoot.

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,000
No problem. Let's go.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,640
Mr. Tang.

54
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,480
Tong Yuxin,

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,800
why are you here?

56
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,640
I have something very important
to tell you.

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,680
Actually,

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,680
I have something to tell you, too.

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
I know how to get my necklace back.

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,200
Necklace?

61
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,120
I thought carefully

62
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,880
about the first time we met.

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,160
Maybe you should sing to me first

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,520
to activate the necklace

65
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
and then kiss me,

66
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,800
so the necklace can return to me.

67
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,560
No.

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,320
I can't give you the necklace.

69
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,800
Why?

70
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,000
If you regain your superpower

71
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,200
and can easily win others' favor,

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,880
will you still take music seriously?

73
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,720
Even without the necklace now,

74
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,280
I can make you a singer-songwriter

75
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,960
and write good music.

76
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
But the necklace was mine.

77
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
Are you coveting
the superpower of the necklace

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
and don't want to return it?

79
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,360
Tong Yuxin,

80
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,280
do you only think of the necklace
when you see me?

81
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,960
I...

82
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,880
Just give me back the necklace.

83
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,680
I promise

84
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,120
after I successfully pass
the singer-songwriter competition,

85
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,480
I will study music hard with you

86
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,920
and never use the superpower again,

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,720
okay?

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,160
Let's talk about it
after the competition.

89
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,920
Tang Yutong!

90
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,200
Alright, I got it.

91
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,040
Stingy man.

92
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,960
It's just a matter of a kiss.

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,640
He even refused to cooperate.

94
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,160
He can't possibly keep

95
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,120
the necklace for Lin Xiaoqing, can he?

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,040
Yuxin, something happened.

97
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,160
Your haters say online

98
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,959
that your debut song

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
copied the Singer-songwriter Champion
three years ago.

100
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,440
You'll be disqualified

101
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,800
from the competition this year.

102
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,840
What?

103
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,480
That song

104
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,480
was surely written by myself.

105
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,920
The song of Tong Yuxin?

106
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,480
Who knows?

107
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,640
Don't worry, Ms. Li.

108
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,640
Don't let it stop me from taking jobs.

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,160
I really need money recently.

110
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,280
Alright.

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,800
Alright.

112
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,040
I got it.

113
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,720
Bye.

114
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,242
(Erbao)

115
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,640
Lin Xiaoqing,

116
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,120
how dare you not answer my call!

117
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Yuxin, your debut song

118
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,600
really resembles her style.

119
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,920
And you were
good friends in high school.

120
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,920
Be honest with me.

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Did you do it?

122
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,720
Even you don't believe me.

123
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,480
That's not what I meant.

124
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,960
Never mind.
I've got Lin Xiaoqing's address.

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,880
I'll go talk to her.

126
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,040
Get out.

127
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,840
I'll go myself.

128
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,120
Send me the address

129
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
right now.

130
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,920
Lin Xiaoqing.

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,720
Mr. Tang.

132
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,760
What's with the trends on the Internet?

133
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
What do you mean?

134
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,560
Was that song

135
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
really written by you?

136
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,240
Mr. Tang,

137
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,880
you even suspect me of plagiarizing her.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
I know Tong Yuxin.

139
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,120
She'd rather write
bad songs and be scolded

140
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,880
than plagiarize others' work.

141
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
Why are you so biased towards her?

142
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,520
You used to stand on my side before.

143
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,720
Lin Xiaoqing,

144
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,800
I just want to hear the truth from you.

145
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
Okay. You sing for me,

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,760
and I will tell you.

147
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,120
Sing?

148
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,120
Sing your song, "The First Snow".

149
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,520
(Perhaps)

150
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,160
(only the magic of the necklace
can make her tell the truth.)

00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,960
what are you doing?

Yuxin.

157
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,880
How could you do this to me?

158
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,720
You refused to return the necklace,

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,040
but you gave it to her.

160
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,240
Let me explain.

161
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,560
It's not what you think.

162
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,800
- Mr. Tang, help me.
- Give me back the necklace.

163
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,320
Tong Yuxin,

164
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
let me explain.

165
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,280
Go away.

166

I don't want to see you again.

167
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,520
Come.

168
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
- Tong Yuxin.
- You!

169
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,600
Let me go!

170
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,720

171
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,760
Get in.

=Falling In Love With Me=

174
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,800
I thought carefully

175
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,760
about the first time we met.

176
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,160
Maybe you should sing to me first

177
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,560
to activate the necklace

178
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,160
and then kiss me,

179
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
so the necklace can return to me.

180
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,000
No.

181
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,400
I can't give you the necklace.

182
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,360
Why?

183
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,560
If you regain your superpower

184
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,800
and can easily win others' favor,

185
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,840
will you still take music seriously?

186
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,600
The necklace.

187
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
