it was hard for us to meet again.

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,920
Let's not let her interrupt our date.

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,600
Right.

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,480
Tong Yuxin,

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,880
we'll discuss that later.

Don't disturb our date.

60
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,840
I booked the entire camp this afternoon.

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,600
Go and play somewhere else.

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,160
I'll cover the cost.

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,400
M-Mr. Liang.

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,560
- What?
- What?

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,200
Mr. Zhen,

69
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,160
it's been so long.

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,120
Mr. Liang,

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,480
how has the Chairman been lately?

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,440
You can ask him yourself
at the group annual meeting

73
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,680
next month.

74
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,840
But you've upset my friend.

75
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,480
I'm not happy right now.

76

and my most important friend.

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,360
I am her fan.

why didn't you tell me?

83
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,920
Give a notice

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,920
and close the camp for the afternoon.

85
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,120
I want to book
the entire place for my idol.

86

belongs to your family?

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,280

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,280

What are you doing?

163
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,080
3 years ago,

164
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,760
a girl told me she loved music

165
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,400
because it could
make her forget her worries

166
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,000
and allow her to hear her inner voice.

167
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,080
She planted the seed
of love for music in me.

168
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
In order to find her

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,720
and let her see me,

170
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,080
I began to study music strenuously.

171
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,960
I've practiced this song
for a long time.

172
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,760
I must sing it to her,

173
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,840
and I hope she will like it.
