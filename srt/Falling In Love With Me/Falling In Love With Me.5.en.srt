Don't get me wrong.

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,120
I couldn't reach your agent,

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,880
so I brought you home.

Well,

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,880
I want you to do it for me.

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,840
Five minutes to go.

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,160
Can't you calm yourself down?

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
You know your love for me now

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,040
is from the necklace.

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm clear on that.

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,600
Then get off me.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,200
I just can't control myself.

Tong Yuxin,

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,720
now you know it.

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,920
It's unfair to manipulate

39
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,800
others' feelings with the necklace.

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,480
But,

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,520

What for dinner?

47
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,520
Whatever.

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
What does "whatever" mean?

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,400
Pasta, okay?

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,560
No tomatoes.

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,960
You,

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,800
try entering one more time.

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't want tomatoes.

54
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,720
Are you okay?

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,680
A hug and I'll be fine.

56
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm not hugging you.

57

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,640
I forgot it.

59
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,960
Good.

60
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,880
But

61
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,200
you already knew about the magic.

62
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,680
So you refused to return it.

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,079
I'm not like you.

64
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,160
