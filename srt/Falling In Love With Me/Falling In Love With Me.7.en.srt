=Falling In Love With Me=
=Episode 7=

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,480
Have we

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,480
met somewhere before?

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,680
Tong Yuxin.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,040
That's right.

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,560
You are Tong Yuxin,

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,080
the biggest fraud as a singer.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,520
I spent so much on your songs
and related items.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,760
Refund my money.

25
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,480
Why am I a fraud?

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,840
I'm profligate

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,000
or I broke the law?

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,040
You seem to ruin yourself in a new way.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,080
The song is the same,

30
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,360
but it sounds completely different.

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,720
I sing badly,

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,640
but I always sing badly.

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,760
Just my fans don't like me anymore,

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,560
so I'm wrong?

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,360
You heartless fans.

36
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,000
It seems to make a bit of sense.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,760
When you liked me,

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,480
you thought I was perfect.

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,720
When you don't,

40
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,560
you defame me now.

41
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,240
No one can be
more ruthless than you guys.

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,080
And you want me to refund your money.

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,960
Don't cry.

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,920
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,280
I am wrong.

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,240
Why are you wrong?

47
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,320
I shouldn't

48
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,720
have been disloyal as a fan.

49
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,680
I promise to remain your fan, okay?

50
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,800
Then

51
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,600
promise me one thing.

52
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,320
No problem.

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,240
Leave it to me.

54
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,640
Mr. Tang, thank you so much.

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,200
I will pay you back soon.

56
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,320
Why did you borrow
money from Tong Yuxin?

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,840
We were high school classmates.

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,960
We used to be close.

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
Sorry. I said you are my boyfriend.

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
I just wanted to upset her.

61
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,520
But I didn't mean that.

62
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,280
You said it two years ago.

63
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,240
Don't repeat it.

64
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,200
Mr. Tang.

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,400
I know you're kind.

66
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,440
But you just look cold.

67
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,160
You're a nice person.

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,680
You always help me

69
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,960
when I ask you.

70
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
You're so nice.

71
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,720
No need for flattery.

72
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,120
Tell me.

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,000
Are you in trouble?

74
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,520
No.

75
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,400
I've made a fortune as an influencer.

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,760
I've bought a villa recently

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,320
and I don't have enough cash.

78
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,400
The rest of the money
is still in the bank

79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,600
for interest.

80
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,400
Your career can't last long.

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,040
Are you really not going
to continue your studies

82
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
and be a singer?

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,960
I haven't sung for two years.

84
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,600
I've forgotten how to sing.

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,400
Mr. Tang, eat this.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,720
I'm full.

87
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,320
I'll transfer

88
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,720
the money to you.

89
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,680
Goodbye.

90
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,880
Mr. Tang.

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you sure the test paper
of your brother is on the computer?

92
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,120
Of course.

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,920
The password?

94
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,240
It's someone's birthday.

95
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,880
His girlfriend's birthday?

96
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Liszt.

97
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
His girlfriend has surname Li?

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,440
Liszt.

99
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,920
A great pianist and composer.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,320
My cousin's idol.

101
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,880
Are you illiterate?

102
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,560
That Liszt.

103
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,640
You scared me.

104
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,840
How can he have a girlfriend?

105
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,600
His mind is full of music.

106
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,120
Whoever wants to be his girlfriend

107
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,840
has to pass his test first.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,754
You and he...

109
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:18,520
No.

110
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,840
Who wants to be his girlfriend?

111
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,280
Go watch the door.

112
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,640
Go.

113
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,680
Be fast.

114
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,840
He will be back soon.

115
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,000
What are you doing?

116
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
Yutong, you're back.

117
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,920
Yutong, did you go to eat?

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,280
Where did you go to eat?

119
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Why didn't you tell me?

120
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm so hungry.

121
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Why didn't you tell me?

122
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,840
I'm so hungry.

123
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,960
Why didn't you tell me?

124
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,040
Did you go for a drink?

125
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,200
What did you drink?

126
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,960
Wine or Baijiu...

127
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,560
This wall is so white.

128
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,360
Yutong, you can't take it off.

129
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,640
Why?

130
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,480
I'll take a bath.

131
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,320
I mean well.

132
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,480
You may regret it.

133
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,080
Go out.

134
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,560
Stop it.

135
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,320
Tell me.

136
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,600
- It was him.
- It was her.

137
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,520
Didn't you say you'd be my fan forever?

138
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,840
But he's my only cousin.

139
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,640
But you...

140
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,800
No more whispering.

141
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,080
When did you get so acquainted?

142
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,160
Tong Yuxin,

143
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,560
given your act of stealing test papers,

144
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
I'll redraft the test

145
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,480
and double the difficulty.

146
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,400
What?

147
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
As for Liang Tete,

148
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,000
since you care so much about her,

149
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,760
you can take the test too.

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,600
If you fail,

151
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
pack up and leave immediately.

152
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,760
Please don't.

153
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,880
There are only three days left.

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,640
You guys study well.

155
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,240
Why didn't you

156
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,080
stop him?

157
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,560
It's your own business.

158
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,600
Why should I care?

159
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,160
It's you.

160
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,000
Wasn't it easy?

161
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,920
You blame me

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,600
for what you said?

163
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,960
I said the wrong thing?

164
00:08:03,392 --> 00:08:05,408
(Here's a bonus clip.)

165
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:07,002
=Falling In Love With Me=

166
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,280
You don't need

167
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
to see me out.

168
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,760
I'm just gonna throw trash.

169
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,160
Well,

170
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,920
what is your relationship
with Lin Xiaoqing?

171
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,840
She's my junior.

172
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,760
I once liked her,

173
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
but she rejected me.

174
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,800
