17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,200
Tete,

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,600
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,760
I can't be with you.

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,960
I'm happy when spending time

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,280
with you and I like it.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,360
However,

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,760
this kind of affection is not love.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,520
Have you met someone
who makes your heart flutter?

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Yes, I have.

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,640
I see.

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,200
Tete,

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,840
No need for apologies.

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,200
If you like someone, you should be bold.

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,040
I've tried my best,
so I don't have regrets.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,480
Erbao,

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,320
no matter who you end up with,

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,280
I'll always be your fan.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
I hope you can be happy.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,720
Hello?

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
Good news.

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,880
Lin Xiaoqing posted it on Weibo.

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,600
She said the song
was co-created with you,

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,360
so you didn't commit plagiarism.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Tong Erbao,

42
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,760
I owe you for what happened in the past,

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,880
but I will never return
the necklace to you.

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,560
Lin Xiaoqing,

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
you've suddenly got a conscience?

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,600
You think I wanted this?

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,120
All because I was forced by Tang Yutong.

48
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,440
Him?

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,440
Drop the act.

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,360
Take a look at Lin Tongyu's Weibo posts.

51
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,760
(Hello, everyone.)

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,280
(I am Lin Tongyu.)

53
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,600
(I made a mistake)

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,760
(and upset a very important person.)

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,560
(Today,)

56
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,200
(I want to say to her...)

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,880
He's not going
to confess to Lin Xiaoqing, is he?

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,080
Could you give me
the time to play a song

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
to make you fall in love with me?

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,880
I can make you fall in love with me

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,240
before a song is over.

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,120

I like you.

65
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,000
From when?

66
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
From a long time ago.

67
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,800
From the first day I saw you,

68
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,440
maybe I fell in love with you.

69
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,400
But you said it too late.

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
You've made me sad for so long.

71
