Do you dare to make a bet with me?

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,000
I can make you fall in love

19

20

(Now, the hottest singer online)

21

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,160
After all, no matter how I sing,

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,600
everyone will love me.

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,600
Tong Yuxin,

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,960
I know it,

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,920
but don't you rely too much on it?

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,680
What if...?

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,280
No "what if".

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,360
See?

39
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,040
Ever since I got this necklace,

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,560
it just can't be taken off.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,200

You always use the superpower.

49
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,760
When can you sing the song in tune?

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
I have a question.

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,240
What is it?

52
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,680
Is he handsome?

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,600
Yes.

54
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,760
Definitely handsome

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,400
in the age group over 60.

56
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,000
I won't go.

57

Tong Yuxin,

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400

I'm Tang Yutong,

Show me your foundation.

77
