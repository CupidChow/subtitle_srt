=Episode 4=

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,040
You like me so much?

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,560
What did you say?

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,840
I'll give you a chance.

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,520
Pass my music theory test
with full marks

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,840
and I'll agree.

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,280
Y-Y-You're making it hard for me.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,360
Not even willing
to put in a little effort

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,320
and you say you like me?

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,440
So it's not genuine.

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,600
Miss Tong,

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
I won't play your game.

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,320
Well.

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,160
Wait.

Why is he leaving?

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,080
Tang Yutong,

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,280
I agree.

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
I'm definitely not going to give up.

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,000
- Good!
- Good!

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Excuse me.

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,560
Hello, sir.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,120
Check.

38
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,234
(Give me a kiss, can you?)

39
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,160
You're so handsome.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,720
How can you be so hardhearted?

41
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,200
If you have time,

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
go to study.

43
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,664
(Basic Music Theories)

44
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,960
I am a senior singer-songwriter.

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,000
Why should I learn this?

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,279
Have you heard Tong Yuxin's new song?

47
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,959
What a piece of garbage.

48
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,560
I can't believe I liked her.

49
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,440
I was simply blind,

50
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,240
no, deaf.

51
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,080
Yeah.

52
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,080
Unmusical.

53
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,080
Cracking voice.

54
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,840
Even my grandma sings better.

55
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,240
And her songs

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,760
are words
like "one, two, three" and "ah".

57
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,600
Even a pupil could write those

58
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,280
and she claims

59
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,480
to be a songwriter.

60
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,680
No wonder she never shows her face.

61
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,840
Singing these songs?

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,640
She must find it shameful.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,920
Who knows?

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,360
Maybe she looks ugly.

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,640
I walk the talk.

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,760
