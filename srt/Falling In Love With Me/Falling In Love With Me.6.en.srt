=Episode 6=

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,880
Girl,

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,080
are you kidding?

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,600
Your singing is not vibrant,

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,840
smooth,

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,240
and articulate.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
The rhythm is not good.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,320
And even out of tune.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,160
Girl,

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,600
your vocal conditions are not good.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,440
Your voice is quite dull,

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,480
and you are lacking
in the variety of it.

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,680
You write good songs,

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,440
but a singer needs to sing.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,200
Give me another chance.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,440
I will strive hard.

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,000
Girl,

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
go back to school.

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,520
You have no talent as a singer.

35
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,280
No!

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,880
I am Tong Yuxin,

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,479
not Tong Erbao.

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,400
I must get my necklace back.

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,400
It's just music theory.

40
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
It's not so hard.

41
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,640
Intervals can be divided into

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,680
diatonic intervals
and chromatic intervals.

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,600
Diatonic intervals
include major intervals,

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,400
minor intervals,

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
and augmented fourth...

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,080
Tong Yuxin, keep going!

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,120
There are downbeats
and upbeats in music.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,400
They are repeated periodically.

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,640
Tang.

50
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,720
Mr. Wang.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,600
How is it?

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,960
Was Tong Yuxin surprised
when listening to

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
your song yesterday?

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,320
Professor,

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,160
please don't do such things.

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,080
I did that to promote your relationship.

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Tang,

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,920
you're not young.

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,200
You finally have a girlfriend.

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,080
You should cherish her.

61
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,120
Professor, actually,

62
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,000
she's not my girlfriend.

63
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,200
Tang.

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,520
As a man,

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
whatever you do,

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,160
you must be faithful.

67
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
The worst thing is

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,720
to be too greedy.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,680
Aren't you still thinking about
Lin Xiaoqing?

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,120
I...

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,839
(What a beautiful evening.)

72
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,680
(Does my bracelet look good?)

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,640
Okay.

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,720
Lady.

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,880
If you don't buy it, we'll be closed.

76
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,680
Please don't use our display items.

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,440
So stingy.

78
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,200
Hello, Ms. Li.

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,240
The bracelet advertorial
has been posted.

80
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,760
Any items I can promote this month?

81
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,080
I can do it in any form.

82
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,400
What? A toilet seat?

83
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,800
Xiaoqing,

84
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
this line of work is not easy anymore.

85
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,720
Now it's all

86
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,680
about live commerce.

87
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,400
I got a thing.

88
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,440
I will hang up.

89
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,080
Xiaoqing.

90
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,400
Xiaoqing,

91
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
you can't give up music.

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,560
Mr. Tang,

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,120
I've been a singer for a year,

94
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,480
and haven't made achievement.

95
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
Being a singer
has no future and no money.

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,440
I'd rather be an influencer.

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,840
But you are talented.

98
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,360
You have a good voice.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,920
You'll regret it.

100
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,560
There are too many more talented people.

101
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,880
When can I be popular?

102
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,680
Stay here.

103
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,080
I can help you.

104
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,120
Mr. Tang.

105
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,560
I know you like me.

106
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,920
But as a student,

107
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,360
you can't give me what I want.

108
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,960
Mr. Tang.

110
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,720
Mr. Tang.

111
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,840
It's been long.

112
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,200
How are you doing lately?

113
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,560
Why are you here?

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,120
I came to see you.

115
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,880
Mr. Tang.

116
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,800
It has been two years.

117
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,160
Are you still mad at me?

118
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,280
I was too young

119
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,600
and impulsive back then.

120
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,360
In fact, I want to ask you

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
if what you said back then

122
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,760
still counts?

123
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,280
Mr. Tang,

124
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,440
it really isn't easy

125
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,000
for me to come to see you.

126
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,520
There's something I want to say to you,

127
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,600
but I don't know how to start.

128
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,480
Music theory is so difficult.

129
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,440
I'll ask Tang Yutong to tutor me.

130
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,040
Mr. Tang.

131
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,520
You!

132
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,480
Lin Xiaoqing, pay the money back.

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
Let go of my hand. Stop it.

134
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,080
You disappeared after borrowing money.

135
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,640
I shouldn't have lent
you money back then.

136
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,280
I will pay it back.

137
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't escape.

138
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,040
Pay back the money.

139
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,000
Let me go.

140
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,240
You promised me at first,

141
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,880
- but then disappeared.
- Let go.

142
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,400
Let go of my hand. Stop it.

143
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,360
Pay back the money.

144
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,560
Tang Yutong,

145
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,800
don't interfere.

146
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,960
I'll pay it back

147
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,840
for her.

148
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,120
Why will you do it for her?

149
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,120
Because he is my boyfriend.

150
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Tang,

151
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,280
you are silly.

152
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,160
You guys.

153
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Calm down.

154
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,760
Professor,

155
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,760
let me explain.

156
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,680
Don't talk.

157
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,760
Bad guy.

158
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,880
Tong, I'm sorry for you.

159
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,080
But you must keep calm.

160
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,520
You.

161
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,160
I'm pissed.

162
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,760
Tang Yutong

163
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,440
is so annoying.

164
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,560
He also has such poor taste.

165
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
He's so cold to me,

166
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,600
and he likes Lin Xiaoqing!

167
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,520
He likes to pay for others?

168
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,400
Fine.

169
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,640
I'll increase five percent of interest.

170
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,800
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,040
Are you okay?

172
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,120
Have we

173
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,480
met somewhere before?

174
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:26,714
