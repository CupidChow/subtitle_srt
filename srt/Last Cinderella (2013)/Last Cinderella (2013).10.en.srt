00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,450

Hey, Tachibana.

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,940
- Look at that.
- Eh?

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,840
Stars.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,070
Gosh, this is not a time for talking about stars, is it?

38
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,690
Come on. You should lie down, too.

39
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,330
Hurry, take a look.

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,710
It feels good.

41
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:32,040
I haven't gazed at stars for many years.

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,780
They are truly beautiful, looking up at them like this.

43
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,440
It's a pity that I didn't look at them until now.

44
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,700
Didn't we learn how to find constellations in elementary school?

45
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,760
Yeah, we did.

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,270
Hey, what is that constellation? What's that called?

47
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,010
<i>Gyoza</i> (dumpling).
<i>(Constallations end with -za. It's a pun.)</i>

48
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,410
Of course I had to joke, you know.

49
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,290
That is Cygnus.

50
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,440
You've been knowledgeable about stars since before.

51
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,280
Then, how about that one?

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,040
That's Ursa Minor (Big Dipper). You don't even know
the North Star?

53
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,120
It was my first time

54
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,820
to receive a ring

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,010
from someone.

56
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,770
I need to return it.

57
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,510
How foolish. Even I thought

58
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,550
we weren't suited for each other at first.

59
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,450
Before I realized it, I came to believe we were a normal couple.

60
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,480
When he proposed to me,

61
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,040
I thought we were a perfect match.

62
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,620
I was completely fooled

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,840
by the spell that he casts.

64
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,830
I was tricked.

65
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,670
But, I'm not too disappointed.

66
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,270
How do I put it... I came to my senses...

67
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,100
or woke up from a dream.

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,600
You know, how Cinderella felt, after the spell was broken,

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,040
must have been like this.

70
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,200
What a birthday it was.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,780
Oh?

72
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,860
Oh yeah, I totally forgot that it was my birthday.

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,330
I am sorry for the trouble I caused everyone.

74
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,070
You don't have to think about it now.

75
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,870
Happy birthday to you. You are 40 years old?

76
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,050
Don't mention my age.

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,820
Do you want to celebrate?

78
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,480
That's a great idea.

79
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,790
Let's do that.

80
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,690
- Come on.
- Thanks.

81
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,140
Oof.

82
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,880
I'm bringing the booze to your place.

83
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,780
Okay, bring snacks, too.

84
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,830
- Chocolate and dried squid, okay?
- Okay, okay.

85
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,150
Okay.

86
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,440
<i> HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  </i>

87
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,000

<i>Sakura-san.</i>

89
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,550
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,490
I am terribly sorry.

91
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,650
I don't know how much Chiyoko told you, but...

92
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,890
It is true that I approached you because Chiyoko told me to

93
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,220
on that day.

94
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,020
<i>I know I was wrong to have lied to you.</i>

95
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,640
But, sincerely, about Sakura-san...

96
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,940
Why are you here?

97
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,240
Sakura-san, is this really the end for us?

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,930
<i>Is it really the end?</i>

99
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,970
Don't bother. Go home.

100
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,740
Leave it as it is. I'll clean up later. Let's drink for now.

101
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm the one that doesn't like it.

102
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,880
Why are you getting so serious about this?

103
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,470
The balloons and the  flowers are not to blame.

104
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,830
Forget it. Why don't you start drinking first?

105
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,390
Thank you.

106
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,750
I'm glad that you are here, Tachibana.

107
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,620
Just kidding.

108
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,000
Were you joking?

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,840

Gather, everyone.

141
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,190
The rainy season is at its peak.

142
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,210
It's a season when hair styling is not easy, and customers have trouble managing their hair.

143
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,150
Please put in your effort to solve problems for them, even a bit.

144

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,820
<i>Tachibana-san.</i>

150
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,070
Is Sakura-san okay?

151
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,700
She can't get back to being herself right away.

152
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,160
Please deal with her in the usual way.

153
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,750
Yes.

154
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,460
Why did you do such a thing?

155
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,020
That's because I really don't care about anything anymore.

156
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,590
Why?

157
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,390
Why don't you ask yourself why?

158
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,060
What?

159
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,900
You made a deal with Rintaro-san, didn't you?

160
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,520
Both you and Rintaro-san are the worst.

161
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,120
You should've hurt me. Why did you hurt Sakura-san who has nothing to do with us?

162
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,100
Don't you get it?

163
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,220
That's because hurting Sakura-san can cause you the biggest damage to you. That's given.

164
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,900
<i>I hope you and Rintaro-san will suffer
watching Sakura-san being sad.</i>

165
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,440
<i>I hope it will hurt you like hell.</i>

166
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:28,020
I didn't sleep a wink. I want to get some sleep, so get out.

167
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,460
What's that?

168
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,840
It just sleep-inducing drug.

169
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,900
It's fine.

170
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,000
Doctor said I won't die but will just have some pain
if I overdose it.

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,550
Hmm.  Good night.

172
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,980
- I'll go.
- No, I will.

173
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,710
Then, I'll go.

174
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,420
Please do.

175
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,700
Sakura-san, let's go.

176
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,810
Huh, where to?

177
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,940
A video arcade.

178
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,990
A video arcade?

179
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,120
Come on. Let's go, Sakura-san. Recent arcades are super fun.

180
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,360
Recent arcades...   Are you saying I'm old?

181
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,860
Not at all.

182
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,300
Let's go.

183
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,240
- Let's go.
- It will be fun.

184
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,800
Can't help it.  Then just a little.

185
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,520
Great! Let's go.

186
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,230
Tachibana-san, come with us, too.

187
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,080
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

188
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,210
Let's go!

189
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,190
Yahoo.

190
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,860
Let's play basketball next.

191
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,560
I'm home.

192
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,290
Hi, welcome home.

193
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,260
Miki-chan, have a seat.

194
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,740
- What is it?
- Just sit down.

195
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,970
Tada. I booked it.

196
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,240
You kidding!

197
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,470
It's true.

198
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,900
What?  You managed to book a wedding venue?

199
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,320
Luckily, Miki's dream wedding venue happened
to have a cancellation.

200
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,200
- I can't believe it.
- I was really lucky.

201
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,060
It's in two weeks.

202
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,410
Eh?

203
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,940
- In two weeks?
- So sudden.

204
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,830
Is that bad?

205
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,610
Well... considering Sakura's situation,

206
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,880
I don't think it's a good idea to have a happy wedding.

207
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,680
I get that, but they are fully booked for this year.

208
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,700
If we miss this opportunity, we might regret it.

209
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,950
Really... I was going to have a new kimono tailored, but

210
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,150
it can't be done in two weeks.

211
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,290
Kimono, right?

212
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,840
Two weeks should be enough, so I will look into it
on the Internet.

213
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,320
Are you going to buy me one?

214
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,120
Yeah, I will.

215
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,550
Really? I'm so lucky.

216
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,880
- Takasagoya~ (traditional poem used in wedding ceremories)
- Oh, there you go!

217
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,960
- Dance along with her.
-  Hoist the sail on this boat...

218
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,520
You are the best!

219
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,980
Is that why we are here?

220
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,090
That's right. It's my first pre-wedding spa treatment.

221
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,000
I thought it was odd for stingy Miki to want to come to a spa.

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,400
Call me "frugal."

223
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,250
Sakura.

224
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,180
I'm sorry for doing this at a time like this.

225
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,090
What are you saying? I'll be mad if you are worrying about that.

226
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,890
By the way,  we will take care of your hair styling and makeup. Will that be okay?

227
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,020
Of course!

228
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,760
Take care of me, too.

229
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,140
Certainly.

230
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,200
By the way, Sakura.

231
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,150
Did you talk with him after that?

232
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,050
I didn't.

233
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,620
I see.

234
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,760
But, it's okay.

235
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,120
I was shocked I was lied to,

236
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,790
but, these past few months I spent with him were really fun.

237
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:51,540
Besides, he made me remember how wonderful
falling in love was.

238
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,810
It is unreal that a couple with a 15-year-age gap could date like a normal couple to begin with.

239
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,280
Now I know it was all lie, I feel rather relieved.

240
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,680
It's kind of hard for me now.

241
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,450
But, I will be fine as time passes.

242
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,480
I'm sorry to have worried you.

243
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,630
That's okay, but...

244
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:20,610
But, it's hard for me to believe it was all a lie.

245
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,750
Shima-san, you saw it too, right?

246
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,370
How he was when Sakura fainted at the bike competition.

247
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,940
He was really concerned about her.

248
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,760
If he was faking it, he must be a real good actor.

249
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,790
He might as well stop being a rider and
become a marriage swindler.

250
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,900
Swindler?

251
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
What I'm saying is, he looked really sincere.

252
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,250
I get it, but...

Sorry for the wait. Please go in.

- Great!
- Proceed slowly.

<i>Matchmaking Party for Hasegawa Shima-san </i>

260
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,240
Kenichi-san.

261
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,490
What?

262
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,210
Everyone is here.

263
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,230
Really?

264
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,100
Ah, excuse me. Please excuse me.

265
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,080
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,190
Okay, thank you for coming today to Matchmaking Party

267
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,170
for Hasegawa Shima-san.

268
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,260
I'm the manager of SOBAR, I'm not a 'babah' (old lady)...

269
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,980
It's SOBAR. I'm Endoh Kenichi.  Pleased to meet you.

270
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,430
Well then, let's welcome today's main guest,

271
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,400
Shima-chan, come out!

272
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,600
I'm Hasegawa Shima.

273
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,970
I'm honored to see so many of you here today.

274
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,420
I'd like to ask a few questions.

275
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,210
Those who want to sleep with me right away,

276
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,540
I'm sorry but can you please raise your hands?

277
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,380
Yes.

278
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,300
Thank you.

279
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,990
Then, those who raised hands,

280
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,470
I'm sorry but please leave now.

281
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,040
What?

282
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,390
Although you came all the way, I'm sorry.

283
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,990
I'm not looking for someone to sleep with, but

284
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,700
someone who is interested in my inner self rather than my body.

285
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,380
I'm really sorry.

286
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,810
Take care. Good bye.

287
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,500
We lined up from the morning.

288
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,440
Wait. Are you leaving already? Why don't we go
somewhere quiet...

289
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,890
and have a talk...?  What a pity.

290
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,430
Okay now, all of you who are still here,

291
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,660
I'm sorry but can you raise your right hands?

292
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,870
Are you ready?

293
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,400
Here I go again.

294
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,490
Start with rock, rock-paper-scissors.

295
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,160
He won!

296
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,750
Those who didn't sign scissors, I'm sorry but please leave.

297
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,530
Thank you so much for coming. I'm sorry. Good bye.

298
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:38,170
I'm sorry. See you again.

299
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,490
what's your name?

300
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,120
I... it's Kondo Suguru.

301
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,350
Suguru-san, right?

302
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,810
I know it is sudden, but would you go on a date with me tonight?

303
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,120
Tonight? ... Tonight...

304
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,680
Are you alright?  Calm down.

305
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,370
Of... of course.

306
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,490
Thank you.

307
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,920
Are you alright?

308
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,950
Please watch out.

309
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,650
Will it be okay to go on a date with a guy like that?

310
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,220
It'll be fine.  He looks sincere.

311
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,740
I guess... but I didn't think you would decide
with rock-paper-scissors.

312
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,270
Maybe I don't want to give up on Sakura and her boyfriend.

313
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,520
What?

314
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,600
I want to prove that it doesn't matter how the relationship starts.

315
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,090
I won! I won against Kantaro.

316
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,180
I heard from your father

317
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,080
that you stood up to Grandma for me.

318
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,070
Thank you.

319
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,040
Oh, today's dinner is hamburger steak.

320
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,460
It's my favorite.

321
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,700
<i>This is for Dad.</i>

322
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,980
<i>What? Why is this white?</i>

323
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,390
Yours is made of tofu.

324
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,280
Tofu? Why?

325
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,500
We must be careful not to have your blood sugar level go any higher than now.

326
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,310
That's right. You have to listen to Miki-san and become healthy.

327
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,410
But Miki-san.

328
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,880
I heard onion and okra are effective to lower
the blood sugar level.

329
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,690
Is it really?

330
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,560
What? You didn't do any research?

331
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,990
I did, in my own way.

332
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,520
In your own way?

333
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,740
Can we eat?

334
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,570
Ah, sure.

335
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,920
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

336
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,590
- Looks delicious.
- I wish I had a meat one...

337
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,410
I'll have one, too.

338
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,550
Miki...

339
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,750
Thank you for the meal.

340
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,370
Thank you for the meal!

341
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,510
Delicious!

342
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,040
- I'm glad.
- So good.

343
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:53,500
<i>A married couple feels their love toward each other through ordinary days.</i>

344
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,870
Thank you for waiting.

345
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,300
- I'll go.
- No, me.
- Me.

346
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,750
- Then I go.
- Please do.

347
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,130
Next, let's go to Karaoke.

348
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,300
I want to hear Sakura-san sings Akina.

349
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,900
I want to hear it, too.

350
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,110
This is enough.  Thank you, everyone.

351
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,890
Thanks to all of you, all my sorrow was blown away. I'm feeling tired of you worrying about me.

352
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,540
Seriously? Then how come you are binge eating?

353
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,580
We didn't invite you to cheer you up, Sakura-san.

354
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,780
We simply want to hear you sing.

355
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,520
That's right.

356
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,260
What is there to hesitate about?  Let them hear you sing.

357
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,700
Your deaf-tone Akina.
<i>(Nakamori Akina = singer) </i>

358
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,730
Hold it! My singing is ten times, hundred times better than your "Erimo Cape."

359
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,990
Idiot!  Everyone will agree that my "Erimo Cape" is better than the original singer.

360
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,110
Tomonori-kun, report this to Mori Shinichi-san's agency.
<i>(Erimo Cape was sung by Mori Shinichi)</i>

361
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,650
Absolutely!

362
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,690
Whose side are you on?

363
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,670
I'm on Sakura-san's side.

364
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,160
Yuppie!

365
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,700
Tachibana-san, thanks for treating us.

366
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,530
Sakura-san.

367
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,120
You are persistent. Why don't you give up already?

368
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,360
Sakura-san, please listen to me.

369
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,410
Let's go, Sakura-san.

370
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,170
Sakura-san...

371
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,790
I was faking at first, but

372
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,680
I came to love you. That's the truth.

373
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,670
I knew I had to tell you the truth someday.

374
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:36,590
I was attracted to you before I knew it.  And, when I realized it...

375
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,050
I couldn't tell you because I was afraid to lose you.

376
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,350
I really love you now.  My proposal was sincere, too.

377
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,040
If I win the competition, please meet with me one more time.

378
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,720
Sorry.

379
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,570
Sakura-san?

380
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,200
Sakura-san.

381
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,880
Don't approach her anymore.

382
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,470
Whenever you show up, she gets hurt even more.

383
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,580
Can you make her happy in the first place?

384
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,860
I can make her happy better than you can.

385
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,410
At least, I won't hurt her.

386
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,830
If you really love her,

387
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,890
you should think about that.

388
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,780
Don't be so nervous.

389
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,610
I'm sorry... It's that I have scarcely dated before.

390
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,800
Ah, a waiters will pick it up for you.

391
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,310
What?

392
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,480
I'm sorry.

393
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,930
Why did you decide to participate in the matchmaking with me?

394
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,370
I wanted to change.

395
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,700
I get nervous easily, and I hate myself for it.

396
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,920
If it's with you... with a lady who is confident,
I thought I could change.

397
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,160
It's the same.

398
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,570
What?

399
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,020
Ah.... This is good, isn't it?

400
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,460
Why don't you try it, too?

401
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,980
Ah... Yes.

402
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,550
You are right. This is delicious.

403
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,560
Can I have another glass of wine?

404
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,400
Of course.

405
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,520
Excuse me. Excuse me!

410
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,930
From him?

411
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,890
Wait a second.

412
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,240
Can you forgive him?

413
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,160
After all, I don't think everything was a lie.

414
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,250
How can you be so naive? Wake up already.

415
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,640
He hurt you badly, and yet do you still love him?

416
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,190
Do as you please.

417
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,120
I like this one.

418
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,100
Not the pants, the jacket.

419
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,000
How about this?

420
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,990
- This.
- Yeah, I like that.

421
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,800
- Right?
- You can decide that.

422
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,310
Are you mad?

423
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,270
Put some serious thought into it.

424
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,210
I am thinking.

425
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,550
But I'm looking at this one.

426
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,960
Okay, enjoy your tea.

427
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:34,030
That's right. I'm having the best time of my life.

428
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,150
Good for you.

429
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,500
Sorry for the wait.

430
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,840
Your hair is getting longer.

431
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,520
Excuse me.

432
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,110

434

435
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,400
Where are you going?

436
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,060
Are you still chasing after that woman?

437
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,990
Why don't you give up already?

438
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,580
She knows you were lying.

439
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,160
Sakura-san is important to me.

440
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,220
I don't want to give up on her.

441
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,230
I won't let you.

442
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,470
I won't let you be happy by yourself.

443
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:12,990
If you are going to see her, I will take the whole bottle of pills.

444
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,640
Chiyoko.

445
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,290
I'm serious.

446
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,790
I don't care if it doesn't kill me, I'll take them anyway.

447
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,010
Why?

448
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,180
You have been always by my side up until now.

449
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,520
Are you going to abandon me?

450
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,380
Don't go, Hiroto.

451
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,930
I can't stand being alone anymore.

452
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,200
I'm begging you.

453
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,760
Don't leave me alone.

457

Non-chan, please take care of Mother-in-Law.

458
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,610
- Yes, okay.
- Tomonori-kun, look after fathers of bride and groom.

459
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,670
- I got it.
- Thank you everyone.

460

461
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,560

462
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,330
help each other to get yourselves ready.

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,070
What's wrong with your tummy?

464
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,430
- Shh...
- What was that?

<i>It's rare that we receive a fax.</i>

Yes.  What is it?

470
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,410
<i> Manager Mr. Tachibana Rintaro </i>

471
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,040
<i> appointed as manager of New York branch. </i>

472
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,420
No way.

473
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,910
New York?

474
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,800
Alright, alright, I'm coming.

475
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,400
Hey, this... what's going on?

476
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,690
Can you read what it says?  Isn't it obvious?

477
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,880
What in the world...?

478
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,430
You have only been with us for three months.

479
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,940
Why New York? I don't understand this.

480
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,770
They will open a new salon there in the fall.

481
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,470
I didn't expect to be transferred to an overseas branch,
but what can I do?

482
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,920
Since I was the one who requested a transfer.

483
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,790
Requested a transfer? What's going on?

484
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,190
Why did you decide on your own?

485
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,750
Calm down.

486
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,800
If I'm gone, you may become the manager that you always wanted to be.

487
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,380
I don't really care about that right now.

488
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,750
What I want to ask is...

489
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,930
Forget it. Suit yourself.

490
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,730
Then what am I supposed to do?

491
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,980
When the girl I love is marrying some other guy,

492
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,070
am I supposed to just stand and watch it?

493
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,800
Hurry up and go.

494
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,440
<i>New York? It' far.</i>

495
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,950
Right.

496
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,500
How do you feel honestly?

497
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,580
What do you think about Rintaro?

498
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:16,300
Tachibana has been... always right next to me.

499
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,300
It is only natural to be beside him.

500
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,810
So when I heard about his transfer, I was terribly shaken.

501
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:30,450
But, I don't think he is my love interest.

502
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,070
I have been treating him like my family,

503
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,870
who I can say anything to.

504
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,230
<i>I see. I guess you are right.</i>

505
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,550
<i>You have always thought of him as a friend,</i>

506
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,380
<i>so it's hard for you to look at him as a man.</i>

507
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,110
<i>But, missing your boyfriend badly when he is away</i>

508
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:56,670
or having your heart flutter  just to think about him... that kind of relationship is nice.

509
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:00,280
But, a relationship that lets you be true to yourself if you're with him...

510
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:06,760
don't think that is also one form of romance?

511
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,290
I am not trying to compel you and Rintaro to get together.

512
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:21,870
Why did I spend all my money on that stupid horse?

513
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,100
You guys should've stopped me.

514
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,600
I'm sorry.

515
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,300
Oh? You are Hiroto's...

516
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,530
What a coincidence.

517
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:39,090
Look, the bite mark you made became a scar.

518
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:42,240
Can you pay me compensation?

519
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,030
Geez, can you move?

520
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,910
I'll report you to the police.

521
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,320
Go ahead.

522
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,260
Hey, what are you doing?

523
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,150
Take her.

524
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:57,300
Wait, let go...

525
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,740
Welcome.

526
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,130
Oh? Didn't you meet Sakura-chan outside?

527
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,020
No.

528
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,360
That's strange. She just left.

529
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,060
The heck. Only 3,000 yen ($30).

530
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,000
You should carry more cash since you are an old lady.

531
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Never mind. What is your pin number?

532
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,870
You guys, cut it out already.

533
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,980
Don't think you can get away with this.

534
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,550
Shut up!

535
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:32,050
You talk too much, old hag.

536
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,400
What the heck are you guy doing?

537
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,420
Why did you do that for, bastard!

538
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,530
<i>Come on.</i>

539
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,410
<i>Finish him off.</i>

540
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,920

- It's enough. Enough.
- No, you have to. If you don't  get treated, it won't heal.

567
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,540
- I said it's enough.
- It won't heal.

568
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,760
You never listen to me.

569
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,280
Oh, right.

570
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,340
Here.

571
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,260
That's right. Thank you.

572
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,200
Sorry you got injured because of me.

573
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,820
It's not your fault. The fault is theirs.

574
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:28,900
That man... is Hiroto's ex-girlfriend's brother.

575
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,860
He broke up with her to date me,

576
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,760
so it's partially my fault,

577
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,000
and I can understand why they attacked me.

578
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,360
But, I'm sorry to have involved you, who have nothing
to do with it.

579
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,880
Why does everyone say I have nothing to do with it?

580
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,000
What?

581
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,200
I love you, so you can't say I have nothing to do with it.

582
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,580
<i>I have MUCH to do with it.</i>

583
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,340
What are you saying?

584
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,580
I have to clean this up. Um, it's antiseptic solution...

585
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,170
Shall we go to New York together?

586
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:22,810
Until now, I have thought what mattered most was your feelings.

587
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,410
But I am not going to hold back anymore.

588
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:30,830
I... will make you happy.

589
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,870
I will protect you.

590
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,060
So...

591
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,380
let's go together.

<i>Thank you very much. See you.</i>

593
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:13,750
Today, I'll go meet with Hiroto-kun.

594
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,490
I have decided

595
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:21,450
to talk to him properly.

596
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,870
Is that so.

597
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,250
Yup.

598
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,140
<i>It's me.</i>

599
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,600
Can we meet now?

600
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,300
Hiroto-kun.

601
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,300
Thank you for the flowers.

602
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,650
Did you see my mail?

603
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,790
I see.

604
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,070
What's happened?

605
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,880
Hiroto-kun?

606
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,670
It was a lie.

607
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,030
What?

608
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:12,260
You are so naive. You were tricked again.

609
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,760
So...

610
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,810
I lied about everything.

611
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:24,650
Confessing my love and proposing to you, too.

612
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,450
Isn't that obvious?

613
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,630
Think about it.

614
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,530
A young man like me

615
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:38,070
won't possibly fall in love with an old woman for real.

616
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,340
It was fun. But I'm tired of it, so I'm done.

617
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,460
Don't bother with me anymore.

618
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,650

- You let Sakura-chan see him alone.

No matter how I look at it, you are masochistic.
