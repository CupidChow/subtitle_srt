1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,590
<i>My face when I'm kissing...</i>

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,410
<i>Oh, she is pretty, isn't she?</i>

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,140
<i>Huh? Oh... Yes.</i>

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,270
<i>That was a little... don't do that with my ear.</i>

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,690
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,640
<i>About the fact that I approached Sakura-san at your request,</i>

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,880
<i>please keep it quiet if possible.</i>

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,730
<i>No way...</i>

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,910
<i>The reason you approached her...</i>

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,230
<i>Make absolutely sure she doesn't find this out.</i>

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,780
<i>No matter what happens, don't you ever let her know.</i>

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,260
<i>Before she learns about it,</i>

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,800
<i>break up with her just like normal couples do.</i>

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,210
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Last Cinderella Team @Viki.</i>

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,870
- What do you want?
- Do you have a minute?

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,160
- No!
- Here!

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,770
- Hey, that's cold!
- I'm coming in.

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,180
Then why did you ask?!

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,210
Is it around here?

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,900
What's this?  They are all baseball comics.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,850
What are you doing?  Why are you here, going through my stuff without asking?

22
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,060
It's not here.

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,730
What is it?

24
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,590
- A porn video.
- Huh?!

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,420
You have one, right? Why don't you take one out.

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,710
I don't have any.

27
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,960
- You're lying!
- No, I'm not.

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,250
I don't rent those kinds of things lately -

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,010
Why are you looking for a porn video?

30
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,160
He said that...

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,570
We haven't done it yet.

32
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,990
Didn't do it? Who didn't do what?

33
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,540
<i>I lied to you.</i>

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,390
<i>I've been lying to you.</i>

35
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,320
<i>I'm sorry. The truth is we...</i>

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,960
<i>- didn't do anything. (sex)
- Eh?</i>

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,090
<i>When we first met, you were drunk.</i>

38
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,310
<i>When you woke up, you were at the hotel, right?</i>

39
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,310
<i>At that time, I told you that we had sex,</i>

40
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,200
<i>but the truth is... nothing happened.</i>

41
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,260
<i>Really?!</i>

42
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,200
<i>I'm sorry!!</i>

43
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,860
<i>I lied because I wanted to see you again.</i>

44
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,840
<i>I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you the truth.</i>

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,700
<i>You wanted to see me again?  Oh, my goodness- </i>

46
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,060
<i>So you mean, you and I...</i>

47
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,740
<i>not even once?</i>

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,980
<i>Really...?</i>

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,740
That means he has lied to you all this time.  Didn't you get upset?

50
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,340
I was annoyed... since I thought I got pregnant.

51
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,460
I also thought why he didn't tell me sooner.

52
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,100
But somehow I was glad.

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,980
Because he wanted to see me,

54
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,660
he bothered to lie.  Think about it.  Isn't he so cute?

55
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,220
Besides,

56
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,160
I thought I didn't remember my first time in 10 years because I was drunk...

57
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,380
To think that I can do it for real, I'm getting so excited...
So horny.

58
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,980
So, we decided to

59
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,320
- go on a trip to make it memorable.  What should I do?
- When are you going?

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,640
We haven't decided yet, but I'll request time off.

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,760
- We're busy this month, so I can't give you time off.
- Huh?

62
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,100
We got the magazine photo shoot, so it'll be inconvenient if you take time off now.

63
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,680
What do you mean?  Not even a day?

64
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,080
What can't be done can't be done.

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,640
Stingy! Such a cheapskate!

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,420
Oh well, forget it for now.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,720
I have something to ask you.

68
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,220
I forgot how to make love.  Can you tell me?

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,340
You went to a hot spring?

70
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,540
The open-air bath was so great.

71
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,120
- Where did you go to?
- Kusatsu.
- Kusatsu!?

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,400
Wow, it sounds romantic.

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,060
You can't (take time off).

74
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,760
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much!

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,260
Why not?

76
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,380
You're so persistent.  When it's no, it's no.

77
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,140
- Why not?
- I'm saying you can't go.  Don't you get it?

78
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,380
I don't get it!

79
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,760
- Welcome, good afternoon!
- Welcome, good afternoon!

80
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,120
Uhm, I have an announcement.

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,980
What is it?

82
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,500
I found a part time job.

83
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,430
<i>This is a hand that is working so hard... It makes me  want to protect you.</i>

84
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,890
<i>I'll teach you about stocks and computers.</i>

85
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,490
<i>You can help me until you find another part time job.</i>

86
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,800
<i>How about 2,000 yen (20 USD) per hour?</i>

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,580
It's for a short term.

88
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,010
What kind of company is it?

89
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,120
It's administrative work.  At a real estate company.

90
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,940
Wow, that's great.

91
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,670
So, Mother, starting tomorrow, I won't be at home during the day.

92
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,580
Go right ahead.

93
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,930
But I can't help you if everything here gets messed up.

94
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,850
Hey, Mom can work hard

95
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,940
so we can go eat at a BBQ restaurant next week.

96
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,410
Yay!

97
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,120
If we splurge like that,  my part time salary
will be gone in no time.

98
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,500
That's right.  Buying clothes for the job will deplete it.

99
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,350
- Saki-chan, you're done already?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,990
Thank you for the meal.

101
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,210
Thank you for the meal.

102
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,440
Saki-chan seems down lately.

103
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,500
Isn't it because she's in puberty?

104
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,880
I wonder if it's ok to leave her alone...

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,560
There's time when (teenagers) don't want to be bothered.  It'll be fine... just leave her alone.

106
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,680
Are you done?

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,900
I didn't eat it yet.. but oh well.

108
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
<i>If you're going as a couple, these places are the best, right?</i>

109
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,500
<i>Right?!</i>

110
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,260
Oh right, Rintaro said he knew a good place to go.

111
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,740
- Oh yeah, speaking of Rintaro. Are Choko-chan
and Tachibana dating?
- Eh?!

112
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,920
Really?!

113
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,380
You didn't know?

114
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,740
I haven't heard of it.

115
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,680
- Wow, this place looks nice.
- Welcome!

116
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,400
- Hi!  Here...
- Sakura-san.

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
- Beer please.
- Alright!

118
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,040
Did you find any good place?

119
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,180
I was just talking to Ken-chan... How about this one?

120
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,860
<i>There is an open-air bath attached to the room?</i>

121
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,920
<i>Yeah.</i>

122
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,080
We can take a bath any time, then.

123
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,320
We can bathe together.

124
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,520
By the way, I'm paying for the trip.

125
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,180
Eh?! No, let's split it.

126
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,820
No! It's a bit early, but

127
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,960
it's my birthday gift to you.

128
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,920
Then... let's find some place less expensive.

129
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,640
Sakura-san?

130
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,060
Didn't we decide to make this a great memory for us?

131
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,660
Then, let's go to a place where you want to go.

132
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,240
<i>I can pay for it so leave it to me.</i>

133
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,460
Okay.

134
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,060
Can I ask you a favor?

135
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,680
I would like  to have a spare key.

136
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,880
You don't have to if you don't feel up to it.

137
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,740
We can just meet up like this.

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,520
I got it.

139
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,480
I have it at home. When we go home, I'll give it to you.

140
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,920
- Thanks.
- Hm.

141
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,620
Sorry. Go ahead.

142
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,940
Watch your steps. Are you gonna be okay?

143
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,300
<i>I'm so happy... So happy.</i>

144
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,280
What, What is it?

145
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,800
<i>Happiness, when you hear, can I have a spare key?</i>

146
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,850
Sorry to keep you waiting.

147
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,580
Me too... sorry to ask you to come out this late.

148
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,240
No, it's totally fine.

149
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,590
What is it that you want to talk about?

150
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,700
Ah, we bumped into you the other day, right?

151
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,810
Ah... Yes.

152
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,450
At that time, we were in this complex situation and...

153
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,190
Kin (Sakura) and I couldn't talk to you then.

154
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,980
There's nothing between Kin (Sakura) and me.

155
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,690
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.

156
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,270
You came all the way here just to tell me that?

157
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,770
Sorry.  I guess I could have just called.

158
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,780
No... I'm glad.

159
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
So, Choko-chan...

160
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
Rintaro-san?

161
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,190
Couldn't it be me?

162
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,970
Eh?

163
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,250
Couldn't I be your romantic interest?

164
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,310
Ah... Well... it's not about you, but...

165
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,500
I'm really not interested in anyone right now-

166
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,060
<i>If you want to protect Sakura-san,</i>

167
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,950
<i>please take care of Chiyoko.</i>

168
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,020
Couldn't I at least have a chance?

169
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,290
I'm not asking you to like me.

170
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,140
I just want you to get to know me.

171
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,930
Can't you do that?

172
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,980
Can I work until the morning today?

173
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,740
<i>Oh sure.  Why are you so eager?</i>

174
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,050
I have some reasons...

175
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,720
<i>What is it?  You look happy...</i>

176
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,840
<i>- Bring them over here.</i>
- Okay.

177
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,020
It's a mess, but please come in.

178
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,840
Thank you.

179
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,850
<i>Let me give you an overview.</i>

180
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,940
Yes, please.

181
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,160
<i>As you can see here, you can see the movement of stock prices in a real time.</i>

182
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,460
This is a  list of stocks I own.  If you see any huge movements, please wake me up.

183
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,090
<i>I understand.</i>

184
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,930
<i>I'll leave a key here, so you can come and go as you like.</i>

185
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,120
Yes.

186
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,520
<i>If there is anything you don't get, just wake me up.</i>

187
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,410
Good night.

188
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,750
Eh? Good night...

189
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,350
What a shocker...

190
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,280
That was so bad for my heart.

191
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,090
This looks difficult...

192
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,790
Hey...

193
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,220
Thank you very much.

194
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,200
What are they doing?

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,150
They are like grade school kids.

196
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,740
It's worse than that.

197
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,410
Eh?

198
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,890
Good morning.

199
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,700
Wow, it's so clean.

200
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm sorry for doing it without asking...

201
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,690
I had nothing to do so...

202
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,540
No, thank you very much.

203
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,880
I made some food too, so if you like, please eat it.

204
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,910
A meal, too?

205
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,220
<i>It's nothing big.</i>

206
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,890
<i>Wow, it's Oyako-don (Chicken and Egg Rice Bowl)</i>

207
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,220
I really like it.

208
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,520
Oh good.

209
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,950
I'll get going.

210
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,040
Please wait.

211
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,070
Here.  This is for today.

212
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,360
I can't take all that.

213
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,890
But, it's 2,000 yen per hour.  It was from 9:00 to 3:00, so it's 12,000 yen (120 USD).

214
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,540
I didn't do anything today.

215
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,080
Here.  You cleaned the room, and even made me some food.

216
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,270
I should be paying you more.

217
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,500
No...

218
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,710
This is so heavy.

219
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,990
Oh, you can't get through this way.

220
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,490
Please make up before leaving.

221
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,770
The mood in here is getting bad.

222
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,260
Hey...

223
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,210
What is it?  Just say it.

224
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,090
It's nothing.

225
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,950
Don't say it's nothing.

226
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,110
Why can't I go on the trip?

227
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,140
I got it.  You are jealous.

228
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,110
You fool.

229
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,750
Then what is it?

230
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,390
Are you serious?

231
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,760
About what?

232
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,780
About him.  Do you really like him?

233
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,080
Yeah.

234
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,010
I see.

235
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,660
Then, go.

236
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,850
What do you mean?  Something doesn't seem right.

237
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,750
Then, don't go.

238
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,300
I don't need your permission.  I'll go.

239
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm just saying, don't regret it.

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,740
If you like him for real, then it's fine.

241
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,620
Even if you regret it, you'll be able to accept it.

242
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,790
I won't regret it.

243
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,810
Then it's fine.  Nice work today.

244
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,200
Nice work today to you, too.

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by

247
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,900
<i>So nice...</i>

248
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,450
<i>Yeah... it's so healing to be in the water.</i>

249
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,140
<i>I'm so glad you like it.</i>

250
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,690
<i>Miki, how did you know about this wonderful "Lady's Day Package" here?</i>

251
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,470
<i>I found out when I came to the nearby aquarium with my family.</i>

252
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,350
<i>But it was during the summer break, so it was so crowded.</i>

253
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,300
<i>I have wanted to come here during the weekday some time.</i>

254
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,160
<i>My dream finally came true.</i>

255
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,640
<i>And to pay for it with the money I earned... it's like a dream.</i>

256
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,460
<i>Miki, </i>

257
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,700
<i>Yeah?</i>

258
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,970
<i>Congratulations on getting a job.</i>

259
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,360
<i>Thank you.</i>

260
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,460
Thank you.

261
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,930
It is such a nice feeling to make my own money.

262
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,520
Actually, I have felt inferior to you guys.

263
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,400
Hmm?

264
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,270
You two are independent.

265
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,520
I think that is amazing.

266
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,940
You are not scared of anything,

267
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:50,930
and you know what you want.  It's because you have gained confidence through your successful careers.

268
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,090
I didn't have that.

269
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,680
But, my life still has a long way to go.

270
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,110
I hope someday, I can be more confident about myself.

271
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,900
I'll be cheering you on.

272
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,560
Me too.

273
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,450
Thank you.

274
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,540
Sorry for talking about something so serious.

275
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,620
It's okay.

276
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:21,100
It's so nice to have a drink in my swim suit.

277
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,560
There's a bed too.  If only we had some guys here,
it would be perfect.

278
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,660
Shima-nee...

279
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,340
I'm being serious.  It is boring to live all alone.

280
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,990
I can get money or house by myself, but to be happy alone is really hard.

281
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,170
I won't be too picky so,

282
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,110
I want someone who understands me to be beside me.

283
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm getting some snacks.

284
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:54,320
Maybe she's finally willing to look for a steady boyfriend.

285
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,380
Maybe she's finally gotten over her previous marriage.

286
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,840
Maybe.

287
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,270
Feels so good!

288
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,100
Hey! Can I buy some souvenirs for the kids?

289
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,680
- Yes. They are having a sale there. Let's go look.
- What is it?

290
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,320
<i>- Where would go wearing this?
- I wonder.</i>

291
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,720
<i>You should wear something like this.</i>

292
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,720
Tetsuro.

293
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,400
<i>Shima.</i>

294
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,360
It's been a while, hasn't it?

295
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,900
Yes it has.

296
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,190
Have you been well?

297
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,880
Yes. You too, it seems?

298
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,730
Fortunately yes.

299
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,780
Papa!

300
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,250
Oh, Hibari.

301
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,390
So you finally decided on the dolphin?

302
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,600
Shall we go to the aquarium to see a real one?

303
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,240
Yippee!

304
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,290
Mama is coming.

305
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,320
<i>Mama, I bought this by myself.</i>

306
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,890
I remarried, 4 years ago.

307
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,100
Congratulations. You're lucky to have a kid now.

308
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,450
And you? Are you happy?

309
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,740
I am.

310
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,490
I haven't remarried, but I am having fun as it is.

311
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,740
Hearing that makes me relieved.

312
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,030
Well then. I need to go now.

313
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,910
Sure.

314
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,270
- Be well.
- You as well.

315
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,010
Hibari, come here.

316
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,350
Shima-nee? Are you okay?

317
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,440
What is it?  Let's buy the souvenirs and go home!

318
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,310
You're going the wrong way.

319
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,060
Oh, it was here?

320
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,970
Welcome! Alone?

321
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,870
Yeah.

322
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,630
What would you like?

323
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,970
I'll have vodka, straight up.

324
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,710
Wow! Today you're starting straight from a strong one.

325
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,320
Here you go.

326
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,150
<i>Excuse me?</i>

327
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,490

329

Did you forget?

330
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,070
You know, that time at the restroom?

331
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,220
<i>Do you have a minute?</i>

332
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,230
Oh...

333
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,060
I wanted to meet you for so long. I've been unable to forget about you ever since.

334
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,690
How about it? Today we could go somewhere, four of us...

335
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,640
Stop kidding me.

336
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,150
Well, just one person at a time.

337
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,420
You like it right? "That."

338
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,170
<i>What do you think you're doing?!</i>

339
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,120
There is no way I would do it twice with
an unskillful person like you.

340
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,690
Your friends look so bad as well.

341
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,450
Come again once you've got more experience.

342
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,570
What are you saying, wench (<i>'ama' in Japanese)?</i>

343
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,930
<i>Wench?  Isn't it from Showa era? (meaning it's an old expression).</i>

344
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,970
You are soaked. You are so drenched.

345
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,310
Stop it! Ow, ow! It hurts.

346
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,510
It's fine. I love to wipe people's faces.

00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,690
Really?

352
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,790
<i> Reminder
Preparation for Happi and headband for Sport Day </i>

353
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,900
<i>My goodness. He's right.</i>

354
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,910
What's wrong?

355
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,090
Well, I forgot to prepare clothes Kakeru is going to wear on the Sport Day.

356
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,380
You see? This was bound to happen since you started to work.

357
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,690
<i>Saki-chan, I'm going shopping now.</i>

358
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,220
I think the supermarket by the station is still open.

359
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,920
<i>Take a bath and go to sleep, okay?</i>

360
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,700
I'm going now.

361
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,140
Geez, that's why I told her so.

362
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,850
<i> Happy Go Lucky </i>

363
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,310
Good work today.

364
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,940
Good work.

365
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,340
Sakura-san, you are going on a trip tomorrow, right?

366
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,570
That's right.

367
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,690
Please enjoy yourself since you couldn't go to the hot springs with us.

368
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,700
Sure. I'll buy you souvenirs.

369
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,450
Sure.

370
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,900
Tomoniri-kun, I have a favor to ask.

371
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,130
What is it?

372
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,040
Good work.

373
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,190
Emm...

374
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,600
What are you watching?

375
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,990
Tomonori-kun helped me find it.

376
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,420
Why don't you watch it at home?  I have to do bookkeeping now.

377
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,260
I would be a pervert to watch this alone.

378
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,140
You are a pervert to watch it when others are around.

379
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,880
Well, well, well. Don't mind me.

380
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,830
Here you go. Sure, sure. Here.

381
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,690
Give me a break. How can I work listening to that?

382
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,640
Here.

383
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,130
Where do I plug this in?

384
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,240
Right here.

385
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,900
Oh, here?

386
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,450
I can't stand it.

387
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,770
Amazing.

388
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,860
Wow, crazy. This is crazy.

389
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,520
What? Is it normal to make sound like this?

390
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,100
Ugh. Wow!

391
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,200
Woo. No, don't. Not there.

392
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,990
You can't. This is erotic. Too erotic.

393
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,600
I can't watch this anymore. I really can't.

394
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,900
Shut up! It's normal for a porn.

395
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:54,410
Do you think I have to lead him since I am older?

396
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,540
Is this why you were watching a porn in a fluster?

397
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,120
- Yes.
- Idiot.

398
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,880
He looks like he has a lot more experience, so let him lead.

399
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,770
You think so?

400
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,040
But, It's not good if you are too much like <i>'maguro (tuna)'</i>.
(maguro: being passive when having sex)

401
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,070
<i>'Maguro'</i>?

402
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,510
Women are...

403
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,960
Women? What about women?

404
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,810
Never mind.  I'm going home.

405
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,980
Wait a minute. What about women?

406
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,660
Watch that and learn.

407
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,020
Why don't you tell me?

408
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,010
Ah!

409
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,510
No!

410
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,390
Sorry.

411
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,930
S-sure.

412
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,530
♫ <i>I just felt that I knew it all</i> ♫

413
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,410
♫ <i>I just tried to put it all away</i> ♫

414
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:00,730
♫ <i>Everytime I got too much to recall I'm holding back my tears</i> ♫

415
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,690
Good work.

416
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,900
♫ <i>Taking plenty of time</i> ♫

417
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,670
♫ <i>We all made it getting here</i> ♫

418
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:16,370
♫ <i>And we wanted someone to understand what we believe</i> ♫

419
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:28,680
<i>Suddenly, I see my friend as a man.</i>

420
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,530
<i>I figured he would be remarried.</i>

421
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:37,100
I didn't imagine him having a kid though.

422
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,570
But it is all clear to me

423
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,970
that it was I who had a problem that didn't allow us to have kids.

424
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,270
He made a right choice splitting up with me.

425
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,890
How funny.

426
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,680
You are amazing, Shima-san.

427
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,670
What?

428
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,560
You congratulated him, right?

429
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,330
There aren't many women who can act maturely like that.

430
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,770
Let's drink tonight. I'll keep you company until the end.

431
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,640
Thanks.

432
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,630
Oh! Did you go to a hospital for ED?

433
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,590
I made an appointment.

434
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,540
Really?

435
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,820
They didn't have an opening on my days off. But I'll go next month. So don't worry.

436
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,220
Okay.

437
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,450
Let's have a toast.

438
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,790
For what?

439
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,380
Friendship between us.

440
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,250
Cheers!

441
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,730
- No way!
- Not my forehead, to my glass.

442
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,710
Come on, cheers.

443
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,550
- Here.
- On my forehead? An, sorry.

444
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,710
Ah, here it is.  Oh good.

445
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,830
Shima-san!

446
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:17,310
Sorry.  Although I said I would never see you again, I haven't even deleted your phone number.

447
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,740
Me too.

448
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,630
Let's delete the numbers for real.

449
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,560
Next time we see each other, it will be with Miki.

450
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,120
Of course.

451
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,380
Let's go home.

452
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,460
Yeah.  Let's go.

453
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,200
<i>- Cheers.
- Ouch.</i>

454
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:55,640
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
Last Cinderella Team @Viki.</i>

455
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,770
Welcome home.

456
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,550
Ah... I'm home.

457
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:06,090
Right away, I used the spare key.

458
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,650
Was that bad?

459
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,390
No, I thought you would be home after me,
so I was a little surprised.

460
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,830
Are you hungry?

461
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,550
I am.

462
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,390
I'm making pasta.

463
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,770
- Really?
- Yeah.  It's almost done, so wait a little bit.

464
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,400
- Mom!
- I'm home.

465
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,460
Not!

466
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,320
What are you saying?

467
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,620
Are you that disappointed that it was me?

468
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,960
Miki-san isn't home yet.

469
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,340
Eh?

470
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,730
She left home around 7:00 for shopping...
I wonder where she went.

471
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,880
What did she go get?

472
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,970
My clothes for Sport Day.

473
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,150
I think she went to get some fabric.  She said the store in front of the station would still be open.

474
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,920
<i>Connecting you to the voicemail...</i>

475
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,650
I got it.  I'll go get her.  Don't worry.

476
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,300
You guys go to bed.  Mom, please.

477
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,100
Be careful.

478
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,750
Hiroto-kun, did you wait?  No, this isn't it.

479
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,420
Oh yes.  This one.

480
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,050
Do this, and show some shoulder and...

481
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,230
Ah, Hiroto-kun.  And with this... how about this?

482
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,170
I think it's good.

483
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,530
Oh, were you watching me?

484
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,550
So you like something like this.

485
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,380
You're taking all of that?

486
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,450
Yeah, I am.

487
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,580
And, a towel, a toothbrush, toothpaste and

488
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,180
an umbrella.

489
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,250
Umbrella aside,  you don't need a towel.

490
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,160
I'm definitely taking a towel.

491
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,570
When I sweat, I can wipe it off like this.

492
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,330
And if I spill something, I can use it too.

493
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:43,160
And, if it's windy, do this... and it won't be cold.

494
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,550
Why are you laughing?

495
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,750
It's nothing.

496
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,290
It's nothing?  Why did you laugh?  Just tell me.

497
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:55,950
Hey.  Why did you laugh?

498
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,030
It's nothing.

499
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,060
What?

500
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,940
It's nothing.

501
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,610
Sorry.  I thought you looked like a middle aged man.

502
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,400
What?

503
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,510
This is in the way.  Let me have it.

504
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,150
Sorry.  I won't say it again.

505
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,210
Yes, hello?

506
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,170
Are you Sakura-san?  This is Takenouchi, Miki's husband.

507
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,000
Ah.  Hello.

508
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,550
Has Miki called you?

509
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,510
No, she hasn't.

510
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,160
Did something happen to Miki?

511
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,970
She went out shopping, but she's not back yet.

512
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,850
Eh?

513
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,620
If she hadn't called, then it's fine.  I'm just calling some people who might know.

514
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,200
Sorry to bother you.  Thank you.

515
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,380
Hello?  Hello?

516
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,110
Hello?

517
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,890
She hasn't called?

518
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,120
I bet she saw us.

519
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,880
What if something happened to Miki?  It's my fault.

520
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,100
There's no point in thinking like that right now.

521
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,720
Let's just look everywhere.

522
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,430

523
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,800

00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,940

00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,510
Here you go.

529
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,660
He gave me a chance.

530
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,460
What?

531
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,330
<i>Ken-chan!</i>

532
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,510
Welcome.

533
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,940
Did Miki come here?

534
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,500
<i>Miki-chan isn't here.  Did something happen?</i>

535
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,320
She's missing.

536
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,950
Eh?

537
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,660
She went out shopping but has not come back yet.  She's not answering her phone, either.

538
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,770
Her husband is worried and is looking for her.

539
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,740
If you hear from Miki, let me know.

540
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,650
<i>Ok, I got it.</i>

541
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,350
Please.

542
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,900
Sakura!

543
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,600
Shima-nee.

544
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,070
<i>Oh, Takenouchi.</i>

545
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,580
Hello.

546
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:16,260
<i>♫ You say ‘it’s okay’ out of habit ♫</i>

547
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,790
So, you guys were together.

548
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,950
Eh?

549
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,530
W, wait... So Miki-san's husband is Takenouchi-san?

550
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,760
Does it have anything to do with Miki gone missing?

551
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,420
Shima-nee, you said there's nothing between you.

552
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,350
Sakura, that's not it.

553
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,370
What's not it?

554
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,250
Stop it.

555
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,200
- Wait...
- Just stop it.

556
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,580
I'm going to look again.

557
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,550
Sorry to bother you all.

558
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,840
Shima-nee...

559
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,910
Why did you stop me?

560
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,970
We don't know any facts yet.

561
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,860
Cornering them without knowing facts could create an irreparable situation.

562
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,260
<i>For now, let's think of places she could go.</i>

563
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,200
<i>I'll make some coffee.</i>

564
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,960
<i>Why don't you call her home again.</i>

565
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,470
Maybe she's already home.

566
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,930
<i>There are things</i>

567
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:26,050
<i>that you can't get back once they are gone.</i>

568
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,370
You look sad.

569
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,970
What happened?

570
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,290
You might feel better if you talk.

571
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:01,260
I saw my husband with another woman.

572
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,910
You must have been shocked.

573
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,620
If I didn't know who the woman was,

574
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,640
I wouldn't be this shocked.

575
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,550
She was my friend.

576
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,640
So you mean, your husband cheated on you with your friend?

577
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,130
I don't want to believe it, but

578
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,840
not matter how I think about it, it was strange that they were hanging out together.

579
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,670
I wonder how long it has been like this.

580
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,840
I see...

581
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:50,970
It happened because I told him to go see Shima-san.

582
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,780
I was the one who created an opportunity for them.

583
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,680
Wh-What are you doing?!

584
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,480
I'm sorry.

585
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,770
You look cute, so...

586
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,820
Next week, Mila Pharmaceutical will introduce new cancer drug.

587
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,730
It is certain that Mila Pharmaceutical's stock will rise up right after the announcement.

588
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,760
So, Miki-san.

589
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,410
Would you like to make an investment?  It can be one million... or even two million yen.

590
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,790
What?

591
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,260
I wanted to offer you something positive at a time like this.

592
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,320
I want you to cheer up.

593
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,830
Your investment will be doubled at the beginning of the following week.

594
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,760
What do you think?

595
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,660
I got it. I'll withdraw money right now.

596
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,200
Really?!

597
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,460
<i>I will need money if I got divorced.</i>

598
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,660
This might be a heaven-sent opportunity.

599
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,920
Is there a convenience store nearby?

600
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,640
<i>Yes, I'll take you there.</i>

601
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,220
I can go by myself.

602
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,040
I'll be right back.

603
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,870
Sakura-san?

604
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,900
Hhm?

605
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,960
You washed that earlier.

606
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,250
Ah... ahh...

607
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,220
Should we postpone the trip?

608
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,750
Well, but it's too late for that.

609
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,460
Sorry. I will go look for her.

610
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,740
- Miki!
- Sakura.

611
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,610
What have you been doing?!

612
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,560
I was worried about you.

613
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,470
She was at the downstairs of this building.

614
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,340
She will catch a cold like this.

615
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,600
You're right.

616
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,020
Hurry and come inside.

617
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,760
Sorry.

618
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,360
Geez, you must be cold.

619
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,810
Thanks, Tachibana.

620
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,120
Come in.

621
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,820
You will get sick.

622
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,910
I'm leaving then.

623
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,750
Ah... I'm sorry.

624
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,350
It's fine. We can go next time.

625
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,260
Thank you so much.

626
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,950
Miki.

627
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,520
Thank you very much for accepting Chiyoko.

628
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,260
I'm just going to dine out with her every once in a while.

629
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,830
But that's a huge step up for her.

630
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,700
She's been in love with you for a long time.

631
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,050
You love her too, right?

632
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,110
What?

633
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,430
Talking about Sakura.

634
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,210
You love her, right?

635
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,280
So what if I do?

636
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,660
Are you backing out?

637
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,100
Like I said, I am not...

638
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,650
Please take a good care of Chiyoko.

639
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,780
Well then.

640
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,840
Really? I'm so relieved.

641
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,180
I am coming to pick her up right away.

642
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,740
Ah! For tonight, I'm letting her stay here.

643
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,480
Is that okay with you?

644
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,770
Yes, of course.

645
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:07,100
She is also worried about her children,

646
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:12,130
can you give them reassurance when they wake up
tomorrow morning?

647
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,370
Okay. Yes, thank you.

648
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,670
- I will leave her in your care.
<i>- Yes, good-bye.</i>

649
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:36,880
So where did you go?

650
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,890
Host club.

651
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,310
What?

652
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,700
I almost got swindled by a host and gave him money.

653
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,970
Why did you go there?

654
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,990
I told you I work as a real estate receptionist, right?

655
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,630
Yeah.

656
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:04,910
That was a lie.

657
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,670
Actually, the guy we met at the host club that we went together,

658
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,890
he hired me personally.

659
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,790
Well, or rather, I have been deceived.

660
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:16,250
Wait a minute, why did you lie?

661
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,820
If I told you,  you would have stopped me, right?

662
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,850
Of course!!

663
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:27,740
Come to think of it, I am a mere housewife without any qualifications or experience.

664
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,700
Who would pay me 2,000 yen (20 USD) per hour?

665
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,690
When I found out that I was being deceived,

666
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,250
I was dumbfounded to realize how foolish I was.

667
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:51,170
I thought of going away somewhere afar.

668
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,980
But I couldn't help getting concerned about my kids.

669
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,990
And I realized

670
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,020
I was a worthless,

671
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:11,670
stupid and incapable woman.

672
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,300
Hey.

673
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,490
What are you saying.

674
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,420
No wonder a woman like me got cheated on.

675
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:30,090
It is surprising he didn't cheat on me until now.

676
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,390
I hope my kids are okay.

677
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:45,420
I have seldom stayed away from home.

678
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,120
I'm sure they will notice something is wrong.

679
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,920
Involving my kids in this is the last thing I want to do.

680
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:04,000
I don't want to make them sad.

681
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,000
It's going to be okay.

682
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:23,250
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
Last Cinderella Team @Viki.</i>

683
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,190
Here! Don't forget to take this with you, okay?

684
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:30,280
Your mom is in my house, but she's doing great.

685
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,610
So, rest assured and go to school, Kakeru-kun.

686
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,490
- Yes.
- Okay?

687
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,770
Why don't you put that in your backpack.

688
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,440
Thank you for delivering his clothes.

689
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,790
No, not at all.

690
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,000
I'll be leaving then.

691
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,020
Em... did Miki say something to you?

692
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,830
Ah, she isn't in a condition to speak rationally.

693
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,520
I see.

694
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,950
Until she calms down, I will take care of her.

695
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,310
I know it's hard on you, but take care of everything.

696
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,110
Thank you.

697
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,210
It's fine. Then, excuse me.

698
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,640
Yes.

699
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,780
<i>For now, I will let her stay at my place.</i>

700
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,230
I see. I am glad that she is alright.

701
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,950
Thank you very much, indeed.

702
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,220
Don't mention it.  I didn't do anything special.

703
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,240
What are you saying. By the way, about the other day...

704
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,060
Welcome and good afternoon.

705
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,350
Oh, Choko-chan. Welcome.

706
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,510
- Hair coloring today, right?
- Yes.

707
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,140
