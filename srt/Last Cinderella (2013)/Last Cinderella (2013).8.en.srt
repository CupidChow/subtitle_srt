1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,780
<i>I'm sorry. The truth is, we still haven't done anything yet.</i>

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,570
<i>Eh?</i>

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,690
<i>You love her, don't you?</i>

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,010
<i>So what if I do? Would you step aside?</i>

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,680
<i>As I said, I don't-</i>

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,700
<i>Anyway, please take care of Chiyoko.</i>

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,650
<i>Can't you give me a chance? I want you to  know me better.</i>

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,460
<i>Ah!</i>

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,010
<i>Shima-san!</i>

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:36,010
<i>Miki! Just what have you been doing?</i>

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,220
<i>Welcome!</i>

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,870
<i>Tachibana-kun, it has been a while.</i>

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,920
I'm getting a divorce. We're in mediation right now.

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,760
I'm staying at my parent's house right now

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,840
But my brother's family is also there, so I don't feel comfortable.

16
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm bothering you, aren't I. I'm sorry.

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,960
Wait.

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,490
At least for today, you-

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,370
<i>Stop pushing me!</i>

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,840
I keep telling Tomonari-kun to fix that tension rod but...

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,640
Stop telling such an obvious lie.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,540
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,620
It is such a bad taste to eavesdrop other people's conversation.

24
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,690
I already apologized!

25
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,280
And you think that's enough?

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,450
To begin with, your apology wasn't even sincere.

27
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,970
Then,  how am I supposed to apologize?

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,090
Like this? "I'm sorry."

29
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,130
"I apologize deeply." "My bad, my bad."

30
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,190
I'm sooorry. Yes! I'm sor-

31
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,530
Sakura-san!

32
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,170
It's #509 in the apartment building across from the Akagi Shrine.  You will know it once you get there.

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,390
I'll be back home by 8:30.

34
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,410
Sorry for interrupting your work.

35
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,120
It's okay.

36
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,940
She has an air of refinement.

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,150
Quite the opposite to a certain someone.

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,510
She has to be your ex, right? You are rekindling an old blaze?

39
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,350
It's not 'blaze.'  It's 'flame.'  You idiot!

40
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,600
Why are you snapping at me?

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,790
Okay, stop wasting time on nonsense and work.

42
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,790
Everyone get back to work!

43
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,040
Yes, understood!

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Huh!  It's scary to see a man lose his temper.  Isn't it, Haru-chan?

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,520
But, I've never seen Tachibana-san agitated like that before.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,360
You are right...

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,740
Sorry, Chiyoko-chan. Thank you for waiting.

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,350
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Last Cinderella Team @Viki.</i>

49
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,860
<i>Welcome, good afternoon!</i>

50
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,890
<i>Welcome!</i>

51
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:07,590
Do you still have lingering feelings for your
old love and those days?

52
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,850
Today, Tachibana's ex-girlfriend came to the salon.

53
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,310
Kasumi-chan? Why now?

54
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,640
I heard she's getting divorced.

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,820
Ah! I see...

56
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,780
Did they date a long time ago?

57
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,560
Kasumi-chan is Rintaro's senpai (older person) from middle school.

58
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,680
What? From that long ago?

59
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,330
No, they only started dating after they graduated
from high school.

60
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,490
They dated for around 10 years... no, even longer than that.

61
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:34,830
Anyway, they dated for a long time and even lived together. We thought for sure they were going to get married.

62
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,500
But, they suddenly broke up out of the blue.

63
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,790
Why?

64
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,120
Who knows? But Kasumi-chan married another guy shortly after.

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,170
Rintaro hasn't mentioned her since then.

66
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,510
Well, I don't care about his love life anyway.

67
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,680
Ken-chan, can I get another beer?

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,900
Okay.

69
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,430
Maybe men and women shouldn't date for too long.

70
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,600
Why's that?

71
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,550
If a couple gets married after knowing everything about each other, there would be nothing fresh in their married life.

72
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,260
We got married because I got pregnant.

73
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,260
Now that I think about it, he never proposed,
and we never had a ceremony.

74
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,350
So, I guess we ended up being together since
we had no other choice.

75
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,930
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,630
Even though you didn't have a ceremony, you went on that honeymoon in Hawaii. You even showed me that  lovey dovey picture-

77
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,750
Be quiet!  I want to forget about it!

78
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,350
<i>- Oh, Shima-chan.</i>
- Good evening.

79
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,160
Shima-nee!

80
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,990
I'm going home now.  I think I drank too much.

81
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,620
Sorry Sakura, please pay for me!

82
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,170
Hey, hey, wait a sec.  I don't need the change!

83
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,770
- Actually there isn't enough.
-  Shima-nee,

84
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,470
give us some more time.  Sorry.

85
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,190
<i>Miki!</i>

86
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,360
Welcome home.

87
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,510
I'm back, sorry for being late.

88
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,790
It's okay. Are you hungry? I made dinner.

89
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,460
Ah, you didn't need to do that.

90
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,890
Well, I had free time anyway.

91
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,350
Oh, I used your kitchen without asking you.

92
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,890
I don't mind.

93
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,490
You still have your drinking habit.

94
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,860
Can I have some as well?

95
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,180
Yes.

96
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,320
So, why are you getting a divorce?

97
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,060
Um...

98
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,070
Our marriage has been failing for many years already.

99
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:35,480
When I thought my life might end up like this, I started to panic.

100
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,230
If I were to start over, now is my only chance.

101
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,920
And so I requested a divorce,

102
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,340
but he started to say that I must have been cheating and-

103
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,650
Did he use violence?

104
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,610
I'm fine now... since I left the house.

105
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,560
That time, if only I chose to stay with you to begin with,

106
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,770
I guess none of this would've happened.

107
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,640
I was never able to forget you.

108
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,840
What are you saying now?  You're the one who left me.

109
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,900
I didn't want to marry you back then.

110
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,100
It's quite refreshing when you say it so bluntly.

111
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,320
I didn't want our relationship to end.

112
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,760
I wanted to stay in love with you forever.

113
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,120
Thanks for letting me take a bath.

114
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,230
S-Sakura, what are you doing?!

115
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,920
It's dangerous, get back down!

116
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,190
Hey!

117
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,440
<i>What do you mean you're not interested at all?  You're so curious.</i>

118
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,320
- Sshh....!
<i>- What, can you hear it??</i>

119
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,600
They were talking, but now it's quiet.

120
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,500
Eh?  They're quiet now?

121
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,540
I wonder if they are doing something?

122
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,640
Here you go.

123
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,570
Wow.  When did you make this?

124
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,890
You sure are a mom who makes breakfast every morning.

125
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,100
Thank you for the meal.

126
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,850
This is all I've been doing.

127
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,730
Eh?

128
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,780
I've been married for 13 years.  I haven't done anything else.

129
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,860
So I became a middle-aged woman like this
with no redeeming traits.

130
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,670
What are you saying?  Your family is so happy that they can eat tasty breakfast like this every morning.

131
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,060
I was making breakfast for a guy who was cheating on me with my friend.

132
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,570
I'm such a fool, right?

133
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,550
B, B, But...

134
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,410
I'm so upset.

135
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,910
But, we don't know for sure if he had an affair.

136
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,110
The food will get cold. Here.

137
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,770
Let's eat.  Ok?

138
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,180
Put your hands together... Thank you for the mambo! (meal)

139
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,070
Mambo.

140
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,370
♪ Thank you for the mambo, the mambo.  Fu!

141
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,460

00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,720

145
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,250
By the way, do you know where is the grater?

I want some bread.

152
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,120
Don't be such a nuisance.  Mom's not here, so there's nothing we can do.  Just eat.

153
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
I'm leaving.

154
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,990
What about your breakfast?

155
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,040
I have morning practice.

156
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,940
Oh really?

157
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,660
Welcome.

158
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,350
Sakura-san, what's wrong? You are restless.

159
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,370
It's nothing.

160
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,510
This is it.

Hi.

164
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,180
It's a nice salon.

165
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,690
Do you want to take your jacket off?

166
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,230
Thank you.

This way.

170

I heard about the age difference, but they look great together.

171
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,560
What a handsome guy...

172
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,010
I'm so jealous.

173
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,020
I'm getting nervous.

174
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,460
Eh?  Why?

175
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,050
This is my first time to give a haircut to a person I like.

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,540
I'm getting nervous...

177
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,250
Sakura-san.

178
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,660
Eh?  Oh!  Sorry.

179
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,510
Excuse me.

180
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,470
Pardon us.

181
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,290
Please wait.

182
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,750
You are staring at me.

183
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,270
You look so cool when you're being so serious.  I've fallen for you all over again.

184
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,740
I'll cut your ear.

185
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,140
That tickles.

186
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,540
Excuse me.  How about here?  And here?

187
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,060
Sakura-san.

188
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,250
Would you please stop flirting around in the salon?

189
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,760
Yes.

190
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,330
Excuse me.  Manager, would you please check the color?

191
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,790
Manager?

192
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,680
Tachibana.

193
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,440
Eh?

194
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,300
Would you please check the color?

195
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,250
Ah.  I'm sorry.  I'll be right back.

196
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,880
Did something happen to the manager?

197
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,120
Hmm? I'm sure he had too much to drink, as usual.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,680
Shima-san.

199
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,520
I'm sorry.  This happened because I called you up.

200
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,430
No, it's not your fault.  I was the one who wanted to see you even after finding out that you were Miki's friend.

201
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,080
No, it's not.

202
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,380
I was the one who asked you out first.

203
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,440
These are the consequences for hitting
on anyone and everyone.

204
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,120
I wish I was the one to get hurt.

205
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,460
Too bad it's Miki.

206
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,510
It makes it so difficult.

207
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,650
You could have told everyone about my ED.  (Erectile dysfunction)

208
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,680
I promised you I wouldn't tell anyone, didn't I?

209
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,380
Besides, even if I told Miki now, she'll get
more confused and worry.

210
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,370
You're right.

211
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,670
Ah... What am I doing at this age?

212
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,960
At what age will I become a decent adult?

213
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,780
At this rate... we probably can't until we die.

214
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,680
You're right...

215
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:18,730
<i>Just because you age, it doesn't mean you will become an adult.</i>

216
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,260
- It's the day after tomorrow, right?
- Yup.

217
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,180
Where should we meet?

218
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,210
At 5:00 in front of the hotel.

219
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,730
I got it.

220
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,730
I'm looking forward to it.

221
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,200
Um.

222
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,300
Me too.

223
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,960
Ok... have a good day at work.

224
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,460
Yes.

225
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:05,270
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Last Cinderella Team @Viki.</i>

226
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,920
<i>Last Cinderella
~ Episode 8 ~</i>

227
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,140
Why are you sighing like that?  What's wrong?

228
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,120
She stayed over last night, didn't she?

229
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,140
Maybe  it's just lack of sleep.

230
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,290
It's not like that.

231
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,540
Then what is it?

232
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,730
If you have problems, I'll listen.

233
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,430
Just tell me.  What is it?

234
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:15,150
Manager, Choko-can is here, but she doesn't
have an appointment.

235
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,000
- I'll be there.
- Yes.

236
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,990
Hey... you're not seeing 2 people at the same time, are you?

237
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:27,380
<i>If you want to protect Sakura-san, please take care of Chiyoko.</i>

238
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,750
Don't do that.  That is the worst.

239
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,870
Hi.  Do you want to go to lunch with me?

240
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,790
Okay.

241
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,000
Rintaro-san, you seem tired.

242
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,900
Eh?  No I'm not.

243
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,480
Let's go.

244
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:57,400
I got it.  Don't worry about it.  Leave it to me.

245
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,590
I'm home.

246
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,430
Welcome home.

247
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,950
Miki, let's go to a bar... a bar.

248
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,100
Eh?  I already made dinner.

249
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,680
Eh?

250
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,110
See?

251
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,410
<i>Nikujaga</i> (meat and potato)?  It's my favorite.

252
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,970
And, grilled fish... and vegetable with sesame?

253
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,130
This is a perfect Japanese dinner.

254
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,560
Hurry up and wash your hands and gargle.

255
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,180
Yes!

256
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,050
No, that's not it.  Let's just go to SOBAR for one beer.

257
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,250
I got some beer here.  They're in the fridge.

258
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,090
Let's just go for one drink.

259
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,650
Sakura, it's none of my business but

260
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,670
just because you're single, if you waste your money, you'll regret it later.

261
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,460
If you have kids, you'll need so much money.

262
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,070
You should save as much as you can while you are able to, right?

263
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,600
Yes.

264
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,050
This is no good.

265
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,830
What should I do?

266
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,190
<i>Sorry.  I couldn't take her out. Today, let's cancel.  So sorry!</i>

267
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,430
Ken-chan, can you give me a check?

268
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,440
You're leaving so soon?  You just got here.

269
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,740
Sorry.  Here.

270
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,080
I got it.  Thank you.

271
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,200
<i>Saki-chan.</i>

272
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,610
What are you doing for meals?

273
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,940
Grandma makes them, or Dad brings home something.

274
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,580
I see.

275
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,830
Mom, when are you coming home?

276
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,220
When... I'm not sure yet.

277
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,870
Are you getting... a divorce?

278
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,820
What are you saying?  We are not.

279
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,640
I think we are not.

280
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,090
What is a divorce?

281
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,130
You don't have to know.

282
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,690
You're mean.

283
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,730
I had a fight with Dad.

284
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,350
We want to make up, but it looks like it will take some time.

285
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,140
I know it's tough for Saki-chan and Kakeru, but would you wait a little longer?

286
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,220
I don't want to.  I feel lonely when you are not home.

287
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,390
Hey, there's no school tomorrow, right?

288
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,170
Yeah.

289
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,980
Should we all spend the night at Sakura's place?

290
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,090
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

291
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,820
Then Saki-chan, can you call Dad?

292
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,980
And Grandma, too.

293
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,530
<i>I got it.</i>

294
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,000
<i>Since it's an interview, this shirt will do.</i>

295
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,520
Looks good.  Can you pick out another one?  Something a little bit brighter than this one.

296
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,700
Why?  Where are you wearing it to?

297
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,260
Some place.

298
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,270
<i>How about this one?</i>

299
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,590
Looks good.  Thanks.

300
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,570
Excuse me.  I'll take this one, too.

301
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,940
How's it going with him?

302
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,500
That woman showed up.

303
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,920
That woman?

304
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,960
The woman Rintaro-san was seeing before.

305
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,380
He's been acting strange since then.

306
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,310
I see.

307
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:00,480
What's with her to show up all of a sudden?  He might be   falling for me soon.

308
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,690
I'll never forgive her if she gets in the way.

309
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,290
Thank you for waiting.  This is the bill.

310
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:16,240
Don't worry about it.  Please use this.

311
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,740
Thank you.  One moment please.

312
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,150
I was going to give it to you as a present for getting a job.

313
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,880
Give me a gift after I actually get the job.

314
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,790
It's Dad's company.  Of course you won't get rejected.

315
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,530
You'll never know.

316
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,920
Whatever.  I have plans, so I'm going.

317
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,870
Good luck with the interview.

318
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,270
- Yeah.  Thanks for coming here with me.
- Okay.  See you.

319
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,570
Chiyoko.

320
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,220
Um?

321
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,130
Don't overdo it.

322
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,970
- Like this?
- I said that's wrong!

323
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,050
Don't you realize that I've been telling you this repeatedly?

324
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,780
Why can't you do something so simple as that?!

325
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,800
- I'm sorry.
- Huh!

326
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,700
- It's your teaching skills that suck!
- Huh?!!

327
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,090
No one would struggle if they could do exactly as they're told.

328
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,970
To begin with, you're a genius, so you don't understand people who struggle and can't do it.

329
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,100
No wonder I could never understand a commoner like you.

330
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,560
You are pickin' a fight with me?

331
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,720
You're the one who started it.

332
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,530
I don't know what's up with you but quit being so grumpy from day to night.

333
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,240
- Stop taking it out on everyone!
- I'm not in a bad mood.

334
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,180
You are! You don't realize it?

335
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,330
- I said I'm NOT!
- YOU are!

336
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,790
- Excuse me...
- Huh?
- Huh?

337
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,750
Go, go.

338
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,580
<i>Sooo cute!</i>

339
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,490
We're not going to hesitate. Thank you for the meal.

340
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,980
Thank you for the meal.

341
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,430
<i>So nice.</i>

342
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,230
<i>I'll pour some tea.</i>

343
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,330
You're so sweet. Thank you for everything.

344
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,450
Sorry to trouble you!

345
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,250
<i>I hear she's a teacher of a cooking class.</i>

346
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,170
<i>So what?</i>

347
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,420
Oh nothing.

348
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,270
I don't really like

349
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,600
that type of meddling woman.

350
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,090
I wonder if Tachibana-san likes that type of woman.

351
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,050
Hey, stop gossiping and let's finish off our work.

352
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,360
Yes!

353
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,720
<i>Here you go.</i>

354
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,950
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

355
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,040
Well then, I am going now.

356
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,640
- Please be careful.
- Please be careful!

357
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,400
She's so nice.

358
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,660
So elegant and feminine.  So ideal.

359
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,750
So jealous!

360
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,710
Let's clean up and go home.

361
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,350
Yes!

362
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,010
So sweet.

363
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:52,020
- Be careful...
- Hot! Hot! Hot!

364
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,330
Hello, mom?

365
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,400
I'm going to stay at my friend's house again.

366
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,470
Yes, I'm fine.

367
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,510
Don't worry.

368
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,920
I got it.

369
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,490
Choko-chan.

370
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,440
Thanks for waiting.  What do you want to eat?

371
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,700
Hi.  Good bye.

372
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,520
Let's go.

373
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,380
Hello?

374
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,720
Why did you get in the way?

375
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,540
Umm... about that...

376
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,490
I wasn't going to push her down the stairs.

377
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,650
Oh, really?

378
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,300
I just wanted to talk to her.

379
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,960
You're right... I just thought...

380
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,350
She ripped out Rintaro-san's heart in the past.

381
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,050
But she showed up again as if nothing happened.

382
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:14,430
So, I wanted to tell her to get away from him.

383
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,410
I understand how you feel.

384
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,970
But, how would Tachibana feel if he found this out?

385
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,310
Would he be happy?

386
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,830
If you really love him,

387
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,010
you should just tell him up front.

388
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,400
If you try any other way, I don't think it'll work.

389
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,250
Sakura-san, you've never gotten hurt, have you?

390
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:48,670
I couldn't have survived if I lived an innocent life like you.

391
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:54,150
All I could do was to protect myself from things that harmed me.

392
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,930
I think we will never understand each other
since you have lived comfortably.

393
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,800
Good bye.

394
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,640
Thank you.

395
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,040
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

396
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,510
Who was that?

397
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,570
She's one of our customers.

398
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,920
- She may or may not be seeing Tachibana.
- I see.

399
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,600
Here you go.

400
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,980
It's on me.

401
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:27,140
I'm so happy.... to see you two sitting together.

402
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,240
Hey, Ken-chan...What's wrong?  Why are you crying?

403
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,320
Thank you.

404
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,900
- How are you?  Have you been doing okay?
- Yeah.

405
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,660
How is Miki?

406
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,960
- She's getting better.
- That's good.

407
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,910
- Oh yeah!  Sorry about the other night.  I couldn't take her out.
- It's alright.

408
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,250
It's more important for Miki and her husband to make up.  I'm not the priority right now.

409
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,660
What are you saying.

410
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,860
I like it better when it's three of us.

411
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,840
It has to be three of us.

412
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,540
You won't ask why I was seeing Miki's husband?

413
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,980
No, I won't.  Please talk to Miki about that kind of things.

414
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,780
It's not something I should meddle with.

415
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,700
I got it.

416
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,500
Oh.

417
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,880
Here.  You're going to have a date tomorrow, right?  Use this, if you like.

418
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,100
Really?  I'm so happy.  Can I open it?

419
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,340
Go ahead.

420
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,960
What is it?  Something I can use on a date...

421
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,160
I'm so happy... Thank you.

422
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,340
Wow... So cute.

423
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,570
This is so erotic.

424
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,270
- Have a lovely evening.
- Thank you...

425
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,560
Look at this.

426
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,810
- What is it?
- It's lace...

427
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,810
So cute!

428
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,510
Marriage.

429
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,260
Marriage?  It says kids.

430
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,430
Let me have it.

431
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,080
<i>Here.</i>

432
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,890
How is it?

433
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,590
Wow, you look great.

434
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,090
- You look younger.
- Really?

435
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,610
Oh, I see.  He is the reason why you look younger.

436
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,630
No.

437
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,610
Hiroto-kun.  I almost didn't recognize you.

438
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,510
You look so good in a suit.

439
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,040
Sakura-san, you are so pretty.

440
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,420
I was wondering which princess you were.

441
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,450
Sure... Where is your umbrella.

442
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,250
I don't have one.

443
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,350
Here.

444
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,350
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

445
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,630
Let's go.

446
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,470
Oh?

447
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,410
This is...

448
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:06,070
where we met for the first time...?

449
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,970
Welcome... my Cinderella.

450
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,510
What do you think?

451
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,990
I'm so happy.

452
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,710
Let's go.

453
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,030
Come in.

454
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,170
It brings back memories.

455
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,930
Wow.  Amazing!

456
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,840
Hiroto-kun!  Wow.

457
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,580
I wanted to make it perfect today, so I tried hard.

458
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,160
But I'll try harder for your birthday.

459
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,700
You don't have to try hard.

460
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,860
I just want to be with you.

461
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,230
No... that will be the first time we're spending
your birthday together.

462
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,690
I want to make it a memorable one.

463
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,750
I got it.

464
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,360
Cheers.

465
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,040
It tastes so good.

466
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,700
Don't chug champagne.

467
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,690
But it tasted so good.  Can I have another one?

468
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,230
You better not get drunk.

469
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,590
I'm fine.  Today, we are spending the night, right?

470
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,230
Cheese...

471
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:39,550
Hey! Again.

472
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,810
Cheese...

473
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,400
One more time. Hey!

474
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,020
On your next day off, why don't we go somewhere?

475
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,760
Where?

476
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,740
Like an amusement park or a movie theater.

477
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,000
I want to do something that is like a date.

478
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,580
I haven't done anything like that in a while.

479
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,230
Do you want another one?  Let me get it.

480
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,490
<i>It's okay. I'll do it my self.</i>

481
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,010
I think I should go home tonight.

482
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:18,150
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Last Cinderella Team @Viki.</i>

483
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,140
<i>Miki! I'm really sorry.</i>

484
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,770
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

485
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,780
<i>Can you at least accept these flowers?</i>

486
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,410
<i>It's not that these can solve anything but... Sakura-san, if you are there, can you please open the door?</i>

487
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>Miki, please.  Just for a moment...</i>

488
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:48,530
Sakura-san, it's empty.  I want another one.

489
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,360
- Another one...
- Ok, ok...

490
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,870
This wine tastes good.  What is it called?

491
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,410
I wonder...

492
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,650
I'm starting to sweat a little.

493
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,700
It's hot in here, right?

494
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,900
Wow, this cheese tastes good.

495
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,850
You should eat it, too.

496
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm ok for now.

497
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,090
See, it's good.

498
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,530
Oh I dropped it.

499
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:22,610
I dropped the cheese... what should I do?

500
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,960
It's really good.

501
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,980
- Hey...
- Another one!

502
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,270
Another one.

503
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,610
Aren't you drinking too much?

504
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,690
It's fine... we're spending the night.

505
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,390
Oh well.

506
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:47,220
Then... let's drink tonight.

507
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:52,500
Here you go.

508
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,770
A long time ago...

509
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,860
I hurt a girl.

510
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,760
My parents got divorced when I was in grade school.

511
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:20,020
And I went with my mom, but she died of illness.

512
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,360
Then, my dad took me in.

513
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,020
My dad had already re-married by then.

514
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,530
And his wife also had a child.

515
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,000
A girl that was a year younger than me.

516
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,520
Then one day, when my parents were out, my younger sister said, "I'm hungry."

517
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,950
She said she really wanted to eat donuts,
so I tried to make some.

518
00:34:54,030 --> 00:35:00,130
But I dropped the pan, and she got a huge burn.

519
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,590
She got oil on her back and was crying...

520
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,150
but I was just helpless, not knowing what to do.

521
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,460
All I could do was just to wait for my parents to come home.

522
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,660
Because of that, she now has a horrible scar.

523
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,050
She says she can't show her body to anyone,

524
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,860
and her heart is closed off.

525
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:45,760
But, it was an accident.  You didn't mean to do it.

526
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,070
I didn't mean to do it.

527
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,440
But, I was jealous of her.

528
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,110
It's because I came later, but

529
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,070
both of my parents loved her so much.

530
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,290
And she got along with my dad, too.

531
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,930
I hated her.

532
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,850
I wished something bad would happen to her.

533
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:41,820
That's why... it's my fault.

534
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,720
It was just like I hurt her.

535
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:57,690
The scar will never go way.

536
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:08,330
So, my relationship with my sister will not change.

537
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:13,750
It'll stay distorted... forever.

538
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,450
Good morning.

539
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:23,240
- Ah... no way.  Did I fall asleep?
- Yes.

540
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,940
Ah... no... why didn't you wake me up?

541
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,210
You were sleeping so soundly.

542
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,810
Oh no... Why did we...

543
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,190
Ok, then, let's do it now.

544
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,650
I can't.

545
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,990
I have to go to work now.

546
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,930
No way.

547
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,580
Sorry.

548
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,270
Oh crap...

549
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,510
If we want to, we can do it whenever we want.

550
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,760
I know... but...

551
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,550
I reserved this room to make it a memorable night.

552
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,890
- Hey Hiroto-kun.
- Yeah?

553
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,100
I had fun yesterday.  Thank you.

554
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,530
You told me about things I didn't know before...

555
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,640
and that made me happy.

556
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,220
Thank you.  I love you.

557
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,210
I had fun too.  I love you, too.

558
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,780
I want to do it!

559
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,110
Hey...

560
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,530
Hiroto-kun... no, you can't.

561
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,100
Can you zip me up?

562
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,270
Zipper?  In the back?

563
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,130
Yeah.  Close it up.

564
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,730
I don't want to.

565
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,040
I can see the happiness in your face.

566
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:45,110
No... it's not like that.

567
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,070
- Thank you.
- I'll get going.

568
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,890
<i>♫ “You can be true to yourself” ♫</i>

569
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:12,800
<i>♫ You say with a smile ♫</i>

570
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,380
<i>♫ A midnight love story, I am about to cry ♫</i>

571
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,990
<i>♫ but I hold back the tears ♫</i>

572
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:32,390
♫ I get it ♫
♫ You say ‘it’s okay’ out of habit ♫

573
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:39,090
♫ Will it be a love story from now on? ♫
♫ Or will it be a ‘I’m sorry’? ♫

574
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:44,640
<i>♫ It seems sweet but it's spicy ♫</i>

575
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,800
<i>♫ The dramatic kind of love ♫</i>

576
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,130
<i>From: Momo

577
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,590
<i>♫ with your tulled-dress appearance ♫</i>

578
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,690
Momo!

579
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,160
No way.  You believed it?

580
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,790
You would have ignored it before. Why are you acting
like a nice person?

581
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,860
What are you wearing?  Are you looking for a job?

582
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,300
Is it for that person?

583
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,540
I can't believe it.

584
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,770
Momo...

585
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,950
you took good care of me.

586
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,340
If it weren't for you,

587
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,940
my life would have been a total mess by now.
I really am grateful to you.

588
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,280
But I want to end it now.

589
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:10,010
Please... break up with me.

590
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,380
What's so great about that middle-aged woman?

591
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,900
She has such a beautiful heart.

592
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:32,050
When I'm with her, it makes me feel like I'm also a good person.

593
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,990
What nonsense are you saying?

594
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:39,960
Not only the age, but she is so different from us in every way.

595
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,700
Why don't you get it?

596
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,420
Hiro, you know it, right?

597
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,940
No matter how you see it, it won't work.

598
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,970
Hey...

599
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,450
Maybe not.

600
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,950
But I want to go as far as I can go.

601
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,030
I've never had strong feelings like this

602
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,550
toward someone in my whole life.

603
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,220
Get out.

604
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,510
I am disgusted to see a guy that's into a middle-aged woman.  Good-bye.

605
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,700
And... when we went camping in Oku-Tama,

606
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,260
the tent blew away. Remember that?

607
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,570
I remember that.

608
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:13,410
In the middle of the night, it got really stormy.

609
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,220
<i>That's right.  It was so much fun.</i>

610
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,640
<i>I wish we could all spend time together like that.</i>

611
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,050
I wonder why good times always come to an end.

612
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,120
<i>Rintaro-san...</i>

613
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,600
Welcome.

614
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,200
I'm glad you're here.

615
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,460
I was at my friend's engagement party, but

616
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,170
when I saw her happy face, I didn't feel like going home alone.

617
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,840
I'm glad I stopped by.

618
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,840
May I have a mimosa?

619
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,650
Ok...

620
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,650
Let me introduce her.  She is Kayano Kasumi-san.

621
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,060
I know.  You got married, right?

622
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,070
Eh?

623
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,180
Do you know each other?

624
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,380
I'm sure Kasumi-san doesn't remember...
but we've met in the past.

625
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,480
You were getting married, and seemed so happy.

626
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,180
Are you still happy?

627
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,930
Choko-chan... let's go for a minute.

628
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,060
Why?

629
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,410
It's ok, Tachibana-kun.

630
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,110
I'm sorry.

631
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,610
I don't remember meeting you,

632
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,280
but I'm actually getting divorced.

633
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,460
Is that why you came back to Rintaro-san?

634
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,630
- Choko-chan.
- Rintaro-san!

635
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,260
Why are you being so nice to her after getting badly hurt by her?

636
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,990
You can't forget about her?

637
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,640
I don't want to see you...

638
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,830
like this.

639
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,680
Go ahead.

640
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,440
After I drink this, I'm going.

641
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,220
Sorry.

642
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,200
<i>You're not using your waist.</i>

643
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,800
Why are you here?

644
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,670
You got here after me, you know.

645
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,380
You've even gotten good.

646
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,010
Because I've been coming here a lot.

647
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:48,210
By the way, did you go stay at a hotel?

648
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,490
Yeah. We did.

649
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,810
Congratulations on that.

650
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:55,350
We didn't do it though.

651
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,060
What? Didn't you go there to do it?

652
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,020
Hiroto got drunk and ended up falling asleep.

653
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,080
What kind of a couple are you to be already sexless in the early stage of dating?

654
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,750
There are lots of different types of couples. What about you?

655
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,760
What about me?

656
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,950
You are about to get back together with her, right?

657
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,310
Does it look like it'll go well?

658
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,230
Not really.

659
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,000
I have thought I was in love with her all this time, but...

660
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,050
It seems it's not that I could not forget her,

661
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,510
but I could not forget the grudge for being dumped.

662
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,720
I'm a pathetic man, aren't I?

663
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,950
You are a narrow-minded man.

664
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,590
You should deny my comment here. Can't you say "No, you're not" or something?

665
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,730
No, I can't.

666
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,350
You are a narrow-minded woman.

667
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,700
Shut up!

668
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,810
- How about you?
- Hm?

669
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,500
- Are you getting married with him?
- Why?

670
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,890
You are so much in love, aren't you?

671
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:51,920
Well, when it comes to our future...

672
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,800
It's difficult, you know.

673
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,630
What?

674
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:04,960
I'm not in a hurry to get married any more, but... I want a child.

675
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,580
Be honest and tell him that.

676
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,640
It's not that easy.

677
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,570
I told you, he has a future.

678
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:16,000
There are so many possibilities for him.

679
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,400
How can I say "I want a child"?

680
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,210
At the same time, I find myself wishing to be with him.

681
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,060
- You are so in love.
- What, are you jealous?

682
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,780
- No.
- Don't be stubborn!

683
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,380
What happened this time made me think,

684
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,430
I can't be with someone who makes me uneasy.

685
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:42,670
I used to think having a feeling of tension somewhat was good,

686
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,510
but is it because I've got older?

687
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:48,200
I don't have the energy to make strenuous effort to go along with my partner.

688
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,100
I understand that very well.

689
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,710
If I ever date someone again,

690
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:02,250
I want to spend the rest of my life with her. So, she has to be someone I can feel easy with.

691
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:10,670
That's true. But, a relationship without tension might not become romantic, don't you think?

692
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:11,750
You're right.

693
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,210
Right?

694
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,950
I wonder if there is a trigger.

695
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,340
Trigger...

696
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:25,210
<i>♫ No one knows who is who at all ♫
♫ Someone calls someone to fall apart ♫</i>

697
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:32,930
<i>♫ Everything I did wrong for our love was ♫
♫ That we had no fears ♫</i>

698
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,950
<i>♫ My world is going around ♫</i>

699
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,530
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

700
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,200
We'd like to...

701
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,470
get change for this bill.

702
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,890
Thank you for coming always.

703
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:45,670
Are you her boyfriend?

704
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:46,780
This?

705
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,370
Oh, no!

706
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,520
- Thank you for taking care of my mother.
- Mother?

707
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,160
Yes, I'm his mother... Why?

708
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,710
So, what happened with Choko-chan?

709
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,150
You are so indecisive! Make it clear for her!

710
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,110
Shut up.

711
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,100
What, when you talk about me,

712
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,490
you are so pompous, but you are no good with your own relationship.

713
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:13,240
Even I don't know what I'm doing sometimes.

714
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,710
So you admit it.

715
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,910
I'm not the same with you.

716
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:19,770
You look better now. There, it's coming.

717
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,240
You hit it well!

718
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:44,850
<i> What is the difference between a friend and a boyfriend? </i>

719
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:50,530
Choko-chan likes you, huh?

720
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,460
I like you, too. But...

721
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:59,360
I will give up. Be happy with Sakura-san.

722
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,890
What?

723
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,020
It was shocking, though.

724
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:10,100
I was wondering what she was like because you called her "old man," then she turned out to be so beautiful.

725
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,620
Beautiful?

726
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,590
She is beautiful.

727
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:15,570
She doesn't put much make-up on,

728
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:20,820
and not even dressed up, yet she looks unbelievably beautiful.

729
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:26,850
I guess the beauty is coming from the inside.

730
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:33,320
To be honest, I had been jealous even before
I knew how she looked.

731
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,210
Because you look like you are having a much better time with Sakura-san

732
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,530
than with me.

733
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,940
I felt it so much when you talked about her,

734
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:49,100
and it was really hard for me.

735
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:55,450
Sakura-san has always been by your side since back then.

736
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:58,270
<i>That's probably why I felt distant</i>

737
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:01,960
<i>even though I was living with you.</i>

738
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,940
It's too late to talk about it now.

739
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:11,290
I hope you will be happy.

740
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,760
Are you going to be okay?

741
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,700
No, I'm not.

742
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:28,070
If I said so, will you do something about it?

743
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:34,010
Don't be nice if you don't have feelings for me.

744
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:38,910
It hurts me more when I know you're just feeling pity for me.

745
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:44,720
You should tell that young girl clearly, too.

746
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,580
Then, I'm going.

747
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,570
Take care.

748
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,040
You, too. Take care.

749
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:14,440
One Magical Chicken Basket, please.

750
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,260
Thank you.

751
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,320
I wonder if the kids are eating alright.

752
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,720
Are you worried?

753
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:30,150
Are you still not willing to talk?

754
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,520
When I was in the track team...

755
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,560
It was before you came because I was a freshman in high school, but

756
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,190
there was some girl who flirted with my boyfriend.

757
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:47,690
Then, Shima-san, who was the captain of the team at the time,

758
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:51,610
called her and talked to her.

759
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:55,320
She was like, "Can you not flirt with my teammate's boyfriend?"

760
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,450
Wow!

761
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,660
Thinking about it made me think,

762
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,750
that they might not be having an affair.

763
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,560
I think so, too.

764
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:14,430
It's about time that you talk to your husband and Shima-nee.

765
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,830
You're right.

766
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,850
Right.

767
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,560
It's here already? So quick.

768
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,100
No, way. It's too fast.

769
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,280
Yes?

770
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,530
Oh, no.

771
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,660
Nothing, it's nothing.

772
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,880
Come in!

773
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,790
The pizza place is right there, so...

774
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,960
Sakura. You called her, didn't you?

775
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,690
I did...

776
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,450
Grandma, I'm hungry.

777
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:50,040
It will be ready soon. Wait for a bit more.

778
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:56,170
Oh. It's no good because this kitchen is so small.

779
00:54:56,170 --> 00:55:00,570
<i>Why didn't Miki-san make the kitchen a little bigger?</i>

780
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,490
I'm home! I got bento boxes.

781
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:03,700
Yay!

782
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,270
You must be hungry. Eat as much as you want.

783
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,440
You are home early today.

784
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,830
Yeah. I left work early.

785
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:13,250
What? I wonder when Miki-san is coming back.

786
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,610
I don't know what you two are fighting about,

787
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:19,510
but how can she be okay with leaving her husband and kids for so many days?

788
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,740
It's not that. My stomach was upset.

789
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:25,330
Anyway, young people today are so selfish.

790
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:29,010
When there is something they don't like, they sulk and leave home right away.

791
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,460
We used to bear all sorts of things.

792
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,960
My husband and kids came first before me.

793
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,970
Stop it!

794
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,960
Why are you badmouthing Mom?

795
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,920
She started working because you took over her place.

796
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,370
This family is ruined because of you!

797
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:53,470
You shouldn't talk to your grandma like that...

798
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:54,970
Ouch...

799
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,270
Dad?

800
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,580
What's wrong?

801
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,990
<i>Kohei! What's wrong?</i>

802
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:08,210
No, no, no.

803
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:11,570
Oh, it's Saki-chan!

804
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:12,760
Hello?

805
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,990
<i>Come back home, Mom! Something happened to Dad!</i>

806
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,470
It's here!

807
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:24,150
Listen, Miki's husband was taken to the hospital
by an ambulance.

808
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,060
- What?
- What?

809
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,520
Put this inside.

810
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,980
- Oh, okay.
- Let's go.

811
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,370
You can eat it.
