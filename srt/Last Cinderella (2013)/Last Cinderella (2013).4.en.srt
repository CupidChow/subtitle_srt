00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,800
<i>On our next date can we go somewhere I want to go to?</i>

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,990
<i>Where do you want to go?</i>

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,860
<i>Sakura-san's house!</i>

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,090
<i>It is useless when it comes to using a lot of energy
for being in love.</i>

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,950
<i>How long has it been since you've been unable to get it up?</i>

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,310
<i>Why do I really have to look after mother-in-law?</i>

7
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,510
<i>Why don't you try making a move?</i>

8
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,450
<i>You know best the reason why I can't!</i>

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,440
<i>- Do you have a person you like?
- Yes.</i>

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,640
<i>But she went somewhere I cannot reach.</i>

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,950
<i>Rintarou-san!</i>

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,880
<i>I saw you kissing Momo-chan at the practice ground.</i>

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,460
<i>Sorry! I don't know if we liked each other.</i>

14
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,160
<i>One could say it's complicated between us.
I'll talk to her tomorrow about it.</i>

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,990
<i>Please give me some time.</i>

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,000
<i>Sure!</i>

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,020

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,820
Hey!

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,010
What? What are you hiding?

23
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,900
Did you buy condoms or something?

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,120
I didn't.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,910
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

26
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,620
It's an essential part of a healthy sex life.
Rather, you should be unashamed about it.

27
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,090
You're wrong! Prying into each and every thing.

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,600
Why do you appear in front of me so many times every day?

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,420
Why are you so irritated? I get it!

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,230
You bought <i>that</i>?

31
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,630
Well, women get irritated just before they menstruate, right?

32
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:46,270
So irritating. You're an idiot! You really are a super-idiot!
(<i>baka-tare</i>)

33
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,380
"Super-idiot"? When's that from? Showa-era? (1926-1989)

34
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,120
Shut up! Don't follow me!

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,260
I live next to you!

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,970
Haven't you heard about "ladies first"?

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,970
Isn't it common sense to give priority to superior people?

38
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,850
And where is there a lady around here? Where?

39
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,640
Shut up. Be a man and show some restraint.

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,750
Be a woman and be more modest.

41
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,010
Where's my key?

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,790
Eh!

43
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,420
Why weren't you using birth control?

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,400
I was drunk...

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,680
I don't even remember having sex. How could
I have remembered to use contraception?

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,690
You're this age and an adult.  There is a limit
to  how pitiful you can be.

47
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,320
Don't say that.  I'm already depressed as it is.

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,550
Thanks.

49
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,910
- So?
- Huh?

50
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,830
What will you do if you are pregnant?

51
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,900
"What will I do?" Even if you say that...

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,790
It'd be wrong to not think about it, right?

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,760
Should I give birth to it?

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,990
Don't ask me.

55
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,790
Hey, if I give birth, what about work?
I can continue until my 8th month.

56
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,870
After that I can go on maternity leave, right?

57
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,470
Before that, shouldn't you first get married?

58
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,380
But he's only 24.

59
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,690
You can't tell this to a young man with his
future still ahead of him!

60
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,930
You know. When a man and a woman have sex,

61
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,360
there is a chance of pregnancy even with contraception.

62
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,940
A person who is not ready for such responsibility has no right to have sex.

63
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,460
Were you thinking that when you had sex as a 24-year-old?

64
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,990
No.

65
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,600
You are not convincing at all.

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,750
- That reaction is from Showa-era, right?
- Shut up.

67
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,950
Well, go and make sure.

68
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,510
- What? Now?
- You said you aren't brave enough to see
the result by yourself, right?

69
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,580
Well, that's true.

70
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,030
Make up your mind.

71
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,210
I'll do it later.

72
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,830
Thanks for the coffee. Bye bye!

73
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,100

Not at all. I just came. What should we eat?

79
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,090
- What's this?
- That's a pamphlet for an employee trip.

Earlier Tachibana won it at the contest, right?

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,650
The price was a trip to the hotsprings.

82
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,560
So Tachibana-san is going as well?

83
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,490
Yes, he will go. Why?

84
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,670
I said there's nothing (going on with him), by 1000%.

85
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,030
Sakura-san might not, but Tachibana-san might.

86
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,840
You know. You have no idea how he treats me normally, right?

87
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,730
He does not treat me like a woman at all. So no worries.

- Have fun.
- I will bring a souvenir.

- I will have a seiro soba.
- Me too.

95
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,420
Yeah, I like them.

96
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,050
Really?

97
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,690
So you like them...

98
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,270
Why?

99
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,280
Nothing really.

100
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,350

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,510

102
00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:01,580
- pre-...
- pre?

103
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,380
preg....

104
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,250
If I bought some pre-made pickled garlic, would you eat it?

105
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,830
I would.

106
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,030
But what does that have to do with liking kids?

107
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,740
That's right? They have nothing in common.

108
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,750
What?

109
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,700
Or maybe...

110
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,710
"Let's eat garlic and keep at it at night?"

111
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,000
Sakura-san, you're perverted.

112
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,280

113
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,540
Hot? Turn on the air conditioner.

- What's with that face?
- What about my face?

119
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,350
A really bad face, do you have a fever or something?

120
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,480
It's hot!

121
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,040
It's pretty high. You probably have a 38 degree (100.4F)
fever don't you?

122
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,480
39.2 (102.5F).

123
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,090
Are you stupid? What are you going to do going to a hot
spring like that?

124
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,550
Since I'm stupid, I might feel better on the way there.

125
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,660
There is no way you will recover.

126
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,330
- But I want to go!
- Don't say reckless things!

127
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,950
You might be pregnant, right?

128
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,280
If you do something reckless that you can't take back, what are you going to do?

129
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,560
Ah, phone call, phone call.

130
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,010

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,370

132
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,730
Ah.

133
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,070
Alright, I got it

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,700
Who was it? Tachibana-san?

135
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,880
Sakura-san has a fever, so he'll comes after he takes
her to the hospital.

136
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,200
Okay, let's head out.

137
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,610

138
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,300

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,960
Oh, shoot!

140
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,970
YOU hurry up!

141
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,840
The fever is high, but it seems like a normal cold. So you'll recover in due time.

142
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,580
- Be good and rest properly today.
- Yes.

143
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,450
You have to eat something, too.

144
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,290
I don't want to. I don't have an appetite right now.

145
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,110
- I will take medicine later.
- I should've bought something at the convenience store.

146
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,650
If I need something, I will call Hiroto-kun. So it's fine.

147
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,690
That's right. Do that!

148
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,680
- What?
- What do you mean "What?"

149
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,460
I don't want to rely on him.

150
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,370
Rely on him since he is your boyfriend.

151
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,180
It's easy for you to say.

152
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,060
That's why your romance doesn't last very long

153
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,060
- What do you mean?
- Relying on someone means showing your weakness.

154
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,420
If you only appeal your strong side then

155
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,660
men will start to think that they're not needed.

156
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,300
A guy who rejected me 10 years ago actually said that.

157
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,790
We humans want to feel we are  needed.

158
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,720
Otherwise, we can't find value in ourselves.

159
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,510
- You too?
- No

160
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,620
Ah right, you weren't human.

161
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,260
If you can joke like that, then you should be fine.

162
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,800
Alright, see ya.

163
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,470
Make sure you take your medicine.  The doctor prescribed safe medicine for pregnant women.

164
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,600

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,330

- What? We went there just the other day.

174
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,470
So what? Let's go.

175
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,850
Shima-sensei! I'd like to talk to you about a lesson program.

176
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation. I need to talk to her about a program. Can we?

177
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,580
Sure.

178
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,650
Then, I will-

179
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,660
- Okay then I'll contact you.
- Some other time? Sure.

180
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, contact her some other time. Sorry. See you.

181
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,700
Adultery? Adultery isn't good.

182
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,090
It's not your business.

183
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,870
It is!

184
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,240
Shima-san, you're my wife's and also my friend.

185
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,630
After we're done  here, let's drink coffee and go home.

186
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,220
I prefer a hotel.

187
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,320
Roger that.

188
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,800
I'm sorry.

Okay, thank you very much. It was "Watarase Bridge"

I hope Sakura-san is alright.

197
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,690
Tachibana-san.

198
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,830
Next is you, Tachibana-san

199
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,550
Is it okay for me to sing so soon?

200
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,990
I'm a good singer, so no one will want to sing after me.

201
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,470
<i>Well, no one is expecting anything, so just go sing.</i>

210
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,730
- Hey!
- Right there.

211
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,320
Shut up! People may think we are having some kind
of a weird play.

212
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,370
But, i-it hurts.

213
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,530
Do you want me to do it or not?

214
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,520
I want <i>choo</i> to do it.

215
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,830
Ummm.

216
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,440
By the way,

217
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,140
why are you having an affair with a married man?

218
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,910
It's not that I want to have an affair.  It saves me from having a future trouble.

219
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,430
Are you not going to get married anymore?

220
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,470
I won't. I had enough.

221
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,000
You'd be popular though.

222
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,270
If I were suited for marriage, why did I get divorced?

223
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:30,080
But, people get divorced for different reasons.

224
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,640
You know, I think marriage is a miracle.

225
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,340
It is amazing to be able to meet someone who likes you back

226
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,520
and stay with the person the rest of your life.

227
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,460
Same goes for children.

228
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:53,590
People think it's natural to have children after you get married.

229
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,880
But that's not the case.

230
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,700
It's almost like a miracle to get pregnant.

231
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:06,270
What I mean is, your family is

232
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,940
a result of a miracle.

233
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,150
So cherish it.

234
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,860
W-what?

235
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,040
Just now, I said some good things!

236
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,810
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.

237
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,170
Aren't you too late these days?

238
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,700
Ah, I went to the gym.

239
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,350
You should go to bed early.

240
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,650
Is the gym even open at this hour?

241
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,650
I got thirsty and hungry after I worked out.

242
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,100
Saki, go to bed.

243
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,450
There's no point in working out, if you drink and eat afterwards.

244
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,440
Why are you nagging. I just came home.

245
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,010
- Because you go to bed so soon.
- Because I am tired.

246
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,410
Your mother is here, so don't you feel like you should come home sooner?

247
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,480
It's okay just to leave mom alone.

248
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,840
I'm telling you to come home for my sake!

249
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,280
Do you know what she said about me behind my back?

250
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:00,160
- She said I am easily manipulated.
- You are so noisy.

251
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,650
What are you yelling about in late hour?

252
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,060
I'm sorry.

253
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,860
Kohei, welcome home.

254
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,360
You worked hard till late.

255
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,120
- Miki-san.
- Yes.

256
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,920
He just came home. You shouldn't nag him about trivial things.

257
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,590
<i>Home should be a healing place. If you keep nagging,</i>

258
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,770
<i>soon he won't come home.</i>

259
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,760
<i>Mom. It's late already, so why don't you go to bed?</i>

260
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,140
Alright then, goodnight.

261
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,430
Goodnight.

262
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,750
Your sock is inside-out.

263
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,070
I wonder why...

264
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,020
Oh right. My foot was itching at work,
so I thought I had athlete's foot.

265
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,430
- It's the gym right?
- Right, right. Because I took a shower at the gym.

266
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,250
So, I put in on wrong.

267
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,560
I am taking a bath.

268
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,800
Clearly he is acting suspicious.

269
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,770
36.3 degrees. (Celsius)
<i>(approx: 97.34 degrees Fahrenheit)</i>

270
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,990
I don't have a fever at all.

271
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,830
AH!! My hip hurts.

272
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,450
I haven't used my hip lately.

273
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,400
I can move with no problem.

274
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,890
I wanted to go to the hot springs! Geez.

275
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,530
Oh, hot springs bath powder.

276
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,040
Thank you. I will enjoy the hot springs tonight.

277
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,810
Are you fine now?

278
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,140
I am perfectly fine. Perfect as I can be. Full of energy.
<i>(She's saying this in a funny and old way.)</i>

279
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,750
- That sounds so <i>Showa</i> (1926~1989).
- Of course.

280
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,810
- By the way, how was it?
- What do you mean?

281
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,600
Pregnancy test.

282
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,080
If you keep putting it off, it won't be good...

283
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,940
Oh, come inside.

284
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,010
Just come inside, I will treat you something to eat.

285
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,350
You were about to take the test now?

286
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,860
I needed time.

287
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,320
Time?

288
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,310
If I were pregnant, I should be happy. Otherwise, I would feel bad for the baby.

289
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,440
So,

290
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,350
I have waited until I felt that way.

291
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,610
Is that right.

292
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,340
I didn't even take the medicine.

293
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,170
Why?

294
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,840
Because it's not good for the baby right?

295
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,300
I'm going.

296
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,240
Okay.

297
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,350
H-How many minutes have passed?

298
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,620
1 minute has passed already.

299
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,180
Come with me.

300
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,620
Quickly, come with me.

301
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,710
Okay, okay.

302
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,260
- Here, you can take a look first.
- Sure.

303
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,590
Don't look at it, idiot.

304
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,870
Which one is it?

305
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,320
Okay, quickly...

306
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,370
3, 2, 1.

307
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,540
<i> Not pregnant </i>

308
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,200
Only one line means...

309
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,120
Not pregnant?

310
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,800
- That's right..
- Yeah, right.

311
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,710
Shoot! I wasn't pregnant.

312
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,730
Too bad, huh?

313
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,920
Yeah.

314
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,270
What?! If I'm not pregnant, then I should be happy.

315
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,170
But you were so disappointed.

316
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,650
There's no way I was disappointed.  I'm happy.

317
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,150
Stand up, go home now.

318
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,350
You have to pay me back big.

319
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,990
I know. Ten-seiro soba noodles, right?

320
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,860
Buy me a hot sake, too.

321
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,550
Alright. Alright.

322
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:23,630
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Last Cinderella Team @ Viki.</i>

323
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:32,570
<i>I wonder why I sighed... although I felt relieved.</i>

324
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,390
Oh my, why did you come here for a lady's get together?

325
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,440
It's free, right?  I had to come.

326
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,260
If we don't treat ourselves every once in a while, we might forget that we are women.

327
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,080
Even you think so, Shima-san?

328
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,550
Of course. Since I've been living alone too long.

329
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,050
Is that why you have one-night-stands sometimes?

330
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,480
That's right.

331
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,070
That's fine, but you should use contraception, okay?

332
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,340
I've been using it of course. But, even if I don't, I won't get pregnant.

333
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,250
What are you saying, Shima-san?

334
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:07,630
Unplanned pregnancy in our 40's is common, so we have to be careful.  That's what the doctor who delivered Kakeru said.

335
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,900
You see?

336
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,790
Well, I won't have to worry about it since I will be sexless.

337
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,050
<i>I should go to a hospital, too.</i>

338
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,260
It's strange that my menstruation is three weeks late.
And I'm not even pregnant.

339
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,520
Could it be menopause?

340
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,580
Hey, I am still 39.

341
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,910
- You are turning 40 next month.
- Right.

342
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,140
I hear some people go through menopause in their 40s.

343
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,390
Seriously?

344
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,080
I don't mind if my menstruation cycle stops.

345
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,920
Me, too. It's tiresome.

346
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,140
We have suffered every month for so many years.

347
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,720
You are right. You worked hard.

348
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,430
You, too, worked hard.

349
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,970
Hey, it's not that I had menopause.

350
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,760
Their conversation is far out.

351
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,240
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

352
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,980
<i>- Ken-chan, kamo seiro noodles.
- Okay.</i>

353
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,740
Ah right, I bought this.

354
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,590
What is that?

355
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,540
These supplements eliminate body odor of the middle ages.

356
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,640
Deodorizer Lullaby Z.

357
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,800
But, Ken-chan, you have body odor?

358
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,130
I think my pillow started to smell lately.

359
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,400
Also my fart smells really bad.

360
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,720
Me, too.

361
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,450
Come to think of it, your fart earlier stunk, Takenouchi-san.

362
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,960
Did you notice? People call me skunk... No,  I didn't fart.

363
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,880
Nice <i>nori-tsukkomi</i> !
<i>(a person goes along with a joke before slamming it down.)</i>

364
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,090
You are like a comedian.

365
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,990
I hate comedians.

366
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,550
We have to be more careful at our age.

367
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,250
Careful of what?

368
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,710
Menopause. Men experience it although it's not
so bad as women's.

369
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,910
I don't need to worry about that yet.

370
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,100
You may think you still have time, but who knows?

371
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,910
It's hard to notice your own body odor.

372
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,970
Takenouchi-san, how about you?

373
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,150
I'm an old man. Down there doesn't work anymore.

374
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,420
What?

375
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,700
I still think I'm young, but my body is declining here and there.

376
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,970
We can't strain ourselves anymore.

377
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,820
Sounds like an old men's conversation.

378
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,790
Check, please.

379
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,620
Oh, sure.

380
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,360
By the way, what is your occupation, Takenouchi-san?

381
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,220
Me? Financial Planner.

382
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,230
Huh?

383
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,050
Financial Planner. I am an insurance salesperson in brief.

384
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,670
I see.

385
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,330
Oh, can I get advice next time?

386
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,810
- Yes.
- I am single, so I feel insecure.

387
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,010
Of course.

388
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,250
- Here, 50 yen is your change.
- Thank you.

389
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,050
Thank you for the meal.

390
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,620
<i>When are you going to introduce him to us?</i>

391
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,820
Huh?

392
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,340
Your 24-year-old boyfriend.

393
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,090
Ah, I want to meet him, too.

394
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,310
Sorry. He is busy right now.

395
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,320
He's a bike rider, right? He must have a lot free time.

396
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,210
How rude. He's busy since he's a professional rider.

397
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,220
You know, can you just ask him?

398
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,360
What? Okay. Some other time, okay?

399
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,460
No, ask him now.

400
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,370
Now?

401
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,780
Here, hurry, hurry.

402
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,050
- Hurry.
- But I'm sure he's busy, though.

403
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,600
When normally during the practice...

404
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,740
Hiroto-kun?

405
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,950
What's wrong?

406
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,630
Ah, my friends want to meet you.

407
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,780
This is Shima!

408
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,740
Let me, let me. This is Miki. Hello.

409
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,650
<i>- Hello, Hiroto-kun.
- Hello, I'm sorry.</i>

410
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,080
Sounds like you are having fun. Are you drinking?

411
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,460
<i>No, we are always like this even when we are sober.</i>

412
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,190
Sounds like fun. That's fine. I want to meet them, too.
Can you set the date?

413
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,240
Really?

414
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,220
Also...  I settled it with Momo.

415
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,580
<i>Er... okay.</i>

416
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,650
Sure, I'll call you again.

417
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,090
See you. Bye-bye.

418
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,800
H-hey. You look so happy.

419
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,840
Can I hit you?

420
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,930
- I know right?
- Do whatever you like.

421
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,970
Should we hit her?

422
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,190
Get back to work!

423
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,620
Is it over between us?

424
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,690
That's right.

425
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,440
Are you serious about that old lady?

426
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:03,140
That can't be. You've never been serious with anyone.

427
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,940
I'm leaving.

428
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,440
Bye-bye.

429
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,860
Call me anytime if you like.

430
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,040
<i>Yes?</i>

431
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,020
Hello, this is Takenouchi from Hikari Insurance.

432
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,440
Hello.

433
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,060
I'm sorry.

434
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,520
Chuya!

435
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,730
- Please come in.
- Excuse me.

436
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,790
You are good at drawing.

437
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,590
The sky should be blue.

438
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,520
Okay. Here.

439
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,280
That's right. Good job.

440
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,400
Chuya, Takenouchi-san and I need to talk.

441
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,980
He's an adorable boy.

442
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,420
He is mischievous, though.

443
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,080
Boys are supposed to be mischievous.

444
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,000
Based on your files that I received the other day...

445
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,140
<i>A receipt?</i>

446
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:28,490
<i>♪ I love you. Just for now... ♪</i>

447
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,510
<i>♪ I don't want to hear... hear... ♪</i>

448
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,480
It could be crayon or something.

449
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,680
Why would it be crayon? He's not a preschooler.

450
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,020
Please sit here.

451
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,310
Then, how did he get lipstick there?

452
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,830
That's why I'm suspecting that he's having an affair.

453
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,090
He comes home late these days, and I found
an unfamiliar receipt.

454
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,130
He checks his cellphone more frequently than before.

455
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,190
Did you check his cellphone?

456
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,830
No, I didn't!

457
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,590
I'm sure I would regret it if I did.

458
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,690
But it began ever since he started going to the gym.

459
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,450
He's probably cheating with a member of the gym.

460
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,170
He doesn't look like he would cheat on you.

461
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,590
I would kill him if he was having and affair.

462
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,470
Kill whom?

463
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,510
What do you mean?

464
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,450
Your husband? Or the woman?

465
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:24,300
Women usually get mad at the other woman when their husband or boyfriend cheats on them.

466
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,320
I always wonder why that is.

467
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,700
I guess that's because we want to believe that the other woman seduced him.

468
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,320
We have to believe so to go back to how we were before.

469
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,900
Then, believe him.

470
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,920
You married him because you loved him so much.
Don't end it so easily.

471
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,360
That's what a girl without dating experience says.

472
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,800
What?

473
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,670
Getting married is not a goal. It's a start.

474
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,090
I'm surprised there is someone who still believes in that kind of fairy tale.

475
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,540
You have no dream in your life.

476
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,800
You will end up aging alone...

477
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,630
20 years it has been.

478
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:06,170
I've been tired of him many times after we got married.

479
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:12,230
But I've never thought I shouldn't have gotten married.

480
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,010
So, if he is cheating, I will not forgive him.

481
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,220
I will never forgive him!

482
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:33,960
<i>When they are having an affair, the one you cannot
forgive is him? or her?</i>

483
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,800
Then, you didn't go to the hot spring?

484
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,240
No. So, there is no souvenir for you.

485
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,000
Sorry!

486
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,770
Why didn't you call me?

487
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:50,420
Well, it wasn't a big deal because Tachibana
took me to the hospital.

488
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,040
Here you go.

489
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,110
Tachibana-san again, huh?

490
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,260
Oh, no. He just happened to be there.

491
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,910
When I opened my door, he opened his door and...

492
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:10,090
Sakura-san. You think I have no feelings?

493
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,810
What?

494
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,840
You think that I am young and don't have much thoughts,

495
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,090
and that I'd feel nothing even when you talk about another man?

496
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,350
I don't think that way at all.

497
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:26,080
Then, don't be friendly with Tachibana-san anymore.

498
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,770
I've got to go back to practice.

499
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:40,870
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Last Cinderella Team @ Viki.</i>

500
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,740
Oh...

501
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,480
Hello, this is Takenouchi residence.

502
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,140
Oh, thank you for taking care of Saki.

503
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,190
Okay. I will be there right away.

504
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,640
Yes. Bye.

505
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,460
Something happened to Saki-chan at school?

506
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,670
No, nothing.

507
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,820
What's wrong?

508
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,740
Well, it looks like <i>it</i> started.

509
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,570
It...?

510
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,330
Are you saying she had her first period?

511
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:22,800
Yes. She has cramps and is in the nurse's office. I have to go pick her up.

512
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,580
Can you stay home for Kakeru?

513
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,910
Oh, yes. Yes.

514
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:31,320
Oh, really. Saki-chan did...

515
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,770
It's a normal thing that happens to a woman.

516
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,800
But when I had my first period, I was confused, too.

517
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,830
- You, too?
- Yeah.

518
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,190
But you'll get used to it soon. Don't worry.

519
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,080
Okay.

520
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,920
Don't tell Dad, though.

521
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,810
I know!

522
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,810
We're home!

523
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,260
You're back! Congratulations, Saki-chan!

524
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,730
What?

525
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,470
I cooked red rice!

526
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,430
Ah, mother...

527
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,840
Why red rice?

528
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,620
Because we have to celebrate tonight.

529
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,200
Saki-chan!

530
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,860
Oh? What's wrong with her?

531
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,660
A girl at her age is sensitive.

532
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,290
You are telling me that I'm not sensitive?

533
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:29,040
Sorry for doing unwanted things.

534
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,390
Why are we having red rice?

535
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,200
Saki is already at that age, huh?

536
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,820
Some girls have it in the third or fourth grade.

537
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,670
Hmm.

538
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,450
Kids these days grow up fast.

539
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,600
They say their minds can't keep up with the changes
in their bodies.

540
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,530
Hmm...

541
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,190
I have to pay more attention to Saki.

542
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,830
Yeah, right.

543
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,190
Hey, pretend that you don't know about it. Okay?

544
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,610
Oh... I know.

545
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,210
- Oh!
- Ouch.
- Hey.
- What?

546
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,900
- Did you go to the gym today?
- Yeah, I did.

547
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,940
You go there so often, but I see no change.

548
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,680
It takes time to have a result.

549
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,620
That's true, but what does Shima-san say?

550
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,980
N...nothing. I'm going to take a bath.

551
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:25,400
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Last Cinderella Team @ Viki.</i>

552
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,150
Again...

553
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,580
What are you doing in my seat?

554
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,360
Say something. It's not like you.

555
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,640
You said you wanted to be a baseball player, right?

556
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,590
I had been playing only baseball since elementary school.

557
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:35,130
I just couldn't think of anything else when I was asked what my dream was.

558
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,920
- Were you any good?
- Yup.

559
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,160
I was the pitcher and the third batter in the little league. I was always a first string player in school.

560
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,160
We made our way to the national high school championship.

561
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,780
Wow. How far did you go?

562
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,000
It was over before we even played.

563
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,550
One of our teammates was found smoking.

564
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,140
Our school withdrew from the championship.

565
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,900
I was being scouted, too. I could have been a professional player if I played then.

566
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,690
My dream stayed a dream afterall.

567
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,010
I see.

568
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,060
What did you want to be when you were a kid?

569
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:16,380
Me? I... wanted to be a mom.

570
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,970
Yeah?

571
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,470
It was my dream...

572
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,910
but I was told at the doctor's office today that

573
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:29,520
I haven't had my period because my hormonal balance is off.

574
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,370
Even if I got lucky and got married,

575
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,950
it would be hard for me to get pregnant.

576
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,050
Do you want some?

577
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,120
Yeah. Thank you.

578
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,930
- Actually, I've been there, too.
- What?

579
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:52,780
My girlfriend took a pregnancy test once.

580
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,790
It turned out that she wasn't pregnant.

581
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:04,720
I was disappointed, but she was apparently relieved.

582
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,510
It means she didn't want to marry me, right?

583
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,770
Not necessarily.

584
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:15,250
Maybe she wasn't ready to have a child then.

585
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,200
You still have a chance.

586
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,710
You never know what will happen in your life.

587
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:30,320
I mean, a year ago, you never thought you would be dating a boy who is 15 years younger than you in a year, right?

588
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,590
Oh, no.

589
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,480
He'll be mad at me again.

590
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,150
What?

591
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,000
Watch out!

592
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,590
It's coming here!

593
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,130
I thought I heard bam.

594
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,860
Hey, Tachibana.  Hey.

595
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,870
Hey, hey! Seriously?

596
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,430
Tachibana, hang in there!

597
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,680
Tachibana... No way!  Tachibana, come on!

598
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,300
Tachibana! Tachibana!!

599
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,380
Too loud. You almost blew my eardrum.

600
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,920
What? Don't scare me.

601
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,910
<i>Just now, you were worried for real, right?</i>

602
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,470
<i>I wasn't worried. Were you really a baseball player?</i>

603
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,050
You lied about being a pitcher and 3rd batter. You were just a bench-warmer, right?

604
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:33,200
I just saved you. You are such a ungrateful person.

605
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,150
We're sorry.

606
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,090
Are you ok?

607
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,350
Oww, it hurts.

608
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,590
Ah don't worry, he is  perfectly fine.

609
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:46,560
It hurts too much. I won't feel better unless you let us join the game.

610
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,530
Coming you way.

618
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,900
Good evening.

619
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,380
Ugh!

620
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,400
Good evening.  Welcome.

621
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,830
Ah! It's Tachibana-san.

622
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,220
Good evening!

623
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,520
All of you are here today. Is this a so-called lady's get together?

624
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,670
Sakura is introducing her boyfriend to us.

625
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,420
You don't have to say it.

626
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,810
He seems to be young, so we must pamper him.

627
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,420
Go easy on him. Young people are naive these days, so he might run away with his tail between his legs.

628
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,320
I am well aware of that. But I can't leave Sakura in care of that kind of guy.

629
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,150
Don't bully him too much.

630
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,140
Miki-san, What's going on...

631
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,360
with your husband's possible affair?

632
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,470
What? Are you suspicious of him?

633
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,000
Miki has been delusional.

634
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,270
It isn't a delusion.

635
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,270
Right, I wanted to ask you, Shima-san.

636
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:18,950
What it is?

637
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,180
Does he act suspicious at the gym?

638
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:27,380
He has been acting strange since he started going to the gym.

639
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,600
I don't know. I don't keep eyes on him all the time.

640
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,370
Miki, your husband is not the type of person to have an affair.

641
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,480
He's not the type that attracts women, but

642
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,460
he has been acting suspicious for sure.

643
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,820
You are suspicious of him, because you love him.

644
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,660
That's true. I'm envious.

645
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,040
Right?

646
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,560
I am not sure that's the case.

647
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,960
That's the case.

648
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,710
Tachibana-san, are you single?

649
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,920
Yes, Shima-san, are you also single?

650
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,260
Yes, I'm single, too.

651
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,870
Ah, since we are both single, let's drink together sometime.

652
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,650
Good idea.

653
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:12,850
Hey! You there, drunker! Don't ask my friend out.

654
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,440
I was the one who was asked out.

655
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,810
- Right?
- That's not right, idiot!

656
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:18,390
Decline the invitation.

657
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,880
Why? You, idiot!

658
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,410
You are the one who is idiot. Sit here alone all by yourself.

659
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:29,260
Okay, okay. Welcome. Since not all of you are here, do you want to start with a drink?

660
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,270
Please!!

661
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,900
Who is the real drinker here?

662
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,040
Who are you talking about?

663
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,000
Did you hear me?

664
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,030
Let's order Fava beans.

665
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:44,440
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Last Cinderella Team @ Viki.</i>

666
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,700
Hello.

667
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,530
It's me.  Where are you now?

668
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,850
What's up?

669
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,820
I wanna see you.  Come here now.

670
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,640
Are you drinking?

671
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,420
Hey!

672
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,080
If you don't come soon, I don't know what I'll do.

673
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:22,390
Hey, Chiyoko. Where are you right now?

674
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,540
You know, he is awfully late, isn't he?

675
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,570
- Yeah.
<i>- You will be connected to voice mail...</i>

676
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,870

677
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,860

678
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,730
I'm leaving, so...

679
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,140
Let's drink together then.

680
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,420
Join us.

681
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,040
I'm not confident enough to handle three ladies all by myself.

682
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,770
What?

683
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,230
Ah, you are here, my servant.

684
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,470
What happened?

685
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,220
Nothing really.

686
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,220
It's just, I am all alone.

687
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,380
Don't push yourself.

688
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,150
Give it back.

689
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,580
You can't drink alcohol.

690
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,960
I want to get drunk.

691
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,150
You already are.

692
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,250
I'm not drunk. That's why I can't get my mind off
that woman's face.

693
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,550
Disappear, just disappear!!

694
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:26,190
I got it, just calm down.

695
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:38,170
Wait... I've seen that stain somewhere before.

696
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:47,800
You have, haven't you? This stain.

697
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,020
Stay back. It's dangerous.

698
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,270
Hiroto.

699
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,550
Doesn't it look like something?

700
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,460
Whose fault is it that I can't fall in love? Your fault, isn't it?

701
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,840
It's all your fault!

702
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,650
Your fault!

703
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,990
Let go!

704
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:26,960
Because you failed to hold onto her.

705
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,530
It's your fault.

706
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,590
I'm sorry, Chiyoko.

707
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,920
Sorry...

708
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,350
I'm sure an urgent matter came up.

709
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:55,510
When I stood him up, he was sitting tight here.

710
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,140
So I will sit tight here for him, too.

711
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,290
You are right. He'll show up eventually. For now, let's drink.

712
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,120
Let's drink!

713
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,420
Thank you for the wine.

714
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,230
Please enjoy.

715
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,620
Thank you.

716
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:11,260
Wait a minute, can we get some glasses?

717
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,030
<i>Hold on, Shima-san. Hurry. Oh thank you.</i>

718
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,890
Excuse me.

719
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:42,870
♫<i> Oh baybaybay, whether it is today or tomorrow
Cinderella steps out ♫</i>

720
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:49,610
♫ <i>When I stand in front of a mirror, I look most beautiful</i> ♫

721
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:56,240
♫ <i>Oh baybaybay, please blow away the doubt in my heart</i> ♫

Makes me want to do it.</i>

725
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,640
<i>I'm so happy that you are next to me when I wake up.</i>

726
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,970
<i>You seem doing well with her.</i>

727
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,110
<i>I'm only doing what you told me to.</i>

728
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,040
<i>As I thought, you like Sakura-san.</i>

729
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,350
<i>Are you having an affair with Miki's husband?</i>

730
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,280
<i>No way!</i>

731
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,740
<i>I like you, Shima-san.</i>

732
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,630
<i>Who is it?</i>

733
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,480
<i>Can I fall asleep here?</i>

734
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,050
<i>Sure.</i>

735
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,360
<i>My lover's young brother. Geez, stop it.</i>

736
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,420
<i>What an odd match.</i>

737
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,670
<i>You mean, he is Choko-chan's brother?</i>
