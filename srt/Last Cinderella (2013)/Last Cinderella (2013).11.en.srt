<i>Don't come near her anymore. </i>

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,710
<i>You aren't capable of making her happy.</i>

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,450
<i>I can make her happier than you can.</i>

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,820
<i>Won't you come with me to New York?</i>

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,990
<i>I'll make you happy,</i>

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,800
<i>I'll protect you!</i>

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,260
<i>It was all a lie</i>

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,900
<i>when I said I loved you, and</i>

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,840
<i>even when I proposed to you.</i>

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,630
<i>You're annoying.  Don't bother with me anymore.</i>

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,600
<i>What's happened? What's happened??</i>

<i>So, what is Sakura-chan going to do?</i>

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,800
<i>It seems  she hasn't been able to decide what to do yet.</i>

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>I've thought she and Rintaro were  well-matched
from the beginning.</i>

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,280
<i>So, I want her to go with him to New York.</i>

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,090
Tachibana-san will definitely make Sakura happy.

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,250
I don't think that's going to happen that easily.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,470
<i>I'd never seen Sakura being that happy
until she was with Hiroto-kun.</i>

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,410
<i>But what Sakura needs right now is someone
dependable like Tachibana-san.</i>

26
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,090
Although she actually loves someone else?

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,920
Wouldn't that be rude to Tachibana-san?

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,750
Tachibana-san understands

29
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,210
<i>that Sakura doesn't have him in her heart yet.</i>

30
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,960
<i>Even so, he is trying to take Sakura with him.</i>

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,410
Well, well, in the end, it is all up to Sakura-chan to decide.

32
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,670
Hm... That's true.

33
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,750
<i>(Sakura cleared her throat out loud.)</i>

34
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,760
She came.  Welcome!!

35
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,410
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

36
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,740
- Hi!
- Hi!

37
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,380
Ah, it is time to go, right?

38
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,960
Hm...  you're right!

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Okay let's go now!

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,460
Thank you very much, Ken-chan.

41
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,380
I heard you.

42
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,510
Hm?

43
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,110
What you've been talking about now.

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm sorry that I made you guys worry.

45
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,730
I will make a decision after giving it careful thought.

46
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,920
Okay.

47
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,500
See you later Ken-chan, I'll come again.

48
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,710
It's raining, huh...

49
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,120
Oh... Hiroto, you are here at the right time.

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,050
Can you lend me some money?

51
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,300
I feel bad about what I've done to Momo.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,760
So, I don't care what you do to me.

53
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,470
But, don't you ever bother Sakura-san again.

54
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,420
Hah?!

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,610
You have no right to order me around.  Idiot!

56
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,470
She has nothing to do with me anymore.

57
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,010
She belongs to another world that has nothing to do with me.

58
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,620
So, please...

59
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,160
Don't you ever come near Sakura-san again.

60
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,370
I beg of you, Yusuke.

61
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,300
I got it.

62
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,880
I thought President would be againt it, but

63
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,960
he said he'd appreciate it if we two go together.

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,160
Of course.

65
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,960
It is the first overseas branch, so he wants to have it succeed.

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,410
But... my English...

67
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,630
Right...

68
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,410
It seems Tachibana went to an English conversation school when he was small.

69
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,050
But I've been bad in it since junior high school.

70
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,140
I'm at the level of "this is a pen."

71
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,990
It's okay. You'll probably go to school there.

72
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,250
So, just rely on Tachibana-san until then.

73
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,920
I can't do that, since I've been causing him so much trouble.

74
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,270
I can't rely on him.

75
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,670
It's nice to rely on someone once in a while.

76
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,680
You try too hard to do things alone.

77
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,050
I feel more at ease now after meeting him (her boyfriend).

78
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,580
Being able to be yourself without over-straining
yourself is wonderful.

79
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,500
<i>Thanks for waiting!!</i>

80
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,670
So pretty!

81
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,210
It looks good.

82
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,570
You look great even though you are over 40.

83
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,090
Yeah!

84
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,210
- Do I look good?
- Yeah!

85
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,590
Okay, I have to keep it up myself.

86
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,960
What? Are you getting along with your boyfriend?

87
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,590
Sort of. Our relationship is still platonic, though.

88
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,900
That sounds wonderful. Just think of it as long foreplay.

89
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,010
- Ah!
- What is it?

90
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,420
You have to go beyond foreplay this time.

91
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,250
Sure.

92
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,800
Hey, what is it?

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,920
- Forget it.
- What?

94
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,170
Foreplay?

95
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,250
Don't say it out loud.

96
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,040
It's foreplay.

97
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,960
You touched my chest.

98
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,850
Shima-san!

99
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,280
Ah!

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,480
Is that possibly your boyfriend?

101
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,130
Let me introduce you. This is Kondo Suguru-san.

102
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,420
They are my best friends, Sakura and Miki.

103
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,380
Nice to meet you. I'm Kondo.

104
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,040
Hello.

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,540
Congratulations on your wedding.

106
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,040
That's me here. Thank you.

107
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,170
Pull out your shirt.

108
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,590
Why do you have this here?

109
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,750
You are wearing a bag.

110
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,090
<i>Why are you wearing it?</i>

111
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,510
Hey!

112
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,800
We are having dinner before going home.

113
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,170
So see you later.

114
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,470
Okay.

115
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,590
<i>Wow, he seems kind.</i>

116
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,250
He might be a good match for Shima-nee.

117
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,830
Sakura also was a good match... with Hiroto-kun.

118
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,170
Sakura, if you are going to New York,

119
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,870
I'm gonna miss you so much that I might cry.

120
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,630
But no matter what your decision is,

121
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,550
Shima-san and I will root for you.

122
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,450
Thank you, Miki.

123
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,420
- I'm going to kiss you.
- No.

124
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,170
Geez.

125
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,330
Yo!

126
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,670
Oh!

127
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,670
Come on in.

128
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,550
Here.

129
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,080
Ah, thank you!

130
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,130
So, did Miki-san pick and choose her dress?

131
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,050
Yes, she did.

132
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,250
But she still can't make up her mind about her hair style.

133
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,410
How about you?

134
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,130
What?

135
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,460
You are not going there dressed casually, right?

136
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,460
That's right. I have to start thinking about that.

137
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,630
But, I have shoes. You know,

138
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,550
that pair you bought me before.

139
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,970
What kind of dress matches those shoes?  You have any ideas?

140
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,200
Don't ask me!

141
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,750
You have better fashion sense than I do.

142
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,300
Your lack of fashion sense is really something.

143
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,010
Leave me alone.

144
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,330
It can't be helped.

145
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,430
I know a good shop, so I'll give you the information.

146
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,420
Really?  Thanks!

147
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,510
Sorry to cause you trouble about everything.

148
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,750
Ah, yum.

149
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,120
Hey...

150
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,710
There's something I didn't tell you.

151
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,120
My goodness. I thought you were going to kiss me.

152
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,820
You know, that guy... your ex-boyfriend...

153
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,180
I don't want to talk about Hiroto-kun anymore.

154
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,120
It's not about him. It's about me.

155
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,630
The fact that he approached you at Choko-chan's request,

156
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,000
I have known it for quite some time.

157
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,010
Ah, really.

158
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,540
Choko-chan got jealous over our relationship,

159
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,220
and she made him approach you.

160
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,170
So, I have caused you to get involved to begin with.

161
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,620
You don't have to feel responsible for it.

162
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,660
But, couldn't you have told me about it sooner?

163
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,080
I could't tell you...

164
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,710
since you loved him.

165
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:37,080
Whatever the reason was, I didn't tell you anything,

166
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,580
so you can't just blame only him.

167
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,500
Forget it.

168
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,000
I think... he loves you even now.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,420
Like I said, forget it.

170
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,300
Maybe, the reason why he said those terrible things to you-

171
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,720
I know.

172
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,840
You know?

173
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,340
I think those two will keep having hard time if they are like that.

174
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,950
I feel sorry for those siblings.

175
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,300
But, it's not something I should be worrying about.

176
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,880
By the way, it's about going to New York.

177
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,540
Can you give me more time?

178
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah.

179
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,380
Damn it.

180
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,120
Is there something between you and Choko-chan?

181
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,590
I know she's holding a grudge against me for nothing.

182
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,060
I'm sorry that I tried to threaten you.

183
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,970
But, if even I turn my back on her, she'd be too pitiful.

184
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,700
I don't think you can save her by pitying her.

185
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,680
Chiyoko is a child who is hungry for love.

186
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,740
Until she finds someone who would unconditionally love her, I will stay by her side.

187
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,260
Although I'm her brother, it will be better than having no one.

188
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,250
Next week, I'll be transferred to New York.

189
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,080
I am intending to take her with me.

190
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,720
It will be alright to take her, won't it?

191
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,250
If it's you, you can support her financially and mentally.

192
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,250
Please make her happy.

193
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,800
Well then.

194
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:19,150
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Last Cinderella Team @Viki</i>

195
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,530
- That will be 490 yen ($4.90).
- Okay.

196
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,350
Here you go! Keep the change.

197
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,360
<i>I got it!</i>

198
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,300
Choko-chan!

199
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,020
Wait, Wait!

200
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,710
Can I talk to you a bit?

201
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,750
Do you think you could...

202
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,970
let Hiroto-kun go?

203
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,160
Don't get it wrong. Our relationship is over.

204
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,240
It's just...

205
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,820
Hiroto-kun... was having a hard time.

206
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,220
He talked to you about my burn, didn't he?

207
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,710
Yes.

208
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,550
It's been hard for you too, Choko-chan.

209
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:24,080
But I think Hiroto-kun has suffered enough as well.

210
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,560
What in the world do you know about me?

211
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,750
I don't know anything.

212
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,130
Only you know your own pain.

213
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,390
But continuing to shackle him won't get you anywhere.

214
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,420
You can't be free either if you don't let him go.

215
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,030
<i>If Horito-kun's unhappy, are you happy?</i>

216
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,740
<i>That's not it, right?  It can't be.</i>

217
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,460
<i>Since he's your brother you have lived with since childhood.</i>

218
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,280
<i>It'll be too sad if you keep blaming someone
for the rest of your life.</i>

219
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,710
<i>Haven't you and Hiroto-kun...</i>

220
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,570
<i>suffered more than enough?</i>

221
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,150
Soon, I won't be able to eat your Soba anymore.

222
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,270
It's okay. I'll go make you some every once in a while.

223
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,970
All the way in New York?

224
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,990
Yeah. I can put my travel costs down to my business expenses.

225
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,730
No, you can't.

226
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,680
I can't?

227
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,710
Of course not.

228
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,210
Ah. Welcome!

229
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,870
Choko-chan.

230
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,930
I saw Sakura-san today.

231
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,040
Is that so?

232
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:51,110
She was still worried about Hiroto despite all the terrible things he did to her.

233
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,380
She asked me to set him free.

234
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,990
Didn't she think saying such a thing to me would
work adversely?

235
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,460
She doesn't know how to doubt people.

236
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,750
I'm sick of this.

237
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,140
All I did was fall in love with someone.

238
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,450
That was all...

239
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,630
But if it makes me hurt someone, get hurt...

240
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:37,700
or go through this much pain, I never want to fall in love again.

241
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,710
I'm grateful to you.

242
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:49,840
Just knowing someone loves you

243
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,150
gives you confidence and strength.

244
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,970
I just thought

245
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,910
that I was never lonely although I was alone,

246
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,850
and you might have been the reason.

247
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:11,360
Thank you... for loving someone like me.

248
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,040
<i>Welcome.</i>

249
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,960
Here's the menu.

250
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:44,890
<i>A one-sided love that never blossoms, is hard to let go.</i>

251
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,120
How pretty!

252
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,830
I didn't want my shop to seem snobbish although I wanted it to be fashionable.

253
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,770
I created a shop that even young people could feel free to enter.

254
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,630
This shop makes someone with poor fashion sense like me to feel like coming inside.

255
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,180
Sakura-san, you don't have good fashion sense?

256
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,510
Yes, Tachibana-san always says I have 'zero' fashion sense although I am a beautician.

257
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,270
Well, that's not good. I won't be able to entrust this shop
to you then.

258
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,310
What?

259
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,350
I suppose I'm being hasty.

260
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,620
If you're going to a wedding, I recommend these over here.

261
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,950
This is good!

262
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,660
You're pretty good, Ken-chan.

263
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,520
Thank you.

264
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,580
I've never thought Rintaro's Mom would come here.

265
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,850
Sakura-chan.

266
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,680
Thank you!

267
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,010
It's fine. What are you crying about?

268
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,920
Do you go back to your parents' house once in a while?

269
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm so busy, I hardly have time to do so.

270
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,560
You should let them see your face once in a while.

271
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:49,620
You are still fortyish, but your parents are golden yearish and don't have much to live.

272
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,550
Golden yearish?

273
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,990
That's a new one!

274
00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:01,030
So, Sakura-chan and Ken-chan, you should contact your parents once in a while.

275
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,670
Okay.

276
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,690
I will keep it in mind.

277
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,600
Okay, take your time.

278
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,050
By the way, I heard you might go to New York.

279
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,590
RIntaro asked you to go with him, right?

280
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,890
I was so surprised to hear that.

281
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,390
He was never the type to volunteer to say such a thing.

282
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,950
But it seems your mind's not made up yet.

283
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,440
Sorry.

284
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,350
Hey, don't apologize.

285
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,250
I'm all for it, of course.

286
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:41,100
If things go well between you and Rintaro, you and I won't have serious in-law problems.

287
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,160
But this is your life.

288
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,560
I won't meddle in.

289
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,920
This is your life, nobody else's.

290
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,590
Make the choice you won't regret.

291
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,900
Yes!

292
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,350
Where is New York?

293
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,280
I know, right?

294
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,430
It's far, isn't it?

295
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,990
<i>Life is great because you can't do it over.</i>

296
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:28,720
♪ Once more. Once more.  I hope we meet again ♪

297
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,770
♪ Once more ♪

298
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,560
Tachibana.

299
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,780
I'm coming in.

300
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,060
Are you taking a bath? Shall I peek- Oh?

301
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,340
Gosh, you're asleep?

302
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,040
I got you some tasty treats though.

303
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,900
Drunkard.

304
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,900
What is this? Vocabulary?

305
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,180
Self introduction.

306
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,970
<i>My name is Tohyama Sakura.</i>

307
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,390
That's me.

308
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,740
<i>I am 40 years old.</i>

309
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,860
<i>I have a habit of saying 'heave-ho.'</i>

310
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,470
<i>I am clumsy.</i>

311
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,370
<i>I rush into things without thinking of the consequences,</i>

312
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,650
<i>and I make mistakes.</i>

313
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,960
<i>I may seem cheerful...</i>

314
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,240
<i>but I actually get lonely easily.</i>

315
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,750
♫<i> I just felt that I knew it all </i>♫

316

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,970

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,740
♫<i> And we wanted someone to understand </i>♫

321
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,890
You startled me. How long have you been here?
♫ What we believe ♫

322
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,370
I'm going to New York.

323
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,270
What?

324
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,500
I'll go with you.

325
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,480
Really?

326
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,630
I'll have my stuff sent over later.

327
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,720
I'll ask Miki and Shima-nee to make the arrangements.

328
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,450
Do you want some?

329
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,630
You ate sushi?

330
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,330
You should've called me.

331
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,920
But I was having so much fun with her and even
went to karaoke.

332
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,060
We sang "Once more, once more."

333
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,830
Soy sauce.

334
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,820
Get it yourself.

335
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,710
That looks good. I can't help myself.

336
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,790
Get some beer, too.

337
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,140
Also, um...

338
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,450
It's up here?

339
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,150
Found it. There it is.

340
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,580
Where is a...<i> stachion</i> (station)?

341
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,370
Huh?

342
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,080
What's "<i>stachion"</i>?

343
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,250
I am a bealty... a bealtichan (beautician)?

344
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,520
Give me a break.

345
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,660
Come on, I'm trying hard here, don't laugh.

346
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,220
What's this one?

347
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,640
What?

348
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,270
I would like to eat a hum... a hum... humbo...(hamburger)

349
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,450
<i> Ham... brassiere?</i>

350
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,540
It doesn't say brassiere anywhere on there!

351
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,970
<i>Bra...</i>

352
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,650
Wait.

353
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,850
What? What's wrong? Is there something on my face?

354
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,320
Ouch.

355
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,300
That hurt.

356
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,500
Quit laughing at me.

357
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,950
Every night...

358
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,920
doing that.

359
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,870
What?

360
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,890
Wait a second.

361
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,400
Stop it already.

362
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,660
- My heart is pounding.
- I know, right?

363
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,950
He is here. You are late for your own farewell party.

364
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,170
I'm sorry. I was doing a final check for my luggage.

365
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,860
Cerveza por favor.
<i>(A beer, please.)</i>

366
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,960
You are speaking English.

367
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,950
It's not English.  It's Spanish.

368
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,150
Why Spanish now?

369
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,140
Sorry for being late.

370
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,790
Not at all. So you are leaving tomorrow, how do you feel?

371
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,290
All I have to do now is to board the airplane.

372
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,330
How about you, Takenouchi-san?  How do you feel now to have a wedding tomorrow?

373
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,990
Honestly, I wish it could end soon.

374
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,520
Is it ok to say that?

375
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,050
It really is a hassle. Food, outfits, music and gifts...

376
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,870
We have to take care of bunch of trivial things.

377
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,050
I see.

378
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,490
Sorry to tell such realistic things to you guys who are not married yet.

379
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,410
No problem. I don't even have a partner yet.

380
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,410
Yeah, right!

381
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,920
But you could get married soon, Rintaro.

382
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,340
Is that so?

383
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,190
Well... Can I ask you something?

384
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,540
Yeah.

385
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,110
Why did you decide to marry your wife?

386
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,140
It's deja vu.

387
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,860
Eh?

388
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,140
Well, I simply wanted to be with her for the rest of my life.

389
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,810
I see.

390
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,060
The point is whether you can meet someone who makes you feel that way.

391
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,620
I still have a long way to go.

392
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,160
Me, too.

393
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,110
No. There is no way. Impossible.

394
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,460
Mmm, this steamed dumpling is delicious.
<i>(Sh-umai is umai. It's a pun.)</i>

395
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,350
What the heck was that?

396
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,320
It's not an old man’s joke, but an old woman’s joke.

397
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,290
Don't call me an old woman. Watch what you say.

398
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,320
Thank you for the meal.

399
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,010
- This steamed dumpling is delicious.
- Delicious.

400
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,250
- Right?
- Not you, too.

401
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,240
I won't be able to eat your home cooked meal. How sad.

402
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,260
If you think so, come back sometimes.

403
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,650
That's right. I won't forgive you if you don't come visit us.

404
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,690
Okay, but you have to come visit me, too.

405
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,160
I don't think I can.

406
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Why not?

407
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,540
Our family budget is tight, and there is no telling how much it would cost the whole family to go to New York.

408
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,070
I can't, either. He says his salary as a government employee is rather low.

409
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,070
We have to start saving for a wedding.

410
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,080
Pshaw, both of you only think of yourselves.

411
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,770
I'm just kidding. We will save up and come visit you.

412
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,860
I'll be waiting.

413
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,230
Should I have a wedding ceremony over there?

414
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,650
A wedding ceremony in New York sounds good, doesn't it?

415
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,100
Did he possibly propose to you?

416
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,290
Nope.

417
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,840
I'm just imagining it.

418
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,970
How about you, Sakura? Do you think Tachibana-san will propose to you?

419
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,190
Not yet. We are not quiet there yet.

420
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,570
I think we are almost there.

421
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,540
Since our relationship isn't platonic anymore.

422
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,190
What? You mean...

423
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,250
By any chance...

424
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,190
Stop it. Geez. Yeah.

425
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,510
It's only your imagination, right?

426
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,610
Absolutely not.

427
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,410
You know, unexpectedly he was...

428
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,680
- You kidding?!
-  My goodness!

429
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,990
Welcome home.

430
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,110
Miki.

431
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,440
Something wrong?

432
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,490
It's fine, right?

433
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,120
What it is? Go take a bath. Here, right in time.

434
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,100
- It's okay.
- What?

435
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,020
- What is going on?
- It's okay.

436
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,160
Dinner is ready.

437
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,650
Wait. Ko-chan!
<i>(Ko-chan: nickname for Kohei)</i>

438
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:06,460
- I want to drink more.
- Hey, get hold of yourself.

439
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,140
<i>Oh? Shima-san?</i>

440
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,320
Ah, Tachibana-san. Thank goodness.

441
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,190
What's going on?

442
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,650
I'm sorry. She didn't drink that much,

443
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,950
but she seems to be drunk.

444
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,680
Can you walk?

445
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,190
You're a good-looking man.

446
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,240
Hey, let's go drink some more.

447
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,510
- What?
- Hey, be nice.

448
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,200
- Hey, hey.
- You are such a handful.

449
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,680
Sorry, but can you put her on my back?

450
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,410
Ah, okay. Sorry about this.

451
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,230
Here, hang on to him. Go.

452
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,000
Ah, it's comfortable.

453
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,760
Thank you for taking care of her.

454
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,160
Shima-san, you too, be careful.

455
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,040
- Yes, thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

456
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,630
Let's go.

457
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,550
How much did you drink?

458
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,690
You know, tomorrow is an important day.

459
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,510
I'm going to fart.

460
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,050
No matter how drunk you are, don't fart on me, okay?

461
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,560
We are here.

462
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,660
So troublesome...

463
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,470
this drunk lady.

464
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,100
Here.

465
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,240
Take off your shoes.

466
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,890
Hiroto-kun.

467
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:49,060
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Last Cinderella Team @Viki.</i>

468
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,480
<i>We are closed for a special party today</i>

469
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,210
<i>- You look really cute.
- Thank you very much.</i>

470
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,490
Everyone! May I have your attention?

471
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:03,850
Some of you will be wearing kimono,
so please watch your steps.

472
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,330
Okay. I'll leave the rest to you. I'm leaving first.

473
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,620
Ow!

474
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,480
Are you alright?

475
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,630
Ow, ow.

476
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,750
You are the one who should be careful the most.

477
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,390
Sure, sure.

478
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,800
Just say "sure" once.

479
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,140
SURE!

480
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,240
Go quickly.   Miki-san and Shima-san are waiting, right?

481
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,130
That's right. Take care the rest, okay?

482
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,060
Okay.

483
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,120
Tachibana-san, will you two be okay from tomorrow?

484
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,450
Going to New York is fantastic.

485
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,740
Sakura-san and Tachibana-san will be
like this anywhere they go.

486
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,260
You guys should get started, too. We don't have much time.

487
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,640
Yes.

488
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,720
Okay, it's done. What do you think?

489
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,270
it doesn't looks like it's me...

490
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,800
Miki... you look gorgeous.

491
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,410
Congratulations.

492
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:00,940
Sakura, Shima-san, thank you!

493
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,070
Hey, you are making me cry.

494
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,700
- Don't cry.
- Sorry.

495
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,120
- You are ruining your make-up.
- Sorry.

496
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,160
- Are you good?
- Yes.

497
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,900
I will go change and do my hair.

498
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,870
- Okay.
- See you later.

499
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,090
<i>Sakura doesn't look like she cares, but</i>

500
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,310
<i>the national competition is on today, right?</i>

501
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:31,530
<i>Yeah. But Sakura is leaving today, so</i>

502
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,100
<i>I'm sure she got over him.</i>

503
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,590
Hello! Oh? Has everyone left already?

504
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,850
Yeah, a little while ago.

505
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,970
Oh, really?

506
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,830
Hurry up and sit here.

507
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,620
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

508
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,530
Please make me look beautiful.

509
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,270
Of course.

510
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,890
A simple style will do since we don't have much time.

511
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,940
Be quiet.

512
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,440
Don't tell me to be quiet.

513
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,960
It's fine. I can do my own makeup.

514
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,380
Just sit still.

515
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,130

How about the plane tickets?

529
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,190
I have them.

530
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,890
When a taxi comes, I'll load the luggage.

531
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,980
Is this it?

532
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,250
Yeah, that's the one.

533
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,450
Hurry up, okay?

534
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,070
Okay.

535
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,320
Tachibana.

536
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,990
Thanks.

537
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,540
Sure.

538
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,910
<i>Look at this one you said was inexpensive. It's nice.</i>

539
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,720
- I like this one, too.
-  Dad.

540
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,620
- Dad.
- Hm?

541
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,310
The plastic surgeon you found a long time ago,

542
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,890
would you take me there again?

543
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,930
Yeah, that's fine, but why?

544
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,780
What is it? Did you injure yourself?

545
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,220
No. That's not it. After all these years,

546
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,920
I want to remove the burn scar.

547
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,550
Chiyoko-chan.

548
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,710
Can you take me there?

549
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:38,790
Of course. I'll call the doctor now.

550
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:45,530
Also, I want you to forgive Hiroto... Onii-chan (older bro).

551
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,380
He really intended to work at your company.

552
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,360
I am sure of it since I went suit shopping with him
for a job interview.

553
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:03,750
When he wins today's competition, he will put an end to it.

554
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,210
Can you give him another chance then?

555
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,870
<i>Here are the Groom and the Bride.</i>

556
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,360
Nice face... nice face...

557
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,700
I know.

558
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,330
Here, Ken-chan.

559
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:56,450
Ken-chan?

560
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:00,010
It tastes good!

561
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,510
He's here.  Over here.

562
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,320
He looks so different.

563
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,070
He looks okay today, doesn't he?

564
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,580
Wow... he looks nice.

565
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,810
But his character is... oh well.

566
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,310
You say that, but I bet you are thinking he looks cute.

567
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,420
Was it obvious?

568
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,450
It's been a while... let me be lovey-dovey.

569
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,450
To decide with rock-paper-scissors, huh?

570
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,620
It doesn't matter how it starts.  It could be a matchmaking meeting, being hit on, or the Internet.

571
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,030
What's important is what comes after.

572
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,700
You're right.

573
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,430
Sorry.

574
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,900
What are you saying?  You're worrying too much.

575
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,780
<i>It finally started.</i>

576
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,940
<i>BMX, All Japan Cup 2013.</i>

577
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:59,350
<i>Who will be the number one in Japan?</i>

578
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,030
Hey, Hiroto.

579
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,210
<i>You better get ready soon.</i>

580
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,080
Hiroto.

581
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,020
Oh... you came.

582
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,650
How is it going?

583
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,410
Not good.

584
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,520
What do you mean?

585
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,410
You better win today no matter what.
I brought someone with me.

586
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,620
Thanks, Chiyoko.

587
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,330
Give it your best.

588
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:02,910
<i>Next, we'll hear a congratulatory message from the  bride's friend, Hasegawa Shima-san.</i>

589
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:14,980
Miki, Takenouchi-san, congratulations.

590
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,730
Miki and I were in the same club in high school, and although we were apart for some years,

591
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,920
it's been over 25 years since we first met.

592
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,490
<i>Miki was a cute kohai (a junior) who was
always laughing and smiling,</i>

593
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:35,260
<i>and I always thought I would never forgive
anyone who would hurt her.</i>

594
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:43,710
But, recently, I ended up hurting Miki myself.

595
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,120
I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize to her.

596
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,080
Miki, I am so sorry.

597
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,100
Miki said that someday she would like to have more confidence.

598
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:14,400
But neither Sakura nor I have confidence.

599
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:20,430
That's why we need friends.  Thinking that they need you

600
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:24,970
will help you figure out what your worth is.

601
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,960
Let's be friends forever.

602
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,850
Takenouchi-san,

603
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:40,140
- please make Miki the happiest bride in the world.
- Yes.

604
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:47,700
<i>That was Hasegawa Shima-san, the bride's friend.
Thank you very much.</i>

605
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,390
The next rider is... Hiroto.

606
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,610
<i>He won the Imperial Remix Cup, and he represents
the Kanto region.</i>

607
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,540
<i>Here is Saeki Hiroto.</i>

608
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,030
Hiroto, good luck!

609
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,140
<i>Okay, here goes Hiroto.</i>

610
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,750
<i>From a high jump to... wow!</i>

611
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,810
That's great!

612
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,480
<i>He is back flipping.</i>

613
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,070
<i>He landed with no problem!</i>

614
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:46,230
<i>He's been great so far.  What's he gonna do now?</i>

615
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,530
Hiroto!

616
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,190
- Is something wrong?
- Hm?  Nothing.

617
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,020
<i>Now, we will have the bouquet toss.</i>

618
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,540
it is said that the one who receives the bouquet
will soon find happiness.

619
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:15,890
<i>Ladies, catch the bouquet and get your happiness!</i>

620
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,520
Here I go.

621
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,330
If it's Ken-chan, that's fine.

622
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,190
That's true.  Be happy, Ken-chan.

623
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,350
Thank you all.

624
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,390
I'll become happy!

625
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,710
What?  What?!

626
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,220
- Hope to get along with you.
- No. No, thank you.

627
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,260
Let's take a picture...

628
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,260
<i>I'll go get my camera.</i>

629
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:56,070
- Kiss, kiss, kiss.
- What?

630
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,410
One more time.

631
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,890
- Hey.
- I was about to take a picture.

632
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,410
It's horrible.

633
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,410
Hiroto-kun fell in the preliminary, and is badly hurt.

634
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,790
What?

635
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,450
Go.

636
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,390
Quickly!

637
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,510
I got it.

638
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,370
Hiroto-kun!

639
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,980
Sakura-san.

640
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,760
Are you okay?

641
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:46,490
- What?
- You were injured, right?  Where?

642
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,570
What?

643
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,640
What?

644
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,810
That Tachibana!

645
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,820
Tachibana-san told you to come here?

646
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,040
I see.

647
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,690
If you're not injured, I'll go.

648
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,380
- Wait ...
- What are you doing, Hiroto?

649
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,440
The final round will begin now.

650
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,460
I don't have any motivation.

651
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,860
I don't care about winning anymore.

652
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,890
What??

653
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:35,550
You're the one who said you were going to win the national competition.

654
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,980
Was it a lie? That was a lie too, huh.

655
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,580
Don't you love it?  Isn't it your dream?

656
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,010
If you like it, chase it until the end!

657
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,880
Who was that?

658
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:04,630

I... can't go to New York-

00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,260
I know.

682
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:32,610
You are deceiving your own feelings. That's not the Kin I know.

683
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:37,550
Your strength is the foolish honesty that won't let you lie, isn't it?

684
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:41,520
If we take honesty out of you, what remains?

685
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,320
Only the foolishness remains!

686
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,200
Sorry.

687
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,220
You seem to be misunderstanding something.

688
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:58,070
Even if you went to New York with me, I wasn't gonna date you.

689
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,320
Give me a break.

690
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,810
Why in the world would I date you?

691
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:14,480
I did ask you to come to New York with me, but...

692
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:21,830
I didn't ask you to move in with me or date me.

693
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,110
I wouldn't want to, either.

694
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,860
Well, you should go now.

695
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,410
Since I came all the way here, I'll send you off.

696
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,750
Oh please, we are not lovers. It's gross.

697
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,340
You speak without reserve, as always.

698
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:55,290
Take care of the salon.

699
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,630
I got it.

700
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:09,270
Give your best too, Tachibana.

00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,410
Yeah.

702
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,900
See you.

703
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,310
Take care.

704
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,300
You, too.

705
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,860
Thanks.

706
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,680
Forget it. Go already.

707
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,370
Be happy.

708
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:40,130
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by

709
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,350
Sakura-san...

710
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,730
Why are you here?

711
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,550
What about New York?

712
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,920
When are you leaving?

713
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,410
Today.

714
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,770
I see.

715
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,610
I am annoying, right?

716
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:32,210
I've been fooled, right?

717
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,960
You got tired of me, right?

718
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,330
You told me not to come near you, didn't you?

719
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,060
That was obviously a lie.

720
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,740
You're always lying, Hiroto-kun.

721
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,320
Maybe, Tachibana-san can make you happier than I can.

722
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,710
However,

723
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:12,810
I still love you after all, Sakura-san.

724
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,030
I can't believe it.

725
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:21,200
I really love you.  I love you so much.

726
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,620
No good.

727
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,620
It didn't move me at all.

728
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,840
Since we were separated,

729
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,000
it has been so long, painful and boring every day.

730
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,160
I realized how much strength I got from you before.

731
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,230
Now, I can no longer

732
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,940
live without you.

733
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:53,430
I don't want to live in a place where you don't exist.

734
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:01,950
I don't want to be separated from you anymore.

735
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,340
I don't want to be separated from you ever again.

736
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,400
I won't lie again.

737
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,880
This will be the last time I propose to you.

738
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:36,080
Thanks to Sakura-san, I was able to win a first place.

739
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,420
I will work hard at my job.

740
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,710
I won't give up my dream, either.

741
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,710
So...

742
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,560
Sakura-san...

743
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:09,690
Please marry me.

744
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,920
Yes.

745
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,770
I won't let you go.

746
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,860
I will never let you go again.

747
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,010
I told him that I won't go to New York.

748
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,290
Sakura-san...
