It's so annoying.

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,920
What?

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,540
Hey, why won't  you open?

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,960
- What do you want?
<i>- Help me.</i>

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,550
- Huh?
- Just let me in.

19
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,300
Let me sleep on my day off.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,360
Wait! I might have to have an arranged date for marriage.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,170
- Huh,  arranged date?
- You want to see a picture of the woman I'm meeting?

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,290
Look! Look. look.

23
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,760
<i>Look, look, look.</i>

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,260
- Come get it.
- I wanna see it.

25
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,300
Here! Here, here.

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,790
Open the door.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,380
<i>She is very beautiful.</i>

28
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,580
Why don't you just meet her?

29
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,130
She is not my type. It will be a waste of time.

30
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,720
You'll never know.  You might actually find her pretty in person

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,040
and feel like dating her.

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,290
No way.

33
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,170
How stubborn you are!

34
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,550
Well, this woman won't have to waste her time,

35
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,300
so, that might be good anyway.

36
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,290
Ugh! My toe nails are too long.

37
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,960
Eww. I need a nail clipper.

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,590
Nail clipper, nail clipper...

39
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,130
Aren't you going to offer me a cup of coffee or something?

40
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,000
Get it yourself.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,920
Hey,

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,250
treat me as a guest.

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,800
What's with you?

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,500
Okay, here we go.

45
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,340
Ugh, this is no good.

46
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,070
Well, I just thought of something...

47
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,300
What?

48
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,010
Are you... gay?

49
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,420
What!?

50
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,120
Haha, you're upset. Maybe I'm right.

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,840
I certainly like girls.

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,750
I knew it.

53
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,430
I sound like a fool when I say it myself.

54
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,780
Then why don't you have a girlfriend? I know you are not
popular with girls

55
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,880
because you are some kind of pervert.

56
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,460
Got it! Maybe you have a serious physical problem.

57
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,080
Tell me. I won't tell anyone.

58
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,800
Listen to yourself. You are awfully rude.

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,490
Who's been rude?

60
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,040
I don't date since I don't need to date.

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,090
Aren't you lonely?

62
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,800
Not at all.

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,630
What about marriage?

64
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,410
Not interested.

65
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,420
How about sex?

66
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,740
None of your business.

67
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,800
I don't intend to date or marry anyone right now.

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,540
I slipped my tongue and told my parents

69
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,590
that I have a girlfriend.

70
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,510
What? You do?

71
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,510
I don't!! I lied because I didn't want to go through
this arranged date.

72
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,000
And so,  they're saying they want to see <i>her</i>.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,870
Geez, seriously?

74
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,630
So, do me a favor. Pretend to be my girlfriend.

75
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,630
What? Who? Me?

76
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,170
I don't have anybody I can ask.

77
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,560
That's impossible. I am not good at lying, also...

78
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,790
<i>Can you stop hanging out with Tachibana-san?</i>

79
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,420
Ugh, no! No, no.

80
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,910
Absolutely not.

81
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,630
<i>Kin</i>.

82
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,710
Have I ever declined you a favor?

83
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,330
I listened to your boyfriend problems and kept your company when you checked your pregnancy test.

84
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,380
I even helped you move this sofa.

85
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,670
Hey, I helped you move YOUR things, too.

86
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,330
I also looked for a haircut model for you.

87
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,290
WHO took you to the hospital when you had a fever?

88
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,750
WHO taught you how to hit a baseball?

89
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,340
When a baseball came flying at you, I caught it for you.

90
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,940
But you did those things of on your own accord.

91
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,090
I beg of you, Kin.

92
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,660
I don't have anyone else to ask this kind of silly favor.  So  please.

93
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,490
Okay!

94
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,360
Thank you. I owe you one.

95
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,550
Hey, by the way, where are the coffee beans?

96
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,460
If you don't see any there, then I don't have any.

97
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,300
Go buy some.

98
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,760
Forget it. I'll make some at home.

99
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,920
Then, I'm coming, too.

100
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,760
I don't have any coffee to serve you.

101
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,540
What did you say?

102
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,420
Besides, are you going out dressed like that?

103
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,260
It's right next door.

104
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,970
You should act more feminine. At least wash your face, will you?

105
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,570
I won't since it's my day off. What nonsense.

106
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,460
You should wash your face even on your days off.

107
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,540
Nothing will happen if I don't wash my face just one day.

108
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,880
- See ya!
- Wait. Why did you close the door on me?

109
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,290
<i>On my days off, I don't wash my face or go out.</i>

110
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,590
<i>Chiyoko, it's me. Open up.</i>

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Hi.

112
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,380
Did something happen?

113
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,360
I was dumped.

114
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,710
Tachibana?

115
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,500
<i>Choko-chan, I adore you like a younger sister.</i>

116
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,790
<i>But, between you and I, there's too much of an age difference.</i>

117
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,880
<i>And we are not suited to be lovers.</i>

118
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,010
Perhaps, I am destined not to be together with anyone.

119
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,540
What is so good about him?

120
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,170
Everything.

121
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,840
Whatever.

122
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,680
During middle school, I grew really tall.

123
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,170
Boys teased me, and

124
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,630
girls were afraid of me.

125
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,210
That's when I met Rintaro-san.

126
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,750
I had been super gloomy then,

127
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,280
but he made me laugh with his stupid jokes.

128
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,670
He told me I looked pretty when I smiled.

129
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,010
How corny.

130
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:34,580
He was much better than you who had neglected me because you didn't know how to deal with me.

131
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,640
You're taking it to heart.

132
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,340
How lame.

133
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,210
Meanie.

134
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,860
Hey, stop it. Stop.

135
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,970
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Ow.

137
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,960
Okay then.

138
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,550
Mother-in-law, what are you doing?

139
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,330
Oh. I need you to connect this.

140
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,090
I was going to play a game, but I don't know where this goes.

141
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,070
Can you help me?

142
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,130
Oh my, you are dressing awfully young.

143
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,680
You think so?

144
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,090
I oppose the idea.

145
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,750
Mothers should stay home until the children are grown.

146
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,500
But we still have to pay our mortgage for more than 20 years.

147
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,210
Earnings from a part time job aren't going to be much.

148
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,440
Oh, here we go.

149
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,250
I'm sorry, but I'm leaving now.

150
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,320
Young people these days...

151
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,160
Don't know how to restrain their own greed.

152
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,020
Push the circle button.

153
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,410
Hair color is purple. Okay, this is it!

154
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,460
Whose fault is it that I'm working part time?

155
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,520
If she wan't staying with us, I would stay home.

156
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,990
But, the sound of heels

157
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,540
is so pleasant.

158
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,130
<i>You've been a housewife for 13 years?</i>

159
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,870
<i>Yes.</i>

160
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,700
<i>During that time, have you had a part time job?</i>

161
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,040
<i>I haven't.</i>

162
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,650
<i>Then, you don't have any experience working in this industry?</i>

163
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,860
I don't.

164
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,160
But, the ad said that  inexperienced people were welcome.

165
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,910
Is that so?

166
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,980
And you don't have any certifications.

167
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,880
I have 3rd grade proficiency in English.

168
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,650
I understand.

169
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,840
I'll be in touch.

170
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,090
What? Is it over already?

171
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,740
Yes, it's fine.

172
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,950
Thank you for taking your time to come today.

173
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,570
Thank you very much.

174
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,020
Tada.

175
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,930
What? Is this for me?

176
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,170
My parents own a boutique.

177
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,250
I don't know what she would say if you don't dress properly.

178
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,610
If I left it to you, you would probably dress like you were going job hunting.

179
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,390
Sorry, I don't have good taste in clothes.

180
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,580
These are the shoes.

181
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,730
Shoes, too?

182
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,080
Wow, what are these? They are like Cinderella's glass slippers.

183
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,250
I have always wanted to wear shoes like these at least once.

184
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,770
You are too far from being Cinderella.

185
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,160
Since I was a child, I have liked Cinderella's story.

186
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,880
I admired Cinderella,

187
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,880
so I made glass slippers when I was an elementary student... or was it middle school.

188
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,090
Glass slippers?

189
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,650
But it wasn't real glass.

190
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,940
I cut out plastic bottles and taped them,

191
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,500
and I squeezed my feet in them.

192
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,170
But, I cut my feet in multiple places

193
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,840
and bled all over.

194
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,220
You've been an idiot since you were young.

195
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,990
Who has?

196
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,660
Anyway, wear these when you come.

197
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,080
Also watch this, too.

198
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,430
What is that? A porn?

199
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,960
Of course not! It teaches you proper table manners.

200
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,810
Table manners?

201
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,220
My parents like Western dishes.

202
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,460
I bet she will choose a hotel restaurant for dinner.

203
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,740
So, make sure to learn the manners.

204
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,720
Why do I have to do such things?

205
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,940
In-exchange, you can keep all these.

206
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,110
These shoes, too?

207
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,270
Well then, I am counting on you.

208
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,560
Roger, roger. You can count on me.

209
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,270
See ya.

210
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,790
Okay.

211
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,770
How beautiful.

212
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,590
Will I be able to walk in high heels?

213
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,260
I should practice.

<i>I understand.</i>

217
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,530
No one will hire me since I have no experience.

218
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,960
Then, they shouldn't write  "inexperienced people are welcome" to begin with.

219
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,340
The doctor I talked to last was especially rude.

- You are too naive.
- What?

221
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:41,220
Generally speaking, what company is going to hire a person who's been a housewife all this time?

222
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,740
It's not easy becoming a member of the working society.

- I like it. Great.
- Thank you.

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,320
Hey, where are we going for tomorrow's girls' night out?

238
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,280
I can't make up my mind.

239
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,440
How about bouldering?

240
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Bouldering? What's that?

241
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,620
It's rock climbing.

242
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,440
I've done it before.

243
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,570
The next day, my entire body was sore.

244
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,190
Let's not, since it's too tiring.

245
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,560
Let's not talk like old women.

246
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,730
Okay, okay.

247
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,520
It's from Miki.

248
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,240
She bombed all her interviews.

249
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,580
Oh dear.

250
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,750
We have to cheer up Miki.

251
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,080
I agree.

<i>Welcome.</i>

254
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,110
Thank you for welcoming us.

255
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,930
Why are we here?
<i>(They are at a host club.)</i>

256
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,160
To cheer up Miki, of course.

257
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,270
I hope she does.

258
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,060
<i>Right this way.</i>

259
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,200
Oh. Okay let's go.

260
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,600
<i>Good evening.</i>

261
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,070
- I am Masaki.
- I am Shinichiro.

262
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,150
- May we join you?
- May we join you?

263
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,400
They speak in sync.

264
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,150
Please, have a seat.

265
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,900
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

266
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,440
They spoke in sync, right?

267
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,170
This is their first time here.

268
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,450
Don't mind me. Please entertain them. Their names are Sakura and Miki.

269
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,250
I understand.

270
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,580
Sakura-sama and Miki-sama, right?

271
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,660
I am Masaki.

272
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,170
A-ah, thank you.

273
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,210
Sakura-sama, what would you like to drink?

274
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,410
First of all, can you call me without "sama"?

275
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,160
Certainly.

276
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,180
Can I have a whiskey on the rocks?

277
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,360
On the rocks.

278
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,480
Me, too.

279
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,160
Can I have a whiskey with water?

280
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,090
Certainly.

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,580
<i>Happy birthday, Yuki-chan.</i>

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,650
<i>Welcome.</i>

283
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,330
<i>- Welcome.
- Welcome!</i>

284
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,320
Oh, good evening!

285
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,540
Oh, hello.

286
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,730
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

287
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,450
It's rare to see you  here in the evening.

288
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,770
My wife went out, so I decided to enjoy a night out, too.

289
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,130
How adorable! You came here for a night out?

290
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,110
That's true. I couldn't think of anywhere else but here.

291
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,040
I'm glad you thought of us.

292
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,090
- Te-chan, draft beer.
- Okay.

293
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,110
I'll have an orange juice.

294
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,080
Sure thing.

295
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,820
Where did your wife go?

296
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,140
She went out for a girls' night out, so who knows where she is at.

297
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,850
Girls' night out, huh?

298
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,030
I wonder who came up with the term.

299
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,850
Don't you think women have started going out drinking without hesitation ever since the term was created?

300
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,010
I do.  I certainly do.

301
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,170
My wife is a typical one.

302
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,510
Besides, it is a bunch of women who are "not girls" going on a "girls' night out."

303
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,610
It just makes me laugh.

304
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,640
I totally agree with you.

305
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,130
But nowadays with girls' night outs, they don't just
go out and drink.

306
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,750
- What do you mean?
- There are things called "trial lessons."

307
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,900
To improve themselves, they try things like pottery and horseback riding.

308
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,370
Or to relieve stress,

309
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,470
they take day trips to the hot springs, or the spa.

310
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,190
They even go to host clubs.

311
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,160
Host clubs?

312
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,240
Just like how men went to saunas and clubs during the bubbled economy period.

313
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,720
That means females are becoming more like men.

314
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,440
That's why my wife is insisting on getting a part time job.

315
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,560
If there are hosts with them, then it's not a <i>girls'</i> night out.

316
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,500
What if there were brothels for ladies and they became popular?

317
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,660
My wife going to a brothel?

318
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,060
It's the end of the world.

319
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,560
<i>All right!</i>

320
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,180
<i>Okay, we would like to</i>

321
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,300
<i>hear few words from the person</i>

322
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,850
<i>who bought this wonderful champagne.</i>

323
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,600
<i>Three, two, one, zero.</i>

324
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,290
Hm?

325
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,560
Thank me!

326
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,980
<i>Ready? Tonight,</i>

327
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,070

<i>thank to those princesses.</i>

329
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,780
<i>To show our appreciation,</i>

330
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,010
<i>say "thank you for the drinks."</i>

331
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,820
<i>Thank you!</i>

332
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,590
<i>Thank you for the beautiful champagne.</i>

333
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,420
<i>Thank you!</i>

334
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,820
Thank you for the drinks.

335
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,250
<i>Thank you.</i>

336
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,710
Ah, wait. We are paying for the drinks, right?

337
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,530
Yes, that's right.

338
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,080
The person who is paying for the drinks
can drink only one glass.

339
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,140
What kind of system is this?

340
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,640
What?

341
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,560
Welcome back.

342
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Thanks.

343
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,450
Shima-san, it's been a long time.

344
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,340
Yeah.

345
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,840
Why don't we go somewhere after this?

346

<i>You are only hurting yourself.</i>

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,180
Sure.

349
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,570
Who came up with "Champagne Call"?

350
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,160
I wonder who...

351
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,140
You wonder?

352
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,870
Excuse me.

353
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,220
May I join you?

354
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,940
Well... err...

355
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,900
Nice to meet you. I'm Masaomi.

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,180
Hello.

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,580
May I ask your name?

358
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,910
I'm Miki.

359
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,950
Miki-san... what a beautiful name.

360
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,670
I'm sorry. Is this your first time?

361
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,770
Yes.

362
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,360
Then, let's try a psychological test to set you at ease.

363
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,790
What?

364
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,090
If you were vegetable, what would you be?

365
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,210
Cucumber, tomato, cabbage or pumpkin.

366
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,330
Pumpkin, I guess.

367
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,880
Pumpkin.

368
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,960
Your stress is  caused by a fear for the future.

369
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,740
Haven't you found yourself giving up on things you newly started because you thought you couldn't do it?

370
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:05,550
Finding something you feel confident of
will lead you to success.

371
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,350
What do you think? Is it correct?

372
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,980
Miki-san, what's wrong?

373
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,470
Hey, Miki. Why did you make her cry?

374
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,040
I didn't do anything.

375
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,830
Are you alright?

376
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,580
Miki? What's wrong? You are not feeling well?

377
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,460
I'm sorry. I'm leaving first.

378
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,890
- What?
- Wait, Miki.

379
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm leaving, too.

380
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,400
- Sakura-san?
- What did you do to her?

381
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,050
<i>Miki!</i>

382
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,450
Check, please.

383
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,330
Certainly.

384
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,780
Idiot!

00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:44,240
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by

386
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,850
<i>Welcome.</i>

387
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

388
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,310
Here.

389
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,320
Beer, please.

390
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,070
Got it.

391
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,260
You're Ohgami-san, right?

392
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,600
Your real name.

393
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,130
I saw it in the newspaper.

394
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,850
Ah, but normally, I use Saeki.

395
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,680
Why is that?

396
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,140
My name was originally Ohgami, but

397
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,300
my parents got a divorce, and my name became Saeki, my mom's maiden name.

398
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,820
After that, it went back to Ohgami.

399
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,540
But, I didn't want to got through the trouble
of explain it to my friends,

400
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,340
so I decided to go by Saeki.

401
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,450
I didn't know there was such a complicated background.

402
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,460
Sorry for asking.

403
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,450
No worries.

404
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,810
While I am at it, can I ask one more thing?

405
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,720
About Choko-chan.  What is your relationship with Ohgami Chiyoko-san?

406
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,000
Chiyoko is my step-sister.

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,010
Does she  (Sakura) know that?

408
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,760
Do I need to tell her?

409
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,490
Chiyoko-san is our customer.

410
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,440
I'm her stylist, but

411
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,460
she's also an important customer to her (Sakura) as well.

412
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,740
If she were to find out that the two of you are siblings,

413
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,510
I'm sure she would be surprised.

414
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:38,600
Besides, since you haven't said anything about it, I wonder if you have a reason to hide it.

415
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,780
I haven't said anything because there's no reason to.

416
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,860
I didn't even know that Chiyoko was going to your salon.

417
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,880
Then it's fine.

418
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,470
I'll tell her if there's an opportunity.

419
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,970
Please do.

420
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,550
<i>Welcome home.</i>

421
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,240
I'm home.

422
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,060
Have you been looking for a job until this late?

423
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,940
Of course not.

424
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,240
A mother coming home smelling like alcohol and smoke.

425
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,320
I'm sure you want a job so that you can have
your own money but

426
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,400
don't overdo it, or else, your family life might get ruined.

427
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,420
I know that.

428
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,260
Good night.

429
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,740
Good evening.

430
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,680
<i>Welcome.</i>

431
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,900
Thank you for waiting.

432
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,490
Were you two drinking together?

433
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,870
No, not really.

434
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,040
Did you have fun at the host club?

435
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,360
Not at all.

436
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,270
Host club?

437
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,790
Since Miki was a bit depressed, Shima-nee planned it,

438
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,390
but Miki wasn't happy at all.

439
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,070
There are people who enjoy places like that

440
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,060
and people who don't.

441
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,610
That's right.

442
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,800
I'm glad Sakura-san didn't like it.

443
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,580
Of course not.  I won't possibly like it

444
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,320
because I have you.

445
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,390
Hi there.

446
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,860
Should we go over there?

447
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,180
- Sure.
- I'll have a beer, too.

448
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,390
Sure.  A beer.

449
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,020
Yes.

450
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,320
Excuse me.

451
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,250
<i>Here you go.</i>

452
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,560
Thank you.  Wow, 'ladies first.' So happy.

453
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,760
I can't stay overnight, but can I come over for a bit?

454
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,100
Of course.

455
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,890
Thank you.

456
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,150
Wait. Oh my.

457
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,350
<i>Do you need a check?</i>

458
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,950
- Yeah.
<i>- Wait a second.</i>

459
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,080
Not the ear...

460
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,180
<i>I'm not.</i>

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,320
Eh?

465
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,790
Gotta stop.  No sex.

466
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,330

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,650
W-What?

468
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,970
Shima-san?

469
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,910
No more.  No more.

470
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,450
<i>What?</i>

471
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,860
My face when I'm kissing...

472
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,860
That was close.

473
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,990
That hurts.

474
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,230
Eh?

475
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,040
It hurts.

476
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,590
But I haven't...

477
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,130
It hurts.  It really hurts.

478
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:03,480
Ouch, ouch, ouch..... My tooth hurts.

479
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,420
It's down to the nerves.

480
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
I'll give you some local anesthesia.

481
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,170
Yes.

482
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,590
If it hurts, just raise your hand.

483
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,750
Yes.

<i>I'm made to think that being healthy is the most important thing.</i>

485
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,230

486
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,110
I'm fine.

487
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,660
Oh.

Yes.

492
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,930
Have some of these.

493
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,280

Hiroto won at the district competition for BMX.

496
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,440
You're still doing that nonsensical stuff?

497
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,550
You are an adult now.

498
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,340
You need to think seriously about your future.

499
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,200
Why don't you come work at my company?

500
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,880
May I think about it for a while?

501
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,570
Ah, yeah, of course.

502
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,720

Hello.  Nice to meet you.  I'm Tohyama Sakura.

508
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,930
Tohyama Sakura... you mean, like that Tohyama Kin-san?

509
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,600
I get that a lot.

510
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,690
Wow a great name.  Your parents have a good taste.

511
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,670
Sorry for the late introduction.  My name is Tachibana Mitsuko.

512
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,750
Thank you for taking care of Rintaro.

513
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,890
You have a good taste in clothes as well.

514
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,690
I'm so hungry.  Let's go.

515
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,470
Kin-san... She mentioned it first thing, huh.

516
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,770
Like mother like son...

517
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,260
We're here.

518
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,710
This isn't a restaurant.

519
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,830
Oh, shoot.  I didn't expect this.

520
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,870
<i>Welcome.</i>

521
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,630
<i>I got a reservation.  My name is Tachibana.</i>

<i>We were waiting for you.</i>

523
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,390
<i>Please, this way.</i>

524
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,070
Hurry up.

525
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,640
Wow, this is so pretty.

526
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,760
Sakura-san.

527
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,110
Yes.  Sorry.

528
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,010
There is a run in your stocking.

529
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,260
Eh?  Oh.  When did that...

530
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,220
Do you have a spare?

531
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,210
No.

532
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,880
Where is your restroom?

533
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,430
Over there in the end.

534
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,910
Here you go.  Go change into this.

535
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,730
I can borrow this?

536
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,350
You don't have to return it.  Just go.

537
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,570
Thank you so much.

538
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,950
We'll be in the room.

539
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,990
Yes.

540
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,000
Here. Let's toast.

541
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,290
Cheers.

542
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,270
Nice to meet you.

543
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,990
Oh, it's dripping.

544
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,310
What are you doing?  Here...

545
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,860
I was wondering why I didn't feel the bubbles.

546
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,750
It's the anesthesia.

547
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,160
- Dentist?
- It's local anesthesia for my lips.

548
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,910
I guess it hasn't worn off.

549
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,090
Why didn't you notice it until you had a drink?

550
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,320
I was surprised.

551
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,590
Are you okay?  Can you eat?

552
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,810
Of course I can eat.

553
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,620
- I can eat.
- Really?

554
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,920
Then, let's eat.

555
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,520
Yes.

556
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,670
Thank you for the meal.

557
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:55,280
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Last Cinderella team @Viki.</i>

558
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,580
Oh.  You dripped some soy sauce.

559
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,310
What are you doing?

560
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,240
Seriously...

561
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,990
I'm sorry.

562
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:27,140
Are you going to continue working as a stylist
even after you get married?

563
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,310
Get married...?

564
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,730
Mom, we don't need to talk about that yet.

565
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,980
This is important.

566
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,730
I want you to take over my company.

567
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,830
But if you say no, I need to ask my daugther-in-law.

568
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,770
- It's still too soon.
- Really?

569
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,230
Oh... my bowl...

570
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,140
Will you stop it.

571
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,770
It (the lid) was stuck, you know.

572
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,380
You push it before you take it off.

573
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,040
Push what?

574
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,970
Never mind.

575
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,660
This tastes so good.

576
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,580
Sakura-san?

577
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,920
Yes?

578
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,910
Thank you for making time for me today.

579
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,150
This luncheon was really delightful.

580
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,760
Well, me too.  It has been a pleasure

581
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,170
meeting you.  Thank you very much.

582
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,250
Let's go to the next place.

583
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,650
What do you mean next?

584
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,490
After you're full, it's time for karaoke. It's given.

585
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,230
It's given...?  Oh man...

586
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,790
It can't be helped.

587
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,030
Ouch...

588
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,970
What?

589
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,330
My legs...  legs...

590
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,780
- Ha?
- They fell asleep.

591
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,220
Oh no...

592
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,550
My goodness, you are so funny.

593
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:56,500
It's been so long since I laughed this much.

594
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,890
Sakura-san... you are the best.

595
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,030
I like you.

596
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,990
Are you serious?

597
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:07,370
You eat and drink well. That's nice.

598
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,100
It's been a while since saw someone eat fish that gracefully.

599
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,480
I was impressed.

600
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:21,440
In the past, I was also single minded and clumsy like you.

601
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,310
I didn't know any manners at all.

602
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,540
So, you don't need to rush.

603
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,620
Just move forward at your own pace.

604
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,690
No need to rush into marriage either.

605
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,700
But, please make sure I get to see my grandchild's face.

606
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,810
And, you guys expand my company together.

607
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,750
Ok let's go.

608
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,310
She's a great mom.

609
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,890
Hurry up and get married for her.

610
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,190
I don't need to hear that from you.

611
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,490
Hurry up and get up.

612
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,540
Ouch...  My legs...

613
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,290
Ouch... that hurts.

614
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,690
Let's go...

615
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,660
Are you really going to work at Dad's company?

616
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,490
Working part time late at night is really tough.

617
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,880
Honestly speaking, it is really tiring to go work after a date.

618
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:19,290
You're getting serious about Sakura-san?

619
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,170
You were saying you weren't interested.

620
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,230
Since when do you like older women?

621
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:35,020
Could it be, you're looking for someone
like your mom in heaven?

622
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,730
Chiyoko...

623
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,140
I have a favor to ask.

624
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,010
What is it?

625
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,160
About the fact that I approached Sakura-san at your request,

626
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,930
please keep quiet, if possible.

627
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,380
Chiyoko?

628
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,120
Why does everyone like her?

629
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,110
What's so great about her?

630
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,510
Sorry.

631
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,430
Ouch.  Oh, I'm sorry.

632
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,320
- What are you...
- Ouch...

633
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,720
Oh...

634
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,740
<i>Are you okay?</i>

635
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,310
Oh well.

636
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,460
I wonder if Choko-san misunderstood.

637
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,420
Neither you or I made excuses, so

638
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,230
I'm sure she was convinced (about what she saw).

639
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,490
Oh no.  What do we do?

640
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,790
I'll clear up the misunderstanding.

641
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,140
Ok.  Thanks.

642
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,460
Yay!

643
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,290
I'm tired.  Sakura-san, you sing next.

644
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,940
Yes, I got it.

645
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,310
Before that, can I say something?

646
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,520
Um?

647
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,770
Sorry.

648
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:44,770
Actually, I'm not really Tachibana-san's girlfriend.

649
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,490
Sorry to deceive you.

650
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,460
But, I agreed to pretend to be his girlfriend

651
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,000
because, just like him, I haven't been ready for marriage.

652
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,360
<i>I know that I am way past marriageable age.</i>

653
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,250
<i>I also know that my parents are worried.  But,</i>

654
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,690
when the time comes,

655
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:08,870
I am sure we will find our own life partners.

656
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:13,520
Given our age, I know how sad and difficult

657
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,340
it is to live alone.

658
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,250
So, would it be possible for you to

659
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,610
patiently watch over us until that time comes?

660
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,900
I'm sorry.

661
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,540
I like you even more.

662
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:46,170
But, sorry. I 've known that you weren't his girlfriend all along.

663
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,010
What?

664
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:52,160
There is no way Rintaro would choose someone like you.

665
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,520
Because I have been spirited and working hard,

666
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,610
he has been lonely since he was little.

667
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:04,050
Since he was young, he's always liked women the complete opposite of you and I.

668
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,870
He likes modest, graceful and feminine type of girls.

669
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,350
Right, Rintaro?

670
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,160
You really know him well.

671
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,380
<i>But I won't give up.</i>

672
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,210
<i>I'll make sure you get married</i>

673
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,090
and succeed my company.

674
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,770
If you don't care for having arranged dates,

675
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,950
find a girlfriend quickly and get married.

676
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,360
That's right. You do that.

677
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,580
Sakura-san, enter the next song.

678
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,760
Okay, right away.

679
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,220
You, traitor!

680
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,380
She would've found out eventually, even If I didn't tell her.

681
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,410
Judas.
<i>(Judas Iscariot - disciple of Jesus Christ)</i>

682
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,110
- What?
- Lu Bu.
<i> (a warlord who live in Eastern Han dynasty, China)</i>

683
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,320
Speak Japanese.

684
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,050
You too, Brutus?

685
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,660
Oh, it's Akina-chan. <i>(Nakamori Akina: singer) </i>

686
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,050
Sakura-san, you and I are alike. I prefer Akina and Ma-cchi.
<i>(They are both famous singers)</i>

687
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,520
I like Toshi-chan and Seiko better.

688
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,760
Char Aznable.
<i>(a fictional character from the Gundam)</i>

689
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:02,570
♪ Get up, get up, get up, get up, burning love ♪

690
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,830
I wil let you know.

691
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,820
I knew it was you.

692
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,060
Wait, Miki-san.

693
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,310
Who are you?

694
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,740
I'm  Masaomi.

695
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,750
I met you at the host club the other day. You see?

696
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,740
Ah, it's you, from the club.

697
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,410
Good. You remembered me.

698
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,110
Are you going shopping, Miki-san?

699
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,270
No. I had some errands to do.

700
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,120
Then, shall we go for tea?

701
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,430
No thanks.

702
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,040
Oh, even <i>tachinomi</i> is okay.
<i>(Drink without sitting)</i>

703
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,760
What?

704
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,580
Just 10 minutes.

705
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,090
But...

706
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,770
Please.

707
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,620
Okay then... just for a bit.

708
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,100
Wow, so you still have mortgage?

709
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,960
Of course, I do.

710
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,480
I still have 25 years to pay.

711
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,850
That's a long time, isn't it?

712
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,780
That is why I'm looking for a part time job.

713
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,550
Did you find a good job?

714
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,400
Not at all.

715
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,130
Nobody wants to hire an inexperienced person.

716
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,740
I don't have any qualifications.

717
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,570
I've aged without accomplishing anything.

718
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:55,840
I'm just a useless housewife.

719
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,160
I'm sorry. I've said too much.

720
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,670
Why don't we leave now?

721
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,680
That's because you are beautiful.

722
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,630
If they hire a beautiful part timer,

723
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,830
female workers will be jealous.

724
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,470
So they hire normal looking ones over beautiful ladies.

725
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,810
Are you consoling me?

726
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,240
Thank you.

727
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,630
Right! Why don't you work for me?

728
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,810
- What?
- Actually, I personally buy and sell stocks.

729
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:36,330
But I can't oversee the market trends all the time,
since I work as a host.

730
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:40,190
So, during the times that I can't, can you monitor the trends?

731
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,050
How can I possibly do that?

732
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,010
I know nothing about the stock market.

733
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,880
I don't know much about computers, either.

734
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,710
Hard working hands.

735
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,090
Makes me want to protect you.

736
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,760
I can teach you about stocks and computers.

737
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,700
You can work until you find a part time job.

738
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,260
How about 2,000 yen (about $20) per hour?

739
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,680
You can learn about stocks and computers. It's like killing two birds with one stone.

740
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,400
Why didn't you come out the other day?

741
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,540
What are you trying to hide from her?

742
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,570
What do you want to know?

743
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,090
The thing you are hiding.

744
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,090
If you date Chiyoko,

745
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:04,350
everything will be resolved.

746
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,000
What do you mean?

747
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,620
Chiyoko is jealous of Sakura-san.

748
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:16,410
Because you and Sakura-san are close.

749
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,530
<i>I almost felt jealous, too.</i>

750
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,170
No way... The reason you approached her is...

751
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,370
Chiyoko is hurt because you rejected her.

752
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,740
<i>Who knows what she'll do next?</i>

753
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,100
Don't you dare tell her about this.

754
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,670
Don't let her find out no matter what.

755
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,660
Before she finds out, break up like normal couples do.

756
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,500
You got it?

757
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,790
I don't take orders from you.

758
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:45,450
Besides, what is your relationship with Sakura-san?

759
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,920
I am her co-worker.

760
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,440
You are awfully kind for a co-worker.

761
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,610
If you want to protect Sakura-san,

762
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:06,130
please... take a good care of Chiyoko.

766
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,360
Go ahead.

767
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,710
It's fine. You first, Sakura-san.

768
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:18,200
To tell you the truth, I was hiding something from you.

769
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,990
What is it?

770
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,880
The other day, I met Tachibana's mother.

771
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,070
I pretended to be his girlfriend.

772
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:35,280
I'm sorry. You told me not to hang out with him. I'm so sorry.

773
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,110
Actually, his mother was pushing him to meet someone for an arranged marriage.

774
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,450
Since he's helped me on many occasions,

775
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,380
I wanted to repay him a little.

776
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,600
I know it sounds like a lame excuse. I'm sorry.

777
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,610
No.

778
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,730
Actually I have something to apologize for.

779
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,010
