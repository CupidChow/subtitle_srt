00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,160
What an annoying woman.

177
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,870
Are you talking about me?

178
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,300
No.

179
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,770
<i>Raise your hips slowly.</i>

180
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,790
And hold this pose.

181
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:37,160
Next, as you breathe out, push your spine onto the mat.

182
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,520
How was it?

183
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,690
What?

184
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,760
Didn't you do it for the first time in 10 years? Did it hurt?

185
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,460
I don't remember.

186
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,780
What?

187
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,640
Over there. Focus on your breathing.

188
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,670
Why don't you remember?

189
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,620
I was drunk.

190
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,650
What a waste! Do it while you're sober next time.

191
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,930
There is no next time.

192
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,980
Next we'll roll like a ball.

193
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,840
You don't know that.

194
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,310
I do. He is 24, you know.

195
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:22,500
- That means... If his mom gave birth at 20... she would be 44.
- That's right...

196
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:30,990
So if I had a child when I was 20, he or she would be 19 now.

197
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,210
I feel dizzy just thinking about it.

198
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,190
Hey. Focus on what you are doing.

199
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,710
If we had had children when we were 20,

200
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,620
my child would be 19,

201
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,310
and Shima-nee's child would be 24.

202
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,160
What are you talking about?

203
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,320
Come on, straighten your back!

204
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,240
<i>Manager,</i>

205
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,830
<i>are you the type who doesn't want children?</i>

206
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,640
Of course. I definitely want to have children.

207
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,250
That's surprising.

208
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,520
It would be lonely without them when I get old.

209
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,990
You think so?

210
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,050
You laugh now, taking for granted that you are young now, but

211
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,330
you'll get old as well someday.

212
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,790
I don't want to get married just because of that though.

213
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,520
You're full of contradictions!

214
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,000
I wonder if Sakura-san is the type who wants children.

215
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,110
She is out of the question.  She doesn't even have a man.

216
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,700
She's like a guy anyway.  She has to start from there.

217
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,680
Here.  Ok.

218
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,480
<i>Sakura,  you're bowlegged.</i>

219
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,370
Ah.

220
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,970
But to have done it after 10 years is a step forward.

221
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,440
Open?  Oh, the "tunnel."

222
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,010
At least, it must have stopped you from getting masculinized.

223
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,150
That's right.  I'm sure it activated the hormones.

224
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,260
It doesn't feel any different.  What's up with you, Shima-nee?

225
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,900
About that guy you hit on at the hotel.

226
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,610
He hasn't called.  I'm waiting for it though.

227
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,790
It's rare to see you wait!

228
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,690
Was he that good?

229
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,890
He's kind of innocent and cute.

230
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,110
He seems like he's never had an affair.

231
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,450
- Hey, he's married?
- Yeah.

232
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,450
What do you mean "yeah."  You can't have an affair now.

233
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,860
I know.  I don't intent to get too involved.

234
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,080
Here he is...

235
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,830
<i>I wonder if I should have an affair, too.</i>

236
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,530
I've heard this from friends... do you know about ED  (Erectile Dysfunction) with just the wives?

237
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,610
What's that?

238
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,050
Men who can do it with other women but not with their wives.

239
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,690
I think my husband has that.

240
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,930
What are you talking about? You're going through <i>kentai-ki.</i>
(A couple, bored with each other, drifts away from each other.)

241
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,530
I hope so.

242
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,890
Hello?

243
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,090
I'm the guy from the hotel the other day.

244
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,540
You finally called me.

245
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,870
I'm glad it's you. I was worried I'd call the wrong number.

246
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,440
Are you free right now?

247
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,790
I am.

248
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,670
I was wondering if you'd like to get lunch together.

249
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,480
I'm sorry. I'm actually at work now,
but how about tomorrow night?

250
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,740
Night?

251
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,210
If it's inconvenient...

252
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,050
It's fine. It's fine.

253
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:17,470
- I'll wait for you in the same room as before.
- Yes.

254
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,180
If you know of a good dry cleaners, would you tell me?

255
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,120
When I used the one nearby, it wasn't so good.

256
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,980
I'll ask my mom.

257
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,150
Thanks. You're a great help.

258
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,470
<i>Did you ask the assistant manager?</i>

259
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,200
<i>Do you think she knows of a good dry cleaner?</i>

260
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,110
She leaves her laundry out for days.

261
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,250
You even know about that when you live
in the same apartment building?

262
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,150
Even if I don't want to see it, I can't help it. Since we are neighbors and all.

263
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,870
<i>I wish she would move out soon.</i>

264
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,320
Achoo!

265
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,570
It's good.

266
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,510
Okay...

267

Good morning.

272
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,080
Sakura-chan, you look prettier than usual.

273
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,950
Really?

274

Did something good happened?

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
No, no.

276
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
Just spill it.

It's nothing.  Here, go get a wash.

281
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,670
Thank you.

282
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,970
Ugh, here we go.

283

What?

285
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,970
Looking at your phone all day.

286
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,160
Do your job seriously.

287
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,300
I am.

288

What?

290
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,590
On your head.

291
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,250
So, you decided to go out with that kid?

292
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:31,780
We're not dating, but he sends me tens of texts every day.

293
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,450
Tens of texts?

294
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,290
He has way too much free time.

295
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,480

Not really.  I think I'm just nervous.

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,550
It's my first time doing something like this.

317
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,680
Especially with someone as attractive as you.

318
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,510

319
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,990

Not really.

321
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,540
You bought this for me.

322
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,820
In Hawaii, on our honeymoon.

323
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,710
Really?  I don't remember.

324
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,530
Doesn't it bring back memories?

325
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm so tired.

326
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,610
I'm going to take a bath and go to bed.

327
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,840
Hey... your wife is dressed like this, and you don't feel a thing?

328
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,810
Can't you tell it's some sort of sign?

329
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:08,160
How long has it been since we met?  20 years!

330
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,820
Don't you think it's more weird to do it with the same person after 20 years?

331
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,990
You see, we are a normal married couple.

332
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,310
So, don't worry.

333
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,370
I'm going to bed.

334
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,900
Good night.

335
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,260
Don't just talk to them.

336
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,770
And don't just listen either.

337
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,960
In other words, like me-

338
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:53,440
Like me, you need to have communication skills that allow you to read other people's feelings.

339
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,170
She's pretty stubborn.

340
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,780
Even though she's a middle-aged lady.

341
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,960
What are you struggling with?

342
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,800
Hurry up and make her fall for you.

343
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:11,430
I need more funds.

344
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,970
Okay, let me take this.

345
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,940
But why? It's not like she's dating Tachibana.

346
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,360
She's an eyesore.

347
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,540
And I have to get rid of a risk factor.

348
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,420
Risk factor?

349
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,930
You remember the last woman, right?

350
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,930
I wonder how much he was scarred by her.

351
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,390
I don't want him to get hurt like that again.

352
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,010
You are pretty crooked.

353
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,480
Just hurry up and make her fall for you.

354
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,290
Make sure she doesn't get close to Rintaro-san.

355
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,060
Okay.

356
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,900
<i>I'm home. </i>

357
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,190
<i>Welcome back.</i>

358
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:59,370
<i>Chiyo-chan, your father's going on a business trip
to London today...</i>

359
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,250
You're here.

360
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,030
Hello.

361
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,990
<i>Will you have dinner with us?</i>

362
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,870
I was just about to leave, actually.

363
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,010
- Bye.
<i>- Okay.</i>

364
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,430
You're here.

365
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,680
You're still doing the worthless thing?

366
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,760
You don't have to go home at the same time as me.

367
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,440
Right back at you. Why don't you work more dilligently?

368
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,690
- I am.
- No you're not.

369
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,780
I'm saying I am.

370
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,780
Today...

371
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,090
Hiroto-kun.

372
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,220
Hey. Suddenly I wanted to see you.

373
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,220
What?

374
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,890
- I'll be leaving.
- Good work today.

375
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,670
He's the same guy as before, right? Is he the manager?

376
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,840
Yeah...

377
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,890
Really? He's pretty cool.

378
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,230
He has a terrible personality.

379
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,900
Are you hungry?

380
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:01,930
I actually have plans with a friend today.

381
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,760
I see.

382
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,790
It's fine then.

383
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,290
At least I got to see your face.

384
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,720
Well then, see you later.

385
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:33,110
But, we could go for a beer.

386
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,570
Don't cry, Miki.

387
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,490
It's over. We might as well get divorced.

388
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,930
What are you saying?

389
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:56,140
It's the same as if he said that he could no longer do it with me.

390
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:02,540
I'm not saying I have to have it all the time like you, but...

391
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,400
I can't stand it if I won't do it the rest of my life.

392
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,520
I don't have to have it all the time, though...

393
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,320
How about you?

394
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,260
How's it going with the guy?

395
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,650
We weren't able to do it again.

396
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,500
Why not?

397
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,130
He was too nervous.

398
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,090
But that made it even hotter.

399
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,570
The best part of sex is the foreplay.

400
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,650
You want it, but you can't have it.That sensation is so frustrating, but great.

401
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,280
It's like prolonged foreplay.

402
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,680
Hmm...

403
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,070
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be saying things like this
when you're worried.

404
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:54,070
No, after listening to your indecent talk, I feel somewhat better.

405
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,910
Really?

406
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,750
I'm glad.

407
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:01,340
As long as I just think of it as prolonged foreplay...
It's not so bad!

408
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,020
That's right!

409
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,560
Miki-chan, I love that you get over things really fast!

410
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,350
But what if it ends with just foreplay?

411
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,130
Stop that!

412
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:15,140
- Let's drink!
- Let's drink.

413
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,840
That must be Sakura.

414
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,210
I'm coming!

415
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,160
What's this?

416
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,570
What do you mean, "What's this?"?

417
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,980
What are these?

418
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,530
Can't you see what they are?

419
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,960
What? You bought them?

420
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,220
Why! It creeps me out.

421
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,530
- Creeps you out? Fine, then. If you don't want them...
- No, no, I do!

422
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:42,300
Hello? What are you doing over there?

423
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,580
Isn't this your first time meeting? This is my senpai
in track and field

424
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,370
and takes care of me as well as Sakura.
She's Hasegawa Shima-san.

425
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,680
Hello.  I'm pleased to meet you.

426
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,730
Likewise.

427
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,900
Look what he got me. It's a first since we got married.

428
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,990
Wow, so beautiful!

429
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,600
Are you cheating on me or something?

430
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,500
What are you talking about?

431
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,880
I guess you wouldn't have anyone to do that with.

432
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,680
- Why don't you get changed? Let's eat.
- Okay.

433
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,230
What the hell is going on?

434
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,700
That's what I would like to know.

435
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,020
Shima-san, let's start dinner.

436
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,030
I'm coming now!

437
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,750
We can't ever let her find out!

438
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,370
I know that!

439
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,160
Do coincidences like this exist?!

440
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,790
This isn't like one of those hidden camera shows, right?

441
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,090
No, how could it be?!

442
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,920
Are these enough appetizers?

443
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,610
Definitely!

444
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,240
I guess there isn't much to talk about if you've just met.

445
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,290
Kou-chan, Shima-san's glass is almost empty!

446
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,960
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's not necessary...

447
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,100
- Oh!
- What?!

448
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,430
Kou-chan, why don't you get a membership at Shima-san's gym?

449
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:09,050
She's a fitness trainer. He's on the brink of
developing metabolic syndrome...

450
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,720
Look at his belly.

451
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,220
Hey, wait, stop that!

452
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,940
It's nothing to be embarrassed about! It's more embarrassing to continue having that kind of belly.

453
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,730
Why don't you ask her about exercises you can do at home?

454
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,170
Yeah.

455
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,220
We haven't done anything yet, so we're okay, right? There's no need to feel guilty, right?

456
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,020
Of course. But why were you at the PTA party?

457
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,180
You said you have a kid, right?

458
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:38,210
I never said that! I only said I knew where the party was just to lure you in.

459
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,600
That means Miki was lying.

460
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,710
Where did those two go?

461
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,090
What are you two doing down there?

462
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,270
- What happened?
- I dropped my ring!

463
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:52,270
Kou-chan, try your best to find it okay? It would be awful if we sucked it up with the vacuum.

464
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,400
I found it!  Is this it?

465
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,980
Yes! That's it!

466
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:03,180
- Thank you so much.
- Thank goodness! Pull yourself together!
Are you already drunk?

467
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,360
Maybe so!

468
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,750
Oh, the phone. It's probably Sakura. Where's it ringing from?

469
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:15,140
I can hear it coming from over here. Why is it over here?

470
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,630
You don't have to worry about Miki. She would never do anything to betray you.

471
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:25,630
So you'd better not either. Let's forget about everything. Erase my number, too.

472
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,080
Sorry, Miki! I think I got tipsy after all.

473
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,700
I'm gonna go home for the night.

474
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,370
Maybe we should've gone to a different place.
It's hard to relax, isn't it?

475
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,040
I actually have something I want to talk to you about.

476
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,300
<i>Hiroto!</i>

477
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,350
Hey!

478
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,910
It's been a while, Hiroto!

479
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,070
You know, you never show up anymore.
What have you been up to?

480
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,720
- Work.
- No way.

481
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,580
- Oh hello.
- Is this your older sister?

482
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,440
<i>Could it be your girlfriend?</i>

483
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,580
I haven't received a yes from her yet, though!

484
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,460
<i>Come on, now!</i>

485
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,650
We don't want to get in your way, so we'll be going now.

486
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,210
- Let's hang out next time.
- Sure!

487
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,000
<i>- See ya!
- Bye!</i>

488
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,910
<i>Seriously?</i>

489
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,140
Wanna leave?

490
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,770
Sure.

491
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,520
You're going to your friend's place, right?

492
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,710
Where is it? I'll walk you there.

493
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,020
Sakura-san?

494
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,760
Are you thinking about what happened a while ago? You can't worry about stuff like that.

495
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,780
I haven't seen them for a while, and I'm not even
that close with them.

496
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,650
I'm sorry.

497
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,910
Huh?

498
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:11,770
I'm 39 years old. I know I haven't told you about my age yet but...

499
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,180
I'm 39 years old. Almost 40.

500
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:20,260
It is natural she mistook me as your older sister. That's the normal reaction...

501
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,560
I'm glad I was mistaken as your sister. If I was mistaken as your mom, I would've had no idea how to react.

502
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,780
But anyway, that's all. Thanks for the beer.

503
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,800
Wait a second...!

504
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,600
What are you doing about your meals?

505
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,240
I'm here almost everyday.

506
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,180
But you're just drinking!

507
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,660
It won't help you to have balanced diet. Maybe it's time for you to get a girlfriend.

508
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,970
Say hi to Shima-nee and your husband for me.

509
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,790
Bye.

510
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,680
<i> Too bad </i>

511
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,040
<i>Timing and subtitles provided by
Last Cinderella Team@viki.com</i>

512
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:47,140
This is pissing me off!

513
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,300
Jeez! Why won't it hit?!

514
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,410
You are not using lower half of your body.

515
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,410
Tachibana! What are you doing here?

516
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,840
You're the one that came after me.

517
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,240
- What?
- It's coming.

518
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,310
What is? Whoa!

519
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,050
You are good.

520
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,200
I've been playing baseball since I was a kid.

521
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,220
I want to hit and feel better, too...

522
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,460
Did the youngster run away from you?

523
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,450
I'm the one that ran away.

524
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,150
It's been so long since I've dated anyone.

525
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,430
I feel like I've forgotten how to have fun.

526
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:42,000
Going out with someone 15 years younger than me is too much to handle in the first place.

527
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,660
I wanted to start with someone I could handle with more ease.

528
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,520
I'm starting to find it tedious.

529
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,990
Maybe I will just be alone for the rest of my life.

530
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,590
Here we go.

531
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,560
Put more weight behind you.

532
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,910
Not like that.

533
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,770
Good. Point your left foot out a bit. Don't tense up.

534
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,600
Relax your muscles. Tuck in your chin.

535
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,300
It's coming. Keep your eye on the ball.

536
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,140
I hit it!

537
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,170
Amazing! I hit it!  I hit it!

538
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,910
Hey, come on, teach me again!

539
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,090
You can do it on your own now.

540
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,670
What? Really?

541
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,990
It's true! I did it!

542
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,510
Wow!

543
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,350
This feels great.

544
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,810
Ah, that felt awesome. That's gonna become a habit.

545
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,690
- Don't go there anymore.
- Why?

546
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,850
Because we'll run into each other again.

547
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,840
Even if we do, I won't talk to you.

548
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,690
What is it? Did he ask for money, just like I said?

549
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,730
He said "Age gap doesn't matter.  Let's date."

550
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,690
I see.

551
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,090
I'm starting to feel like I'm being teased.

552
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:13,810
They say there's no accounting for taste.
Why don't you try it out?

553
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,900
What good would that do?

554
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,040
You'll never know until you try.

555
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,830
- I do know.
- Stop being scared.

556
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,440
I'm not scared.

557
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,910
You're an adult, so stop being scared.

558
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,730
You're used to being hurt by now, right?

559
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:55,760
<i>Full of scars. That's why you get more nervous.</i>

560
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,850
So, you know.

561
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:05,400
I decided to try dating him since I have nothing to lose.

562
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,830
That sounds great! You do have nothing to lose anyway.

563
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,270
Oh, looks like they're home.

564
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,290
<i>Let me know how it goes! Bye!</i>

565
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,010
Bye!

566
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,000
All right!

567
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,140
Welcome home!

568
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,160
She bought this for me.

569
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,960
- Wow, that's great! Good for you!
- I'm thirsty.

570
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,960
There's juice in the fridge.

571
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,300
May I have some, too?

572
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,380
Oka-san!
(mother-in-law)

573
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,250
I'll be staying here for a while.

574
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,470
W-what does that mean?

575
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,820
Well, that's how it is.

576
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,430
Mom? Your room is this way.

577
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,980
Okay.

578
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,100
What's happening?!

579
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,870
Yes!

580
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,850
- All right!
- Wow, Sakura-san! You're good at this.

581
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,790
I am an old arm at this.

582
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,860
You mean 'an old hand'?

583
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,300
Oh? Didn't I say that?

584
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,610
Oops, I made a mistake.

585
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,910
Right into the gutters.

586
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,380
I think you're cheating somehow.

587
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,760
Well, that's because you beat me so badly at bowling.

588
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,020
Cut me some slack!

589
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,780
I don't wanna! I'll win this game while your score remains love.

590
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,170
That's fine. Wait, love?  What does that mean?

591
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,820
Whoa!

592
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:09,960
Yay!

593
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,860
No way!

594
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,650
Here we go!

595
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,330
Ah! No way!

596
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,630
Amazing!

597
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,290
Yay!

598
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,170
- Thanks for waiting.
- Thanks!

599
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:30,750
It's been a while to eat soft-serve.  It's so delicious.

600
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,390
Oh...

601
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,280
Are you okay?

602
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,300
I'm fine.

603
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,400
Thank you.

604
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:52,230
There's some on your nose, too.

605
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,420
You're laughing way too much!

606
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,720
That was so much fun.

607
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:08,550
I bet you're still thinking about that soft-serve episode.

608
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,840
No, I'm not.

609
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,870
Sakura-san? Didn't you have fun?

610
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,550
I had a lot of fun.

611
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,790
I'm glad.

612
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,690
I'm sorry about that!

613
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,450
I'm sorry.

614
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,510
<i>Excuse me.</i>

615
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,720
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine, thank you.

616
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,990
If you'd like, you can have my seat...

617
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,090
Just wait a moment, please.

618
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:45,340
Hey, hey, you, you. I got up from this seat so I could give it to her over there.

619
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,560
Would you take those out?

620
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,080
I'm asking you to take those out. Can you hear me?

621
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,350
I said take them out!!

622
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,970
What the hell are you doing?!

623
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,260
Don't play dumb!

624
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:12,620
There's clearly someone who's having a hard time there. Don't keep sitting as if nothing matters... that's what I am saying...

625
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,090
How annoying.

626
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,330
Hey.

627
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:20,760
If she has hard time riding the bus, she shouldn't ride one.

628
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,300
Give this seat up.

629
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,490
Shut up, old hag!

630
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,750
I am an old hag!

631
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:30,480
I'm so used to be called that.  I'm not even bothered.

632
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:39,160
I don't know how far you are going, but at least stand up for a bit. You're still young, aren't you?

633
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,850
Here, come on, get up, you're young.

634
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,350
Stop that. Don't touch me.

635
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,980
- Not until you get up!
- Let go!

636
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,190
Old geezer!

637
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,160
<i>The seat's free now.</i>

638
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,420
I'm sorry.

639
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,390
For ruining everything.

640
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,460
That's not true.

641
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,430
You weren't wrong back there. You just have to stand tall.

642
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,140
I always overdo things at critical moments.

643
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,240
I might not be able to read the situation...

644
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,570
Or I am really like an old lady...

645
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:43,830
Well, instead of 'old lady,'... he called me an 'old geezer'...

646
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,310
It's kind of depressing.

647
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,030
Oh.

648
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,720
Cherry blossoms. (Sakura)
Stay still.

<i>Please forgive me!</i>

663
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,790
<i>Rintaro-san, do you have feelings for someone?</i>

664
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,740
<i>I do.</i>
