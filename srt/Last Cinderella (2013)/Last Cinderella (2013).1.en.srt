No way... is that for the next customer's shampooing?

64
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,490
Because that customer always smells and sweats alot.

65

Our job exists because of the customers.

By the way, I wonder if the new manager has been appointed.

What, Tachibana! You got a mustache.

87

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,770
8 years? All through the years, you've been working at this location ever since you got hired.

- Until 7 o'clock.
- 7 o'clock?

In the morning.

111
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,350
Are you stupid? We provide service to customers. What kind of idiots would drink until the morning?

112
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,390
I shouldn't smell that bad.

176
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,470
It's been 10 years already?

177
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,880
It's 10 years already.

178
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,590
You've totally returned back to a virgin hey?

179
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,410
It's gonna hurt the next time you do it.

180
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,440
That's....if there is a next time.

181
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,160
Excuse me, is it okay if I take this off?

182
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,350
Ah, I forgot.

183
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,460
Excuse me.

184
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,370
What's wrong? Did you smash a pimple or something?

185
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,090
Or were you shaving your beard and nicked your face?

186
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,280
She is like an old man.

187
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,980
- Eh?
- Sakura?

188
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,500
I was just kidding.

189
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,480
It's not a joke...

190
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,360
It grew....a beard.

191
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,640
Eh?!

192
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,790
Maybe I'm a guy.

193
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,150
It's not uncommon for women to even grow a beard.

194
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,130
Eh? Really?!

195
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:38,860
The causes are fatigue, stress, and also poor lifestyle habits and unhealthy diets.

196
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,680
As a result, your hormonal balance deteriorates and you start displaying male traits.

197
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,050
Could you be referring to oyaji-gal?
(oyaji: old man)

198
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,690
These days they call it oska-joshi or ossan-joshi.

199
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,060
Oska-joshi...
(masculinized woman)

200
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,690
Ossan-joshi...
(old-man-like woman)

201
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,130
I'm doomed!

202
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,550
Wow this is amazing. It feels so good!

203
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,860
I don't want to get out from here.

204
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,580
- Hey Sakura.
- Uhm?

205
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,400
Why don't you try it?

206
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,840
Try what?

207
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,680
Sex.

208
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,050
Sakura, to begin with, you lack effort in femininity.

209
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,200
Even though you're a hairstylist, you're clueless when it comes to your fashion and makeup.

210
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,120
It's obvious you lack any body contact or kissing.

211
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,690
If anyone were to continue such a lifestyle for 10 years, it's obvious that they'd forget that they were a woman.

212
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,970
Then are you saying that women who don't have sex will grow a beard?

213
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,830
No way!

214
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,270
That's not what I meant but...

215
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,990
What should I do...the truth is that we're having a sexless marriage.

216
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,330
Oh no, since when?

217
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,890
It's been almost a year. As soon as I get in bed, he falls asleep as if he were avoiding me.

218
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,650
But I don't want to grow a beard like Sakura, so I'll try to make a move on him tonight.

219
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,680
Yup, that's a good idea.

220
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,450
<i>Sakura, you should learn from her. Japanese women are too subservient in the first place.</i>

221
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,280
<i>But men like that in a woman, don't they?</i>

222
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,950
<i>Yup, they looove it when a woman is normally very subservient but then turns aggressive in bed.</i>

223
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,240
<i>Men watch too many drama like porn I tell ya!</i>

224
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,080
<i>It can't be helped. For starters, men don't understand a single thing about women.</i>

225
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,830
That's right! Men are soooo clueless when it comes to women.

226
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,990
Women know nothing about men!

227
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,820
<i>If women lose their cuteness appeal, to be honest with you, it's over!</i>

228
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:30,160
I wonder why they start acting all cute when they get old. Not cute, more like annoying. Why do they do that?

229
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,460
It's probably because they lose interest in attracting men and become unshameful.

230
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,680
Lately, there's more masculine women, and  it turns me off.

231
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,850
Yes, you're right.

232
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,400
Women are most attractive when they are feminine and timid.

233
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,840
I'd have nothing to complain about if they'd turn all aggressive during "those" times.

234
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,500
Yah, that would be amazing!

235
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,480
Hi, here is cold soba with warm duck soup.

236
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,590
Oh it's here.

237
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,710
Here you go.

238
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,620
Thank you.

239
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,480
I'll enjoy the meal.

240
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,020
Ken-chan, your soba is delicious.

241
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,160
Isn't it? Thanks!

242
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,140
Ow...I said ow!

243
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,370
Oh, pain pain go away!

244
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,760
You two are close?

245
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,810
Well we're childhood friends after all. I'm so happy that you moved back.

246
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,750
Are you a woman? No, actually, woman these days won't say such heartwarming things.

247
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,480
But hey, don't they say that women are getting masculine because men have become effeminate?

248
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,510
That's so unfounded.

249
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,380
Women made a fuss at first to get higher social status.

250
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,780
They demand to be treated equally, but they would use femininity when they have problems.

251
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,010
I am so sick of that kind of women.  I feel more comfortable staying single.

252
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,300
You are single, Manager?

253
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,250
Of course!

254
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,710
- Ken-san, you too, right?
- Yup.

255
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:41,020
Since you senpais (seniors) are staying single, we youngsters don't have to rush.

256
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,320
You know, two dimentional women are the best.

257
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,680
Two dimention?

258
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:57,030
This is it.  Two dimentional women are cute and classy.  They don't disappoint us men.

259
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,660
Scared me.

260
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,430
Why don't you cover your mouth at least?

261
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,380
- You start becoming like an old man that way.
- Okay, okay.

262
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,300
Then, shall we go have tea?

263
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,920
Sorry, I have to go home.

264
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,940
Oh, I will treat you tea.

265
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,010
That's not it.  I told you, I will work hard today.

266
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,980
Ah!  At this time of the day?

267
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,280
Wow, that's really something.

268
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,840
You are mistaken.

269
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,350
Lately, I have been busy taking care of my kids and house chores.

270
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:33,330
So, I am going to cook something my husband likes
and wait for him.

271
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,290
Your husband is lucky.

272
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,360
Yeah.  When can I see him?

273
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,900
Oh, right.  You haven't seen him yet.

274
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,570
That's right.  Let me see him soon. I won't eat him.

275
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,890
But, you didn't come to my house even when I invited you.

276
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,330
I was busy then.  I will visit you next time.

277
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,870
It's a promise.  See you later!

278
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,060
See you.

279
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,620
Good luck!

280
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,090
Hey!

281
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,230
I want a wife like Miki.

282
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,880
You sound like an old man.

283
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,340
You know, Miki is cute.  She's three years older than I, but she doesn't look it.

284
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,210
You are right. She has been cute since long ago.

285
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,200
That's why she got married, I guess.

286
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,080
I also did.

287
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,260
You divorced.

288
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,450
Wanna come to our restaurant? I'm thirsty.

289
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,860
Hey, let's have a beer.

290
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,120
It's still 3 p.m.

291
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,510
- Does it matter?
- I guess not.

292
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,500
We're here.  Okay, let's drink.

293
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:39,200
<i>Before anything, please give me beer instead of water.</i>

294
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,240
A customer gave this to me. Do you want some?

295
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,940
I'd love some. Thanks.

296
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,800
<i>Here you go.</i>

297
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,430
<i>Welcome!</i>

298
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,130
<i>- Crap!
- Long time no see!</i>

299
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,440
I'm Sakura's...

300
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,240
I remember. You're Shima-san, right?

301
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,050
That's right! I'm so glad you remember me.

302
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,500
I never forget a beauty.

303
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,430
A beauty? Oh, my goodness.  Did you hear that?

304
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,490
Let's go somewhere else.

305
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,340
- Why?
- I don't want to see him outside of work.

306
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,200
I can hear you.

307
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,500
<i>Just sit down.</i>

308
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,730
What would you like?

309
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,440
- Beer for now.
- Okay.

310
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,120
Alcohol in the afternoon?

311
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,320
Why not?  It's my day off... I don't want to hear it from you.

312
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,250
- I'm a man.
- Heh?  Huh? Hah?

313
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,480
Hey, Sakura...

314
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,910
What? Men can drink in the afternoon, but women can't?

315
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:38,380
Women need to be modest. If they keep doing everything men do, there won't be distinction between men and women.

316
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,040
Modest?  Come on!  Nowadays, women are not restricted from doing what men do.

317
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,030
Your way of thinking is so outdated.

318
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,580
That's why you can't get promoted.

319
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,220
Wait a second. What exactly are you trying to say?

320
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,920
No matter how much women may have advanced in this world, but it is still men's world.

321
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:11,070
A woman who can't use  flattery on men, like you, won't get a man or get promoted even if she is competent.

322
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,920
- Oh no.
- Sakura!

323
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,460
A woman who can't use flattery on men?

324
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,880
Fine!

325
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,140
If I can't get a man or get promoted unless I use flattery on men, I'd rather stay like this.

326
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,610
I am going to live single without promotion the rest of my life! Huh!

327
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,830
Ken-chan, I'll take my check.

328
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,870
You're running away?

329
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,690
I haven't finished packing for moving. Besides, I feel bad for Shima-san as well.

330
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,590
Huh, you look funny.

331
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,880
<i>Enjoy.</i>

332
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,400
<i>Sorry...</i>

333
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,440
- See ya, 'Kin'!
- Just get out.

334
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,570
Hey, wipe with this.

335
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,730
He's such a good looking guy.

336
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,170
Who is?

337
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:04,550
He is really good-looking. He is competent and accessible.
He is excellent.

338
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,920
You will be happy with anyone as long as he is a man, right?

339
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,710
That's terrible (of you to say that).

340
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,640
I won't fall for him ever.  He is a male chauvinist and
quibbles a lot.

341
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,330
Even if he was the only man in the world, I won't.  Never!

342
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,160

510
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,110
There's a match making party at the Star Palace Hotel this Sunday.  Would you like to join me?

511
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,280
- What? Me? Really?
- You can attend as a filler.

512
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,620
Choko-chan, you must be kidding. She's almost 40!

513
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,540
Age isn't an issue.

514
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:25,220
You must be kidding. Someone might mistake you for Choko-chan's mom. Why would you go out of your way to embarass yourself like that?

515
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:30,400
That's not true. No one's going to think that. If you're looking to get a boyfriend, wouldn't it be worth just checking it out?

516
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:36,260
Is that true? ... You're right. Is it OK if I bring a friend?

517
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,910
Of course. Please send me your friend's name later.

518
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,840
Got it!

519
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,430
You wait and see! I'm going to get myself a hot man!

520
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,760
Ohhh...I'll be looking forward to your good news!

Hello.

523
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,010
I wanted to ask you a favor. Can you come right away?

524
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,570
Alright.

525
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,270

Huh! This sucks. What am I gonna do?

560
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,610
If I recall, your match making party was today right?

561
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:39,010
I can't go in these clothes.  Like you said, I'd only embarrass myself if I went in these clothes.

562
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,660
Oh shoot, I better call Shima-nee and Miki.

563
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,080
Ahhh I get it. You don't have any confidence.

564
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,760
You're wrong.

565
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,930
Even if you went to the match making party, you don't have the confidence to snag yourself a guy right? That's why you're using the rain as an excuse not to go.

566
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,910
I told you you're wrong.

567
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:55,020
Go then! You've committed yourself to finding
a guy for real right?

568
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,300
Then don't run away without putting up a fight.

569
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,790
Fine, I got it! You're telling me to go right! Your freakin nagging is annoying!

570
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,370
Looking like that?

571
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,030

572
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,460
What's with that outfit anyway?

573
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,090
Are you a university student looking for a job?

574
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,260
What can I do? This is all I've got.

575
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,280
To begin with, I don't like the premise of luring in guys with how you dress.

576
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,290
Stupid! You're so stupid!

577
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,550
Stop saying stupid. You stupid!

578
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:27,050
Just based on appearances and ranked on appearance. Girls who don't look as if they have it together aren't even considered women to begin with.

579
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,560
Well excuse me for not looking the part.

580
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,190
Hey! What are you doing you pervert!

581
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,000
At the very least you should show off your legs.

582
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,270
I'd expose my underwear if I hiked up my skirt so short.

583
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,550
Yah exactly! The shorter the skirt the better.

584
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,110
Not wearing anything is even better.

585
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,930
You're a real life pervert.

586
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,790
- Well maybe.
- Um I'm not complimenting you.

587
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,390
Those are complimenting words.

00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,970

00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,200

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,850
Thank you so much for earlier today.

00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,120
I'm sure my grandkids will be happy.

592
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,150
You came all the way here to tell me this?

593
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,520
Sakura-san, you got drenched in the rain didn't you?

594
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:13,850
This is an outfit that I made for my daughter many years ago.  If you don't mind, would you like to wear it?

595
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,710
Oh wow! Yoko-san, you made this?

596
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:27,550
Yes I did. Is it perhaps out of fashion?

597
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:31,000
- You're not thinking of going to your match making  party wearing that are you?
- Oww!

598
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,270
- I'd also like to do your hair.
- Oh...

599
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,990
Oh OK ... No... OK.

600
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,190
Sorry, sorry!

601
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,890
Oh what were you doing?

602
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,750
I was getting myself a room. It's such a pain to get home when you're drunk.

603
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,200
You're so lucky you can afford it.

604
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,260
I have to go home by 6pm when my husband comes to pick me up.

605
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,310
Aww you're lucky to have a husband like that.

606
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,690
The grass is greener on the other side I guess.

607
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,880
Yup, that's the case.

608
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

609
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,060
Sakura, what's with that outfit?

610
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,550
- What's with this vintage look?
- Oh this smell brings back memories. It smells like my old dresser drawer.

611
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,720
- What?
- Oh yeah!

612
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,040
There's a reason behind this.  Anyway, let's get going.

613
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,090
Sakura, just wait. Wait!

614
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,540
Wow!

615
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,740
Hey, what kind of party is this?

616
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,730
It's a networking party for entrepreneurs isn't it?

617
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,730
- Sorry, it's actually a matchmaking party.
- A matchmaking party?

618
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,520
Matchmaking party?

619
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,840
I'm married.

620
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,770
That' ok. That's ok. We're just fillers. I figured you girls wouldn't join me if I told you the truth.

621
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:55,150
That's true. Everyone here's young but they seem to be well off.

622
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,230
- I'm kinda getting excited.
- Me too.

623
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:03,820
I wonder how many years it's been since I've gone to such a fancy party.

624
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,040
The food looks amazing, too.

625
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,170
- Is it all free?
- Yup, ladies get to eat and drink free.

626
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,900
I guess you're right. We might as well enjoy ourselves since we're here.

627
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,640
Well I'll see you later.

628
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,410
Have fun!

629
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,350
Good evening.

00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,210

My pleasure. Thank you for inviting me.

636
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:38,510
Your outfit today isn't really your regular style.

637
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,660
Oh really?  Tachibana was telling me to dress more like you but...

638
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,310
Rintaro-san said that?

639
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:49,870

644

645
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,630
Please have some if you'd like.

646
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,090
Thank you.

647
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,750
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

648
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,890
Is it possible to get this to-go?

649
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,830
What? Let me double check. Please wait a moment.

650
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,600

664
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,400
There isn't such an event? What do you mean?

665
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,220
Ummm...there's no way that there isn't an event. I dropped her off here.

666

Ummm could it be a matchmaking event?

667
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,420
Like I said to you, it's not a matchmaking event. It's a PTA committee dinner.

668
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:29,300
I'm not getting anywhere with you. Can you call your superior? Manager?

669

- Hey manager?
- Bingo!

00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:05,820
It's Tohyama Sakura, so there's an idiot that calls me Kin. Hahahaha!

680
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,690
Tohyama Kin-san. The guy who has (tatoo of) flurry cherry blossoms.You're familiar with him,  right?

681
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:17,770
What? A while ago you said you'd go with me. For starters, let's get out of here. Let's go to a nicer hotel.

682
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,860
- Let go of me.
- What's wrong with you?

683
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,820
- You're the one who said you wanted to be alone with me.
- Let go of me!

684
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,650
- I said, let go!
- Hey you!

685
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,990
Leave her alone. She said no.

686
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:31,920
What the? This is none of your business. Let's go!

687
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,860
You're hurting me!

688
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,220
Like I said, LET GO!!

689
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:40,060
What's it to you old hag? What business do you have hanging out here?

690
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:44,360
Did you come here thinking you could score a one nighter with a young guy?

691
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,230
So what's it to you if that's the case? Are you gonna entertain me?

692
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:55,240
Sure I'll do it but you better pay me money. Sorry but there's no way I'd do you for free.

693
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,630
There's no way I'd do it with a virgin like you either!

694
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,280
Who you calling a virgin? You shitty old hag!

695
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,980
Sorry for being a hag you little shit! Who'd ask a lil shit like you to sleep with them?

696
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:08,810
A guy who doesn't even notice that a girl is feeling uncomfortable has no right to hit on women.

697
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:11,040
If you get what I'm saying piss off! Heee!

698
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,880
- Excuse me for a minute.
- What?

699
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,750
Hey this is crazy! Wait wait wait...!

700
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,510
Excuse me.

701
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,710
Ummm is this...?

702
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,220
What?

703
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,280
An affair. Have you had an affair before?

704
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:45,460
Excuse me? Ummm affair?  I've never had an affair.

705
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,330
Do you feel like doing something forbidden?

706
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:54,760
Something forbidden? Forbidden things should be forbidden shouldn't they?

707
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,510
- Let's calm down.
- It's ok isn't it?

708
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,880
Let's just calm down. Let's calm down for a minute.

709
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,940
- You're so cute.
- OMG...

710
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:37,930
Why am I the one being kicked out?

711
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:45,370
Owww! These shoes are so uncomfortable.

712
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,340
Uh , don't need these anymore!

713
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,790
Maybe I should have another drink.

714
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,890
You've forgotten something...

715
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,600
my Cinderella.

716
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,680
Cin....derella?

717
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:44,840
Are you ok?

718
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,830
I'm...fine...!

719
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,920
You were thinking of devouring me just now, weren't you?

720
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,210
No, I wasn't!

721
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,560
You're so cute!

722
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:09,210
What are you saying? More like, where is this?

723
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,130
Who are you?

724
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,540
Could it be...you don't remember?

725
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,150
What?

726
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,380
Ohhh...I remember! You're the prince!

727
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,590
Prince?

728
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:35,540
Well, you called me Cinderella... didn't you?

729
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,800
Did I say something like that?

730
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,240
You did. You did for sure! Hang on...

731
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,560
What happened after that?

732
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,930
You said you didn't want to go home, so we booked a room...

733
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:54,760
and you said you couldn't walk, so I carried you to the bed and...

734
00:54:55,990 --> 00:55:00,180
you asked me to sleep with you, so I got in the bed and...

735
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,910
and then?

736
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,870
And then....

737
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:17,460
No way! No way! For real?

738
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,300
We did it? I was able to do it? I did it?

739
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,660
- What?
- What? Oh  never mind.

740
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,440
Well it's fine if I was able to do it but...

741
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,820
it's a shame that I don't remember it. Well more like why can't I remember anything?

742
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,500
- Then let's do it again right now.
- What!

743
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,120
Kidding!

744
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,010
I'm Saeki Hiroto.

745
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,590
Hiroto-kun.

746
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,400
I'm Tohyama Sakura.

747
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,750
Yup, I know.

748
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:58,860
Oh, I guess I was the only drunk one.

749
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,130
Sakura-san.

750
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:13,560
Yes.

751
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:25,540
Will you...go out with me?

752
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,380
Excuse me?

753
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:33,960
I've fallen for you.

754
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,970
Please.

755
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,930
Go out with me.
