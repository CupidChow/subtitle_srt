00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,490
<i>Hiroto-kun.</i>

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,800
<i>I knew you wouldn't see me, so I came to see you.</i>

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,560
<i>It's not like you're Tachibana's girl, right?</i>

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,890
<i>You're twisted.</i>

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,590
<i>Just hurry up and make her fall for you.</i>

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,300
<i>He said that the age gap doesn't matter so let's date.</i>

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,410
<i>I'm starting to feel like I'm being teased.</i>

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,510
<i>Stop being scared.</i>

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,430
<i>I'm not scared.</i>

10
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,980
<i>You've gotten used to getting hurt, haven't you?</i>

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,600
<i>I hit it!</i>

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,620
<i>Hold still.</i>

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:35,070
<i>Timing and subtitles provided by
Last Cinderella Team @viki.com</i>

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,110
Good morning.

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,020
Good morning!

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,290
What are you looking at?

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,180
The manager of the Ginza store is on the cover of a fashion magazine.

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,570
Him, huh? He's got a front page interview?
Is this guy that popular?

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,580
He did succeed Tachibana-san at a young age.

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,850
<i>He lifted the Ginza store to the top of the industry</i>

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,320
<i>with his skills and bold management strategy.</i>

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,230
Tachibana-san is the one who grew the Ginza salon to that level.

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,240
Wouldn't Tachibana-san be offended if he saw this?

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,720
Let's hide it.

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,930
Good idea.

26
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,730
Good morning.

27
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,970
He's here, he's here!

28
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,360
<i>- Is everyone here?</i>
- Me?

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,730
<i>Let's get the meeting started.</i>

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,460
<i>Come on, line up. Quickly now.</i>

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:36,100
The Happy Go Lucky Styling Live will be held before Golden Week again this year.

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,100
This time the feature event will be a hair show where all our salons will compete.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,490
Naturally, the outcome of the event will affect
the salon's reputation,

34
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,200
which means... I'll be representing our salon.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,580
<i>The event is going to be held on our day off, so come watch it if you are free.<i></i></i>

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>But I know I'll win, so leave it to me.</i>

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,500
There we go.

38
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,630
Listen up, everyone.

39
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,950
The assistant manager has a boyfriend for the first time
in 10 years.

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,130
Wow!  Cool!

41
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,540
I know it's good news, but we can't have you
running off during meetings.

42
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,390
- People become listless if they fall in love after many years.  She's a typical example.
- What?!

43
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,370
You need to have romance so that you won't be like her.
That's all.

44
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,790
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

45
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,000
I look forward to working with you again today.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,080
Thank you!

47
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,970
Hey, wait. What was that about just now?

48
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,690
I was trying to refocus your energy.

49
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,830
A listless boss could cause trouble for all the employees.

50
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,700
I am not listless.

51
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,960
Oh, right. Don't come to the Styling Live.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,930
You'll give me bad luck if you come.

53
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,910
What are you talking about?
I know you want me to come...

54
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,550
<i>Hiroto: Sorry for texting you at work. I had fun the other day. Can I see you when you get off?</i>

55
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,560
That's gross.

56
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,220
<i>- Whoa!
- Sorry.</i>

57
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,630
<i>Even though your heart flutters, people think it's gross because you are old.</i>

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,320
I don't know why, but my daughter-in-law...

59
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,160
<i>she doesn't vacuum the house.</i>

60
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,240
I know she's working but once a week just isn't enough.

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,360
You should vacuum yourself, mom.

62
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,390
I'm looking after the children while she's gone.

63
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,960
- If I start doing the housework too, what use would his wife be?
- You're right.

64
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,920
But when I say anything, she says she'll do it her own way

65
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,100
and to leave her alone.

66
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,530
She's terrible. She's an awful wife.

67
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,500
- So, Miki-san.
- Yes.

68
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,700
In protest,

69
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,480
I've decided to stay here for a while.

70
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,370
I see.

71
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,800
That weight is finally off my shoulders.

72
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,070
Now I can eat again.

73
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,080
More.

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,910
Me too. Half of what you gave me earlier.

75
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,270
Mix it using this part of your hand.

76
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,880
Dough dries out easily so work as quickly as you can.

77
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,510
Give me a break!

78
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,000
Why do I have to look after his mother?

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,390
Yeah.

80
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,730
Why did we put down a deposit to build a two-family home?

81
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,690
It's nice that we can do whatever we want because my husband is the second son but,

82
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,620
we didn't receive any money for our house!

83
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,440
We did it all ourselves.

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,520
<i>Hey, Sakura-san.
Hello, Sakura-san?</i>

85
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,460
Her head is in the clouds.

86
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,120
This is why old people shouldn't fall in love.

87
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,040
Old people? Just how old do you think I am?

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,550
You have something to say about that?

89
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,220
Look. Isn't it cute?

90
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,440
Yeah, it's cute.

91
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,030
It's cute, but Sakura, that dough is for <i>shokupan</i>.
(a long square type loaf of bread)

92
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,120
- What?
- And it hasn't risen yet.

93
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,440
Your brain is spewing chemicals everywhere right now.

94
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,200
Yeah. What are they called? Something dolphins?

95
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,630
The endorphins will come later.

96
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,320
Right now it's releasing a hormone called PEA,

97
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,660
that's filling her head with lovey dovey thoughts.

98
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,190
Either way, it's got nothing to do with me.

99
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,090
I hate this.

100
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,900
<i>Have some chocolate.</i>

101
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,480
Thanks for the food.

102
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,610
Mmm...

103
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,860
- It's bitter.
-  It goes well with sake.

104
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,350
I know, right?

105
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,620
This was a gift, but you're welcome to have some after you eat.

106
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,430
Thank you.

107
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,980
They say these types of chocolates are like a drug.

108
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,050
They make you happy by releasing endorphins or something.

109
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,860
Isn't that the hormone

110
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,740
<i>your brain releases during sex?</i>

111
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,460
Yeah, that's it.

112
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,420
Maybe that's why women like chocolate so much.

113
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,190
Apparently brain chemicals are serious matters.

114
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,650
They say more middle-aged people have short fuses because of a serotonin deficiency.

115
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,760
When your brain is releasing enough serotonin,

116
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,180
your focus improves, and it makes your mind
and body healthier.

117
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,300
I heard you can release them with simple exercises.

118
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,330
Why don't we try it?

119
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,980
Let's try it.

120
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,910
Line up here.

121
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,240
Stand up straight.

122
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,190
A, i, u, e, o!
Say it with me.

123
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,610
Go!

124
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:25,890
A, i, u, e, o!

125
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,190
Let's keep going.

126
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,150
Join us.

127
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,390
Thanks.

128
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,250
Swing your arms.

129
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,240
Here we go!

130
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,000
A, i, u, e, o!

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,400
It's so cute.
It's so cute, I can't eat it.

132
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,930
Why are you acting like that?

133
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,120
You look like Munch's "Scream" to me.

134
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,360
Shut up.

135
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,990
By the way, have you already done it a second time?

136
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,870
A second time?

137
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,220
I mean sex, of course.

138
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,320
- I don't care about that.
- What?

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,560
What do you mean?

140
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,190
I don't need to have sex. Just kissing is enough.

141
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,730
What are you talking about?

142
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,670
A relationship without sex is like an
Isono family without Sazae-san.
(referring to a cartoon "Sazae-san")

143
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,910
That sounds so boring.

144
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,480
Just think about it. I can't show him this body.

145
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,320
I'm glad I was drunk the first time.

146
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,630
If you're embarrassed about it, you should work out.

147
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,010
Come to my gym everyday, and we'll figure something out.

148
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,390
Unfortunately, I don't have the time or the determination.

149
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,010
I'm fine with platonic relationships for the rest of my life.

150
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,240
The rest of your life? What about kids?

151
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,670
39 is cutting it pretty close.

152
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,720
There's no age limit on marriage but,

153
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,220
that's not how it works with children.

154
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,730
You're right but,

155
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,760
how could I put such a heavy burden
on my 24-year-old boyfriend?

156
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,250
He's 24, huh?

157
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,210
He really is young.

158
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,870
I see.

159
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,880
By the way, what does he do for work?

160
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,850
I don't know.

161
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,710
What?

162
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,750
♫<i> I can't rely on you </i>♫

163
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,860
♫<i> You're never there for me, I can't rely on you </i>♫

164
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,060
♫<i> You're hot and then cold see I can't rely on you </i>♫

165
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,640
Hey.

166
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,170
Do you want some? It's bread from Jolly Bakery.

167
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,570
I'm so hungry I could eat anything. Thank you.

168
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,740
I should've bought something from the convenience store.

169
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,990
So? Why did you come here today?

170
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,990
No reason. You said you're busy with practice, so I came to give you this.

171
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,240
That's it?

172
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,360
Is it that weird for me to bring you a gift?

173
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,490
Yeah. In fact, it's creepy.

174
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,740
How rude.

175
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,760
The event is coming up, right?

176
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm doing my best to support you here.

177
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,990
What an honor.

178
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,380
Is there anymore? I'm still hungry.

179
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,050
Next time I'm definitely getting something
from the convenience store.

180
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,700
By the way, I think she's about to fall for me.

181
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,270
What am I supposed to do now?

182
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,520
How long do I have to keep going?

183
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,890
Hey, she's getting old.

184
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,320
If she asks me to marry her, I might really tell her the truth.

185
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,470
Don't! You definitely can't do that.

186
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,250
That violates our agreement.

187
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,720
When did we make an agreement?

188
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,890
I can't believe Rintaro-san lives in the same building.

189
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,940
Why don't you make a move?

190
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,910
What?

191
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,690
Are you just going to stand by without doing anything?

192
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,800
<i>He's getting pretty old, and he won't be single forever.</i>

193
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,410
I already know that. You don't have to tell me!

194
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,290
But you know better than anyone why I can't.

195
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,980
Sorry.

196
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,500
I'm leaving.

197
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:34,330
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Last Cinderella Team @Viki.</i>

198
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,570
Bye bye.

199
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,920
<i>Everyone, gather around in front of the TV.</i>

200
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,620
<i>Everyone looks good.</i>

201
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,060
<i>Let's start with the abs!</i>

202
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,440
Leg...  Wow...

203
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,590
I'm going to die...

204
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,360
I pulled it... Ouch...

205
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:29,390
<i>You go on a diet... but, in the end, you drink a beer.</i>

206
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,000
<i>Let's start with finding a model.</i>

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,730
This time,  I want to show both cut and perm techniques.

208
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,780
Can you find a girl with light colored long hair,

209
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:49,220
who would look good with light wavy curls, like a foreigner.

210
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,500
Can you do a perm during the show?

211
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,340
The show will be held toward the end, but in the beginning, stylists and models will be introduced.

212
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,310
If I start it right after that, I can easily make it.

213
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,910
<i>So, use your free time to look for a model.</i>

214
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,320
<i>Yes.</i>

215
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,480
You are being aggressive.

216
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,480
I told you I can't lose.

217
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,860
He's going to be competing, too.

218
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,910
- Who's that?
- Everyone is counting on him in our company.

219
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,730
Then you can't lose (to him).

220
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,830
Anyway, is that all you're eating?

221
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,350
Huh?  Yeah...

222
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,730
You usually eat like a man.  Are you not feeling well?

223
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,740
I'm fine.

224
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,150
This machine makes a weird sound.

225
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,550
That was you, right?

226
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,280
<i>Oh boy...This machine...</i>

227
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,870
Who put this here?

228
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,400
I'm gonna throw it away.

229
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,040
I'm so hungry...

230
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,920
Oh wow.  What was that?

231
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,220
It's called BMX.  It's a competitive bicycle sport.

232
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,640
Wow.  You look like a professional.

233
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,040
- I am a professional.
- What?

234
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,840
So, this is your job?

235
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,420
That's right.

236
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,950
Wow.  I want to see some more.

237
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,550
I'm finished.  We're not supposed to do this around here.

238
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,250
Oh... that's too bad.

239
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,320
Everyday, I practice at the skate park behind
the station almost everyday,

240
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,390
so why don't you come over sometime?  Everyone is great.

241
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,240
Ok, I'll definitely be there.

242
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,120
See you.

243
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,860
<i>Sakura-san.</i>

244
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,100
For our next date, can we go to a place where I want to go?

245
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,400
Of course.  Where do you want to go?

246
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,160
- Your house.
- Eh?

247
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,860
I want a date at your house, and eat home cooked meal
made by you.

248
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,860
See you later.

249
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,280
Date at my house.... Home cooked meal...

250
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,060
Are you serious?

253

What is it?  So loud... Ah!

254
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,030
<i>This is so heavy... gosh...</i>

255
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,530
Oh, it's you, Kin.  I thought you were some old man.

256
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,610
Good timing.  Come help.  My back hurts.

257
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,950
What the heck...?

258
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,970
Just grab the end and carry it over.

259
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,520
Let's go...

260
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,040
Wow, what's this?

261
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,020
Oh, wow... it's been so long.

262
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,620
What a mess.  Since when have you not cleaned your room?

263
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,560
Since I moved in... so about 5 years?

264
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,080
A filthy woman won't be liked.

265
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,790
A reunion after 5 years...

266
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,100
You're not even listening.  Make sure you clean
your new place regularly.

267
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,440
A new place?

268
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,430
You're moving, right?

269
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,210
Who is?

270
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,470
You are.  You're not?

271
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,890
I'm just cleaning.  Isn't it obvious?

272
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,720
Is this your year-end cleaning?  This totally looks
like you are moving.

273
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,240
I can't help it.  I'm having a date here.

274
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,010
A date at home?

275
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,540
Just wait a moment, ok?  Can you bring that over here?

276
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,120
Let's go.

277
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,060
Why do I have to help you clean your room?

278
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,620
I helped you move in.

279
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,750
It's natural for a subordinate to help her boss move in.

280
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,500
That is called power harassment these days.

281
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,590
I love power harassment.  I'm going back to sleep,
so do this quietly, ok?

282
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,470
He's ungenerous.  Oh well, it can't be helped.

283
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:51,060
Let's go.... oh, it's heavy....

284
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,890
I'm sorry.  Look it up on the internet.  Ok?

285
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,230
Miki-san, I want to wash this.

286
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,830
Eh?  Oh.  I did the wash already today, so can I wash it tomorrow?

287
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,580
I only brought these pajamas... I want to wash them now, so I can wear them tonight.

288
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:16,160
Ah... then leave them with me.  I'll hand wash them later.

289
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,260
Oh, you are so helpful.

290
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,400
And, I would like some fish tonight.

291
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,540
Not sashimi (raw fish). Either boil or grill it, ok?

292
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,860
Are you kidding me?

293
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,980
Why do I have to hand wash her pajamas?

294
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,080
And she wants fish tonight?  Can't take it anymore.

295
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,830
5, 6, 7, 8.

296
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,430

297
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,220
1, 2, 3, 4...

298
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,650
Good work!

299
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,390
Hey, Shima-sensei.  How about tonight?

300
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,170
Ah... ok.

301
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,610
See you at the usual place.

302
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,340
Who was that?  He was wearing a wedding ring.

303
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,150
It's none of your business.  Why are you here anyway?

304
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,460
You don't have to say it like that.

305
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,380
Didn't we decide not to see each other anymore?
What if Miki finds out?

306
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,740
Miki told me to come here.

307
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,450
Eh?

308
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,200
She told me to come here until I lose at least 5kg.

309
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,740
Why didn't you refuse?

310
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,690
I thought it would be more unnatural to refuse.

311
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,040
Besides, I have something I need to talk to you about.

312
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,280
Can we get together after this?

313
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,800
And...? You wanted to talk to me about...?

314
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,210
Well, it's a bit awkward to talk about it here.

315
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,050
Then where would be a good place? There's no way I'm going to a hotel!

316
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,410
Back then, I didn't know you were Miki's husband so...

317
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,570
Sorry to say but I'm not desperate enough to sleep with my friend's husband.

318
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,360
You're talking too loud!  Shhh!

319
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,500
Ok, I'll talk.

320
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,540
Go ahead.

321
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,490
To be honest,

322
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,040
I may have ED.
(Erectile Disfunction)

323
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,330
- ED??!!
- <i>Hahahahaha</i>

324
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,160
<i>That's funny.  So funny.</i>

325
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,790
I haven't been "responsive" from quite a while back.

326
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,350
It's one thing to have failed with Miki but I couldn't get it up with you either.

327
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,160
That's when I was convinced that I had ED.

328
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,570
<i>I'd like to find a way to overcome this, but I'm hesitant
to go to a hospital...</i>

329
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,490
But I can't confide in anyone about such an embarrassing problem so

330
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,770
I figured, with you, Shima-san, I've already showed you quite a lot of my embarrassing side, so

331
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,490
I was hoping I could get some good advice from you.

332
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,230
OK, I understand,  I'll ask around.

333
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,790
I appreciate it.

334
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,950
Hurry up and go home. Miki's waiting for you.

335
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,340
<i>OK, ok, ok. Hey...</i>

338
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,900
What are you doing?

339
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:31,110
You can't be thinking of going home? Hey, Hiroto!

340
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,370

<i>What's Styling Live?</i>

342
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,150
One stylist from each salon participates and competes in a hair and makeup competition.

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,270
Wow, that sounds interesting.

344
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,800
It gets pretty exciting.

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,520
Mika-chan, if you're interested, bring your friends along. My manager is confident that he'll win.

346
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,530
OK, got it.

347
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,700
Hey, is that the model for the show?

348
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,160
Yes, seems so.

349
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,550
OK, have a good night everyone.

350
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,870
Have a good night.

351
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,100
Well there, you've found a cute long haired girl.

352
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,770
Well, this just shows you my abilities.

353
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,610
I shouldn't have complimented you.

354
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,410
Well then, good luck! Please excuse me, I'm heading out first.

355
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,140
OK. Thanks for your hard work.

356
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,890
Having a boyfriend is making her leave quickly.

357
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,990
I'm so jealous.

358
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,880
You guys are working overtime again.

359
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,910
Yes, got it!

360
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,250
Ah, hang on...

361
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,780
Ah, it's too early for this.

362
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,320
Ah ah ah...can you turn off the lights. Ah!

363
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,450
Ah Stop. Ah. You're crazy...ahhh!

364
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,920
No, that's not right.

365
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,120
Please excuse me.

366
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,080
This is the good part, too.
<i>(The call interrupted her)</i>

367
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,170
Oh that's right!

368
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,490
Uh!

369
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,920
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

370
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,050
That phrase, I'm throwing it right back at you.

371
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,980
Why are you always appearing in front of me?

372
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,760
Like I said, that's my phrase!

373
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,670
And... when are you going to let go of this?

374
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,140
Seems like this is the last bottle so...

375
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,640
Why don't you ask the store manager?

376
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,990
You're planning on taking off with it while I'm asking, aren't you?

377
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,480
I need to use this.

378
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,000
"Use" it? You're not planning on using it for cooking, are you?

379
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,160
What else would you use it for?

380
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,610
Hey, you are planning to use Montepulciano for cooking?  Just use some cheap wine for your cooking.

381
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,470
- I really love this one!
- Don't kid me. Let go!

382
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,580
No way, there's no way!

383
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,850
- Then Rock paper scissors!
- You're on!

384
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,760
- Starting with rock, rock paper scissors.Look over there!
- Arrr!!

385
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,470
I don't want to! Ken-chan!

386
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,730
Hey, you guys were together.

387
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,240
It's just a coincidence.

388
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,410
Hm, what are you guys doing?

389
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,050
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

390
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,630
You get along so well.

391
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,760
Oh hey, why don't you come eat, Rintaro?

392
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,390
<i>I'm teaching Sakura-san to cook tonight.</i>

393
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:08,250
You'll get to feast. You can drink while you wait. Is that alright, Sakura-san?

394
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,010
Only if you'll let me use "this."

395
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,590
<i>Let me see here.</i>

396
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,060
<i>Sole Poele in White Sauce. Wow, you picked a hard one.</i>

397
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,190
<i>That hard?</i>

398
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:26,110
<i>Well, let's give it a try. For starters, we'll slice in three pieces and debone the sole...</i>

399
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,720
<i>OK, you bet I can do it!</i>

400
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,000
OK, I'll gather the white sauce ingredients.

401
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,100
Hey, hey, hey, hey!!

402
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,040
What?

403
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,800
Not what? More like what are you doing?

404
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,910
Like I said, I'm slicing and deboning the sole, but it's harder than it looks.

405
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,390
Oh Sakura-san, you're always full of jokes.

406
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,830
Whaaat!

407
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,300
Ken-chan, she's much more ignorant than you'd imagine.

408
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,640
It's not even on the level of being bad at cooking or lacking sense. She lacks common sense.

409
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,390
You know that Tokyo-whatchamacallit show people are talking about? The segment where people who can't cook are featured. If she were to go on the show, she'd win.

410
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,350
I can't help it! I had no opportunity to cook. That's why I'm here learning right now!!

411
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,780
There are levels you can and can't reach
with last-minute practice.

412
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,030
If you can't cook, you should stick with things that you can do.

413
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,020
Don't try to make yourself look good.

414
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,680
That's not it!...Well I suppose it kind of is...

415
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,110
If you try too hard, he'll find out eventually.

416
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,300
That's true. When you're in love and give it your all,
it goes wrong.

417
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,790
Well I don't think it's just that.

418
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,120
Shut up! Who cares? It's not like I'm trying to make a living off my cooking.

419
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,470
She turned defiant. Women get defiant more quickly
as they get older.

420
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,950
Shut up, you. You're distracting me, so go home.

421
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,180
Yeah, I'm going home.

422
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,030
Go home, go home. Ah wait! This is mine!

423
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,580
Hey, hey, you two calm down.

424
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,870
It's midnight. You'll disturb the neighbors.

425
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,390
It's done.

426
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,900
How fast!

427
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,290
"I have to prepare food for the restaurant, so I'm leaving"

428
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,060
I'm sleepy!

429
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,960
Ah!

430
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,130
What is it? So loud.

431
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,930
What do you mean "What is it?" Why are you sleeping here?

432
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,390
What? What time is it right now?

433
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,720
Ten! It's ten!

434
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,500
Oh no! The rehearsal for the show starts at noon.

435
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,080
That's right. You've got to go!

436
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,360
Don't come with me.

437
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,710
I'm not going. After all, I'm going to have a date at home.

438
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,640
Oh, right.

439
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,500
I feel bad for your boyfriend who has to eat that minced sole.

440
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,260
There is no way I will feed him that. Hurry up. Just go.

441
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,790
Oh, right.

442
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,510
Hey! Win.

443
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,060
Yeah.

444
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,140
Alright, I can't stay like this either.

445
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,160
First off, clean, then take a shower.

446
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,700
Then go shopping. Before that,

447
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,560
<i>I practice everyday at the skate park behind the station almost every day.</i>

448
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,610
I guess I'll go take a look.

449
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,160
Understood.

450
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,790
Manager!

451
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,920
Sorry for being late. How about the model? Is she here yet?

452
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,680
Well, she just called here saying she has 39 degree temperature and can't make it.

453
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,880
What?

454
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,730
<i>I'll go find a new model near the station!</i>

455
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,040
Wait! You guys head to the event and attend
the rehearsal for me.

456
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,070
I'll find a model before the show and be there.

457
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,460
Understood. Let's go!

458
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,980
I'll buy him a gift.

459
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,640
Wait, wait, wait! This position is dangerous.

460
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,960
There are children passing by right in front of you.
What are you going to do if they burn their faces on your cigarette?

461
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,110
You're so annoying.

462
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,060
You're right, but you shouldn't smoke here.

463
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,750
I won't stop.

464
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,530
It's smoky.
Let's go somewhere else, okay?

465
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,580
Don't touch me! Your 'old ladyness' will rub off on me!

466
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,740
<i>Besides, it's none of your business.</i>

467
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,980
It's none of my business? It is my business.
You see that?

468
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,260
No smoking in the street.
Your good manners put a smile on everyone's face.

469
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,820
- Hey Momo, what are you doing here?
- Hey, Onii-chan (older brother).

470
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,440
- This weird old woman is picking a fight with me.
- What?

471
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,280
Just ignore this old woman.

472
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,120
Hey! Wait up!

473
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,290
Sorry I'm such an old lady. Damn it.

474
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,880
There he is.

475
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,540
Hiro. Good work.

476
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:36,100
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by

<i>This pain... it's not illness, is it love?</i>

478
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,030
<i>[Hiroto]</i>

479
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,730

- Yes.

480
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,650
I'm searching for a model for a hair show.
Would you be interested?

481
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,140
<i>I have plans today.</i>

482
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,090
I thought so...

483
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,800
- Hey you.
- Oh.

484
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,660
What are you doing?  What about the rehearsal?

485
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,890
- The model got a fever, so she can't come.
- Eh?

486
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,630
I don't have time to talk right now... Excuse me?

487
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,060
I'm looking for a model for a hair show...

488
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,910
<i>A model?</i>

489
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:53,290
<i>Yes.  The show is today.  Our model couldn't make it today.</i>

490
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,460
Excuse me, sorry to bother you.  My name is Tohyama, and I'm a hair stylist.

491
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,020
We are looking for a model for a hair show.
Do you have any time?

492
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,640
<i>I'm sorry.  I'm busy.</i>

493
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,010
Excuse me... My name is...

494
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,580
I am looking for a model for a hair show.

495
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,680
Our model couldn't make it today.

496
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,080
I'm sorry to bother you, but do you have any time now?

497
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,940
Hey, let's move to another location.  This isn't working.

498
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,360
Forget it.

499
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,210
Ha?

500
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:43,640
There is nothing more we can do.  The rehearsal is almost over.  This time, I have to cancel.

501
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,640
You're giving up?

502
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,720
Didn't you say in front of everyone that you would definitely win?

503
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,700
It's not like you to give up before the fight.

504
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,370
I've heard that somewhere... that's what I said to you.

505
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:04,140
But, it's hard to find someone that meets all the requirements...

506
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,540
Oh wait...

507
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,250
Oh no...

508
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,240
Hello.

509
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,140
<i>Sorry!</i>

510
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,770
Did you stand me up?

511
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,840
I am so sorry.

512
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,070
Where are you right now?

513
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,350
I'm at a cafe near your house.

514
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:29,250
It's called SOBAR Endoh.

515
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,840
Oh... you're at Ken-chan's place.

516
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:38,330
It's difficult for me to ask you this after standing you up but...

517
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,020
<i>I have a favor to ask.</i>

518
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,990
- Hey, what's her name?
- Don't know.

519
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,640
Isn't she your boyfriend's friend?

520
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,600
I don't even know if she's his friend.

521
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,200
Ha?

522
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,630
I just don't know.  I just caught a glimpse of them being together.

523
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,810
Why are you mad?  It's your fault for not going to your date.

524
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,900
I'm helping you this much, so you better not lose to the Ginza salon manager.

525
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,890
I think you're misunderstanding something...

526
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,340
They're here.

527
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,090
Thanks for waiting.

528
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,760
She looks good.

529
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,530
This is Momo.

530
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,990
Thank you.

531
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,700
Nice to meet you.  I'm Tohyama.

532
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,210
Sorry to ask you for this favor.

533
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,850
I think we've met before.

534
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,690
What?

535
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,920
It's a joke to ask me to do her a favor.

536
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,440
I understand.  I understand your feelings.  But is there any way you can do this?

537
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,430
I'm not the one cutting your hair.  It's him.

538
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,740
My name is Tachibana.

539
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,380
Can we ask you for this favor?

540
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,710
If you bow to me and apologize, then I will forgive you.

541
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,230
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

542
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,290
<i>Sakura-san, I don't get it.  What's going on?</i>

543
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:03,200
I am so sorry for being rude earlier.  Please forgive me.

544
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,280
Is that it?

545
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,750
Please forgive me.

546
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,130
<i>Tachibana-san.  It's starting.</i>

547
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,750
Ah...

548
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,730
Make me look cute.

549
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,880
Of course.  Let's go.

550
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,870
<i>Hiro, see you.</i>

551
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,350
What's going on?

552
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,530
I'll tell you later.

553
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:46,120
Since Tachibana told me not to see the show, let's go some place else.

554
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:05,860
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by
The Last Cinderella Team@Viki.</i>

555
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,620
Come in.

556
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,160
Good evening.

557
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,240
W, wait.  What is this?

558
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,880
What do you mean?  You're helping me get over ED (Erectile Dysfunction) right?

559
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,580
What do you mean?  You can't touch me.

560
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,090
But this is a hotel room.

561
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:40,700
We can't talk about getting hard or not in front of people.  So that's why I decided to get a room.

562
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,810
Oh... I just thought...

563
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,980
- You know what?
- Yes.

564
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,300
Let me be clear.  I'm meeting you for Miki.

565
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,500
It's not because I want to be with you.

566
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,870
I know.

567
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,560
Then, sit over there.

568
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,230
Today, let me ask you detailed questions about your condition.

569
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,960
Detailed questions about my condition?   You're not a doctor...

570
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,250
It's because you said you didn't want to go see a doctor.

571
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,660
I am planning to ask my acquaintance about how to get over ED after understanding your condition.

572
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,710
Don't get mad.  I'll do it.  Let's be calm about this.

573
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:26,320
Ok then... when did you stop getting an erection?

574
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,630
About 3 months ago.

575
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,890
Were you experiencing extreme level of stress around that time?

576
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:36,000
No, not really.

577
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,580
So... getting an erection...

578
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,440
He's late...

579
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,520
<i>Compared with Shohei's evil wife, Miki-san is like an angel daughter-in-law.</i>

580
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:01,600
<i>She's so easy to manipulate. She does anything I say.  She has been living an easy life.</i>

581
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,240
After getting a shotgun wedding, she's been a housewife all this time.  She's naive.

582
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,720
<i>On the other hand, Shohei's evil wife is so busy that she takes it out on me...</i>

583
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,830
Come in.

584
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,950
Thank you.  Wow...

585
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,830
So clean!

586
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,680
Sakura-san, you like things to be neat.

587
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,430
Not really.

588
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,530
Are you hungry?

589
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,210
Yeah.

590
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,630
You were going to make something with these, right?

591
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,670
Yeah... but...

592
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,330
I don't think I can use this meat and fish.

593
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,320
Yeah you're right.

594
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,720
Ok, I'll make something.

595
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,600
Eh?

596
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,960
Oh wow. You made it so quickly.

597
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,950
It's just fried rice.

598
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,860
I don't think I can cook quickly like you.

599
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,320
Even though I'm a woman...   How embarrassing.

600
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,410
What do you mean?  It's old fashioned to say women should do the cooking.

601
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:37,350
Men or women, whoever has time, or wants to cook, right?

602
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,670
- You're right.
- Yup.

603
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,020
- Let's eat.
- Yeah.

604
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,780
By the way, about today.

605
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,590
Hum?

606
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:54,490
If you came to the practice park, why didn't you say something?

607
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:59,620
Ah, well... I got a call from work.

608
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,810
I see.

609
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,540
Then, next time, call me, ok?

610
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,470
Yup, I got it.

611
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,000
Then... Let's eat.

612
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,450
Let's eat.

613
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,590
It looks so good.

614
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,300
How is it?

615
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,660
It's good.

616
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,320
<i>That's good.</i>

617
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,860
This... This is what I wanted.
<i>[Prize - Trip to Onsen (hot springs)]</i>

618
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,650
You are such a kind Manager.

619
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,680
Eh?  Just to be clear, I didn't to this for my team.

620
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,070
With this, I don't have to pay for company trip out of our budget.  Instead, I can use money for new equipment.

621
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,210
That's what I wanted.

622
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:52,420
That fool believed that I was trying to beat
that Ginza salon manager.

623
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,510
Ah... you mean Sakura-san?

624
00:39:54,510 --> 00:40:00,820
Eh?  Yeah... I trained that Ginza salon manager,
and he was the best.

625
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,750
Nevertheless, she missed her date and helped me
find a model...

626
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,930
She even kneeled down on the ground to apologize.

627
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:11,470
She's so simple minded... what a fool.

628
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,100
I need to go this way.

629
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,680
Ah, thank you for coming today.

630
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,290
- Yes.
- I'm sure you were busy... didn't you have a date or something?

631
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,500
I'm not seeing anyone.

632
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,200
I see.

633
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,520
Rintaro-san, do you like anyone?

634
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,190
I do have someone.

635
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:47,790
She's some place far away now.

636
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,360
I see.

637
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,610
Good night.

638
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,050
<i> ♫ I just felt that I knew it all ♫ </i>

639
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,910
<i> ♫ I just tried to put it all away ♫ </i>

640
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:18,280
<i> ♫ Every time I got too much to recall, I'm holding back my tears  ♫ </i>

641
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,780
Tachibana won.

642
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,070
Wow, that's cool.

643
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,260
We need to thank Momo-chan, don't we?

644
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,750
You don't need to do that.

645
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,760
She said she really wanted to change her hair style.

646
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,300
She seemed happy that she could do it for free.

647
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,980
Really.

648
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,760
But... I was jealous.

649
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,240
Eh?

650
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,160
You were kneeling down on the ground apologizing for Tachibana-san.

651
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,520
Is it possible that you like Tachibana-san?

652
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,200
Nope.  No way.  1000% not possible.

653
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,790
That's good.

654
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,050
Yup.

655
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,450
Actually...

656
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,830
I was jealous, too.

657
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,840
I saw Momo-chan kiss you at the practice park.

658
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,380
No, it's my fault.

659
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:44,040
I went there without telling you... but...

660
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,860
I was surprised.

661
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,130
Sorry.  Don't worry.

662
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:00,610
I guess I'm little buzzed from the alcohol.

663
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,780
<i>Ouch... my foot is asleep...</i>

664
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,600
<i>Ouch... ouch...</i>

665
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,670
Sorry.

666
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,870
To be honest, I was seeing Momo.

667
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,360
But, if you ask if I like her, I am not so sure.

668
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,380
<i>So, if I talk to her, she'll understand.</i>

669
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,550
I'll go talk to her tomorrow.

670
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,640
Please give me some time.

671
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:47,880
Yes.

672
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,550
I see.

673
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,530
<i>So how about this?</i>

674
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:02,170
Why didn't you kiss me?

675
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:05,330
That.. That was...

676
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,920
Anyway you look at it, we don't look like a couple.

677
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,680
So, I hesitate to be lovey-dovey with you in public.

678
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,580
- You like me, don't you?
- Eh?

679
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:18,680
Eh?

680
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,050
Yeah, yeah...

681
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,620
Then, let's just get over it.

682
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,600
No matter what people may think,

683
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,090
I like you.

684
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:34,280
And you like me.

685
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,940
That's good enough.

686
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:49,110
I'll hold back today.

687

00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,040
No, that's ok.

00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:26,330
Sorry.

00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,050
Gotta practice.

701
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,280
Ouch.

702
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,060
Ouch...
