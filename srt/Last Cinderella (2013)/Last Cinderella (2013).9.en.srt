00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,900
<i>Her heart is really so beautiful.</i>

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,240
<i>This is the first time I felt like this about someone.</i>

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,680
<i>Please break up with me.</i>

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,760
<i>I'll gracefully give up.  Be happy with Sakura-san.</i>

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,150
<i>If I go date someone, I would want to spend the rest of my life with her.</i>

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,080
<i>It would have to be someone I feel easy with.</i>

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,520
<i>- Ouch...
- Dad, what's wrong?</i>

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,890
<i>Miki's husband was taken to the hospital on an ambulance.</i>

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,350
Mom...

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,640
Takeru, Saki-chan.  Sorry for making you feel helpless.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,930
How is Kohei-san?

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,640
He's being operated now.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,800
Eh?  What's wrong with him?

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,270
It's appendicitis.

15
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,360
Appendicitis?

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,460
That's... an appendix?

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,770
Oh...

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,440
It seems like he had been enduring the pain for a long time.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,580
That's why he had to get a surgery right away.

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:09,150
I'm sorry this happened while I was out.

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,950
Since it's so late, I'll stay here so...

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,190
Mother, please take the kids home and get some rest.

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,470
I don't want to.  I'm staying here.

24
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,700
Me too.

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,920
I got it.  Then, let's all wait together.

26
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,120
Thank goodness it was just appendicitis.

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,240
That's right... but he's still in surgery now.

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,960
<i>Let's hope it gets done without problems.</i>

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,950
<i>Beer?</i>

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,870
<i>Please.</i>

31
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,450
Shima-nee.

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,210
It's true I thought he was cute when I met him for the first time.

33
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,120
But, as soon as I knew he was Miki's husband,
that feeling just disappeared.

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,110
Even so, it was wrong to continue meeting him
without telling Miki.

35
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,270
Yeah.

36
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,550
When I think about it...

37
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,560
I don't have any male friends that I don't have any sexual relationship with.

38
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,720
When I was younger, it was hard to have a relationship like that,

39
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,720
but at this age, it's nice to have a friend or two like that.

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,130
That's right...

41
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,320
You're okay, you have Tachibana.

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,620
That?

43
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,470
That's not really a friend.

44
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,240
He's a perfectly good friend!

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,820
You guys have been friends for so long.
I'm sure it'll last a lifetime.

46
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,990

How is Takenouchi-san?

50
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,900
Oh... it was appendicitis.  The surgery was a success.

51
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,150
Hey, let's eat together.

52
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,240
I'm not hungry.

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,150
Oh.  Then here.

54
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,130
I don't want it.

55
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,300
What's wrong?  You never decline alcohol. Is something wrong?

56
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,530
- How's your head...
- Be quiet.  I'm going to bed now.

57
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,610
What are you saying... so weird.

58
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,580
I don't want it.  Just go home and eat it.

59
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,550

I am so sorry... You even made time for my interview.

65
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,400
Do you think you can be a working member of society like that?

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,320
You are just plain worthless.

67
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,630
You never had any intention of getting a job, right?

68
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,270
You did this on purpose to embarrass me, didn't you?

69
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,360
I don't even want to see your face.

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,650
Get out of my house.

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,210
<i>- Get me some liquor.
- Yes.</i>

72
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,640
Wow... it's done.

73
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,000
It's hot... hot... hot.... hot!

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,350
Wow, it's so hot.

75
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,230

76
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,470
Hi, Hiroto-kun.  What are you doing?

77
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,780
Oh that's right, you're practicing.  It's close to the nationals.

78
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,900
Did you see my e-mail?

79
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,690
That's right.  It was appendicitis.

80
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,320
Me?  I'm...

81
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,460
Wait a second.

82
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,880
Right now... I'm... Whoa!

83
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,880
I was surprised.

84
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,330
- You ate pizza?
- Yup.

85
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,430

Serotonin exercise.

Why?

140
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,560
I told you before.  If serotonin is produced, you'll be mentally and physically balanced.

141
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,660
Because you lack in serotonin, you're having marital misunderstandings.

He's been saying that we have to go over there and compete while we're young.

154
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,050

158
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,620
When I told him that a friend of mine won in a regional competition, he told us to  bring him, too.

159
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,550
I'm really thankful but, I can't.

160

<i>Wait a second.</i>

171
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,880
Isn't diabetes caused by food we eat everyday?

172
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,050
When your husband's work is so stressful,

173
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,710
you've been working part time, neglecting housework. That's why things like this happened.

174

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,730
Not once, has she served something pre-made at the store,
or a take out.

177
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,380
How many wives are like that these days?

178
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:28,560
I am satisfied with her.  If you keep attacking her, I can't let you stay with us even though you are my mom.

179
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,960
Please leave.

180
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,340
<i>Ko-chan.</i>

181
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,690
I understand.

182
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,430
Mother.

183
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,580
Leave her alone.

184
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,770
That was a bit too harsh.

185
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,450
It's ok.

186
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,740
More importantly, I haven't properly apologized to you yet.

187
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,130
It's ok.

188
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,470
I did things I couldn't tell you as well.

189
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,680
What happened?

190
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,920
Let's talk about it after you're discharged from here.

191
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,710
To tell you the truth,  I have ED (erectile dysfunction).

192
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,000
What?

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,340
When I asked the doctor, it's a possible symptom of diabetes.

194
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,940
Oh really?

195
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,570
I thought I should have come to the hospital sooner.

196
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,840
You should have told me.

197
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,960
How could I told my wife... How embarrassing.

198
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,750
I guess so.

199
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,530
Then I'll go.

200
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,420
I have to stop mother from leaving.

201
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,970
If Kakeru said that to me in the future, I would be really depressed.

202
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,640
Ko-chan, you didn't really mean it like that anyway, right?

203
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,210
See you.

204
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,590
Welcome back, my child!!!

205
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,400
Where were you?  Welcome back.

206
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm happy for you.

207
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,970
Thank you.

208
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,580
I'm home.

209
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,820
Welcome back.

210
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,240
<i>- You're going to back up your wife?  I got it!</i>
- Grandma...

211
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,820
- What's wrong?
<i>- I won't ever ask again!</i>

212
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,170
Wait a minute.

213
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,030
Mother?

214
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,400
How pitiful...

215
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,550
Even though I have two sons, they both treat me like a nuisance.

216
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,410
Are you going back to Saitama?

217
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,350
How can I got back there?

218
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,190
I would rather just go on a trip and die by the roadside.

219
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,930
Mother!

220
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,260
Then, stay here.

221
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,640
What?

222
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,790
I've had tough time dealing with you just because you are "mother-in-law,"

223
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,510
and was always thinking about running away from you.

224
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,400
But, when I think about it,

225
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,360
you are the mother of someone I love.

226
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,450
We may not always get along, but I'm sure there are some things we could agree on.

227
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,650
Why don't we each try to find those things?

228
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,790
Miki-san...

229
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,130
Once you get to know the real me, you better not run away.

230
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,230
Oh... Miki-san...

231
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,000
When will your husband be discharged?

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,910
Tomorrow.

233
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,570
That's quick.  That's great.

234
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,910
It was just appendicitis.

235
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,470
I just went there and gave him this food.

236
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,740
He said my cooking is the best in the world.  He's a fool, right?

237
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,900
How nice.

238
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,580
I'm not being lovey-dovey.

239
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,780
Yes, you are.

240
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,670
No...

241
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,080
Yes.

242
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,110
Sorry I'm late.

243
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,960
No worries.  Miki just arrived now as well.

244
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,500
<i>So, come on.  Have a seat.</i>

245
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,010
Cheers!

246
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,970
So good.

247
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,690
Looks good. Let's eat.

248
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,680
Thank you for this food.

249
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,720
So,  Sakura, what did you prepare?

250
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,830
Oh me?  This...

251
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,360
Takoyaki.

252
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,280
Wow, it's takoyaki!

253
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,320
- Looks so good.
- I knew I smelled the sauce.

254
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,030
Eat it while it's hot.

255
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,990
Thank you.

256
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,120
♪ Takoyaki mambo

257
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,920
So good!

258
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,220
I haven't had takoyaki for a long time.

259
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,970
So spicy.

260
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,890
Spicy.

261
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,570
Water, water, water...

262
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:23,480
Here you go.

263
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,540
Hey, What did you put in it?

264
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,100
It's mustard.  So much of it!

265
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,720
It's so spicy hot.

266
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,760
So funny.  That's right.  This is called
a Russian roulette Takoyaki.

267
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,120
You should've told us beforehand.

268
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,220
Right.  Otherwise, anyone would think it's regular takoyaki.

269
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,170
Besides,

270
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,010
why are there two of them?

271
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,430
It wouldn't be a Russian roulette unless there's only one.

272
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,130
But, it's in all of them.

273
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,740
What?

274
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,600
But there's just one on this plate, so you can relax and eat them.

275
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,690
How can I relax?

276
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,830
I laughed so hard.  That was funny.

277
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,610
So hot!

278
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,060
<i>I can still taste it.</i>

279
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,690
<i>So hot.</i>

280
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,970
It's good.

281
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,220
Is it good?

282
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,090
That's good.

283
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,260
No way.  You got it?

284
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,660
- It's hot.
- Really?

285
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,390
So hot.

286
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,710
You're a fool!

287
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,360
You got it on the first try?

288
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,940
You got it because you pulled such a prank.

289
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,460
What a probability.

290
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,950
The possibility was 9/1.

291
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,520
It's so funny.

292
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,400
You fool.

293
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,520
Let's drink, Shima-san.

294
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,750
Cheers.

295
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,880
Listen to this.  My mother-in-law...

296
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,710
She wants me to get her a new futon set if she lives
with us permanently.

297
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,020
So, up until now, she was holding back before?

298
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,090
She's sort of cute.

299
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,210
She's not cute at all!

300
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,340
<i>- She is cute.
- No she is not.</i>

301
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,770
That's right.

302
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,570
Excuse me.

303
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,320
Hey...

304
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,630
Here you go.

305
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:27,000
<i>Before we knew it, we've spent a quarter
of a century together, as friends.</i>

306
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,600
Welcome.

307
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,330
Welcome.

308
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,050
Sorry.

309
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,870
Ah, you... you're Sakura-san's boyfriend...

310
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,140
Ah! Miki-san's...

311
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,340
Hello!

312
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,520
What a coincidence to meet you here.

313
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,930
By any chance, are you proposing to her?

314
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,710
I want to know how much they cost since
I have never looked at them.

315
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,170
Is that right?

316
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,670
Can I ask you something?

317
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,570
Go ahead.

318
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,620
Why did you decide to marry your wife?

319
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,130
That's simply because I wanted to be with her
for the rest of my life.

320
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,270
How embarrassing. By the way, what do you think of this?

321
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,500
This. It may be too bulky?

322
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,680
It is cute.

323
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,560
I know, right?

324
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,670
<i>I like this one. I think I can afford this if I work a little harder.</i>

325
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,350
What is the matter?

326
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,460
You are spacing out.

327
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,120
Ken-chan, since when did you notice?

328
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,910
Notice what?

329
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,270
The fact... that I like Kin.

330
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,810
- Rintaro?
- To be honest, I'm confused since I've never realized it at all.

331
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,020
But everyone told me so.

332
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:16,140
Choko-chan, you, Kin's boyfriend and Kasumi.

333
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,700
I have denied it every time, like "No way."

334
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,670
This time, I found myself not being able to deny it.

335
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:28,680
You don't need to force yourself to settle your feelings.

336
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,460
It can be said about everything,

337
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,260
but you can't always make a black-or-white
judgement about things.

338
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,720
As long as she is happy, I will be okay.

339
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,580
I'm not trying to sound cool, but Kin is ridiculously honest, right?

340
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,230
She is too innocent and straightforward.

341
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,180
I don't want to see her get hurt.

342
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,910
Yeah, that's it.

343
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,460
When she's near me and comes into sight,  she makes me worry.

344
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,000
That's why I end up meddling in her business for no reason.

345
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,650
But, Sakura-chan has not noticed that side of you.

346
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,710
After all, you two could be very similar.

347
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,690
<i>Here, please eat.</i>

348
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,340
Would you like coffee?

349
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,960
Yes.

350
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,770
Sorry for the other day.

351
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,420
The other day?

352
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,200
At SOBAR, to Kazumi-san...

353
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,750
It's ok, it's in the past now.

354
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,510
Then, with Kazumi-san...?

355
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,500
I'm relieved.

356
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,070
Choko-chan.

357
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,620
Please look.

358
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,650
It's scar of a burn I got when I was young.

359
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,130
Because of this scar, I haven't been able to fall in love.

360
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,240
Several years later, I was told that the scar will not be noticeable

361
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,590
if I had a surgery at a hospital my dad found, but I refused it.

362
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,340
At that time, I was rejected by a guy I liked,  and I wanted to believe this scar was the reason.

363
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,490
I was hoping he would feel guilty every time he saw this scar.

364
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,220
So, I chose not to have it healed.

365
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,770
But, after that, I met you, Rintaro-san.

366
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,340
I should've fixed my scar, since I fell in love with you like this.

367
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,080
Choko-chan.

368
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,040
I understand, so...

369
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,210
Make love to me.

370
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,980
Once is just okay.  Make me a woman.

371
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,290
Sorry.

372
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,480
I can't do that.

373
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,310
Why?

374
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,130
is it because of this ugly scar?

375
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:10,090
That's not it. Your scar isn't ugly or anything.

376
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:17,580
I am more worried about the scar in your heart caused by your anxiety about the scar.

377
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:33,140
Choko-chan, you are a wonderful girl,

378
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,370
who is delicate, sensitive and really considerate.

379
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,680
Be more confident in yourself.

380
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:45,960
The scar would mean nothing to a guy who loves you.

381
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:51,300
Someday, I'm sure you're going to meet such a guy.

382
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:14,010
I got it.  You're saying I'm just too needy.

383
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,950
Choko-chan.

384
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:19,250
I would have been happy if I did it once. If I did,

385
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,910
I could have done without falling in love ever again.

386
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:46,560
I was really scared to watch you ride at first. But recently, how should I say it...

387
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,900
It is really refreshing to see you nail tricks.

388
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,870
Here you go.

389
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,360
Thanks.

390
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,790
It is refreshing. You should try it, too, Sakura-san.

391
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:01,600
No way!  I'm afraid to ride even a normal bike. How am I suppose to jump or bounce it?

392
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,360
You don't need to jump or bounce it.

393
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,100
- Really?
- You should be fine.

394
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:11,550
I used to ride bikes before. I think I can manage to ride a bike.

395
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,310
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

396
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,150
Okay. Woo.

397
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,930
Oh, oh, oh.

398
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,030
Sakura-san.

399
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,450
Yes?

400
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,080
If I win the next national competition...

401
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,220
Yes?

402
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,580
Will you marry me?

403
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,500
If I win the next competition, I'll get a job and keep the bike riding as a hobby.

404
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,120
I know our life won't be easy at first, but I'll do my best.

405
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,240
Thank you.

406
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,390
I'm truly happy.

407
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,310
But,  I'll be 40 soon.

408
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,020
I know that.

409
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,330
No, you don't.

410
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,760
Anyway, I don't want you to let go of your dream for me, so-

411
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,520
I... want to have a kid like you.

412
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,250
A child who is innocent, straightforward and cute.

413
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,920
You and I are going to adore the child dearly.

414
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,440
I want the child to experience a happy childhood
that I couldn't have.

415
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,180
To do that, I need you.

416
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,190
My dream...

417
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,050
please make it come true.

418
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,140
Please.

419
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,190
Yes.

420
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,870
Yay!

421
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:55,250
My heart was pounding so fast. I thought I was going to die.

422
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:06,590

Good morning.

429
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,110
Happy birthday.

430
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,890
Thank you.

431
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
See you.

432
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,510
Have a good day at work.

433
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,160
- I'm off.
- See you.

434
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,660
Good morning.

435
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,660
Good morning!

436
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:00,480
Sakura-san. Did your boyfriend walk you to work?

437
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,170
How envious.

438
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,820
Why are you so lovey-dovey?

439
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,070
Even if you ask why... Oh?

440
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,320
Oh? Wait! Are you serous?

441
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,190
Could it be...

442
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,900
An engagement ring?

443
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,050
It's blinding.

444
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,560
Yesterday, did somthing happen with Chiyoko?

445
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,570
I received so many calls and texts from her.

446
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,210
I told her honestly that I couldn't date her.

447
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:50,990
I didn't want to hurt her, but I didn't think I could make someone happy with an impure motive.

448
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,250
Impure?

449
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:59,470
You did it to protect Sakura-san, so I think your motive was pretty pure.

450
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:05,000
Choko-chan will be hurt if she finds out the truth. Sakura, too.

451
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,260
I'll protect Sakura-san...

452
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,980
We decided to get married.

453
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,730
You should give up on her once and for all.

454
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,690
I'm leaving then.

455
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,820
Good morning.

456
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,280
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

457
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,160
Morning.

458
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,000
Okay.

459
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,520
- Are you spending time with your boyfriend alone?
- Yup.

460
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:55,950
It seems he made plans for us, so we're going to meet at SOBAR after work.

461
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,380
How envious.

462
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,770
Until recently, I didn't want to turn 40.

463
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,140
But, I don't feel so bad anymore.

464
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,510
It's natural.  You have such a nice boyfriend.

465
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,960
Not only that, recently, I've been thinking that
aging is not that bad.

466
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,950
I've gained experiences and confidence. Then I realized

467
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:24,420
my life is much easier than my young years when I had worries and was not sure of many things.

468
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,530
So I will proudly become 40 with my head held high.

469
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,470
If you have a  strong sense of self-identity,

470
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:35,330
and move forward towards what you believe, you won't be ashamed of getting old.  Or rather,

471
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,090
you will stand tall with confidence.

472
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,840
Oh, my!... Oh, you are still here?

473
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,940
Let's get to work.

474
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,380
Hey, let's get to work. Oh...hey, what are you doing?

475
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,210
How did you get here without me noticing?

476
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,630
I was here before your "youth's opinion" speech.
<i>(a speech contest by young Japanese people)</i>

477
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,530
Youth's opinion? What era are we in?

478
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,140
Oh, my bad. It was a middle-aged person's opinion.

479
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:59,410
You too will soon turn 40.  Look, your belly is bulging.

480
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,490
- It's getting bigger.
- Let's have a meeting.

481
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,040
- Line up.
- Meeting! Meeting!

482
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,960
- Line up!
- Why don't you listen to me?

483
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,230
<i>Hey, hey, hey. Farty-fart. Farty-fart.</i>

484
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,910
Kin!

485
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,070
Okay, let's start.

486
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:23,450
<i>This age when I can do what I like... I kind of like it.</i>

487
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,850
<i>I brought this.
Private Party - From 21:00 today </i>

488
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,730
- What is it?
- I wasn't sure if I should bring a liquor to a bar.

489
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,940
Champagne!

490
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,450
Here you go. I hope you like these.

491
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,760
Cute! You baked it, Miki-chan?

492
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,270
Yeah, with my daughter.

493
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,200
If she can bake this kind  of thing,

494
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,850
I'm sure she will be a great wife like you.

495
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,550
I'm sorry that I can't bake anything.

496
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,950
Shima-chan, you are special since you are one of us.

497
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,240
One of you?

498
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,130
You will wander around seeking for love
the rest of your life, like me.

499
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,150
Stop joking.

500
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,290
I don't want to wander around seeking for love
the rest of my life.

501
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,680
I decided to have a matchmaking date for marriage.

502
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,630
- What?
- Shima-san, are you sure?

503
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,100
I just posted on my Facebook page to look for applicants.

504
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,100
And, I received tons of responses.  I guess people have hard time finding partners.

505
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,660
It's a hassle to pare down the candidates, so I'm meeting all of them. Let me use this place, Ken-chan.

506
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,890
That's fine, but...

507
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,730
I thought Shima-chan was one of us.

508
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,150
- I hope you can find someone nice.
- Yup.

509
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,130
♪ Happy birthday to me.

510
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,720

511
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,090

512
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,720

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,020
Sorry.

514

517
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,110
Our printer is broken.

518
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,910
They won't make it in time for next week's campaign unless we mail them by tomorrow.

00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,990
So, write down addresses and mail them all.

520
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,050
Wait a minute.

521
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,840
You know, today is my birthday.

522
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,920

525
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,660
It'll be fine. If he loves you, he will patiently wait for you.

526
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,540
Thanks.

527
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,700
"Thanks"?  Hey, what's with you?

528
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,960
At least you should help.  There are so many.

529
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,510
I need to stop by at headquartera. See you.

530
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,640
Hey, wait. There are so many.

531
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,800
- I'm tired of this.
- So long.

532
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,880
Hey, Non-chan.

533
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,030
Yes? What can I do for you?

534
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,200
Help me with these.

535
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,740
Sorry, my mom is visiting me from my hometown.

536
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,030
I'm sorry.

537
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,600
I guess you should go home.

538
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,850
Haru-chan!

539
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,120
I'm sorry. I meeting my high school friend,
who I haven't seen for a year.

540
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,300
You should go then.

541
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,830
- Ah...
- Sorry, my head hurts, my head!

542
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,580
I'm sorry.

543
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,540
Hey...

544
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,760
Ah, hello?

545
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,900
No one wants to help me?

546
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,860
Sakura-san seems upset.

547
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,950
What can we do? This is part of the plan.

548
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,530
Why do I have to work overtime on my birthday?

549
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,610
Seriously, I can't believe this.

550
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,010
President.

551
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,110
Transfer request?

552
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm sorry for the short notice, but please
transfer me to another salon.

553
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,260
Why, all of a sudden?

554
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,510
I'm sorry if this caused any inconvenience, but

555
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:18,040
I think it is high time she (Sakura) got in charge of that salon.

556
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,340
♪ When it is past midnight,

557
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,860
♪ I will deliver it to you the first thing.

558
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,340

00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,470

560
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,470
Good work, everyone.

561
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,620
Oh, you, too.

562
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,480
You decorated well.

563
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,160
Isn't this perfect?

564
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,210
Around what time is Sakura coming?

565
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,100
She should be here soon.

566
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,490
Then, why don't we drink while we wait?

567
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,170
Good idea.

568
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,860
- Let's drink.
- Please serve everyone a beer.

569
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,380
Yeah!

570
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,550
Ken-chan, Ken-chan

571
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,860
About what we talked about earlier...

572
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,670
You mean the matchmaking?

573
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,790
You're having a matchmaking date?

574
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,740
That's right. Group matchmaking.

575
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,560
It's a pain to do it so many times, so I'm going
to meet them all at once.

576
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,320
Will it be okay to have 30 guys come here when it is closed?

577
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,480
30 guys?

578
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,860
That many?

579
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,100
30 guys will come... Wow.

580
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,550
Ken-chan, Ken-chan, do you want to be a judge?

581
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,080
I'll do it!

582
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,150
Shima-san and Ken-chan seem to get along,

583
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,530
so, why don't you date?

584
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,960
What?

585
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,610
Did I say something strange?

586
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:29,700
Tachibana-san, Ken-chan's gay!

587
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,070
Come on, you're funny, huh.

588
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,500
Oh no, Tachibana-san, you really don't know?

589
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,810
Eh?

590
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,320
You're childhood friends, right?

591
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,900
If so, you would know, wouldn't you?

592
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,520
That's true.

593
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,020
Isn't he slow?

594
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,250
He might be slow,

595
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,870
but I like that.

596
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,770
Good evening.

597
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,800
Hey, you are here.

598
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,240
Welcome.

599
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,350
I'm sorry to have troubled you the other day.

600
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,730
<i>No worries. I am happy you are out of the hospital now.</i>

601
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,520
Now, everyone is here.

602
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,580
That's right. All we need is to wait for Sakura.

603
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,980
Rintaro, sit here.

604
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,240
Miki-chan, you guys should sit over there.

605
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,800
And then...

606
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,130
Um, excuse me.

607
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,670
Before that, may I have your attention?

608
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,860
What?

609
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:24,710
Miki, I am really sorry to have troubled you this time.

610
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:31,050
Come on, what are you saying in public?

611
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,970
We've been married for 13 years,

612
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,680
and it's been 20 years since we met.

613
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,110
But I haven't even properly proposed to you.

614
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:48,780
I've only had eyes for you since we met 20 years ago.

615
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:54,230
You have been the only one for me, and it will never change.

616
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,490
I might give you much trouble going forward,

617
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:01,980
but I want you to trust me and stay by my side.

618
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,630
Oh. I can't get this out.

619
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:11,210
Let me say this now.   Will you marry me?

620
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,610
You're holding it backward.

621
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,410
<i>That's right. This way.</i>

622
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,290
Please marry me.

623
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,020
Stupid ! We are already married.

624
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,920
I'm doing this over.

625
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,410
How much did you pay for this?

626
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,310
Don't ask me that now.

627
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,450
It's very pretty.

628
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,700
Thanks.

629
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,610
Does that mean... it's okay?

630
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,980
Of course!

631
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,940
Yay!

632
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,490
- It's great!
- Yeah.

633
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,300
Okay. Ah, it's done!

634
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,760
My shoulders became stiff.

635
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,860
Oh, right. I should get going.

636
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,920
I must hurry.

637
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,210
What's going on, Choko-chan?

638
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,830
I came to tell you something.

639
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,770
What... is it?

640
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,630
Don't you think she's being awfully late?

641
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,890
Yeah, I'm getting sleepy.

642
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,910
You drank too much.

643
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,830
Rintaro, how much work did you give her?

644
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,870
It was  not something that should take so long.

645
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:57,370
I'll go look.

646
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:01,620
Ah! She's here!

647
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,230

00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,650
Hey, what's the matter?

656
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,400
Sakura-san?

657
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,380
Is it true?

658
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,830
What?

659
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:58,070
I heard you were pretending to love me... Is that true?

660
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:10,040
That day... when I went to a matchmaking party,

661
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,330
you approached me because Choko-chan asked you?

662
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,600
Even though you didn't even like me,

663
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:31,920
you went to the hotel, pretending to like me, for Choko-chan?

664
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,050
Hiroto-kun.

665
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,100
Answer me.

666
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,030
- Sakura!
- Sakura!

667
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,390
I told you it mustn't be found out!

668
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,540
Are you alright, Rintaro?

669
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,620
You're the worst.

670
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,020
It's none of your business.

671
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,690
This is a problem between Sakura-san and I.

672
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,750
It's my business, too.

673
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,990
