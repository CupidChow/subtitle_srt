1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,430
<i>My friends want to meet you, Hiroto-kun.</i>

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,020
<i>Fine. I want to meet them, too. Let's set a date.</i>

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,880
<i>Really?</i>

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,970
<i>Yup. Also, I settled things with Momo.</i>

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,650
<i>Watch out!</i>

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,180
<i>Tachibana!</i>

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,620
<i>Too loud. You almost blew out my eardrum.<i></i></i>

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,880
<i>You can't even drink.</i>

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,230
<i>I want to get drunk.</i>

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,440
<i>You already are.</i>

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,840
<i>Whose fault is it that I can't fall in love? </i>

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,880
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,510
<i>Chiyoko.</i>

14
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:38,280
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,910
Hello, Mom? Is there something wrong?

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,500
Satoshi? He's not here.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,390
Hello?

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,570
<i>- Hey!
- It's fine, right?</i>

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,460
<i>- Just a little. Only a kiss.
- No.</i>

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,650
<i>- Someone is coming.
- There's  no one here.</i>

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,810
Onee-chan (big sister)?

22
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:27,190
Satoshi! What are you doing here?

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,670
Good evening.

24
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,010
Good evening.

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,980
Huge!

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,110
Where did I put the tea leaves? I forgot since I normally don't brew tea.

27
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,340
How about water? Well, that's kind of weird, right?

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,740
I will do it.

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,680
- Really?
- Yes.

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,660
- Thank you.
- Sure.

31
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,230
- You haven't changed Nee-chan (big sis).
- Hey, hey, you.

32
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,460
Rie-chan, right? She seems nice.

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,220
Where did you meet her?

34
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,530
- Do you want to know?
- Yup.

35
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,430
I met her at a hostess bar.

36
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,470
- Hostess bar?
- The more I talked to her, the more I realized how nice she was.

37
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,950
Then, we started going out.

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,570
- And then?
- I want to marry her.

39
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,970
You want to marry her! But, how long have you been dating?

40
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,960
Two months... almost.

41
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,570
It's been only two months, but you want to get married?

42
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,660
Time isn't important when it comes to love.

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,520
Well, I guess you're right.

44
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,210
But, when I told Mom, she was... (furious).

45
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,220
- Of course.
- So I left home.

46
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,630
What? Do you mean you eloped?

47
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,660
- That's right.
- That's right? But...

48
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,450
Ah...

49
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,890
Who could be visiting you this late at night?

50
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,100
I wonder... who.

51
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,330
- Ah!
- Hello?

52
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,410
- You don't need to look.
- Excuse me, but who are you?

53
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,050
- Well, I am Saeki.
- Saeki-san?

54
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,450
You don't need to answer.

55
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,370
- Nee-chan, look!
- What is it?

56
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,130
- Which Saeki-san is that?
- There's nothing there.

57
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:15,180
<i>- Leave it alone.
- Why? Let him in.
- No. Don't open it.</i>

58
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,600
<i>Don't open it, you idiot!</i>

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,050
He stood me up today.

60
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,200
I'm sorry. I couldn't come because I had an important  matter to tend to.

61
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,310
- How old are you?
- Hey, Satoshi. What are you saying?

62
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,190
- Well, I'm 24.
- 24? What?

63
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,450
Wait. Nee-chan, you are 40, right?

64
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,870
- 39.
- 39? It's the same. Even for 39.

65
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,520
Take 24 from 39... how much is that, Rie?

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,000
- 15.
- You are 15 years younger than her.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,710
- I am 30 right now, so...
- Don't talk about age anymore.

68
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,850
Okay then. Just come in.

69
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,580
- Hey, why are you pulling him?
- Say, sorry to intrude.

70
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,120
- You can't even say "Sorry to intrude"?
- Don't say such things, poor thing.

71
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,510
What do you do for a living?

72
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,870
What do <i>YOU</i> do for a living?

73
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,530
It doesn't matter what I do.

74
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,490
What is your job?

75
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,050
Hey, Satoshi. It's Mom.

76
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,810
What? How did she find out so quickly?

77
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,700
Of course, she knows.

78
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,230
<i>- Don't answer it, okay?
- What?</i>

79
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,570
<i>You are a hopeless guy.</i>

80
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,560
- Ah, thank you. I owe you one.
- What are you planning to do now?

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,050
<i>- I will look for a job here.
- What?</i>

82
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,840
- Are you being serious?
- Of course I am.

83
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,210
That's a given. I wanted to follow you to Tokyo and work after graduating from high school.

84
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,180
But Mom wanted me to stay in Fukuoka.

85
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,320
She's always had such high hopes for you.

86
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,330
It's been so bothersome.

87
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,220
On top of that, she interferes with our marriage.
I can't stand it anymore.

88
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,870
I know how you feel, but...

89
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,140
Wait. If we don't pick up, she'll keep calling all night.

90
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,350
Go ahead and answer it.

91
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,940
- Are you sure?
- You can answer it.

92
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,490
But remember...

93
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,340
to tell her I am not coming home.

94
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,340
- I got it.
- Tell her clearly.

95
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,670
- I am not coming home.
- Hello?

96
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,700
- Mom? Hi.
- Tell her I'm not coming back.

97
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,850
Yeah, he is here.

98
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,400
I'm sorry to involve you in this mess.

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,920
I'm sorry to intrude during such a busy time.

100
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,940
Why are you dating my sister who is 15 years older than you?

101
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,700
What do you like about my sister?

102
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,540
Ah, well...

103
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,630
If you are fooling around with her, please break up
with her quickly.

104
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,930
Hey, Satoshi-kun.

105
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,220
I troubled her so many times, so I want her to be happy more than anyone.

106
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,050
Anyone who makes my sister unhappy, I won't forgive him.

107
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,440
- <i> So I'm telling you, he is an adult.</i>
- Yes.

108
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,670
Let Satoshi do as he wishes.

109
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,250
What?

110
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,070
Yeah, I know. I know.

111
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,710
I'll call you again. Okay. Bye.

112
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,240
What did she say?

113
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,730
She will talk to your boss about taking some days off from your part time job. But in-exchange,

114
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,440
she told me to persuade you to come home.

115
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,680
She's doing needless things again.

116
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,270
I've repeatedly told her, I'm not going back to Fukuoka.

117
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,790
So, what did Rie-chan's parents say?

118
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,140
Her parents are okay with it, since they are divorced.

119
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,440
She wasn't even born in Fukuoka.

120
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,450
After her mom remarried, she moved around a lot by herself.

121
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,570
I see.

122
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,030
So, you must be tired.

123
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,720
- Let's rest up for today.
- What? Wait. What are you saying?

124
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,890
We are going to have an Othello match now.

125
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,370
- Othello match?
- That's right. Have a seat.

126
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,380
Big Sis, don't tell me you've forgotten.

127
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,600
When you were in high school,  you used to play seriously against me when I was just an elementary student.

128
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,150
After 20 years, I want revenge!

129
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,950
Okay. Sit down.

130
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,190
On the floor. You can't even reach Othello from there.

131
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,290
Hey.

132
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,460
I wonder who locked the door with the chain.

133
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,840
Of course, Mother-in-law did.

134
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,470
She knew I went out, so she locked me out on purpose.

135
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,170
Really unbelievable.

136
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,710
Mom wouldn't do something like that.

137
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,510
How long is she going to stay here?

138
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,840
I am at my limit.

139
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,920
Okay, okay. I'll call my big brother tomorrow. I'm going to bed, okay? Good night.

140
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,760
<i>Rie-chan.</i>

141
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,060
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

142
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,380
Have a good night sleep.

143
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,500
Okay then, we should also...

144
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,780
I'll turn the light off.

145
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,450
- Sorry to intrude.
- Sorry to intrude.

146
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,980
I wonder how long it has been since I last played Othello.
It was fun.

147
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,080
Yes, it was. I was shocked at how good you were.

148
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,980
You can seek revenge on me anytime.

149
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,500
Pisses me off. I will win next time for sure.

150
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,990
Your brother said the same thing.

151
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,950
Because we are siblings.

152
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,590
- I am envious of you.
- What?

153
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,950
I don't have a sibling I can rely or be relied on.

154
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,350
When you touch me like that, it makes me want to do it.

155
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,730
Eh? No, you can't. No.

156
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,820
- Then, how about a kiss?
- We can't.

157
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,190
No. We can't.

158
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,040
<i>- It's fine, right?
- I said no.</i>

159
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,090
<i>Hey, not my ear.</i>

160
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,560
Sorry, makes me want to do it.

161
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,570
Satoshi! If you want to do it, go to a hotel.

162
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,920
<i>What are you doing on my bed?</i>

163
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,790
<i>Satoshi! </i>

164
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,190
I can't sleep.

165
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,220
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

166
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,820
I'm so happy that you are next to me when I wake up.

167
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,080
What is it?

168
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,560
Sorry.

169
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,930
Why are you laughing? What happened?

170
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,900
It's nothing, so don't worry about it.

171
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,330
I'm going to run (for training) since the competition is so close.

172
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,790
Eh?

173
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,800
I'll get going.

174
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,630
What is it?

175
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,900
<i>If seeing someone's sleeping face can make you smile, everything is all right.</i>

176
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,300
<i>[Last Cinderella]

177
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,180
<i>Where are you going?</i>

178
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,110
<i>Wow, that's so great.</i>

179
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,350
- What is it?
- Sorry.

180
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,280
<i>Your little brother is here?</i>

181
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,450
<i>Rintaro-san!</i>

182
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,460
<i>Since your little brother is from Fukuoka,</i>

183
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,590
<i>is he "fukuyoka" (plump)?</i>

184
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,050
<i>That was funny.</i>

185
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,440
Choko-chan, thanks for waiting.  Today you're getting
a hair cut, right?

186
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,680
Yes.  Before that, can I have a minute?

187
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,480
Eh?

188
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,330
I am so sorry for the other day.

189
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,650
You don't have to be so formal about it.

190
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,390
And... please take these.

191
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,010
What are they?

192
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,610
Please.

193
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,440
These are Lions vs Eagles (baseball) tickets, right behind the home plate!

194
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,580
She said she got them from her father's acquaintance.

195
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,170
And she gave them to you, huh?

196
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:52,980
Yeah.

197
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,410
What a waste.

198
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,430
What do you mean?

199
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,420
Well... if it was me, I would go myself.

200
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,430
I think Choko-chan likes you.

201
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,830
<i>I think so, too.</i>

202
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,460
She is always watching you through the mirror.

203
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,420
No way... Really?

204
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,450
I never noticed.

205
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,350
<i>Are you shocked?</i>

206
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,530
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

207
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,420
- <i>[Part timers wanted]
- They only want young people here...</i>

208
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,440
Thank you.

209
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,030
It's so difficult to find a job at this age.

210
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,770
I don't think so.

211
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,470
Why did you start doing bike competitions?

212
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:40,710
Ah... when I was in elementary school, my mom just happened to take me to a competition.

213
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,390
And when I got interested in it and started doing it, I got hooked.

214
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,640
So you turned your dream into your job.

215
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,350
I guess so.

216
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,750
Are you able to make a living from that?

217
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,560
It's just that it's a world I have no knowledge of.

218
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,360
Even as a pro, I just wonder how much they earn.

219
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,520
I don't think this is a case but...

220
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,580
you aren't relying on my sister's income, are you?

221
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,630
- I'm not...
- That's great.

222
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:22,850
That's great.  My sister has been sending money
home for a long time.

223
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,420
I want her to live in comfort.

224
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,910
<i>Even though you are younger, you need to be financially stable.</i>

225

226
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,200
You left it on...

227
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,220
<i>I'm watching it.</i>

228
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,010
Mother, you were nodding off.

229
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,740
I was watching it.  Put it back on.

230
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,070
Sorry.

231
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,630
Hurry up.

232
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,740
Sakura-san...

233
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,590
My legs...

234
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,610
Ouch...

235
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,960
I'll be waiting at our usual place.

236
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,920
See you later.

237
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,640
Good work everyone.

238
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,610
Good work.

239
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,540
What a coincidence.

240
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,570
Why?

241
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,050
Sakura-san.  Sakura-san.

242
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,050
Shima-san.  Shima-san.

243
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,500
Shut up.  Don't follow me.

244
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,370
<i>I don't think you should be doing that.</i>

245
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,380
<i>Mind your own business.</i>

246
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,770
<i>You shouldn't have just a physical relationship.</i>

247
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,690
You're going to get hurt.

248
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,490
What do you know?

249
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,850
How would you know how I feel?

250
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,460
No, I don't know.

251
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,740
But, you are an important person.

252
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,880
For Miki, and for me, too.

253
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,480
So I can't leave you alone.

254
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,760
People who like me say things like that.

255
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,180
I like you.

256
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,560
If Miki wasn't around, I'm not sure what would have happened.

257
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,680
I'm going to tell Miki.

258
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,720
You are getting scared.

259
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,410
Don't say things that you don't want Miki to hear.

260
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,960
I want a drink.  Treat me.

262
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,100
Ok.  Let's go.

263
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,840
Sakura-san, that was...

264
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,320
Looks like they are arguing.

265
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,190
<i>- Welcome!
- Welcome.</i>

266
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,600
Why would my friend be out with my friend's husband?

267
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,880
- Eh?
- Because they are married?

268
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,840
That's not it!

269
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,720
What?

270
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,700
There's friend A and friend B.

271
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,350
Friend A was out with friend B's husband.

272
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,990
Not only that, they came out of a hotel.
Do you know what that means?

273
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,630
Adultery?

274
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,670
Right?

275
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,740
It would only be natural to think that.

276
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,380
But why? They just met each other.

277
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,020
I am starting to get confused.

278
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,320
That means, Miki-san's husband may be having
an affair with Shima-san.

279
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,520
What?

280
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,280
I never said that!

281
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,800
But they came out of a hotel together, right?

282
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,800
Well. First, you should ask her in person.

283
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,810
How can I ask that?

284
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,490
What if they were really having an affair?

285
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,680
You can figure that out after finding out the truth.

286
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,910
It's too risky to judge based on your speculation.

287
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,280
Especially, someone who is precious to you.

288
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,640
Ah,  delicious!

289
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,190
<i>That tickles!</i>

290
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,200
<i>Come on. Hold still. I don't want to hurt you.</i>

291
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,220
And?

292
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,090
What did Shohei say?

293
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,720
He can't come to pick you up, but he told me to let you do whatever you please.

294
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,080
How pathetic of him.

295
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,050
He just follows his wife's orders.

296
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,330
<i>I see.</i>

297
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,080
You've got to be kidding.

298
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,250
Okay, stretch out while you breathe in.

299
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,300
Breathe out. Switch to your left side.

300
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,450
Breathe in. Back to the right.

301
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,050
Breathe out. Switch sides.

302
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,470
<i>- Hold the position.</i>
- I was really shocked to see that.

303
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,170
I almost vomited.

304
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,870
I knew he was somewhat of a mama's boy

305
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,350
but I didn't think he was that bad.

306
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,030
Hey, Sakura. Are you listening?

307
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,380
I'm listening.

308
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,470
Really? You are acting odd today.

309
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,060
Ah! Did something happen with your boyfriend?

310
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,900
No, nothing happened.

311
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,750
You guys, we are in the middle of the session.

312
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,720
I'm going to get water.

313
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,190
I said, we are in a session.

314
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,850
Come here.

315
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,300
What?

316
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,090
Yesterday, what were you doing with Miki's husband?

317
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,980
Eh?

318
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,540
I saw you two arguing in front of a hotel.

319
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,560
Could it be...

320
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,360
that you are having an affair with Miki's husband?

321
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,100
No way!

322
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,060
How could I possibly do that?

323
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,240
But you guys came out of a hotel together. If Miki had seen that, she would've been suspicious.

324
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,980
You're right.

325
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,590
Trust me. I haven't done anything wrong.

326
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,950
Okay, I believe you. Go, go.

327
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,390
Okay.

328
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,560
<i>Okay, today's session ends here.</i>

329
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,540
<i>Please return your yoga mats.<i></i></i>

330
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:31,360
<i>You can replace a lover, but you can't replace a friend.</i>

332
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,790
Hiroto.

333
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,350
How do I look?

334
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,100
Looks good.

335
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,490
You always say that.

336
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,800
By the way, you seem to be doing well with Sakura-san.

337
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,070
I'm just following your orders.

338
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,280
If you want to date her for real, you can.

♫ <i>Oh-oh, I will tell you when to go home </i>♫

- Excuse me.
- Yes?

341
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,780
Can I buy a good luck charm?

342
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,040
Good luck?

343
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,820
How about this?

344
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,910
- Ah.
- Hold on.

345
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,520
Oh, just a minute, please.

346
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,910
Hello?

350
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,040
Don't mind me. How is Satoshi-kun doing? Did he find a job?

351
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,520
Well, not yet.

352
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,020
He's been looking all from morning till night.

353
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,270
<i>I see.</i>

354
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,890
I'm sorry to worry you about Satoshi.

355
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,710
What are you saying?

356
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,700
I'm suppose to worry for my love's younger brother.

357
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,420
Okay.

358
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,220
I'll see you tomorrow night at Endoh.

359
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,290
<i>See ya. Bye-bye.</i>

360
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,050
My love's younger brother... what is he saying?

361
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,850
He is acting foolishly.

362
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,980
Ah, what? How did you know?

363
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,330
I wonder why. Good work today.

364
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,580
Can we talk for a bit?

365
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,870
Sure.

366
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,680
♫ <i>Oh-oh, I will tell you when to go home</i> ♫

367
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,230
<i>What? He couldn't get it up?</i>

368
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,720
- Right.
- But he is still young, right?

369
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,280
I was really disappointed.

370
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,620
Men can normally get it up, right?

371
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,080
This is a list of hospitals. They specialize in ED
and accept outpatients.

372
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,210
I know you don't want to, but

373
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,260
you should go to the hospital.

374
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,720
You know, I couldn't get pregnant.

375
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,750
What?

376
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,150
I had always wanted to have children, even before I got married.

377
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,120
My husband wanted kids, too. So we were looking forward to having one.

378
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,470
But I couldn't get pregnant.

379
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,300
We suspected we had fertility issues, but we were reluctant to go to a hospital.

380
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,880
But, I couldn't get pregnant anyway despite
having waited a long time.

381
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,430
So, the relationship between us got strained.

382
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:46,470
In the end, we got divorced for that reason.

383
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,000
It must have been hard for you.

384
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,920
So I want you to be brave and go to a hospital.

385
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,510
Sometimes, I wonder

386
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,270
if I had the courage to go to a hospital then,

387
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,960
things could have turned out differently.

388
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,010
It's not that I still have feelings for my ex-husband.

389
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,790
But, I should've tried harder to conceive a child.

390
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,760
That's my only regret.

391
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,360
Try harder... huh?

392
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,840
Also, this is the last time I'll meet with you alone.

393
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,240
Sakura saw us

394
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,200
when we came out of a hotel.

395
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,160
Gosh!

396
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,330
I should've been more careful.

397
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,310
I'm glad it was only Sakura, but

398
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,330
that could've been Miki.

399
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,530
But, we aren't doing anything wrong.

400
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,490
Are you sure about that?

401
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,740
I'm sorry, but can you go to the gym when I'm not there?

402
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,040
I'll e-mail you the times of my shifts.

403
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,290
Okay.

404
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,070
See you.

405
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,380
Go to the hospital, okay?

406
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,400
Eh? That young man didn't stand up?

407
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,620
Yeah, poor old man. It was priority seat for elders.

408
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,620
Really?

409
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,550
<i>Text Members Only

410
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,420
I guess I'm overthinking.

411
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,230
I looked through his phone.

412
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,320
Choko-chan?

413
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,420
- Hello!
- Hello.

414
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,810
<i>Would you like a beer?</i>

415
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,850
Excuse me.

416
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,430
Rintaro-san, is beer okay for you?

417
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,530
Yeah.

418
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,210
Can I have a beer and an orange juice?

419
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,730
<i>Here you go.</i>

420
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,350
Please.

421
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,670
Thank you.

422
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,710
It's going to be an exciting game.

423
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,270
What's the difference between professional baseball and a high school tournament?

424
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,210
<i>That's... Oh, it's coming.</i>

425
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,470
<i>- Thank you for waiting.
- Thanks.</i>

426
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,010
- Your next competition,  Miki and Shima-san want to come, too.
- Really?

427
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,690
They've never seen BMX. And  they want to meet you,
Hiroto-kun.

428
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,150
I stood them up last time, didn't I?

429
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,430
I have to win 1st place to show them how cool I am.

430
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,870
- Don't tense up so much. Just relax. Relax, okay?
- Okay.

431
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,510
<i>- Welcome.
- This looks delicious.</i>

432
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,690
Ah, Rie-chan. Over here.

433
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,250
- Good evening!
<i>- Good evening.</i>

434
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,430
<i>Do you want to eat something?</i>

435
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,570
<i>Welcome!</i>

436
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,730
Oh my, this is an unusual combination.

437
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,110
Choko-chan, are you alright?

438
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,230
What are you talking about?

439
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,750
I can only see you as a father and a daughter.

440
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,280
Look who's talking?

441
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,880
We went to watch a baseball game.

442
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,540
Rintaro-san is really knowledgeable, so I've learned a lot.

443
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,740
Oh, I see what's going on here.

444
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,400
<i>What's going on?</i>

445
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,080
<i>Well, make yourselves comfortable.</i>

446
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,400
<i>Please, come this way.</i>

447
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,310
<i>Thank you for the meal.</i>

448
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,010
Okay. Oh right!

449
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,990
Let's introduce each other. Er, this is... Wow, welcome.

450
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,990
We have many customers today.

451
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,190
Hey! Satoshi, sit over here.

452
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,590
Good evening.

453
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,450
What? What's wrong?

454
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:56,930
I don't think I can find a job here.

455
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,050
What?

456
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,750
No one wants to hire me.

457
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,030
They look down on me because I'm from the countryside.

458
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,490
Nee-chan, I don't think I'm dressed properly.

459
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,790
I should wear a suit while job hunting.

460
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,750
Say, can I borrow some money?

461
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,750
You know what? Stop being a spoiled-

462
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,430
What did you do that for?

463
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,090
Satoshi-kun, you are too naive.

464
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,350
How much are you going to rely on your sister?

465
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,850
You've relied on her for everything from the beginning.

466
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,130
Now you're asking to borrow money from her?

467
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,870
<i>How can you call this eloping? You are old enough but you still blame your parents for the choices you've made.</i>

468
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,230
<i>You will never be able to support yourself.</i>

469
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,030
We moved to a different location, but nothing has changed.

470
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,070
<i>Rie-chan</i>

471
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,830
Hey, what are you doing?

472
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,410
Idiot!

473
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,690
<i>I wanted to run away from myself</i>

474
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,870
who had lived a humdrum life in the countryside.

475
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,750
I wanted to change myself somehow.

476
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,790
But after I came here,

477
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,930
I was overwhelmed the by big city and the large crowd of people.

478
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,090
Not only that it hasn't changed me,

479
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:22,310
but it made me realize how incapable I am.

480
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,650
Truthfully, I was too naive.

481
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,310
What Rie said was right.

482
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,410
Can you come with me for a bit?

483
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,150
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

484
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,110
Why do you apologize?

485
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,260
I should've told him let's not elope.

486
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,940
I was happy when he told me he would protect me.

487
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,270
I couldn't help myself from agreeing with him.

488
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,070
I am afraid that Satoshi-san ruined his life because of me.

489
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,250
You are wrong.

490
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,650
Satoshi decided on his own. Sit here.

491
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,990
He is surely spoiled and may be pathetic.

492
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,630
But he acted on his own for the first time.

493
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:29,330
In that respect, he has improved.

494
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,850
If you still love Satoshi,

495
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,170
please...

496
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,370
can you watch over him a little more.

497
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,070
Let's drink something.

498
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,030
Wait here, okay?

499
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,110
<i>What should we drink?</i>

500
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,810
<i>Oh? There is nothing.</i>

501
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,570
<i>What should we do?</i>

502
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,730
Let me do it.

503
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,670
Really? Are you sure?

504
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,990
I think I have tea leaves somewhere around here.

505
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,610
- They're right here.
- Oh, here?

506
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,610
I'm working here as a part timer.

507
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,850
Like you said,

508
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,370
riding a bike won't suffice to earn a living.

509
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,150
Please don't tell Sakura-san.

510
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,950
I won't.

511
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,890
- Good work today.
- You, too.

512
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,750
I can't tell her I work part-time because I can't sustain a living otherwise.  That's too pathetic.

513
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,910
When I was 19, I was doing really well since I won a national championship.

514
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,870
After I injured myself, I couldn't perform well.

515
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,370
If my results aren't good in the next competition,

516
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,950
I might have to consider quitting.

517
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,300
The average age of the BMX riders is quite low, you know.

518
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,330
When I heard you were doing bike competitions,

519
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,370
I thought you were a frivolous guy.

520
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,280
But you have been through a lot.

521
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,770
Someday, BMX-. Ah.

522
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,870
Please don't. Thank you though.

523
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,380
Someday, I hope BMX will become more popular

524
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,900
and then there will be more competitions with lots of sponsors.

525
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,320
Then, players won't have to have part time jobs

526
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,520
to sustain a living.

527
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,180
I may not be able to change everything, but

528
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,820
at least, I hope to be a trigger of something big.

529
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,260
Remarkable!

530
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,360
You are remarkable.

531
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,480
You are still young, but you have backbone.

532
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,980
I don't even have a dream.

533
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,740
What are you saying?

534
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,840
You do have a dream of marrying Rie-san.

535
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,160
Please protect Rie-san.

536
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,700
I got affected by my parents' divorce quite a bit.

537
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,780
If you like, I can help you get a part-time job here.

538
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,800
It's hard on the body, but the pay is good.

539
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,260
I appreciate your generosity, but no thank you.

540
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,220
Please take a good care of my sister.

541
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,860
What-

542
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,760
Yes, I'll take a good care of her.

543
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,580
When can I see you next?

544
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,860
Next?

545
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,540
Yes. Our next date.

546
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,460
Did we have a date today?

547
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,340
We didn't?

548
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,240
That wasn't my intention.

549
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:55,070
Choko-chan, I adore you like a younger sister.

550
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,610
But, there is too much of an age gap between us,

551
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,430
and I don't think we are suited to be in relationship.

552
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,490
As I thought, you like Sakura-san, don't you?

553
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,610
Huh?

554
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,860
I'm leaving.

555
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,920
Choko-chan, wait.

556
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,940
My, my, what is going on this time?

557
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,050
She thinks I like Kin.

558
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,370
You don't?

559
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:22,250
I don't. What? When did I say I like her?

560
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:29,210
Rie. Can you go back to Fukuoka with me?

561
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,250
Coming here, I realized how conceited I was.

562
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,540
I want to start over.

563
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,160
I'm sure it won't be easy for you,

564
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,340
but can you stay with me?

565
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,880
I was waiting for you to tell me that.

566
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,050
Let's work hard together.

567
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,150
Really? Oh, ow-ow!

568
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,690
It hurts! You hit me right here.

569
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,550
<i>I will definitely make you happy.</i>

570
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,460
Geez.

571
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,520
<i>Hey, not my ear.</i>

572
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,780
<i>It's fine, right?</i>

573
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,760
If you want to do it, then go to a hotel!

574
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,140
<i>I have no choice since I can't restrain myself.</i>

575
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,810
<i>My younger brother may have</i>

576
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,170
<i>his wedding first.</i>

577
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,350
<i> Imperial </i>

578
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,520
Sakura, you have bags underneath your eyes.

579
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,820
You are right. There are dark circles.

580
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,920
I hardly slept a wink last night.

581
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,500
Why?

582
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,620
I was too nervous, so I couldn't sleep.

583
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,100
Why? It's not like you are entering the competition.

584
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,340
I know. You guys don't know since you've never seen it.

585
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,800
They do crazy stunts on bikes.

586
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,200
One mistake may cause serious injury. Knowing that...

587
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,220
Shoot. My stomach started to hurt.

588
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,100
- I'm going to the restroom.
- What?

589
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,780
Yo, Hiroto. You seem full of enthusiasm.

590
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,150
Momo told me.

591
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,370
Aren't you being too cruel?

592
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,860
<i>When you didn't have money,you stayed with
my sister for several months.</i>

593
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,260
Now that you got a new girlfriend, you abandoned her.

594
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,660
Excuse me. Where is the restroom?

595
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,760
Turn left there and go straight.

596
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,300
Thank you.

597
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,410
<i>Hey you!</i>

598
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,520
<i>Don't think you can get away with this.</i>

599
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,080
Hey you! What are you doing?

600
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,310
Hiroto-ku...

601
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,740
Hey, auntie.

602
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,300
This is not a place for an old lady.

603
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,590
Let go of me. What did you do to my boyfriend?

604
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,190
Boyfriend? So you are the new girlfriend Hiroto got?

605
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,080
So what if I am?

606
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,050
Yusuke, don't touch her.

607
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,240
Oh my.

608
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,350
I was wondering who he jilted my sister for.

609
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,980
It was for an old lady like this?

610
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,750
Hey, wait!

611
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,860
Cut it out already!

612
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,380
You should be ashamed, all of you attacking one person.

613
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,010
Stay back.

614
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,570
Go, go away!

615
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,920
Don't come! Don't come closer!

616
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,990
I won't let you get away with this.

617
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,350
<i>You there! What are you doing?</i>

618
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,670
<i>This is a restricted area.</i>

619
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,190
I'm so relived you're not hurt.

620
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,930
Hiroto-kun, are you alright?

621
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:22,690
Sakura-san, you are too reckless. Don't ever do that again, okay?

622
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,410
If something were to happen to you, I...

623
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,410
Okay, I'm sorry.

624
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,030
But I was happy.

625
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,390
Thank you for protecting me.

626
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,840
Excuse me.  You are hurting me.

627
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,860
Sorry, where does it hurt? Ah, sorry.

Sakura!

654
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:44,650
She's fine. She is just sleeping.

663
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,900
But, you did nothing.

664
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:29,460
Hey, hey, hey. I had no idea Sakura-san's boyfriend was that kind of guy.

665
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,630
- What?
- Did you see this? Look.

666
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,580
<i> Genius BMX rider Saeki Hiroto. Came back strong! </i>

667
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,350
- Is Kin sleeping, by any chance?
-  I think so.

668
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:41,820
She has a lot of nerve sleeping at her boyfriend's competition.

669
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,870
That's so Sakura-san.

670
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,210
Saeki Hiroto...

671
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,420
Hm?

672
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,120
Saeki is a pseudonym. His real name is Ohgami.

673
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,890
Choko-chan's surname is Ohgami, too.

674
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:59,570
I think she is the daughter of the Ohgami Corporation's CEO.

675
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,370
Hmph.

676
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:04,560
What? He, too.

677
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,790
It says, he is the first son of the Ohgami Corporation's CEO.

678
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,990
<i>Ah, that means...</i>

679
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,130
He is Choko-chan's brother?

<i>Welcome.</i>

681
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:19,080
<i>Oh my, such an unusual combination.
Choko-chan, are you alright?</i>

682
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,940
But, it's strange, isn't it?

683
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:27,970
They were right next to each other, but they didn't say anything. Does Sakura-san know about this?

684
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:32,170
You found yourself a good man.
