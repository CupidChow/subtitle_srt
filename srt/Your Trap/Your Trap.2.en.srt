3
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,150
This file is especially important.

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,590
I will personally deliver it to President Feng.

5
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,390
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,310
Waiting for you, Ms. Zhao.

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,630
Waiting for me?

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,710
Secretary Zhao.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,840
You are busy every day.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,030
Give me a chance.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,280
No.

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,120
This is the latest design.

13
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,200
It's not that I can't take it.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,280
Deliver it.

15
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,350
Thank you, Ms. Zhao.

16
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,480
So beautiful.

17
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,630
President Feng.

18
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,830
President Feng.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,630
This is the document you need to sign.

20
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,630
Why is it you?

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,200
Secretary Zhao said she has something to do,

22
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,600
so I helped her deliver it.

23
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,380
(Representative Signature)

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,040
President Feng.

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,950
Since you've chosen me,

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,280
you shouldn't ignore me.

27
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,600
What do you want to say?

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,880
You pay my salary but don't use me.

29
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,550
You won't want an assistant like this.

30
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,040
Then what kind of assistant do you think I need?

31
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,920
At least one that can help you.

32
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,040
Can you drink?

33
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,910
Of course.

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,280
Then tonight,

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,720
let me see what you can do
when encounter difficulties.

36
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,110
Okay, President Feng.

37
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,720
Feng Siqian is taking you to his business dinner?

38
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,550
Maybe he is testing my abilities.

39
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,000
It went smoother than I imagined.

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,480
But don't get excited just yet.

41
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,720
He is best at playing with people's minds.

42
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,790
Don't worry about it.

43
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,600
I'm good at

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
what your husband's good at.

45
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,320
Good luck then.

46
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,950
President Feng.

47
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,160
Who were you speaking to?

48
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,720
My dad.

49
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,040
Mr. Huang has arrived.

50
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,230
Come in.

51
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,510
President Feng.

52
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,400
I really can't stay any longer.

53
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
It's not that I'm not giving you face.

54
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,430
Your uncle and your father-in-law
made an appointment with me long ago.

55
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,720
The smell on Mr. Huang is quite unique.

56
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,400
It should be the smell of snow gardenia.

57
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,840
You know about perfumes?

58
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,280
Just a little bit.

59
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,080
Smells can reveal

60
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,870
a person's personality and preferences.

61
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,040
So you mean

62
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
you know all my preferences?

63
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,520
The smell on Mr. Huang

64
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,520
and the smell of this scented candle

65
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
are exactly the same.

66
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,160
Although this brand is not well-known,

67
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,600
it has investments
in many overseas real estate projects.

68
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,040
You have been
in frequent contact with them recently.

69
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,790
This should be your next investment plan.

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,920
President Feng.

71
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,510
President Feng.

72
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,400
Assistant Han is not simple.

73
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,550
President Feng trained me well.

74
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,440
Mr. Huang.

75
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,350
I think our cooperation must continue.

76
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,280
Because I can give you

77
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,870
something that no one else can.

78
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,990
President Feng.

79
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
You really should

80
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,550
thank Assistant Han properly.

81
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,600
- Pleasure to cooperate with you.
- Come on.

82
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,270
Pleasure to cooperate with you.

83
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,080
- Pleasure to cooperate with you.
- Pleasure to cooperate with you.

84
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,190
Cheers.

85
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Han Qing.

86
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,480
Since you can judge people by their smell,

87
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,400
why not try me?

88
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
President Feng.

89
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,040
I'll tell you after finishing this drink.

90
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm waiting for your answer.

91
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,960
(A riot of blooms dazzles the eye.)

92
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,160
(Perhaps the fragrance is too strong)

93
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,350
(or the alcohol.)

94
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,920
(The most primitive desire is bursting.)

95
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,520
(Desire)
