00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,980
=Your Trap=

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,940
=3. Peel Your Skin Off=

3
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,110
You're not drunk.

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,630
What are you looking for?

5
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,000
Found it.

6
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,480
Were you looking for this?

7
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,470
Or what?

8
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,430
What do you think I was looking for?

9
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,400
You haven't answered

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,560
tonight's question.

11
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,600
There were too many people just now.

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,270
And the smell of alcohol was too strong.

13
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,830
I...

14
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,960
You can smell it now.

15
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,670
The slight bitterness of agarwood
combined with the sweetness of cardamom.

16
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,920
It indicates that Mr. Feng
appears elegant on the surface,

17
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,110
but is actually very cautious and meticulous,

18
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,040
like walking on thin ice.

19
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,200
Mr. Feng.

20
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,350
Did I cross the line?

21
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
Assistant Han.

22
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,390
You are very interesting.

23
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,110
However, this outfit of yours

24
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,950
is not good-looking.

25
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,200
Doesn't look like a secretary.

26
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,550
Since Mr. Feng doesn't like it,

27
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,950
I'll go change now.

28
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,480
You don't do anything

29
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,760
I don't like?

30
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,920
I won't do anything

31
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,440
that's unfavorable to you.

32
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,950
Maybe what you don't like

33
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,440
is just empty talk.

34
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,040
After all, a man's heart is the softest

35
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,480
when he talks tough.

36
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,790
Mr. Feng.

37
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,280
You can come to me if you have needs.

38
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,110
A man's needs

39
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,950
can't just be met

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
by a random woman.

41
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,920
As long as it's work-related,

42
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,840
I can meet all your needs.

43
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,630
Are you sure?

44
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm sure.

45
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,630
Han Qing.

46
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
No woman

47
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,310
is worth me making a wrong move.

48
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,400
You're hurting me.

49
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,960
I don't want such things

50
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,350
to happen again.

51
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,590
Get out.

52
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,300
(Five minutes ago)

53
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,720
(The game between hunter and prey)

54
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,190
(seems to have just begun.)

55
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,310
(If you are impatient for success,)

56
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,230
(no one will end up getting what they want.)

57
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,840
(Guess)

58
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,960
(who'll win this game.)

59
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,280
He is very cautious.

60
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,400
The investigation is more difficult
than I imagined.

61
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,600
Miss Han.

62
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,400
It is indeed not easy
to play against a ghost in human skin.

63
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,160
He is as tight-lipped as can be.

64
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Why did he have to lay hands on you?

65
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,080
Outsiders are unaware of the inside story.

66
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,320
Miss Han.

67
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,230
Feng Siqian is indeed a hypocrite.

68
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,550
His specialty is tormenting people's hearts.

69
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,110
The status of our Yin family is unshakable.

70
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,310
He can only use soft tactics against me.

71
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,960
What he can't cut off, I will take care of it.

72
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,230
Did he hit you again?

73
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,720
Why don't you call the police?

74
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,920
It's useless.

75
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,230
Who would believe

76
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,280
that President Feng,
who is usually gentle and refined,

77
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,400
could do such a thing?

78
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,480
Only one percent of men in the world

79
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,430
don't make mistakes.

80
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,480
I don't believe he is the exception.

81
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,880
That's right.

82
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,720
I know his character better than anyone.

83
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,400
Crafty.

84
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,720
Sly.

85
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,400
Cruel.

86
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,510
Miss Han.

87
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,350
If you believe me,

88
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,870
please help me get the evidence
of his affair as soon as possible.

89
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
Okay?

90
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,510
Don't worry about it.

91
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,230
Even if he is a devil in disguise,

92
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,520
I will peel his skin off.

93
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,600
President Feng, here is a...

94
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,230
If I remembered correctly,

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,750
this should be President Feng's office.

96
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,840
You didn't remember wrong.

97
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,670
This is President Feng's office.

98
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,550
But I can come in too.
