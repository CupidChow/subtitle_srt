3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,310
What happened?

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,630
I heard there was an accident
in the project with Wanli.

5
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,520
The tower crane collapsed
during the topping-out process.

6
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,270
I heard that the tower crane was old,
plus it was overloaded.

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,430
The most crucial thing is

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,310
President Feng signed
to make the purchase of this equipment.

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,240
President Feng is always cautious.

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,630
How could he make
such a low-level mistake?

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,760
Are there any casualties?

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,270
Fortunately, only five people were injured.

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,550
Fortunately?

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,070
Can we just pretend nothing happened

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,520
if there were no casualties?

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,790
What's wrong?

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,350
President Feng said the same thing.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,630
Where is he now?

19
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,120
After this incident occurred,

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,670
President Feng just disappeared.

21
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,840
I don't know where the reporters
got the news from.

22
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,950
They are clamoring to interview Mr. Feng.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,480
The company wants to

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,070
blame the incident
on the driver's improper operation.

25
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,320
I always feel that
this matter is not so simple.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,070
What should we do?

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,560
I will handle the reporters.

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,150
You must find President Feng.

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
Okay.

30
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,840
(Press Conference of Huajing Group)
They're here.

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,240
She's here.

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,560
- Miss Han.
- Miss Han.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,540
Miss Han.

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Can you accept our interview?

35
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,270
Since the collapse incident,

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,270
President Feng hasn't shown up.

37
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,120
Is he deliberately trying
to evade responsibility?

38
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,980
Please answer.

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,200
As President Feng's assistant,

40
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,320
are you also involved
in this misconduct?

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,870
Are you avoiding to answer our question?

42
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,760
Please remain calm.

43
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,070
Take a seat.

44
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,790
The accident is clearly
Huajing's responsibility,

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,200
but you're trying
to blame it on the driver

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,040
to cover up the truth.

47
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,960
Doesn't President Feng intend
to give everyone an explanation?

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,040
The accident has just occurred,

49
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,840
and the cause is still under investigation.

50
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,400
How did you know

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
that it was due to
the aging of equipment?

52
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,430
Were you at the scene

53
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,680
or is this all hearsay

54
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,760
and your imagination?

55
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,710
I...

56
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,920
You don't need to worry about
how we found out.

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,760
- It doesn't matter.
- It's certainly important.

58
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,670
We have already reported it to the police.

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
If it is the former reason,

60
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,320
then please come with us
and assist the police with investigation.

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,790
If it is the latter reason,

62
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,320
then this is libel and slander.

63
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,320
Please think it over before answering.

64
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,440
Moreover,

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,350
Huajing's project with Wanli is confidential.

66
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,390
I believe all of you

67
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,070
have already been to the site, right?

68
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,280
So, who took you to the site?

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,320
Could there be a leak?

70
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,670
Huajing Group's legal team

71
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,110
reserves the right to prosecute the leaker.

72
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,550
Dear journalists,

73
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,390
since Huajing was established,

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,510
Mr. Feng's worked diligently.

75
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,790
The company puts people first

76
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,440
and upholds honesty.

77
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,480
Which company would shoot itself in the foot

78
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,670
when it's about to go public?

79
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,760
Dear journalists,

80
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,390
if there are no further questions,

81
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,000
we've prepared a sumptuous dinner for everyone.

82
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,110
Please move to the dining room.

83
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,670
(Feng Siqian,)

84
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,950
(if you are really a good person,)

85
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,160
(then I hope you are safe.)

86
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,110
Since Huajing was established,

87
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,920
Mr. Feng's worked diligently.

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,950
Which company would shoot itself in the foot

89
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,510
when it's about to go public?

90
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,600
(I'll avenge)

91
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,870
(Wanli's loss.)

92
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,670
You must be the project manager.

93
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,790
- You must be the boss.
- Yes, it's me.

94
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,110
We are waiting for you to compensate us.

95
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,430
- Look at the injuries we have now.
- Let me explain.

96
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,280
How long are you going to put it off?

97
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,550
- Calm down.
- Sir, please calm down.

98
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,410
- Listen to me.
- Stop fighting.

99
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,750
You must give us an explanation today.

100
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,800
I will definitely

101
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,750
give everyone an explanation, okay?

102
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,080
Our wives and children
are waiting for us to support them.

103
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
Stay calm.

104
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,990
Everyone calm down.

105
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,190
What should we do
about our wives and children?

106
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,670
Compensate us!

107
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,630
Stay calm.

108
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,640
- Listen to me.
- Stop fighting, sir.

109
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,480
- Exactly.
- Let's all calm down.

110
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,310
If you fight again, we will call security.

111
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,160
Stop fighting.

112
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,790
How can you let us live like this?

113
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,320
Compensate us!

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
Where's the money? Bring out the money!

115
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
I want to see the money today.

116
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,400
- Be careful!
- Unscrupulous merchant!

117
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,070
Feng Siqian.

118
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,680
Feng Siqian.

119
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,600
- Feng Siqian.
- I didn't mean to.

120
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,520
Feng Siqian, wake up.

121
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,990
I didn't mean to.

122
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,790
- Quick!
- Feng Siqian.

123
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,310
Doctor.

124
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,990
Quickly.

125
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,080
Take a look at him.

126
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,920
Feng Siqian.

127
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,920
(He knew I approached him for a purpose,)

128
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,960
(but he saved me anyway.)

129
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,480
(Han Qing,)

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,790
(seems like you really made a mistake.)

131
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,660
(Yin Yi)

132
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,670
(I heard Feng Siqian got hit by a brick.)

133
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,480
(Now is the best time for you to make a move.)

134
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,000
(By the way,)

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,280
(your father
is being taken care of 24 hours a day.)

136
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,870
(You don't have much time left.)

137
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,180
(Divorce Agreement)

138
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,020
(Divorce Agreement)

139
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,900

140
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,620
(Yin Yi)

141
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,840
(Why do I always)

142
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,190
(fall into darkness)

143
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,360
(when I am about to see the light?)

144
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,640
(You two have already divorced.)

145
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,880
(What is your purpose?)

146
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,000
(Don't fool me anymore.)

147
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,430
(Every minute here)

148
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,470
