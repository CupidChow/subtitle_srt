Sorry.

Please redial later.

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,680
Where is Han Qing?

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,310
She is your fiancée, why ask me?

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,070
How could you not know where she is?

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,270
Where did you hide her?

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,390
I would like to ask you,

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,800
how did you threaten Han Qing

17
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,990
so she left me?

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,590
Feng Siqian.

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
I'm warning you.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,920
If you two have cuckolded me,

21
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,270
I'll kill her.

22
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,550
Lin Zongyi.

23
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,430
Don't burn your bridges.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,070
We'll see.

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,800
Have you found her?

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
No.

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,230
None of the contact information can be reached.

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,790
The people sent out did not find her.

29
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,270
President Feng.

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,710
I suspect someone is deliberately
setting us up.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
I will handle this matter.

32
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,400
You must find Han Qing

33
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,710
and take her to a safe place.

34
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,960
- Okay.
- Go.

35
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,350
Sorry.

How long do you still want to avoid me?

61
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
If you still want to get remarried,

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,540
then we have nothing to talk about.

63
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,950
I'm talking to you about Han Qing.

64
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you know where Han Qing is?

65
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
I can tell you.

66
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,880
But you have to help me.

67
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,390
You know.

68
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
I hate being threatened the most.

69
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,910
Hurry up and tell me.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,510
At this point, you better listen to me.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,070
She has already left.

72
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,630
She won't see you.

73
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,230
(Feng Siqian, Huajing will be mine.)

74
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
(Han Qing will also be mine.)

75
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,040
(I just like to compete with you)

76
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,310
(and fight with you.)

77
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,830
This time,

78
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,920
I have prepared some new dishes for everyone.

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,000
Mr. Chen,

80
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,280
yours is called
"A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains".

81
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,360
How about it?

82
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,960
Do you like your company's

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,760
flow of cash over the years?

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,240
Mr. Zhang.

85
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,280
Yours is called "Spring Affection".

86
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,430
You're quite an affectionate man.

87
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,310
Open yours now.

88
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,840
This time,

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,310
do you have any opinions

90
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,490
about me being the new president of Huajing?

91
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,040
How can you threaten people like this?

92
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,600
- What should we do now?
- That's right.

93
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,720
Do we have any choices?

94
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,110
This is a threat, isn't it?

95
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,550
This is too immoral.

96
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,840
When did you check my account?

97
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,790
I've told you long ago.

98
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm not prepared at all.

99
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,920
I hope that in this shareholders' meeting,

100
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,550
you can transfer your shares to me.

101
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
Well...

102
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,150
Okay.

103
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,600
We will transfer.

104
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,840
Mr. Lin will definitely be the new president.

105
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,310
Come on.

106
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,920
Yes, yes.

107
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,600
You'll be the president.

108
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,440
You'll take over.

109
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,390
Yes, yes, yes.

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,920
Come on.

111
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,590
(Han Qing.)

112
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,670
(Where are you?)

113
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,280
(Stop avoiding me, okay?)

114
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,110
(I really miss you.)

115
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,080
President Feng,
Lin Zongyi has already taken action.

116
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,590
He called all the shareholders together

117
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,040
for the election meeting.

118
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,390
Hello, everyone.

119
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,680
Nice to see you again.

120
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,190
We should've informed Feng Siqian

121
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
about the shareholders' meeting.

122
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,110
Everyone knows

123
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,670
Wanli Real Estate had the accident
while Feng Siqian was in charge.

124
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,960
Huajing Group also suffered negative impacts

125
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,720
due to his personal scandal.

126
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,400
Do you think such a person

127
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,920
deserves to be Huajing's new president?

128
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,360
- Yes.
- He doesn't.

129
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,310
It makes sense.

130
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,270
Yeah.

131
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Good.

132
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,950
He brought negative impacts

133
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,550
to the whole group.

134
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,120
We also suffered too.

135
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,670
Okay.

136
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,760
Chairman Yin is not here.

137
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,280
Then I'll represent him

138
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,120
to officially announce that

139
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,310
Huajing Group's shareholders' meeting

140
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,310
begins now.

141
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,190
The president shall be elected by ballot.

142
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,310
One share, one vote.

143
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,280
Feng Siqian is absent.

144
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,590
Please raise your hand if you nominate me

145
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,680
to be Huajing's new president.

146
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,280
Start the voting.

147
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
Mr. Chen.

148
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,190
Why I wasn't informed

149
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,760
to attend the shareholders' meeting?

150
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,640
Whether you come or not,

151
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,470
the result will be the same, right?

152
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,950
How can I not come?

153
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,470
I'm here to congratulate

154
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,830
the new president.

155
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,470
Feng Siqian.

156
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,710
Stop playing tricks.

157
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,160
Now in Huajing,

158
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,280
I have the final say.

159
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,790
Then I will give Mr. Lin

160
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,040
the first congratulatory gift of today.

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,950
Did you hear me clearly?

162
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,710
There must be a car accident tonight.

163
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,360
And,

164
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,160
Feng Siqian must die.

165
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,190
Make Yin Peidong die with him.

166
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,760
Han Qing.

167
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,520
Import the virus from this USB drive

168
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,120
into Feng Siqian's computer.

169
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,400
You can refuse me.

170
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,000
Your life, your father's life,

171
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,470
and Feng Siqian's life

172
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,190
are all in your hands.

173
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,890
Is there still a way out?

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,120
The company will be destroyed in his hands.

175
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,790
You all know about his relationship
with Han Qing, right?

176
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,240
The two of them are lovers.

177
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,590
You think you can frame me

178
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,190
with just a short recording?

179
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,150
Of course not.

180
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,750
This is the investigation report

181
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,160
on the accident at Wanli Real Estate's site.

182
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,360
The crane operator has admitted

183
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,710
that he acted

184
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,760
on the instructions of Lin Zongyi

185
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,120
and caused this accident to happen.

186
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,280
He wanted to damage the company.

187
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,040
He will eventually ruin the company like this.

188
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,150
And these

189
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,120
are the direct evidence of Lin Zongyi's

190
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,360
