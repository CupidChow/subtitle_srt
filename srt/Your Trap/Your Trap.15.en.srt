Hey, Han Qing.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
What's going on with you?

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,430
You're the trending topic now.

6
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,430
What trending topic?

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,040
There are several posts about you.

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,430
You'd better check it out.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,590
Let me know if you need help.

13

(The so-called life assistant
is actually a private detective!)

14
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,110
Come on.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
Han Qing,
how do you feel about your involvement

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,710
in Feng Siqian and Yin Yi's marriage?

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,540
Doesn't this go against
your intention as a marriage counselor?

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,630
You claim to be a marriage savior,

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,950
are you saving the victim

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,950
or the mistress?

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,600
Step aside.

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,640
- Can you answer us?
- Stop taking pictures.

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,680
- Follow me.
- Step back and stop filming.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,040
- Step back.
- Please accept our interview.

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,990
Stop filming and step back.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,240
Step back.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,240
Are you okay?

28
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,350
I've already found

29
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,510
the mastermind's IP address.

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,910
Who is it?

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,520
Tell me.

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,630
It's her.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
Han Qing.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,230
This time, you owe me.

35
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,990
Thanks.

36
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,070
You found me so quickly.

37
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,000
Our relationship is over.

38
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,790
Can't you just let me go?

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,160
Han Qing.

40
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,000
You deserve all of this.

41
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,790
Ji Weijun has been arrested.

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,920
It's Feng Siqian's doing.

43
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,350
No.

44
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,440
To be precise, it's your fault.

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,040
It was you who did it.

46
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,760
I made a mistake

47
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,350
by asking you to come in the first place.

48
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,510
You b*tch.

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,350
You are really crazy.

50
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,230
All of our family's shares

51
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,000
have been given to Feng Siqian.

52
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,230
Why can't he let me go?

53
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,950
I can accept being his wife in name only.

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Does he have to kill the man I love?

55
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,630
I didn't expect things to turn out this way.

56
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,000
You really didn't know

57
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,880
or are you pretending?

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,510
Feng Siqian has fallen in love with you.

59
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,740
(7 days ago)

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,600
Please

61
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,110
terminate the contract
between Yin Yi and Han Qing.

62
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
I know you can do it.

63
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,110
On what terms?

64
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,830
I will continue to stay in Huajing Group

65
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,760
as your puppet and executioner.

66
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,070
But it's impossible for us

67
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,390
to get remarried.

68
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,160
Just for that woman?

69
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,600
And also for myself.

70
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,280
He's giving up on Huajing for you.

71
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
What are you doing?

72
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,920
I'm going to kill you!

73
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,760
Let me go! Let me go!

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm warning you.

75
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,840
Han Qing is my woman.

76
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,520
If you touch her,

77
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,550
I'll kill you.

78
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,240
Get back here!

79
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,400
