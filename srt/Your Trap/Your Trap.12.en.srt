00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,150
It seems like you have misunderstood.

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,360
Miss Han is my woman.

6
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,350
It's not too late

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,400
to announce it, right?

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,680
Han Qing.

9
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,830
It's all my fault.

10
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,030
You'll be the most important one
in the future, okay?

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,350
I can't believe that Mr. Lin

12
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,200
has such a relationship with my assistant.

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,430
Do I need to report to you

14
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,350
everything about me?

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,350
Just out of curiosity.

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,880
When did it start?

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,790
Before you came to Huajing?

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,350
We just recently...

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm asking you!

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,200
- Feng Siqian.
- That's enough.

21
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
For an outsider,

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,680
look how you're fighting now.

23
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,790
Don't trust

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,920
the wrong person.

25
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,470
Brother-in-law.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,070
Han Qing is not an outsider.

27
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,400
She really is my woman.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,960
Peidong, we should go to the hospital.

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,150
Let's break up.

30
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,880
You'd better explain it to me clearly.

31
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,630
I was also used by Feng Siqian.

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,670
Whether it's Lin Zongyi

33
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,350
or Feng Siqian,

34
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,480
they just use me

35
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,600
to fight with each other.

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,950
You mean

37
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,320
you publicly admitted
to being Lin Zongyi's fiancée

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,440
just to protect Feng Siqian?

39
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,390
Miss Han.

40
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,950
You are also deeply involved, aren't you?

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,280
Ms. Yin.

42
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,160
Power and desire

43
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,110
are a game played by you rich people.

44
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,350
I can't afford to play and I don't want to play.

45
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,200
I want to terminate our cooperation.

46
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,600
You want to quit?

47
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,480
It's not that easy, Han Qing.

48
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,600
You and Feng Siqian have been divorced
for a long time, haven't you?

49
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,920
You knew?

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,630
I don't care who is playing tricks
on whom between you two.

51
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,000
But please don't fool me again.

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,200
Miss Han, you name your price.

53
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,510
How much do you want?

54
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,110
Ten times or a hundred times?

55
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,160
I'll give you everything.

56
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,720
Tell me your reasons.

57
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,070
I promised Weijun.

58
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,550
I must help him

59
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,230
destroy Feng Siqian.

60
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,310
I must let him take over Huajing.

61
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,550
Otherwise, he may abandon me.

62
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,400
I really love him, Han Qing.

63
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,230
I can't live without him.

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,600
I beg you to help me.

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,190
Just help me one last time, okay?

66
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,920
One last time, please.

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,000
Otherwise,

68
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,160
I'll send you and your dad

69
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,520
to prison.

70
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,870
Everyone as to take responsibility

71
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,750
for their own actions,

72
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,310
including you and me.

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,430
If you insist on this,

74
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,870
then I have nothing to say.

75
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,160
Our cooperation is over.

76
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,310
Come back!

77
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,730
- (Ms. Yin.)
- Come back!

78
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,840
(You are just like me.)

79
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,160
(We both are deeply trapped,)

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,480
(almost forgetting about ourselves.)

81
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,360
Han Qing.

82
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,030
Open the door.

83
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,080
Lin Zongyi is not sincere to you.

84
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,990
If it weren't for the benefits,

85
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,430
he wouldn't cooperate with you
to put on the show.

86
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,790
So, Mr. Feng, are you sincere?

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,960
When Mr. Yin falsely accused me,

88
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,990
you didn't argue or get angry.

89
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,870
What were you thinking?

90
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,430
But now you came to blame me.

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,790
Don't you think you're being a bit unfair?

92
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,880
Han Qing.

93
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,640
I know you were sent by Yin Yi to my side.

94
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,870
Yet I still kept you around.

95
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,960
I know you're just trying to take advantage of me

96
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,480
to get rid of the relationship with Yin Yi.

97
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,720
But I still let you use me.

98
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,310
Why do you think I did that?

99
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,430
Feng Siqian.

100
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,960
Don't forget

101
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,160
we are just cooperating.

102
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,110
You should trust me.

103
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,790
Right now, you have no choice but to trust me.

104
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,400
I'm here today to tell you

105
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,110
Yin Yi and I divorced long ago.

106
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,720
Mr. Yin wants to use you

107
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,280
to threaten me to remarry Yin Yi.

108
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,990
I originally wanted to announce

109
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,720
my relationship with Yin Yi today.

110
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,280
But I didn't expect

111
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,960
Lin Zongyi would suddenly intervene

112
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,040

I have never trusted you either.
