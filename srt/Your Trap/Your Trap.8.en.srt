00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,940
=8. I Miss You=

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,680
Mr. Feng.

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,880
You woke up.

5
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,310
I bought some fruits.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,400
Come down and eat some.

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,120
You've been waiting here all the time?

8
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,240
You got hurt because of me.

9
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,950
Taking care of you is what I should do.

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,920
You are caring about me?

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
No.

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,230
Thank you for saving me.

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,560
You are my assistant.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
Protecting you is my responsibility.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,040
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,320
Why apologize?

17
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,680
Ji Weijun,

18
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,870
vice president of Huaicheng branch.

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,270
He must have been with Ms. Yin Yi

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,070
before you got married.

21
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,870
The reason I didn't tell you

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,680
is because Yin Yi

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,680
threatened me with my father's life.

24
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,630
I can help you
solve your father's debt problem.

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,760
You help me solve Ji Weijun.

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,400
You want me to investigate Ji Weijun?

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,790
Ji Weijun suddenly appeared next to Yin Yi,

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,200
it's definitely not a coincidence.

29
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,270
Someone has tampered
with the construction site.

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,510
And the tower crane operator's cousin

31
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,320
works as a cashier at Lin Zongyi's company.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,040
I need you now.

33
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,550
Do I have the right to reject you?

34
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,720
Of course.

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,280
Mr. Feng.

36
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,550
Is there something you haven't told me?

37
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,950
What do you want to know?

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,790
I want to know

39
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,510
what kind of person are you.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,440
What do you think?

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,840
A scumbag?

42
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,470
A villain?

43
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,390
I may be the scumbag and the villain

44
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,510
you guys are talking about.

45
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,480
But I also know that you were sent by Yin Yi.

46
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,600
So you need to be careful with me too.

47
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,230
You are going to be enemies with the Yin family?

48
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,350
It's Yin Yi who wants to be enemies with me.

49
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,510
Mr. Feng.

50
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,720
Aren't you afraid

51
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,320
of telling me all this?

52
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,040
If I were afraid, I wouldn't have saved you.

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,920
There is only manipulation and betrayal
between me and Yin Yi.

54
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,230
But you are different.

55
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,630
I want to take a gamble.

56
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,440
Why do you think I would gamble with you?

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,280
I am very grateful that you saved me.

58
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,280
But I really can't afford to gamble.

59
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,070
I think we can have a cooperative relationship.

60
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,080
Sure enough, you're a business tycoon,

61
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,430
discussing cooperation on everything.

62
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,950
What?

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,920
You don't want to?

64
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,030
Han Qing.

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
You are already in the game now.

66
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,120
You can't escape.

67
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
I was destined to be a loser

68
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,720
from the beginning of the game.

69
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,110
I am just an ordinary person.

70
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,350
I don't want to be involved anymore.

71
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,670
Whether it's your marriage or business,

72
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,040
I don't want to be part of it.

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,880
Goodbye.

74
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,510
Mr. Feng.

75
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,870
(Maybe I shouldn't have taken the risk to hunt.)

76
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,400
(Only when I'm trapped in it do I realize)

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
(the risks that hunters have to bear)

78
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,750
(are not only the dangers of their prey,)

79
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,190
(but also the crises they face themselves.)

80
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,670
(He didn't confess to me.)

81
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,790
(Why should I be used by him?)

82
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,230
(Being involved in other people's lives
for so long,)

83
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,310
(what about my own life?)

84
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,390
How is it?

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,400
This place is perfect.

86
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,680
Look over there.

87
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,840
It's for the swing.

88
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,790
The area in the middle

89
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,080
is for barbecue.

90
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,590
Over there, over there.

91
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,080
There is a large open space

92
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,790
reserved for leisure
and entertainment after meals.

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,960
This is what you call entrepreneurship?

94
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,190
My husband opened it for me.

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,430
- Your husband?
- Hurry up.

96
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,400
- You...
- Sit down.

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,230
When did you get married behind my back?

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,280
Didn't we agree to be single sisters for life?

99
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,110
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,870
I secretly broke our promise.

101
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,110
Let me show you my husband.

102
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,960
Take a look, what do you think?

103
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,390
Is he handsome?

104
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,870
He's quite charming.

105
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,190
He looks rich.

106
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
That's true.

107
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Enough about me.

108
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,710
Tell me about yourself.

109
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,550
Back in the day,
you were the best student in our class.

110
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,870
We all thought that

111
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,080
you'd go to a research institute
to do academic research.

112
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,040
I didn't expect you to be in this trade.

113
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,600
Why, do you look down on me too?

114
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,310
No.

115
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,790
I feel sorry for you.

116
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,440
I think

117
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
you should have a better career.

118
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,670
But doing this is also good.

119
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,840
Eliminating evil and protecting the people.

120
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,880
Most importantly,

121
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,160
I will never do anything against my conscience.

122
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
You're right.

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Eliminate harm for the people.

124
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,190
Han Qing.

125
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,480
Are you really happy?

126
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,560
Happy?

127
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,520
What's the point of
talking about happiness for adults?

128
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,920
Making money is the priority.

129
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,520
You're right, making money is the priority.

130
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,590
Cheers.

131
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,640
Grill a few skewers for me.

132
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,990
Bring over the best ingredients
from our store.

133
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,190
When will I receive my shares?

134
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,670
Don't worry.

135
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,160
I bought a new handbag today.

136
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,320
What do you think?

137
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,430
Dear.

138
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,840
Why are you in such a hurry?

139
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
As long as Han Qing

140
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,000
gets the evidence of Feng Siqian's affair,

141
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,240
the whole Huajing will belong to you.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
How can you promise that?

143
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,910
Han Qing.

144
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,000
Han Qing.

145
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,670
You can't drink anymore.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,400
I told you to drink less.

147
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,670
I'm not drunk.

148
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,550
Fine, you're not drunk.

149
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,400
My name is Han Qiannian.

150
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,550
I am not just a thousand-year-old fox.

151
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,240
I also never get drunk.

152
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,280
Okay, okay, you are great.

153
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,270
Alright?

154
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,190
Don't catch a cold.

155
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,550
Someone is calling you over there, Yun.

156
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,670
Okay, I'll be right there.

157
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,310
Bring me some more wine.

158
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,160
Okay, you stay here and wait for me.

159
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,070
Don't go anywhere, got it?

160
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,950
Don't leave me alone, okay?

161
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,190
Okay, I got it.

162
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,920
Don't leave for too long.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,840
Got it.
