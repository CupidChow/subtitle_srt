=24. Sorry, I Love You=

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,880
Feng Siqian.

4
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,680
Don't think that by defeating me,

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,840
you can get Huajing.

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,470
You and Yin Yi are already divorced.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,040
He can't get Mr. Yin's shares at all.

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,720
And he is not qualified

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,760
to be elected as the new president of Huajing.

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,390
Don't be deceived by him.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,230
Lin Zongyi.

12
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,950
Save those words

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,990
for the police.

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,550
Mr. Lin Zongyi.

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,630
You've been investigated
for multiple misappropriation of property.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,590
Please cooperate and come with us.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,440
You never actually obtained Mr. Yin's shares.

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,070
Wait until I clear my name.

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,430
Huajing will still belong to me.

20
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,200
I will go with you.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Ms. Yin.

22
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,150
Then who will be the president

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,350
of Huajing Group?

24
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,990
Yes.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,430
We can't just let your Yin family

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,560
do as you please.

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,790
Yeah, you're just playing us.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,200
Who can take charge of the situation?

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,160
Everyone,

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,710
Feng Siqian is indeed not qualified

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,350
to serve as the president of Huajing Group.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,790
But I have decided

33
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,790
to transfer all my shares to him.

34
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,840
Combined with Feng Siqian's original shares,

35
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,230
it's already over 51 percent,

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,150
so Feng Siqian is qualified

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
to serve as the president of Huajing Group.

38
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,120
Do you think I'm dead?

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,040
Dad.

40
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,830
Who gave you the right

41
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,880
to transfer shares?

42
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,920
You have to decide between career and love.

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,560
Dad.

44
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,790
When the Yin family
was on the verge of bankruptcy,

45
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,670
who supported Huajing single-handedly?

46
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,790
And who

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,350
saved Huajing from the brink of disaster?

48
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,630
It wasn't Lin Zongyi who just got arrested,

49
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,070
not any of you here present.

50
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,920
It was the person next to me,

51
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,350
who was almost a stranger to us.

52
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,000
Dad.

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
From childhood to adulthood,

54
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,070
I've been living the life you arranged for me.

55
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,350
But this time,

56
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,600
I want to live for myself.

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,320
I have made up my mind

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,760
to transfer all my shares

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,230
to Feng Siqian.

60
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,320
Yin Yi.

61
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,230
You are different now.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,970
There is something
I have been thinking about for a long time.

63
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,950
I have decided to resign

64
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,670
from all my positions in Huajing Group

65
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,760
and transfer all my shares

66
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
to Yin Yi.

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,230
I once thought

68
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,830
love is not the foundation of marriage,

69
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,790
only common interests

70
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,000
can make a marriage work.

71
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,280
But it was only
after life and death that I realized

72
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,520
cherishing the person in front of you

73
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,700
is more important than anything else.

74
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,950
Mr. Yin.

75
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,670
Thank you for taking care of me
all these years.

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,990
I want to live my own life now.
