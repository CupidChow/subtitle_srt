You almost caused a big trouble, you know?

29
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,760
Welcome, President Feng.

30
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,040
My place is not as good as your big house.

31
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,160
Yin Yi.

32
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,630
My patience with you is limited.

33
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,000
My father planned everything out,

34
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,200
but he opened the door to a wolf.

35
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,320
You are really shameless.

36
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,110
Does it feel good to be stabbed

37
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,550
for the woman you love?

38
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,590
You don't care about your life,

39
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,390
but have you thought about the baby
in your belly?

40
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,070
How did you know?

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,670
You can't wrap fire in paper.

42
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,160
Moreover, it's Ji Weijun's baby.

43
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,950
What do you want?

44
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
I can help you bail him out,

45
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,390
but you must agree to one condition.

46
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Feng Siqian,

47
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,230
how can you dictate terms with me?

48
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,000
You're just one of my dad's dogs.

49
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,190
Who is really his dog?

50
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,520
Do you think the profit-oriented Mr. Yin

51
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,670
will side with me,

52
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,190
a puppet son-in-law

53
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,810
who can create a steady stream
of wealth for him,

54
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,230
or with his daughter,

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,310
who only causes trouble for him?

56
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,550
As long as you can get Ji Weijun out,

57
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,190
I will agree to any conditions you propose.

58
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,310
You do love him.

59
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,520
Delete all the videos about Han Qing

60
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,480
online.

61
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,870
Attend a press conference with me,

62
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,870
and then take your Ji Weijun out of Jiangcheng.

63
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,950
By the way,

64
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,380
at tomorrow's press conference,

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,870
I will officially announce our divorce.

66
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,840
Remember to attend on time.

67
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,640
(Press Conference of Huajing Group)
Thank you very much

68
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,960
for attending the press conference.

69
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,600
Today I have something to announce.

70
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,150
Take a seat.

71
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,790
Those photos and videos online

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,280
were edited by me.

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,640
Mr. Feng and Miss Han are innocent.

74
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,280
She didn't sabotage our marriage.

75
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,310
She is not a mistress.

76
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,480
Why did you do this?

77
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,840
When a woman gives up her career

78
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,280
and loves someone with all her heart,

79
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,310
she loses her senses.

80
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,430
Everything I do is to test

81
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,080
whether Mr. Feng really loves me.

82
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,600
I caused trouble

83
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,550
for everyone.

84
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,920
I feel very sorry.

85
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,750
Ms. Yin Yi, is what you said true?

86
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,310
Or is this just a show you put on

87
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,480
to beguile people?

88
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,520
Yes, Mr. Feng.

89
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,920
When the rumors were out,

90
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,990
why didn't you clarify them?

91
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,750
Does it mean that now
you want to return to your family?

92
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,520
Fabricating things out of thin air
is called defamation.

93
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,960
I didn't clarify it before

94
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,720
because I felt it was unnecessary.

95
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
But now,

96
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,040
these rumors and slander

97
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,040
have seriously affected my personal life.

98
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,110
I don't want Huajing Group

99
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
to get affected

100
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,350
because of my personal things.

101
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,350
Today is the first

102
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,520
and last time I will respond to this.

103
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,630
At the same time,

104
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,520
I have one more important thing to announce.

105
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,310
Me and Ms. Yin Yi...

106
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,320
Let me say it.

107
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,390
We

108
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,790
have a child now.

109
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,160
This is big news!

110
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,720
Yeah, how could this happen?

111
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
What's going on?

112
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,040
Don't leave, please accept our interview.

113
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,280
Stop filming, stop filming!

114
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,960
Stop it now!

115
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,190
Don't take pictures.

116
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,400
- Say something
- Yes, yes.

117
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,240
Please tell us.

118
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,680
