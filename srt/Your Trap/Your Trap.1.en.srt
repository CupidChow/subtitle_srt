1
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,980
=Your Trap=

2
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,990
(There is always a dividing line
in the treatment of women by God.)

3
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,560
(What separates him and me)

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,840
(is fate that I can't escape from.)

5
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,960
(If)

6
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,340
(there's a line drawn)

7
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,210
(in the definition of angel and devil...)

8
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,730
Assistant Han.

9
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,900
Am I your bait

10
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,800
or your fish?

11
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,500
(then cross that line,)

12
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,220
(will I become an angel)

13
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,200
(or)

14
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,350
(a devil?)

15
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,710
I fell for it.

16
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,610
Is this what you want?

17
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,640
Mr. Feng.

18
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,970
What I want

19
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,530
is all of you.

20
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,020
(Feng Siqian.)

21
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,250
(You are the devil.)

22
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,580
(The devil who imprisons my soul)

23
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,020
(and makes me unable to resist.)

24
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,300
=1. Battle with the Devil=

25
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,580
(Three months ago)

26
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,980
Han Qing,

27
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,860
a professional mistress dispeller,

28
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,770
traveling frequently between
Jiangcheng and Huaicheng,

29
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,620
helping lawful wives

30
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,460
save their failed marriage

31
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,250
or gain the greatest benefit.

32
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,930
I heard cases handled by you
are practically certain to win.

33
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,290
More accurately,

34
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,950
I've never failed

35
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,580
for three years.

36
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,900
Very good.

37
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,300
I have heard of your methods.

38
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,900
You spend more time

39
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,300
investigating the evidence
of my husband's affair.

40
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,860
The more we have on him,

41
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,650
the greater our chances of winning.

42
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,370
Ms. Yin.

43
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,490
Are you trying to reconcile or divorce?

44
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,740
Divorce.

45
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,650
I want at least half of his wealth.

46
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,890
The chairman of Huajing Group
has a net worth of nearly 10 billion.

47
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,740
With a man like him and your requirements,

48
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,180
this case is not easy.

49
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,980
I understand your concerns.

50
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,370
He wants me to move out

51
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,540
and he'll take everything from me.

52
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,330
Not to mention...

53
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,530
Okay.

54
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,300
I will never let any scumbag off the hook.

55
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,420
But I want the money I asked for,
not a penny less.

56
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,450
The duration of the contract is three months.

57
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,810
(Letter of attorney)
You and I each take what we need.

58
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,060
(Signature of Party B)

59
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,490
Don't come again tomorrow.

60
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,010
Why have you just arrived?

61
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,330
Sorry.

62
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,010
I got stuck in traffic.

63
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,290
Alright.

64
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,370
HR told you everything you need to know, right?

65
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,660
Be cautious and careful in your actions.

66
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,810
President Feng hates scheming people the most.

67
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,010
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

68
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,540
Don't look at what you shouldn't look at.

69
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,100
Not everyone can enter Huajing Group,

70
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,130
especially as an assistant
to the president.

71
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,330
Working for President Feng, it's better to...

72
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,130
To be a smart mute.

73
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,300
Seems like you've got the hang of it.

74
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,410
Go.

75
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,330
This is the president's office.

76
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,410
President Feng.

77
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,200
- President Feng.
- President Feng.

78
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,060
Get back to work.

79
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,320
President Feng.

80
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,490
She's the personal assistant
arranged for you by the company.

81
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,530
I don't need one.

82
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,730
Let her go.

83
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,300
It is reported that

84
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,300
Mr. Feng is humble and modest.

85
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,180
I didn't expect you to be so arrogant.

86
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,100
Arrogant?

87
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,890
Isn't that right, Mr. Feng?

88
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,020
We've got

89
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,570
plenty of people like you in Huajing.

90
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,300
Why should I keep you?

91
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,330
Let's go.

92
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,180
I'm different from them.

93
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,780
As long as the goal is legitimate,

94
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,780
I can use any means,

95
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,660
just like Mr. Feng.

96
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,930
So

97
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,450
you will definitely need me.

98
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,660
A woman with a temper and personality.

99
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,450
I like it.

100
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,690
A boss with strength and challenges.

101
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,020
I like it too.

102
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,170
Zhao Lu.

103
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,450
Help her handle the admission procedure.

104
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,100
Okay.

105
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,570
Please come with me.

106
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,100
By the way,

107
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,540
your lipstick color is too tacky.

108
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,180
Remember to change the color next time.

109
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,780
President Feng, this document is ready,

110
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
just waiting for your confirmation.

111
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,260
Here.

112
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,690
(The supreme hunter)

113
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,060
(often disguises himself as the prey.)

114
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,180
(And curiosity)

115
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,850
(makes a man)

116
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,300
(start to explore a woman.)

117
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,660
(Not to mention)

118
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,500
(no matter how well men disguise themselves,)

119
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,970
(they can't resist)

120
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,420
(an unsolicited prey.)

121
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,730
Feng Siqian is a very scheming man.

122
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,060
He is very guarded against women.

123
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,730
I only need three months.

124
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,420
Are you sure?

125
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,570
