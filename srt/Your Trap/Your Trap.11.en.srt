=Your Trap=

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,940
= 11. Can I Trust You=

3
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,360
Long time no see, Mr. Feng.

4
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,630
Mr. Ji.

5
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,040
I'm afraid President Feng

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,630
needs to change his title.

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,760
You didn't expect this, did you?

8
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,480
The shares I hold

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,160
have surpassed yours long ago.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,500
Plus this stamped appointment letter.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,820
(Appointment Letter)

12
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,990
Listen to me, everyone.

13
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,320
From today on,

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,600
I'll be the president of Wanli.

15
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,870
This is really great.

16
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,400
I feel my burden is lightened.

17
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,710
Come on.

18
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,430
Let's raise our glasses together.

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,320
Congratulations to Mr. Ji,
the new president of Wanli Group.

20
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,600
But I'm curious,

21
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,440
who appointed you?

22
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,110
Where did you get the official seal?

23
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,230
What are you doing?

24
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,230
I am Wanli's president.

25
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,390
Let me go!

26
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,350
President?

27
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,790
Do you know that stealing seals is illegal?

28
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,790
Take him away.

29
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,790
You...

30
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,200
What are you guys doing? Let him go!

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,160
Darling, save me!

32
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,510
Han Qing, how dare you trick me!

33
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,720
Did you all conspire to deceive me?

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,840
Liars!

35
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,910
Don't say anything.

36
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,670
Yin Yi.

37
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,880
How dare you fool me like this?

38
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,550
Dad, I'm leaving first.

39
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,110
What's going on?

40
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,950
Mr. Yin.

41
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,080
Ji Weijun is not happy
that you promoted Mr. Feng,

42
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,350
so he stole the seal

43
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,520
and faked the appointment letter,

44
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,160
hoping to become Wanli's president.

45
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,790
I'm asking him. Why did you speak?

46
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,270
Mr. Yin.

47
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,550
She is my assistant.

48
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,430
She is your assistant?

49
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,240
Yes.

50
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,600
All the physical evidence is here.

51
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,990
How are you going to explain?

52
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,750
Under the guise of an assistant,

53
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,790
you got involved in the affairs
of our Yin family.

54
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,350
Where did you get the ball?

55
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,630
Miss Han.

56
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,160
You should have some self-awareness.

57
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,960
Don't seduce the wrong person.

58
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,990
Mr. Feng had an agreement
with Peidong at that time

59
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,670
to take over Huajing.

60
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,990
The first thing is to marry Yin Yi.

61
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,360
Second,

62
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,040
never get a divorce in the future.

63
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,880
Miss Han.

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,550
You are in the prime of your life.

65
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,350
Do not interfere in other people's marriage.

66
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,600
We can't do this.

67
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,840
I underestimated your rationality.

68
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,640
I overestimated your rationality.

69
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,800
Cooperate with me

70
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,400
to expose the mole.

71
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,920
Then I can set you free.

72
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,670
So you mean

73
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,600
you have already seen through their plan

74
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,550
and want to go along with it?

75
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,710
Han Qing.

76
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,430
I can only trust you now.

77
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,960
Because you are like me,

78
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,790
helpless.

79
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,760
Yes.

80
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,110
I am helpless.

81
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,350
So I've fallen to this point.

82
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,720
Can you let me go?

83
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,280
I don't want to fall deeper into error.

84
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,480
Han Qing.

85
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,990
I hope you can be smarter.

86
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,790
Whether it's you

87
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,190
or me,

88
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,720
we are just a pawn to the Yin family.

89
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,640
As for your dad's matter,

90
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,670
I will help you deal with it.

91
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,670
You don't need to sacrifice yourself anymore.

92
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,720
You can try to trust me.

93
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,720
Ji Weijun will relieve you of your office

94
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,190
at the shareholders' meeting a month later.

95
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,960
He wants to sell Wanli.

96
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,430
Starting from today,

97
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,430
act with me in this play.

98
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,750
I will accompany you to the end.

100
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,360

101
