3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,080
Let go.

4
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,630
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,840
Just stay here for a few days.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
Illegal detention is against the law.

7
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,520
Don't forget

8
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,070
you admitted it yourself

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,760
that you're Mrs. Lin.

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,280
By the way,

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,760
the hotel where your father is staying

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,280
is mine.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,640
You're threatening me?

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,190
Do you have a choice?

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,990
Mrs. Lin.

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,920
I just want to know

17
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,200
how is Feng Siqian doing now.

18
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,270
He is already dead.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,230
(Lin Zongyi has gone crazy.)

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,870
(I must find a way to save myself.)

21
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,440
Has the will been prepared?

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,440
It's all set.

23
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,720
As long as the hospital takes action,

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,880
the will should take effect
as soon as Yin Peidong is dead.

25
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,670
Nine percent of the shares under his name

26
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,200
will immediately be transferred to you.

27
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,440
Plus Yin Yi and Ji Weijun's shares,

28
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,920
you'll definitely be

29
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,590
Huajing's biggest shareholder.

30
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,320
Any news about Feng Siqian?

31
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,630
His life was just saved.

32
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,760
He's under 24-hour surveillance.

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,720
His life is saved?

34
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,630
Then find someone

35
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,200
to kill him.

36
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,230
Yes.

37
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,670
But Feng Siqian has a huge influence.

38
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,920
What if he finds out?

39
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,600
Han Qing is here.

40
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,920
He wouldn't dare do anything.

41
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,040
Hello.

42
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Mr. Lin, Miss Han ran away as you expected.

43
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,480
What should we do? Should we go after her?

44
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,760
How can you get your hands dirty
to kill people?

45
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,880
You know who's perfect

46
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,670
to do this.

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
Tell him to get started quickly.

48
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,920
Sir, drive faster.

49
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,510
Okay.

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,320
Ji Weijun.

51
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,350
Where are you taking me?

52
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,240
Do you want to eat?

53
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,310
What exactly are you trying to do?

54
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,430
Use you to hold Feng Siqian up.

55
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,040
Then Lin Zongyi can quietly

56
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,670
kill Yin Peidong and get the shares.

57
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,790
It's a win-win situation, babe.

58
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,990
Did Feng Siqian have a car accident?

59
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,270
How could he come?

60
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,920
What did you do to Feng Siqian?

61
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,160
It seems you still don't know.

62
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,870
Feng Siqian has already run away.

63
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Run away?

64
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,040
Consider him lucky.

65
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,310
Otherwise, he would have been killed by us.

66
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,960
I'd like to see

67
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,430
whether you'll kill me first

68
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,640
or the police will arrest you first.

69
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,920
Dare to threaten me, huh?

70
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,400
He won't come.

71
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,310
If he doesn't come,

72
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,640
then you'll have to die.

73
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,960
With your photo,

74
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,750
I'm sure he will come.

75
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
Han Qing.

76
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,920
Are you okay?

77
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,270
Go.

78
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,820
(Lin Zongyi)

79
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Ji Weijun.

80
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,240
Weijun.

81
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,760
Weijun.

82
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
Weijun.

83
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,310
Weijun, stop chasing.

84
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,430
Come home with me.

85
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,440
Get out of my way.

86
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,190
My baby!

87
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,520
My baby!

88
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,310
Scum!

89
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,400
Yin Yi, are you okay?

90
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,030
Baby!

91
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,480
It hurts so much!

92
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,040
My baby.

93
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,360
My...

94
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,400
My baby.

95
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,640
My baby.

96
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,950
My baby!

97
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,000
My baby is gone.

98
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,070
Yin Yi, hang in there.

99
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,070
Ji Weijun, are you still human?

100
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,920
Hold on a little longer, Yin Yi.

101
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,920
Scum.

102
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,430
