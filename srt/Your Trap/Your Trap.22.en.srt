=22. Why Did We Meet=

3
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,590
Han Qing.

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,520
I used to imagine many times

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,680
that we'd walk hand in hand

6
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,720
in an afternoon like this.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,760
This

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,080
feels so good.

9
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,510
Han Qing.

10
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,990
I never thought of hurting you.

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,120
It was Ji Weijun
who took the initiative to kidnap you.

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,480
It has nothing to do with me.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,080
Just tell me.

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,710
What do you want from me?

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
How do you think Yin Yi

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,630
found your father's address

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,990
so easily?

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,030
You two are in cahoots?

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,560
But you caused her to lose her baby.

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,960
Han Qing, you are still too naive.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,510
There are no eternal enemies in this world.

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,350
All she wants is Feng Siqian

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,760
who can help her keep Huajing.

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,150
And what I want

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,990
has always been you.

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,150
I think you're crazy.

27
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,190
I am crazy.

28
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,870
I became crazy when I fell for you.

29
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,600
I became crazier when I found out

30
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,990
- you only care about Feng Siqian.
- Let go.

31
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,320
I would like to ask you for a favor.

32
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,430
Import the virus from this USB drive

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,600
into Feng Siqian's computer.

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,800
Of course,

35
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,070
you can refuse me.

36
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,480
Your father's life,

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,520
your life,

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,710
and Feng Siqian's life

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,760
are all in your hands.

40
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,510
Han Qing.

41
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,950
The scenery here is quite beautiful.

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,560
Let's enjoy it together.

43
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,790
(Han Qing,)

44
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,790
(I'm giving you one last chance,)

45
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,320
(just to watch you make the choice.)

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,720
Lin Zongyi.

47
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,700
Don't play with fire and burn yourself.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,200
Aren't you just after those shares?

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
I'll give it to you.

50
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,630
Mr. Yin favors you.

51
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,390
I want to take over the entire Huajing.

52
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,760
So I have to kill you.

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,120
Does it feel good?

54
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,790
Feng Siqian.

55
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,510
Feng Siqian.

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,280
Sorry.

57
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,390
The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,320
Please redial later.

59
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,390
Sorry.

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,510
The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,000
Yin Yi had a miscarriage.

62
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,000
You can't get away with this.

63
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,670
Feng Siqian.

64
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,040
What did you promise me back then?

65
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,510
What do you take me for?

66
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
You have been

67
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,110
a mentor to me.

68
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,350
It's good that you know.

69
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,320
I hope you keep in mind the big picture.

70
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,280
You can have a wife in name only.

71
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,760
But

72
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,720
you must never betray Huajing.

73
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,350
What's wrong? What's the rush?

74
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,960
Why are you crying?

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,080
I dreamt that you were beaten.

76
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,190
Are you silly?

77
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,280
I'm doing well.

78
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,630
Oh,

79
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,550
I found a delicious restaurant.

80
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,700

81

but years of his hard work.

189
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,640
I don't want him to give up all this
because of me.

190
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,670
You think I would say that?

191
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,710
I'm not that great.

192
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,070
A wealthy and handsome playboy

193
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,070
is really tempting.

194
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,400
During the time I spent with Feng Siqian,

195
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,240
me and my family

196
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,240
encountered too many unnecessary dangers.

197
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,160
He and I were from different worlds.

198
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,040
He was originally a bright moon,

199
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,120
I shouldn't make him leave the sky.

200
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,240
And I won't stay because of him.

201
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,830
Now I finally understand

202
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,550
why Feng Siqian likes you so much.

203
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,000
And what about you?

204
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,240
Have you ever regretted your feelings?

205
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,430
I gave all my feelings

206
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,120
to Ji Weijun.

207
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,710
Perhaps it's wrong.

208
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,670
But I have no regrets.

209
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,790
As long as you are happy.

210
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,550
Let me tell you a secret.

211
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,710
I can't get pregnant again in the future.

212
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,360
Your dad doesn't know yet, does he?

213
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,360
I told him.

214
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,240
I said

215
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,950
Feng Siqian and I will have another baby.

216
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,360
The baby will take our family name.

217
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,590
Only in this way

218
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,310
will he agree to hold a shareholders' meeting

219
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,430
and transfer his shares to me.

220
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,470
Then I can help you.

221
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,790
So

222
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,120
you are on Feng Siqian's side.

223
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,150
No.

224
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,520
I am on your side.

225
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,200
Me?

226
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,640
I went to Feng Siqian

227
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,040
with the share transfer document.

228
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,670
I threatened him to be with me
for the rest of his life.

229
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,240
He refused.

230
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,640
He said he wanted to divorce me

231
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,000
to give you a home.

232
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,640
But Han Qing, do you know?

233
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,640
Even if I give him all my shares,

234
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,360
he still couldn't secure his position
in Huajing.
