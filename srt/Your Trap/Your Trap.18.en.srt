1
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,980
=Your Trap=

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,940
=18. Become Mrs. Lin=

3
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,630
President Feng.

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,760
How is it going with the thing
I asked you to investigate?

5
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,840
I've investigated already.

6
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,670
Based on the surveillance footage

7
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,800
from the campsite,

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,590
Miss Han left with Mr. Lin in the end.

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,800
But today is Ms. Yin's birthday.

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,270
Miss Han should come over.

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,430
Got it.

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,470
Where have you been during this time?

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,080
President Feng.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,990
Miss Han is my fiancée.

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,800
Of course, she's been with me.

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,350
Say it again.

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,760
How many times do I have to tell you?

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,310
What are you arguing about?

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,760
You've come at the right time.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,040
I have something to announce.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
Miss Han and I are getting married soon.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,120
Welcome to attend our wedding next week.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,920
Is this true?

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,960
Of course.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
The two of us

26
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,150
will be as loving as Mr. Feng and Ms. Yin.

27
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,070
Uncle.

28
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,710
All of us know

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,760
about Assistant Han's identity.

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,790
What will people say

31
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,630
if you marry someone like her?

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,920
You don't care about your reputation?

33
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,270
Yin Yi.

34
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,270
Should my career and future

35
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,910
also be based on a woman's family background

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,510
like President Feng?

37
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,270
Lin Zongyi.

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,230
I have never built my career

39
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,790
on exploiting women.

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,270
Honey, I'm hungry.

41
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,600
Let's go eat something.

42
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,470
Okay.

43
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,560
Today is my daughter's birthday.

44
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,680
Please take your seats.

45
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,320
Do you know he's using you?

46
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,720
Haven't you ever used me?

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,040
If it's because of the news,

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,560
I apologize to you.

49
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,280
I wanted to clarify things

50
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,830
at the press conference,

51
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,000
but I didn't expect

52
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,880
Yin Yi used her baby to threaten me.

53
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,950
I had no choice at that time.

54
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,950
Your business is none of my concern.

55
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,230
Han Qing.

56
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,200
I came to see you yesterday.

57
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,950
But when I got there,

58
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,160
you had already left with Lin Zongyi.

59
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,120
Feng Siqian.

60
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,110
You never made me your priority.

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,390
Why should I always stand behind you?

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,040
What are you doing?

63
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,720
The banquet is about to begin.

64
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's go.

65
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,880
I'm coming, Zongyi.

66
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,950
- Ms. Yin.
- Ms. Yin.

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,920
- Ms. Yin.
- Welcome, everyone.

68
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,110
Zongyi, for you.

69
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,280
Honey.

70
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,990
I want it too.

71
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,110
My wife is pregnant.

72
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,510
So she can't drink.

73
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,310
Zongyi is not feeling well, I'll drink for him.

74
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,870
A man cannot say he is not feeling well.

75
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,280
As long as my wife is satisfied, it's fine.

76
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,350
How is the accident
of Wanli Real Estate being handled?

77
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,070
Brother-in-law.

78
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,230
I heard because of the accident,

79
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,870
Huajing lost the bid

80
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
and its stock price plummeted.

81
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,840
As the president of the company,

82
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,840
Siqian should bear the main responsibility.

83
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Do you think I don't know

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
the little tricks you played?

85
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,040
Don't talk nonsense.

86
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,230
The crane operator received one million

87
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,480
right before the accident.

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,110
And after the accident happened,

89
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,960
he disappeared.

90
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,750
Although the source of money was made clear,

91
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,750
I found the operator anyway.

92
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,630
Where is him?

93
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,870
You can rest assured about this.

94
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,080
The man is already under my protection.

95
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,430
When I find out the culprit,

96
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,190
I will give everyone an explanation.

97
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,070
Good.

98
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,190
Since Siqian already has a solution,

99
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,110
let's just follow his lead.

100
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,510
One month.

101
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,190
Next month is the year-end
project accounting for Huajing.

102
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,990
This is the deadline.

103
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,990
Discuss with Zongyi

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
if you have any requirements or ideas.

105
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,870
No need. One week is enough.

106
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,400
But before that,

107
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,600
I want to ask Mr. Lin for someone.

108
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,480
Feng Siqian.

109
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,040
Han Qing is my wife.

110
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,160
Don't go too far.

111
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,520
At Wanli Real Estate's press conference,

112
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,840
Assistant Han did a very good job

113
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,350
to suppress the fermentation of news
in the fastest time.

114
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,110
I believe she is the most familiar
with the event.

115
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,550
We'll be glad to have her help.

116
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,390
No way.

117
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
I disagree.

118
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,280
Remember Assistant Han's identity.

119
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,190
Don't mess around.

120
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,830
Honey.

121
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,190
Ease up a bit.

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,190
Don't play tricks on me.

123
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,040
You discuss these things.

124
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,430
I just want the result.

125
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,190
Take your time.

126
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,520
I'm just curious.

127
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,750
Are you reluctant to let Assistant Han go

128
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,400
or are you afraid
that I will find out something?

129
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,760
Feng Siqian.

130
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,800
I'll go.

131
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,830
Assistant Han.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,180
You have been absent from work
for more than ten days without reason.

133
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,720
Report to work on time tomorrow,
otherwise I'll deduct twice your salary.

134
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Honey.

135
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,870
I will pay for your salary.

136
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,040
I will send you to work tomorrow.

137
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,840
As long as it's what you want,

138
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,230
I will find it for you.

139
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,110
Honey.

140
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,350
We need to go to the hospital tomorrow.

141
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,310
Let's go back and rest.

142
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,480
