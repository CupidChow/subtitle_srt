(Huajing Group)

4
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,560
I heard that Mrs. Feng is coming today.

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,630
I haven't seen her yet.

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,590
We'll see her soon.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,240
- Mrs. Feng is here.
- Go, go, go.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,800
Where is Feng Siqian?

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,240
Ms. Yin, you're here.

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,390
- Mr. Feng is not here.
- How about you guys?

11
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,800
Where did Feng Siqian go?

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,310
Mr. Feng is really not here.

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,230
Not here?

14
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,990
How are things going
with the task I assigned to you?

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,840
Have you been following it?

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,760
Ms. Yin.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,710
I feel like Assistant Han is not simple.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,120
Let's wait for a longer time.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,960
Okay.

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,190
Let me tell you.

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,230
Make sure you keep an eye on her here.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,480
Don't let anything go wrong.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,440
Do you understand?

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Ms. Yin, don't worry.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,600
I will keep an eye on it.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,600
Ms. Yin, take care.

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,540
(Songs of Chu)

28
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,630
Assistant Han.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,200
Someone came to inspect the project bidding.

30
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,720
Why are you still here?

31
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,950
I'll go right away.

32
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,320
I got the thing you wanted.

33
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,790
Let my dad go.

34
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,550
Assistant Han.

35
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,000
You really didn't disappoint me.

36
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,670
Then

37
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,510
see you tonight.

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,120
See you tonight.

39
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,790
Feng Siqian.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,790
You forced me to do this.

41
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,630
Hello, Assistant Han.

42
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,760
I am Ji Weijun.

43
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,560
Where's Yin Yi?

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,280
She can't make it.

45
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,480
So I came for her instead.

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,320
Have a drink.

47
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,640
Mr. Ji is here on behalf of Ms. Yin.

48
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,640
- I'm sure you don't just want
- Enjoy.

49
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,600
to have a drink with me.

50
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Please don't tell anyone

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,520
that I came to see you.

52
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,990
My decision is also Yin Yi's decision.

53
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,870
Let me be honest.

54
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,870
I have been looking for like-minded partners.

55
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,400
I do not aspire to work under others.

56
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,750
What do you want?

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,920
I heard you already got

58
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,600
what Yin Yi asked.

59
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,070
Give it to me quickly.

60
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,990
So what can you offer me?

61
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,080
You're a smart person.

62
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,520
A wise bird chooses the tree it will nest on.

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,280
You have to sharpen your eyes.

64
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,640
After I bring down Feng Siqian,

65
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,920
it'll be beneficial to both of us.

66
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,640
Otherwise...

67
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,310
Are you threatening me?

68
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,110
It's too harsh to say it's a threat.

69
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,430
This is called win-win cooperation.

70
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,480
Since it's a win-win situation,

71
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,350
just follow my arrangements.

72
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,720
(Taking risks doesn't necessarily
lead to victory.)

73
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,280
(But if you don't take a chance,)

74
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,230
(how will you know who will turn the tables?)

75
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,550
My brother-in-law and Yin Yi haven't arrived yet,

76
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,670
but you arrived first.

77
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,880
Let's have a drink together.

78
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,120
You're here too.

79
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,920
I heard there would be a great show today.

80
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,310
I'm here to watch the show.

81
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,230
Today is Huajing's family banquet.

82
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,790
Have a great time, Mr. Lin.

83
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
Long time no see, Mr. Feng.

84
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,630
Mr. Ji.

85
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,190
I'm afraid President Feng

86
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,920
needs to change his title.

87
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,960
You didn't expect this, did you?

88
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,840
The shares I hold

89
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,670
have surpassed yours long ago.

90
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,350
You, as the president,

91
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
may have to step down soon.
