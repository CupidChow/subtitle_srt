00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,980
=Your Trap=

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,940
=4. Will the Fish Bite the Hook=

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,110
Mr. Lin, a competitor of Huajing Group,

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,950
appeared in a place where he shouldn't have been.

5
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,720
Can we call it a sinister plot?

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,400
Do you know me?

7
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,440
Nephews often resemble
their uncles in appearance.

8
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,160
Your eyes resemble Ms. Yin Yi's.

9
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,440
Why didn't you tell me you were here?

10
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,520
Disrespectful.

11
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,790
Call me Uncle.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,760
Mr. Lin.

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,760
What's up?

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,430
It's getting cold, put on a coat.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,440
Okay.

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,680
Dad.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,630
I want to move out and live on my own.

18
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,230
The house has just been renovated.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,680
Why do you want to move out?

20
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,150
It's none of your business.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,240
Mind your tone.

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,400
Aren't you by his side?

23
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,630
Why did you find an assistant for him?

24
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,070
Dad.

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,430
Huajing is a big group.

26
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,400
And you are in poor health.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,760
I found an assistant to help Siqian

28
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,070
share the workload.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,320
How many years have you been married?

30
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,270
Is there a problem with you

31
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,560
or with Feng Siqian?

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,070
You don't need to worry about our matters.

33
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,710
You're the only daughter I have.

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,960
Don't make trouble for me.

35
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,040
I'll take the shares

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,600
of Wanli Real Estate.

37
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,320
Shares can only be obtained

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,230
by one's own ability.

39
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,040
Quite a ruthless move.

40
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,040
Uncle, you're leaving me no way out.

41
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,790
Assistant Han.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,670
I besieged President Feng's chess pieces.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,070
He sacrificed the knights to save the king,

44
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,000
finally managed to escape and get a draw.

45
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,720
What kind of tactic is this?

46
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,390
"Relieving the state of Zhao
by besieging the state of Wei".

47
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,320
Miss Han is so beautiful.

48
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,880
No wonder Feng Siqian

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,320
has gone home to be with Yin Yi.

50
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,950
What do you mean?

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,390
Nothing much.

52
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,350
Just afraid you will have a child
with another woman.

53
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,000
Yin Yi is not cooperating.

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,760
One hand alone can't clap.

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,230
That's your business as a couple.

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
I won't interfere.

57
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,630
If there's nothing else,

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,280
I'll take my leave.

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,160
Assistant Han, see the guest off.

60
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,200
Mr. Lin, please.

61
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,280
You seem to be afraid of me.

62
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,670
I should show respect

63
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,920
to Mr. Feng's uncle.

64
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,390
Let's make friends.

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,550
Mr. Feng probably doesn't want

66
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,790
his assistant and his competitor

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
to become friends.

68
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,280
We're on the first floor.

69
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,280
Mr. Lin, please.

70
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,550
Lin Zongyi seems to be very interested in you.

71
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,400
I don't know about Mr. Lin,

72
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,040
but I know

73
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,350
at least you are interested in me.

74
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,960
For successful people like you,

75
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,550
abandoning wife and children,

76
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,990
emotional abuse,

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,350
possession, destruction,

78
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,960
these are

79
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,750
all trivial matters.

80
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,870
But for women,

81
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,040
marriage is a lifetime commitment,

82
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,600
a choice that will not be reversed
for a lifetime.

83
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,230
You seem to have a deep understanding of love.

84
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,400
I don't know how you men think about love,

85
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,990
but for women,

86
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,190
Love is above all.

87
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,040
Your marriage has long been broken, hasn't it?

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,920
You're so interested in my family.

89
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,990
Does that mean you're interested in me too?

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,520
Restraint.

91
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,600
Self-discipline.

92
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,190
Occupation.

93
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,750
What secrets are hidden

94
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,790
behind the flawless appearance?

95
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,110
Based on what Mr. Lin said today,

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,430
will you be caught by him?

97
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,670
I can help you.

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,040
How do you want to help me?

99
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,720
Help you keep a mistress in a love rest.

100
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,230
You are smarter than I imagined.

101
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,960
But I advise you to stay out of trouble.

102
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,400
When you truly know me,

103
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,350
I'm afraid you will be scared to approach me.

104
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,790
I said

105
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,520
I like

106
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,080
challenging things.

107
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,110
I'll go pick up Mr. Huang.

108
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,120
Wait for me here.

109
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
Han Qiannian.

110
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
It's really you.

111
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,080
Long time no see,

112
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,310
Miss Su Li.

113
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,640
I thought you'd pretend not to know me.

114
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,280
How dare you hit me!

115
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,430
There's nothing I've done

116
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,670
that I'm afraid to admit.

117
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,710
But you,

118
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,550
do you dare to admit

119
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,400
that you stole someone else's husband?

120
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,840
If I remember correctly,

121
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,080
you still have the scar on your left shoulder

122
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,280
from the beating you got as a mistress.

123
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,160
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Su Li.

125
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,760
You got here by relying on men.

126
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
I'm different.

127
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,950
If you dare to expose me in public,

128
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,640
I'll make sure

129
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,950
you can't stay in Jiangcheng.

130
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,920
Han Qiannian, I'll kill you!

131
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,760
Su Li.

132
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,630
This lady

133
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,400
is my assistant. Anything I can help you with?

134
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,550
Nothing.

135
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,520
Mr. Feng, Mr. Huang.

136
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,360
There was a misunderstanding
between me and Miss Su Li before.

137
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,640
It's all resolved now.

138
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,670
Isn't it?

139
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,880
Yes.

140
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,670
Li.

141
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Don't be immature

142
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,470
and offend Mr. Feng.

143
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,830
Apologize to Assistant Han quickly.

144
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,760
Now.

145
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,590
Miss Han.

146
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,670
I apologize to your whole family.

147
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,600
It's okay.

148
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,830
I forgive all your ancestors.

149
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,640
Okay, okay, it's all right.

150
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,720
Mr. Feng, come please.

151
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,360
This way.

152
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,760
Han Qiannian, just you wait.

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,840
Han Qiannian.

154
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,510
What do you mean?

155
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,710
A millennial vixen,

156
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,790
right?

157
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,670
Mr. Feng, if you are curious about my past,

158
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,120
just ask me directly.

159
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,160
Why listen to others' made-up stories?

160
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,430
Are you saying all of this is fake?

161
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,470
Truth mixed with fiction.

162
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,070
Just believe in what you believe.

163
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,190
I have to say

164
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,400
the way you hit people

165
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
is very interesting.

166
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,760
So, would you hit a woman?

167
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,360
Women are meant to be cherished.

168
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,120
Aren't they?

169
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,590
Can I trust your words?

170
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,070
Just trust what you trust.

171
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,190
At least for now,

172
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,710
you don't trust me,

173
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,360
I also find it hard to believe your words.

174
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,510
Come here.

175
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,810
♪I feel the weight behind my eyes♪

176
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:05,840
♪Lean towards the color that lies within♪

♪Nothing between you and I♪

178
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,120
Assistant Han.

179
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,790
You are very dangerous.

180
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,080
Is that so?

181
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,430
I have to say

182
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,040
you do have quite an impact.

183
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,190
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

184
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,510
♪Thinking of the fall out it leaves me numb♪

185
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,460
♪But it's something that might never come♪

186
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,490
♪So I'll be waiting here in your arms♪

187
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,640
(Knowing his limits and not being promiscuous.)

188
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,120
(He doesn't seem to be)

189
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,830
