Any progress?

4
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,240
Mr. Feng is much more vigilant than we thought.

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,750
He is proceeding cautiously.

6
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,680
Perhaps he knows our intentions.

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,120
I told you earlier

8
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,070
that he's difficult to deal with.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,270

Help, my daughter!

20
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,430
Those people from the casino locked me up.

21
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,070
They not only beat me
but also want to chop off my hands.

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,430
Give me two million,

23
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,480
or you won't be able to see me!

24
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,430
Han Qing, how ungrateful you are.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,070
If it weren't for your tuition fees
to study abroad,

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,560
I wouldn't have been cheated

27
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,600
of all my money.

39
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,320

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,640
Mr. Feng, I thank you on her behalf.

72
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
By the way, happy birthday.

73
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,150
Thank you.

Goodbye,

76
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,270
Mr. Feng.

77
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,840
(The hunter pays attention to risks,)

78
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,750

(If the risk is out of control,)

80
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,670
(the hunter becomes the prey.)

81
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,640
(But even hunters get hurt sometimes.)

82
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,600
(Mr. Feng,)

83
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,640
(time for me to close the trap.)

84
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,400
Miss Han.

85
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,400
Do you want to quit?

86
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,990
During my investigation,

87
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,350
there was nothing false
about Mr. Feng's personal life.

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,790
He has a strong sense of boundaries,

89
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,280
and seems to be impeccable

90
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,080
in your marriage.

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Miss Han.

92
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,080
I once told you

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,790
Feng Siqian is very good at disguising himself.

94
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,190
Ms. Yin,

95
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,550
trust is the premise of cooperation.

96
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,310
You lied.

97
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,550
Your husband is not as you described.

98
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,670
I am here to save your marriage.

99
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,350
Other matters are not my concern.

100
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,110
Now I want to terminate this deal.

101
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,600
I can offer you ten times the pay.

102
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,480
This is not about the pay.

103
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,720
Then what is the issue?

104
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,080
Don't tell me you want to

105
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,110
be Mrs. Feng.

106
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,230
Feng Siqian disguised himself as a dog

107
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,520
to gain my father's trust,

108
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,400
resorting to extreme measures.

109
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,960
Miss Han,

110
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,960
now you are just like him.

111
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,550
You are both frauds.

112
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,230
Shameless!

113
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,110
Ms. Yin, please calm down.

114
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,840
Feng Siqian's not the only person
trying to stop you, but Lin Zong...

115
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,350
You've stepped into this mess.

116
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,790
It's not possible to walk away unscathed.

117
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,430
You are threatening me.

118
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,230
It's okay if you reject me.

119
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,960
But your dad, the gambler, won't.

120
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,920
I heard he borrowed five million
from a loan shark.

121
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,600
If he doesn't pay it back on time,

122
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,430
you'll only see his dead body.

123
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,600
What do you want?

124
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,310
Help me steal the seal.

125
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,160
This is illegal.

126
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,670
Huajing Group was mine.

127
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm just taking back what belonged to me.

128
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,240
Miss Han,

129
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,350
now the fate of you and your father

130
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,870
are in your hands.

131
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,550
You should think it over carefully.

132
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,670
Did she agree?

133
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,310
As long as we get the seal,

134
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,830
everything will be taken care of.

135
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,160
Don't worry, she will have to agree.

136
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,470
But you can't mess around during this time.

137
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,590
By then, the company will be yours.

138
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
I'll just obediently be your little puppy.

139
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,430
Do you want to do it here?

140
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,790
Go home.

144
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,550
Assistant Han, bad news.

145
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,950
Something big happened to Huajing.

President Feng...

147
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,880
I can't find President Feng.
