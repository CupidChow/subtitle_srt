Assistant Han,

I'm asking you a question.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,270
Mr. Lin is right.

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,990
This is my business

14

Siqian.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,800
You will scare her like this.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,160
I have important things

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,480

00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,600
Please give us some privacy.

20

27
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,350
Mr. Feng,

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,710
you already have a wife.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,510
