=Your Trap=

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,940
=17. You Forced Me To Do This=

3
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,720
You're hurting me.

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,200
Let go.

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,150
Are you crazy?

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,040
Feng Siqian.

7
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,390
You don't trust me,
and I don't trust you either.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,760
I already have a baby now.

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,480
I have to make plans for his future.

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,840
Since Han Qing is so important to you,

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,390
I have to change my strategy now too.

12
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,200
Not only do I want you

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,440
to get Ji Weijun back to me,

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,270
I'm also going to make you the father
of my baby.

15
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,150
Yin Yi.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,390
Do you know what will happen to the people

17
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,840
who threaten me?

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Feng Siqian,

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,270
I know what you're thinking.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,480
If you want to keep Han Qing,

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,400
put on the show with me

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,340
and act like a good husband.

23
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,680
Or I'll expose you both.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,760
We'll see

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,430
who has the worst reputation,

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,350
you or Assistant Han.

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,920
Don't you dare touch her.

28
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,350
Stop.

29
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,230
Don't forget

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,230
I have the evidence of your affair.

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,710
When the time comes, I will say

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,430
Han Qing seduced you during my pregnancy.

33
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,760
Do you want Han Qing

34
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,150
to be infamous forever?

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,070
- Can you bear it?
- Over here.

36
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,960
They are ahead of us.

37
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,040
I saw it. Mr. Feng is there.

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,140
Mr. Feng, please look at the camera.

39
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,680
Take a look at the camera, Mr. Feng.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,150
Is it true about the pregnancy?

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,120
What is the current situation?

42
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,960
What's going on?

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,350
Could you respond?

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,270
Honey, your clothes are wrinkled.

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,350
Give me a smile.

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,350
Yes, can you tell us what's going on?

47
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,320
Can you respond to your affair?

48
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,160
Yes.

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,230
Please answer.

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,230
- Mr. Feng.
- Mr. Feng.

51
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,320
Mr. Feng.

52
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,950
Can you explain what happened before?

53
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,070
Can you explain the situation?

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,670
Please rest assured.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,280
I will definitely be a good wife

56
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,320
and a good mother.

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,950
Right, honey?

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,900
- Let's go get some ice cream later.
- Sure.

59
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,000
You must wait for me.

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
I want to explain it to you in person.

61
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,470
Feng Siqian.

62
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,550
Since I chose to believe you,

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,110
I will definitely wait for your explanation.

64
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,720
How did you come?

65
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,230
Feng Siqian won't come over.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,070
Have you not seen the news?

67
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,880
Please rest assured.

68
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,510
Me and President Feng

69
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,280
(Huajing News)
will guard every inch of land in Huajing.

70
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,510
Feng Siqian, president of Huajing Group,

71
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,320
and his wife attended
the annual financial conference.

72
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,400
The couple showed affection
in a high-profile manner.

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,230
Mrs. Feng promised to guard Huajing
together with Mr. Feng.

74
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,880
Please follow our news coverage.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,040
Don't look at me like that.

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm not here to sow discord.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,920
I'm here to tell you that

78
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,350
he is already very busy over there.

79
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,920
He is not coming.

80
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,040
Whether he comes or not is up to him.

81
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,320
Whether I wait or not is my own business.

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,720
Good.

83
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,230
Then I'll accompany you.

84
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,160
Actually,

85
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,230
I've been meaning to ask you a question.

86
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,920
Tell me.

87
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,960
When did you start to become interested in me?

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,400
When someone tried to steal you from me,

89
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,280
I developed a strong interest

90
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,400
in you.

91
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
Just kidding.

92
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,960
It's getting late.

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,040
Do we need to keep waiting?

94
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,120
Let's go.

95
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,920
Please have a drink with me.

96
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,280
If you come with me,

97
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,080
I'll tell you

98
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,840
how I found you.

99
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,150
Miss Han.

100
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,870
Can my wine cellar

101
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,870
satisfy your taste buds?

102
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,480
Give me a drink.

103
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,270
Miss Han.

104
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,280
Why don't I marry you?

105
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Mr. Lin.

106
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,990
Are you kidding with me?

107
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
You are a smart person.

108
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,040
Feng Siqian cannot promise you anything.

109
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,430
You watched the press conference today.

110
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,840
Between Huajing and you,

111
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,110
he chose the former without hesitation.

112
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,230
What exactly do you want to say?

113
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,430
Feng Siqian cannot protect you.

114
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,870
But I can.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,920
What are the conditions?

116
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
Be Mrs. Lin.

117
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,870
Then you will be the elder of the Yin family,

118
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,310
and Feng Siqian's aunt.

119
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,160
No one will dare to do anything to you then.

120
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,840
Sounds very tempting.

121
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,720
What can you get from this?

122
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,160
If I can get you,

123
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,790
I can get the entire Huajing.

124
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,150
Mr. Lin.

125
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,230
There's a quote I don't know if you've heard.

126
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,230
All the gifts bestowed by fate

127
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,400
have already been priced.

128
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,230
You want to refuse me?

129
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,560
Mr. Lin.

130
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,670
I don't think I am that important.

131
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,310
Nor do I think I can help you get Huajing.

132
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,110
You'd better find someone else.

133
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,750
Thank you for the wine.

134
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,760
Wait a minute.

135
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,800
Miss Han.

136
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,950
Take a look.

137
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,950
Chairman of Huajing Group suffered a stroke
and was admitted to the hospital.

138
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,040
The president and his wife
take care of him attentively,

139
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,390
being loving and affectionate.

140
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,960
Huajing Group is expected to be

141
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,920
the top enterprise in the country.

142
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,350
Mrs. Feng claimed

143
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,790
she'd leave all the shares to her son,

144
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,280
who would further expand Huajing's business.

145
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,400
Miss Han, you saw it too.

146
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,670
Now they are inseparable.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,160
What exactly are you

148
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,670
in Feng Siqian's heart?

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,920
You've been played around

150
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,950
by Feng Siqian and Yin Yi all this time.

151
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,270
Are you really willing to accept this?

152
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,000
If you are really willing to accept it,

153
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,590
you wouldn't have waited for him all night.

154
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,630
In the end,

155
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,950
you were still deceived by Feng Siqian.

156
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
You've always

157
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,190
been standing up for others.

158
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,950
This time, you need to stand up for yourself.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,840
Happy cooperation,

160
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,790
