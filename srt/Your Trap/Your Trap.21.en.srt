How is it going?

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,480
Ji Weijun has been arrested.

5
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,200
He said he had discussed it with Lin Zongyi

6
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,670
to take Ms. Yin to the factory,

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,840
intending to use her and the baby
to threaten you.

8
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,230
He didn't know

9
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,560
that was his own child.

10
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,070
This scum.

11
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,390
Cooperate with the police investigation

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,520
to catch the real culprit.

13
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,800
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,120
My baby.

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
Take a seat.

16
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,870
Did you put a tracking device on me?

17
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,870
You always manage to find me accurately.

00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:02,320
♪Lean towards the color that lies within♪

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,710
How serious is your car accident?

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,160
You're injured.

21
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,480
I'm fine now.

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
Luckily, I noticed the problem
with the car in advance.

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,790
So I stopped the car early,

24
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,400
and it didn't lead to a major accident.

25
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,440
I thought I would never see you again.

26
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,230
I'm a lucky man.

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,390
Let's go back now.

28
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,600
Siqian.

29
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,670
Yin Yi is still lying inside.

30
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,950
It's not appropriate

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,280
for you to flirt here.

32
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,200
It's you who did that

33
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,350
to Ji Weijun and Yin Yi.

34
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,990
What are you talking about, honey?

35
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,160
Wasn't it planned by you and me together?

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,790
You said you wanted to
retaliate against Feng Siqian and Yin Yi.

37
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,110
They both played you like a fool.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,320
Now you're turning against me?

39
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,950
Lin Zongyi, you are so shameless.

40
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,890
Thank you for your compliment.

41
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,070
Lin Zongyi.

42
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,830
I warned you before

43
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,070
not to stretch your hand too far.

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,390
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

45
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,630
Now Yin Yi is on my side.

46
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,480
With my shares and Yin Peidong's,

47
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,510
I can secure my position in Huajing.

48
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,280
What can you do to me?

49
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,160
Do you really think you have obtained

50
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,350
Mr. Yin's shares?

51
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,390
What do you mean?

52
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,950
Hello.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
Mr. Lin, bad news.

54
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,270
Yin Peidong has been transferred long ago.

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,150
We found no one there.

56
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,070
Stop.

57
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,830
She is my fiancée.

58
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,290
Don't even think about going anywhere.

59
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,510
Lin Zongyi, when will you ever stop?

60
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,670
Do you know that you colluded with Ji Weijun

61
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,920
and almost killed Han Qing?

62
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,830
It was you who informed Ji Weijun?

63
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,230
I warned him

64
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,510
not to harm you.

65
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,550
It was his own decision.

66
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,880
It has nothing to do with me.

67
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,630
The damage has been done.

68
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,310
I will settle accounts with you

69
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,160
for everything you did one by one.

70
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,230
But my dad is still in his hands.

71
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Don't worry.

72
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,680
You've got me.

73
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,590
Hello.

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,720
Get the shares straight for me.

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,880
President Feng.

76
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,390
Lin Zongyi has been

77
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,540
meeting with the major shareholders
of Huajing in private

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,400
to collect shares everywhere.

79
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,480
So he still hasn't given up.

80
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,680
By the way,

81
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,070
what about Mr. Yin?

82
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
How is he doing over there?

83
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,230
Mr. Yin was frightened

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,670
but it's nothing serious.

85
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,600
There is a doctor taking care of him now.

86
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,550
He should wake up soon.

87
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,590
However...

88
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,070
Speak.

89
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,040
Before he had the accident,

90
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,480
he transferred all his shares to Ms. Yin Yi.

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,480
It seems that he still doesn't trust me.

92
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,030
That's right.

93
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,190
Now, Lin Zongyi's shares

94
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,750
are almost the same as yours.

95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,360
In the end,

96
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,110
it depends on Ms. Yin Yi's attitude.

97
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,040
Okay, I got it.

98
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,510
Go back to work.

99
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,590
Okay.

100
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,640
(Yin Yi)
Feng Siqian is in big trouble.

101
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,110
Only you can help him.

102
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,230
Time flies so fast.

103
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,350
You asked me to come

104
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,750
just to catch up?

105
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,600
Your dad is safe abroad now.

106
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,960
You will reunite with him soon.

107
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,110
You wouldn't easily help me.

108
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,070
What is your condition?

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,230
During this time,

110
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,750
there is chaos within Huajing.

111
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,230
Lin Zongyi took advantage of the chaos

112
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,920
and bought a large amount of shares.

113
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,040
Now his shares

114
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,310
are equal to Feng Siqian's.

115
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,160
The shareholders' meeting will be held
next week.

116
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,520
By then, whoever gets my shares

117
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,920
will become the largest shareholder of Huajing.

118
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,190
What do you want me to do?

119
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,990
Leave Feng Siqian.

120
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,560
Then

121
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,790
I will transfer all my shares

122
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,870
to him.

123
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,190
Han Qing.

124
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,280
You should know better than me

125
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,550
what does Huajing mean to him.

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,440
You don't want to

127
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,720
ruin Feng Siqian's career and life, right?

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,640
I don't think I can influence
Feng Siqian's decisions.

129
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,760
Miss Han,

130
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,960
you've underestimated

131
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,670
your importance in Feng Siqian's heart.

132
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,510
Before, you were willing to destroy Feng Siqian

133
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,310
for Ji Weijun.

134
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,480
It seems that people change.

135
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,750
My dad was right.

136
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,240
Love

137
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,400
is the most unreliable thing in the world.

138
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,720
Only the interests in hand

139
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,840
are the most important.

140
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,430
I promised my father

141
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,190
to marry Feng Siqian

142
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,920
because only he

143
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,430
could bring continuous wealth to the Yin family

144
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,280
and help us keep Huajing.

145
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,360
Miss Han, don't blame me.

146
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,360
Ji Weijun is now in prison,

147
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,190
and I've lost my child.

148
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,310
Now I can only maintain

149
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,310
my identity as Mrs. Feng.

150
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,670
What if I refuse?

151
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,520
Then I will expose all your scandals
and insider information.

152
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,470
The acquisition will fail

153
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,430
and Huajing's stock price will plummet.

154
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,920
Everything Feng Siqian owns
will also vanish into thin air.

155
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,160
I know you love him.

156
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,040
You won't refuse.

157
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,670
Does my fiancee have time tomorrow?

158
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,240
