3
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,950
Han Qing.

4
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,520
Did you see it today?

5
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,630
I've never seen such an expression

6
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,400
on Feng Siqian's face.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,760
Mr. Lin.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,390
Aren't you tired

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,040
after acting all day?

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
I'm helping you.

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,550
Is that so?

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,240
Today you took me to the Yin family

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,920
to help me make Feng Siqian mad

14
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,920
or just to show off your trophy?

15
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,790
Mr. Lin.

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,030
You don't like me at all.

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,040
You control me

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,200
out of your desire for victory and possession.

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,600
In order to win Feng Siqian,

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,200
you're using every means possible.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,320
Tell me.

22
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,760
What do you want to get

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,120
bringing me back to Feng Siqian?

24
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,480
Otherwise, you wouldn't have

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,680
agreed to my requests so easily.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,630
Help me take down Feng Siqian
and get Wanli back.

27
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,870
Find the crane operator.

28
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,400
I can do as you said.

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,710
Let me go after it's done.

30
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,350
But Han Qing,

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,840
it seems I can't live without you now.

32
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,480
Would you like to be Mrs. Lin for real?

33
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,830
Lin Zongyi.

34
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,510
Lin Zongyi.

35
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,910
Lin Zongyi.

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,510
Lin Zongyi, let go of me!

37
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,630
Lin Zongyi!

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,390
Sober up!

39
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,910
During this time,

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,920
I will fulfill my duties as your fiancée.

41
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,480
I hope you can do it too.

42
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,950
You go first.

43
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,950
Okay.

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,000
Mr. Feng, Miss Han is here.

45
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,200
What brought Mrs. Lin here?

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,350
Call me Aunt.

47
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,200
I am no longer of any use to you.

48
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,920
Why did you ask me to come back?

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,630
You all go out first.

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,320
Okay.

51
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,230
What are you doing?

52
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,600
Hello, Mrs. Feng.

53
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,800
Mr. Feng arranged for us to come

54
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,390
and measure the size of the ring for you.

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
She is not my wife.

56
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,230
She is my aunt.

57
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,080
Nephew-in-law,

58
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,990
why are you giving me a diamond ring?

59
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,550
Mrs. Lin is already engaged.

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,720
But you don't even have a wedding ring.

61
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,040
I almost forgot.

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,430
President Feng has been married.

63
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,510
That's good.

64
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,160
President Feng, you have a good eye.

65
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,520
This ring is a classic one in our store.

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,230
Mr. Feng, we found him.

67
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,480
Keep a close watch on him. I'll be right there.

68
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,350
Are you okay to go by yourself?

69
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,430
Don't worry, Aunt.

70
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,990
You caused the accident
at the construction site.

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,230
I don't know what you're talking about.

72
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,720
Are you done yet?

73
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,280
This person not only wants to kill you,

74
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,790
but is looking for your family everywhere.

75
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,280
Once he finds them,

76
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,430
do you know what will happen?

77
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,990
Can I save my wife and child if I talk?

78
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,840
Mr. Feng has already moved your family

79
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,110
to a safe place.

80
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,520
I have never met the mastermind.

81
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,430
We have always been in contact by phone.

82
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,840
But I recorded the phone calls

83
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,190
and hid the recorder.

84
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,710
Where are the goods?

85
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,430
On the ceiling of the rented house.

86
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Go find it.

87
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes.

88
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,670
I have said all I have to say.

89
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,160
Can you release my wife and children?

90
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,640
With his temper,

91
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,670
he won't let you off so easily.

92
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,160
What else do you have on them?

93
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,270
Nothing.

94
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,280
I've said everything.

95
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,120
I said

96
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,960
I found my cousin's USB drive before.

97
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,870
It has the accounts of Wanli Real Estate.

98
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,800
Where is it?

99
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,280
I have already returned it to them.

100
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,960
I have nothing in my hands now.

101
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,310
People always have to take responsibility

102
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,600
for what they have done.

103
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,880
Turn yourself in.

104
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,230
Hey, cousin!

105
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,790
They took everything away.

106
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
Hello.

107
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,030
Have you found him?

108
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,520
In the abandoned factory to the west
of the city.

109
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,150
Han Qing.

110
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,520
I owe you this time.

111
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,040
Are you going over there now?

112
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,950
As the saying goes,

113
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,760
business is war without bullets.

114
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,360
People with a soft heart can't make money.

119
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,760
Hello.

120
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,720
Assistant Han.

121
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,370
Come to the hospital right away.

122
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,290
President Feng had a car accident.

123
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,990
Bring the account book over.

124
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,240
Bring it here.

125
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,880
You knew it a long time ago.

126
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,190
You and Feng Siqian

127
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,120
put on a show

128
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,520
and pretended to break up.

129
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,360
Isn't it just for today?

130
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,310
What are you doing?

131
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,790
The banquet is about to begin.

132
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,960
Let's go.

133
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,000
From today on,

134
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,470
accompany me in performing this play well.

135
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,190
I will believe in you.

136
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,040
Believe in me,

137
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,000
I will accompany you

138
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,710
walk the rest of the way.

139
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,470
Found him. Go get the account book.

140
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,670
Roger.

141
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,000
You know why I approached you.

142
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,240
Han Qing.

143
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,430
I have told you before.

144
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,400
I am willing to be used by you.

145
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,880
Even though I know you approached me

146
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,430
just for an act,

147
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,280
I don't care.

148
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,160
But you jeopardized my interests.

149
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,520
I just can't stand it.

150
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,520
Bring the account book over.

151
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,640
What did you do to Feng Siqian?

152
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,120
Bring it over.

153
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,550
Give me the account book.

154
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,630
Give it to me.

155
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,830
What did you do to Feng Siqian?

156
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,470
Feng Siqian?

157
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,670
A car accident.

158
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,590
The account book is in my hand.

159
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,310
He can still survive.

160
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,590
It seems that he's really important to you.

161
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,120
Very important.

162
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,600
What's going on?

163
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,980
President Feng and the old man
left together in a car today,

164
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,290
but they had a car accident on the way.

165
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,520
Both of them are still unconscious.

166
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,790
It must be Feng Siqian.

167
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,760
Ms. Yin, please calm down.

168
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,950
How can I calm down?

169
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,240
I have had someone check it.

170
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,400
The brake pad has been replaced.

171
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,980
If it wasn't Feng Siqian, who else would it be?

172
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
He is a jinx.

173
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,470
