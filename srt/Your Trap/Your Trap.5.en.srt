=5. Guess=

3
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,320
Is there anything?

4
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,390
I came to thank you, President Feng.

5
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,120
Are you always

6
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,120
so cold towards women?

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,710
I know that your marriage exists in name only.

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,680
Don't you have any needs at all

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,520
as a man?

10
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,630
Why did you get drunk without drinking today?

11
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,480
Perhaps you don't know

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,680
what kind of person I am.

13
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,560
You

14
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,600
are

15
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,230
a devil

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
who captivates souls.

17
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,760
You came to Jiangcheng without telling me.

18
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,200
It seems like I came at the wrong time.

19
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,950
Ask her out to see me.

20
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,630
When did you become so curious?

21
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,910
Siqian.

22
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,760
I'm just reminding you

23
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,440
Yin Yi is still waiting for you at home.

24
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,440
Lin Zongyi.

25
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,550
You should mind your own problems first.

26
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,480
Just now, Huang Yao from Wanli Real Estate

27
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,880
came to my room to discuss business.

28
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,950
He plans to sell Wanli Group.

29
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,070
You know that.

30
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,790
He will sell
to whoever offers the highest price.

31
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,600
I heard that you offered five hundred million.

32
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,440
So I offered six million.

33
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,320
Huang Yao agreed.

34
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,920
How could I mess up

35
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,550
a sure thing?

36
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Don't fool me.

37
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,630
Assistant Han.

38
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,790
I don't want such things

39
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,310
to happen again.

40
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,070
Mr. Feng.

41
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,670
What if I really like you?

42
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,350
I have told you before.

43
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,280
Don't give yourself away

44
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,640
and let me catch you myself,

45
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,480
otherwise,

46
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,190
you will be responsible for the consequences.

47
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,550
I'm willing to bear

48
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,960
any consequences.

49
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,320
You?

50
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,640
You think with such seductive eyes,

51
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,110
you can be a vixen?

52
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,750
Will you take the bait?

53
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,440
Assistant Han,

54
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,550
don't forget who you are.

55
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,720
Which of us do you think

56
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,840
will win the game?

57
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,030
Get lost.

58
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,720
What are you doing here?

59
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,110
I thought Miss Han only knew
about the besieging tactic.

60
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,840
I didn't expect you to be so skilled
in setting up a honey trap.

61
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,430
I don't understand what you're saying.

62
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,600
Aren't you supposed to discuss
a beast in human face with me?

63
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,070
Let me go!

64
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,480
Feng Siqian doesn't know
how to cherish pretty women,

65
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,480
but I do.

66
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,400
You're a rare piece of jade.

67
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,790
I like it.

68
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,550
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

69
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,920
But instead of being

70
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,350
a piece of jade to be played with,

71
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,990
I prefer to be a stone.

72
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,960
Don't be ungrateful.

73
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,320
Mr. Lin.

74
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,790
Do you want the whole company to know

75
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,160
you're trying to rape Assistant Han?

76
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,750
Now you're casting your net
over Lin Zongyi's head.

77
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,510
What?

78
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,110
One fish is not enough for you, huh?

79
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,160
Mr. Feng,

80
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,550
you compare yourself to my fish,

81
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,640
but I never said I was your bait.

82
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,590
It was you

83
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,280
who asked me to not give myself away.

84
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,400
And you also said

85
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,670
I shouldn't forget who am I.

86
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,190
Now you're lashing out at me.

87
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,310
I don't know what you mean.

88
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,840
Is that so?

89
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,640
Han Qing.

90
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,790
A mistress dispeller

91
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,590
who charges high fees

92
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,190
to help rich wives catch mistresses.

93
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,240
A slippery liar.

94
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,310
Why do you think a woman like you

95
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,400
would approach me?

96
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,880
Now that you've found out,

97
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,000
you shouldn't have saved me

98
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,470
and brought me back here.

99
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,280
Assistant Han,

100
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,950
you don't look like an assistant at all.

101
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,670
Do you like my looks?

102
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,710
I don't need

103
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,720
a disloyal woman.

104
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,830
If I could get a man like Mr. Feng,

105
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,950
why would I be disloyal?

106
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,120
What a sharp tongue.

107
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,760
(After learning the prey's habits,)

108
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,590
(we set traps in the right place)

109
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,470
(and wait for the opportunity to strike,)

110
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,040
(the prey will definitely fall in.)

111
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,540
(Bathroom)

112
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,360
What are you doing?

113
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,000
What exactly do you want?

114
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,160
Isn't this what you want?

115
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,860
