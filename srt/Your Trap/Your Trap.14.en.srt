3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,780
(Han Qing, Huajing Group)

4
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,460
(Resignation Letter from Han Qing)

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,480
How is the acquisition going,

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,320
Feng Siqian?

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,680
Mr. Lin.

8
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,800
You'd better mind your own business first.

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,350
Assistant Han has a good eye.

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,710
Knowing that Huajing is unreliable,

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,590
coming to me to be my woman

12
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,440
is the right thing to do.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,710
I dare you to get closer to Han Qing again.

14
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,990
Are women that important to you?

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,230
It seems so.

16
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,040
You make all this fuss over a woman.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,350
Now that you have Yin Yi,

18
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,870
you still covet other women.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,350
How dare you offend my brother-in-law?

20
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,270
It's good that Assistant Han is smart.

21
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,230
She knows that you are just using her.

22
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,910
Uncle.

23
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,270
You better take care of

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,070
your company's mess, okay?

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,070
I hope you can still swagger around like this

26
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,560
a few days later.

27
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,710
I'm off.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,120
- What's wrong?
- Mr. Feng, we found Assistant Han.

29
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,150
She seems to be in trouble.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,400
- Please come over quickly.
- What?

31
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,840
Yes, it's her.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,560
Take a good look, everyone.

33
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,190
Come on.

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,670
Look at yourselves.

35
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,200
My job

36
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,550
is to help the abused party in a marriage

37
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,920
defend their rights

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,670
without violating the laws.

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
I, Han Qing, can swear that

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,040
I have never done anything illegal.

41
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,320
But what about you guys?

42
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,830
Do you dare to swear?

43
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,480
Have you never interfered

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,440
in someone else's marriage?

45
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,560
Han Qing.

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,510
Then why did you sneak your way
into President Feng's marriage

47
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,630
and get fired by Huajing Group?

48
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,910
Han Qing.

49
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,110
Without Feng Siqian,

50
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll see how you show off again.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,230
Who told you that Assistant Han
was fired by Huajing?

52
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,000
Wasn't she fired?

53
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,390
She did submit a resignation letter to me.

54
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
But I didn't approve of it.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,200
So she still works for me.

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,040
Who is he?

57
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,790
What?

58
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,890
Do you still need to record?

59
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,830
Can't you understand what he said?

60
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,670
Just get lost!

61
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,880
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

62
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,230
You have noting to say to me?

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,760
Haven't we said everything
that needs to be said?

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,040
What?

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,160
The weather is nice,

66
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,600
so you came shopping?

67
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,550
I was afraid you'd be bullied.

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,600
Why?

69
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,000
Will you protect me

70
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,510
from anyone who bullies me?

71
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,160
I'll protect you

72
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,990
