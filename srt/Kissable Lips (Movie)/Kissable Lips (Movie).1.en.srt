00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:00,558
I'm Choi Min Hyun.

183
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,318
I'm a freshman in the 21st class of the Department of Photography and Imaging.

184
00:18:03,318 --> 00:18:05,608
I like basketball...

185
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:08,641
and all other ball games.

186
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:11,628
Enough.

187
00:18:35,768 --> 00:18:38,688
The person you are trying to reach is not available.

188
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,478
I couldn't tell you earlier,

189
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:52,745
but apparently, I was almost kidnapped when I was little.

190
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:59,078
Actually, my parents died when I was young.

191
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:08,528
So... my brother is like my parent.

192
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:11,968
At that time... my brother, who was the only one anxiously worried,

193
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:16,208
reported it to the police and made a huge fuss.

194
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:22,308
Oh, so that's why your brother comes to pick you up.

195
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:24,768
Well, I can understand him but...

196
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:27,898
I'm not sure.

197
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:33,628
I just want to live normally.

198
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:50,288
I know that feeling.

199
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:52,652
Why would you feel that way?

200
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:58,575
Honestly, everyone probably knows who you are.

201
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:01,085
You're the most handsome guy in our department.

202
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:07,000
You knew who I was?

203
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,530
Then, why didn't I know you?

204
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,718
Now that you know,

205
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,328
it's fine.

206
00:20:36,758 --> 00:20:39,238
Don't do it! Hyung!

207
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,160
Don't. I mean it.

208
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,933
♫ How could I survive without you ♫

209
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:53,504
Please, stop looking at me.

210
00:20:56,167 --> 00:21:00,590
♫ I... I'll never let you go ♫

211
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,752
I'm confused.

212
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:06,254
About what?

213
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:11,058
About the way you're looking at me.

214
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:13,700
Is now the time?

215
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,058
♫ Hoping this will make you smile ♫

216
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:23,700
♫ Even if I'm not with you, I feel you all the time ♫

217
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,020
♫ I don't want you to be afraid ♫

218
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,738
♫ 'Cause I'm always next to you ♫

219
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,043
- It's a Polaroid.
- What?

220
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:52,770
Hyung, can I take a picture with this?

221
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,977
Can I take a picture with this?

222
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:00,886
I don't take photos (with it).

223
00:22:02,908 --> 00:22:04,576
All right then.

224
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:27,533
Hyung, I had a lot of fun today.

225
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,204
Me too.

226
00:22:30,544 --> 00:22:33,322
Hyung, can I hang out at your hideout again next time?

227
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:35,695
It's not a hideout.

228
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:39,881
Why not? It is a hideout that I want to hang out again at.

229
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:43,650
Sure. Come whenever you're bored.

230
00:22:58,058 --> 00:22:59,918
Hey, Choi Min Hyun!

231
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,446
I'm in trouble.

232
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:05,575
Hyung, I'll be going first.

233
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:07,675
I'll see you again at the next meetup for the assignment.

234
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,796
You came early today.

235
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:29,036
Yeah.

236
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,642
White clothes look really good on you.

237
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:34,969
I do have quite a lot of white clothes at home.

238
00:24:36,826 --> 00:24:38,696
It suits you well.

239
00:24:45,992 --> 00:24:48,446
Why do you keep acting like that?

240
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,316
Excuse me?

241
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:54,816
You're having a hard time looking at me like something is broken.

242
00:24:58,576 --> 00:25:00,746
Do you like me?

243
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:03,230
You...

244
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:07,758
You! I mean...

245
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,825
I don't even need to ask.

246
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:15,056
Are you okay?

247
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:25,796
I thought the symptoms had stopped.

248
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,919
Didn't you go home?

249
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:47,052
What about your brother?

250
00:25:48,726 --> 00:25:51,136
I snuck out.

251
00:25:51,136 --> 00:25:52,746
Are you allowed?

252
00:25:53,446 --> 00:25:55,586
No.

253
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:59,136
I should get this over with quickly before I get emotionally attached.

254
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:00,636
Min Hyun.

255
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,396
Yes.

256
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,129
My joke went too far earlier, right?

257
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:11,917
Not at all. I also know...

258
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:13,667
that it was a joke.

259
00:26:18,106 --> 00:26:23,156
Then, can I ask you something?

260
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:24,596
What?

261
00:26:25,966 --> 00:26:27,576
Do you like me?

262
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:34,054
- Do I like you?
- Yeah.

263
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:38,086
How about you?

264
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,416
Do you like me?

265
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,723
Yes. I like you.

266
00:26:44,376 --> 00:26:46,466
You're not joking with me again, right?

267
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,407
No.

268
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:55,706
Can I kiss you?

269
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:06,911
The person you are trying to reach is not available.

270
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:15,428
♫ How could I resist destiny? ♫

271
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:22,918
♫ Drawn into your gaze, moonlit eyes ♫

272
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:31,167
♫ And since the day I met you. Every day you grow ♫

273
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:37,542
♫ More and more in my heart ♫

274
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:40,617
Brother? Why are you...?

275
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,857
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?!

276
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:48,056
What were you planning on doing to my younger brother, you bastard?!

277
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:49,974
Give it to me straight!

278
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,443
Come fast.

279
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:13,770
Are you not going to see me anymore?

280
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:33,127
I was conceited.

281
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:36,581
(I believed) even vampires could endure their hunger.

282
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:41,975
Get a hold of yourself!

283
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:13,966
First, you must make him fall in love with you.

284
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:16,850
In order to experience the true merit of drinking a pureblood's blood to become a human,

285
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,242
you must win their heart.

286
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:27,336
A vampire will walk the path of death when they suck dry a human of their blood,

287
00:29:27,336 --> 00:29:30,326
but a vampire who drinks from a pureblood,

288
00:29:30,326 --> 00:29:32,886
can become human.

289
00:29:35,116 --> 00:29:36,966
How about you?

290
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,319
Do you like me?

291
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:43,606
I can't do this.

292
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:48,558
I said let me go.

293
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:51,234
Choi Min Hyun.

294
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,078
You don't think about me, do you?

295
00:29:54,078 --> 00:29:56,600
For the past ten years, I've been raising you alone.

296
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,978
I'm always anxious, worrying something might happen to you when I'm not there.

297
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:04,078
And I always hold on to my phone at work worrying about you.

298
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:06,435
You don't care about me, right?

299
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:08,928
Am I right?

300
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:12,508
Please pick up your phone. Contact me. Tell me if you go somewhere. Please! Please! Please!

301
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:14,976
Is this such a crime?

302
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:16,042
What?

303
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:19,388
What did I do so wrong?

304
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:22,941
- I can't even be with the person I like?
- What?

305
00:30:24,317 --> 00:30:26,108
You like that jerk?

306
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:27,608
Yeah.

307
00:30:28,738 --> 00:30:30,929
I like him.

308
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:35,871
Damn it!

309
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:38,412
You're driving me crazy.

310
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:43,005
Are you acting like this because Jun Ho is a guy?

311
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,984
- It's a polaroid.
- What?

312
00:31:36,158 --> 00:31:39,748
Hyung, can I take a picture with this?

313
00:32:19,682 --> 00:32:21,965
You still haven't drank from him?

314
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:24,868
As you can see.

315
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,482
You were so confident.

316
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:29,433
What have you been doing till now?

317
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:32,160
Do you even want to become human?

318
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:38,461
I can't even see you clearly now.

319
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:43,555
How can you even laugh in this situation?

320
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:45,767
There's something I learned after living for 500 years.

321
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:47,533
What's that?

322
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:50,908
Your heart becomes at ease if you give up.

323
00:32:50,908 --> 00:32:52,682
What?

324
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:55,931
I gave up. I want to stop now.

325
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:34,752
Where have you been?

326
00:33:34,752 --> 00:33:37,092
I've been waiting for a really long time.

327
00:33:42,902 --> 00:33:45,132
Why did you just leave earlier?

328
00:33:58,592 --> 00:34:00,775
Are you not going to see me anymore?

329
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:17,455
We didn't do anything wrong.

330
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:21,305
You said you liked me.

331
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:28,066
I like you, too.

332
00:34:32,632 --> 00:34:35,021
I don't think I told you before...

333
00:34:37,962 --> 00:34:41,447
Sorry. It was a lie.

334
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:45,892
If you were being sincere, I'm sorry.

335
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:48,199
I was just joking.

336
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:18,853
You still remember me, don't you?

337
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:23,286
So, where do I need to go?

338
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:29,903
You're lying.

339
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:39,294
It's because you might kill me.

340
00:35:41,442 --> 00:35:43,634
You're a vampire.

341
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:50,258
And I'm a pureblood human.

342
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:59,272
Listen carefully. You were almost killed...

343
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:04,430
- What?
- ...by a vampire.

344
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,808
Vampire?

345
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,808
The reason why you're so special...

346
00:36:10,808 --> 00:36:13,078
is because you're a pureblood human.

347
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:27,697
But... you didn't harm me.

348
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,955
It's because you like me.

349
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,458
Right?

350
00:36:45,642 --> 00:36:47,238
You're still the same.

351
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:52,140
Hyung!

352
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:56,699
Long time no see.

353
00:37:02,475 --> 00:37:04,923
It's been a long time,

354
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:07,183
and you're not going to greet me?

355
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:10,200
Follow me.

356
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,090
You're really on the brink of death.

357
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:20,712
If you don't want to die, cut the crap.

358
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:28,089
Is that something you should be saying to your brother you haven't seen in ten years?

359
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,113
Hyung.

360
00:37:43,517 --> 00:37:45,233
So, it's him.

361
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:03,269
Is he really not going to see me?

362
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:08,460
No. He's probably being cautious.

363
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,841
He probably never imagined I would know.

364
00:38:23,408 --> 00:38:25,565
He's the pureblood human, right?

365
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:31,348
What is your purpose?

366
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:33,250
Why are you curious about that?

367
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,640
If it's because of guilt that you can't feed, then let's share.

368
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,333
How about we become humans after feeding on him together?

369
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:47,405
In the end, he'll die. But then, you won't be the sole killer.

370
00:38:52,558 --> 00:38:55,171
Let's live relying on each other when we become humans.

371
00:38:56,808 --> 00:38:58,548
Just like old times.

372
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:05,335
Didn't I tell you to cut the crap or I'd kill you?

373
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:10,555
I won't stand still if you do something to him.

374
00:39:37,328 --> 00:39:40,574
Why is this only happening to me? Seriously.

375
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:55,308
I told you to take it easy.

376
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:58,338
It's the first time I've seen you with such a scary look.

377
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:08,598
We've met before, right?

378
00:40:14,558 --> 00:40:16,310
Is he your friend?

379
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,250
We are...

380
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,400
a little more than friends.

381
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:52,398
It was hard to get this.

382
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:55,282
Did you call him?

383
00:40:56,305 --> 00:40:58,825
I couldn't help but call him.

384
00:40:58,825 --> 00:41:02,006
I know what you're thinking...

385
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:02,809
But?

386
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:04,542
You should put yourself in my shoes.

387
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:07,058
My friend of 30 years is dying

388
00:41:07,058 --> 00:41:10,108
and there is a way to live, but he still chooses to die.

389
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:12,403
How do you think I feel just watching you?

390
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,660
Even so, you should've at least told me!

391
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:22,144
Jun Ho, don't think about anything but surviving.

392
00:41:25,642 --> 00:41:28,206
Please, say something!

393
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,808
It looks like he has feelings for the pureblood.

394
00:42:04,808 --> 00:42:06,838
He's probably mistaken.

395
00:42:07,917 --> 00:42:10,269
If you want to become a human through a pureblood's blood,

396
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:12,433
you have to win their heart.

397
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:15,033
So, he can be confused.

398
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,475
That's why I need you to guide him.

399
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:21,578
Before Jun Ho dissipates.

400
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:11,893
What is it?

401
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,523
This place has changed a lot...

402
00:43:23,725 --> 00:43:25,395
since then.

403
00:43:29,433 --> 00:43:31,873
If you're going to die soon, just tell me.

404
00:43:33,267 --> 00:43:34,841
What's the problem?

405
00:43:36,975 --> 00:43:38,397
Hyung.

406
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:43,217
We weren't like this before.

407
00:43:44,933 --> 00:43:49,692
Or... are you still not over what happened then?

408
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:53,531
I'm not hoping for much.

409
00:43:55,408 --> 00:43:58,085
Just tell me, what state you're in?

410
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:01,560
You're right.

411
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:05,914
We weren't like this before.

412
00:44:07,048 --> 00:44:10,425
Also, in the end, you didn't do anything wrong...

413
00:44:13,558 --> 00:44:16,070
...since I was the one who killed him.

414
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:22,927
♫ All I think about is you ♫

415
00:44:24,783 --> 00:44:26,253
Hyung.

416
00:44:27,644 --> 00:44:28,788
Hyung!

417
00:44:28,788 --> 00:44:33,929
♫ You're just like a star, so beautiful ♫

418
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:37,078
♫ Here I am ♫

419
00:44:37,078 --> 00:44:40,518
- Hyung.
- I didn't want to admit it.

420
00:44:40,518 --> 00:44:42,258
So, I kept avoiding it.

421
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:45,038
♫ Don't you worry, you're not alone ♫

422
00:44:45,038 --> 00:44:47,083
You found out about what I wanted to keep hidden the most.

423
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:50,338
♫ Here I am ♫

424
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:51,292
So what?

425
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:55,208
♫ You're the only one ♫

426
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,250
What does...

427
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,833
♫ That I'll ever love ♫

428
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:02,858
♫ How could I survive without you ♫

429
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:06,625
...that have to do with you wanting to die?

430
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:09,568
♫ Call up all memories ♫

431
00:45:09,568 --> 00:45:11,588
I'm scared...

432
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:16,318
history will repeat itself.

433
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:17,468
What?

434
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,348
Don't tell me...

435
00:45:22,438 --> 00:45:24,258
you like him.

436
00:45:35,138 --> 00:45:37,443
Hyung, pull yourself together.

437
00:45:47,668 --> 00:45:49,348
It's okay.

438
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:37,724
I can kill him if he's in the way, right?

439
00:46:52,836 --> 00:46:55,390
Oh, blood...

440
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:55,644
- Drink it.
- What?

441
00:47:55,644 --> 00:47:58,894
Aren't you like this because of the smell of my blood?

442
00:47:58,894 --> 00:48:00,664
Get out of my way.

443
00:48:00,664 --> 00:48:03,194
Since there's no one here,

444
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:05,254
drink it.

445
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:06,654
Are you kidding me?

446
00:48:06,654 --> 00:48:08,004
No.

447
00:48:08,004 --> 00:48:09,788
I'm serious.

448
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:13,430
I can give you as much as you want.

449
00:48:14,504 --> 00:48:16,844
So, go for it.

450
00:48:16,844 --> 00:48:20,054
This is why I hate you.

451
00:48:20,054 --> 00:48:22,244
Do you think everything is that easy?

452
00:48:23,158 --> 00:48:26,278
Stop saying childish things like a little kid.

453
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:34,424
Hyung.

454
00:49:00,674 --> 00:49:02,324
I can kill him

455
00:49:04,554 --> 00:49:06,521
if he's in the way, right?

456
00:49:10,624 --> 00:49:12,901
This is driving me crazy!

457
00:49:17,094 --> 00:49:18,555
Hi.

458
00:49:23,984 --> 00:49:25,494
I'm here to see you.

459
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:36,224
I get it now.

460
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:40,433
This is what Jun Ho likes.

461
00:49:40,433 --> 00:49:42,992
What are you talking about?

462
00:49:42,992 --> 00:49:45,232
I heard your blood taste very good.

463
00:49:49,004 --> 00:49:50,704
Pureblood's blood.

464
00:49:52,024 --> 00:49:54,358
What are you doing?

465
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:57,674
Does Jun Ho know you're acting like this?

466
00:49:57,674 --> 00:49:59,433
What?

467
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:01,973
You guys don't seem to be on good terms.

468
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:05,130
Can you treat me like this?

469
00:50:07,558 --> 00:50:09,415
How interesting.

470
00:50:10,077 --> 00:50:13,924
I'm going to leave if you don't have anything more to say.

471
00:50:13,924 --> 00:50:16,004
You're heavily mistaken.

472
00:50:19,294 --> 00:50:22,004
Do you think you're someone special?

473
00:50:24,492 --> 00:50:26,462
I think you're mistaken.

474
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:30,594
A pureblood human is just food to vampires.

475
00:50:31,604 --> 00:50:34,874
On top of that, a very precious food that can

476
00:50:34,874 --> 00:50:37,332
turn them into a human just by feeding on them.

477
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:41,866
That's probably why Jun Ho cherishes and protects you.

478
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:50,544
If you mistook that for love,

479
00:50:52,034 --> 00:50:54,224
that's pretty sad.

480
00:50:54,224 --> 00:50:56,594
Are you a vampire, too?

481
00:51:04,308 --> 00:51:07,359
I love the sight of scared humans.

482
00:51:11,754 --> 00:51:13,509
I want to...

483
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:18,492
slowly...

484
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,739
play with them.

485
00:51:28,017 --> 00:51:31,664
It was me who was by Jun Ho's side for centuries.

486
00:51:31,664 --> 00:51:33,524
And in the future, too.

487
00:51:34,304 --> 00:51:37,514
I'm the only one who can understand everything about him.

488
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:39,504
It's not you...

489
00:51:40,694 --> 00:51:42,584
who only knew him for just a few months.

490
00:51:44,524 --> 00:51:47,978
It's not about the time you've spent together.

491
00:51:48,944 --> 00:51:52,320
It doesn't matter if it was centuries or a few days.

492
00:51:54,284 --> 00:51:56,422
It's about Jun Ho's heart.

493
00:51:58,924 --> 00:52:00,565
So?

494
00:52:02,314 --> 00:52:04,301
I like Jun Ho.

495
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,740
And I'm the one by his side now.

496
00:52:12,874 --> 00:52:14,476
Not you.

497
00:53:05,714 --> 00:53:07,114
Min Hyun.

498
00:53:09,894 --> 00:53:11,144
Hyung.

499
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:14,145
Are you okay?

500
00:53:15,624 --> 00:53:18,834
It's no big deal. Why are you here?

501
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:23,450
How could I pretend and cold-heartedly leave when a sick person is in front of me?

502
00:53:24,424 --> 00:53:27,634
I'm probably the only one who cares this much about you.

503
00:53:27,634 --> 00:53:30,514
You're right. You're right.

504
00:53:30,514 --> 00:53:32,920
I hugged you because

505
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,242
you were shaking a lot in your sleep.

506
00:53:35,242 --> 00:53:38,867
It became warmer while I hugged you,

507
00:53:38,867 --> 00:53:41,192
so I fell asleep, too.

508
00:53:42,992 --> 00:53:46,418
You have to go quickly. If your brother knows...

509
00:53:48,104 --> 00:53:52,434
Hyung, can I just eat ramen before going?

510
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:08,308
By any chance, do you know a student named Choi Min Hyun?

511
00:54:08,308 --> 00:54:10,863
Ah, yes. We're in the same department.

512
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:35,244
You're the one who called me?

513
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:38,234
I know this is a bit childish,

514
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:39,806
but this is the easiest way.

515
00:54:39,806 --> 00:54:42,456
What do you gain from doing this?

516
00:54:43,604 --> 00:54:45,480
I'm not trying to gain anything.

517
00:54:47,594 --> 00:54:49,724
I just don't want to lose anything.

518
00:54:52,534 --> 00:54:55,154
You told me I was heavily mistaken last time, right?

519
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:58,933
However, I think you're the one who's mistaken.

520
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:02,766
Jun Ho never once...

521
00:55:04,614 --> 00:55:07,177
belonged to you, right?

522
00:55:15,492 --> 00:55:18,277
- Hyung, you just got here?
- Yes.

523
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:21,744
You told me to tell Min Hyun to meet at the rooftop earlier.

524
00:55:21,744 --> 00:55:23,292
So I thought you were on the rooftop.

525
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:26,508
I did? Who told you so?

526
00:55:26,508 --> 00:55:30,812
I don't know. Someone said you told them to, so I relayed the message to Min Hyun.

527
00:55:35,036 --> 00:55:37,475
I guess there's something you didn't know.

528
00:55:37,475 --> 00:55:39,657
Jun Ho will die soon.

529
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:49,630
He killed a human.

530
00:55:54,216 --> 00:55:57,879
Additionally, he killed the person, his lover, by sucking his blood.

531
00:55:58,767 --> 00:56:01,238
Humans like you would never know...

532
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:06,267
how ridiculous love is...

533
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:08,737
in front of desire.

534
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,087
Jun Ho would never do that.

535
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:53,347
Hyung, why...

536
00:56:54,242 --> 00:56:56,772
do you only look at those trivial things?

537
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,484
You knew, didn't you?

538
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,801
That I liked you.

539
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:26,686
But you pretended that you didn't know, right?

540
00:57:28,492 --> 00:57:30,412
No matter how hard I tried,

541
00:57:32,975 --> 00:57:35,555
you always ignored me.

542
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:09,327
Hyung.

543
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,286
It's okay.

544
00:58:28,286 --> 00:58:30,773
It's not your fault, Hyung. It's okay.

545
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:43,264
Don't worry.

546
00:58:45,183 --> 00:58:47,078
You have me.

547
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,368
We need to talk.

548
01:00:04,548 --> 01:00:05,646
Jun Ho...

549
01:00:05,646 --> 01:00:10,257
I didn't know when you would dissipate so...

550
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:13,387
Don't tell me...

551
01:00:14,196 --> 01:00:17,019
Did something happen to that guy?

552
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:21,898
Or...

553
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,498
Hae Soo...

554
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:29,585
I killed him.

555
01:00:36,806 --> 01:00:38,406
You...

556
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:42,139
You truly love him, don't you?

557
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:48,514
Then, are you just going to dissipate?

558
01:00:55,242 --> 01:00:56,982
Don't...

559
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,055
ever do this again.

560
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:53,048
Shall we go?

561
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:58,086
You pretend not to be,

562
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,970
but you're also scared (of me).

563
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:14,592
I did it to protect you.

564
01:02:16,725 --> 01:02:19,240
I'm really fine,

565
01:02:20,142 --> 01:02:22,572
so you don't need to explain anymore.

566
01:02:46,017 --> 01:02:48,327
Let's be honest with each other for once.

567
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:54,895
Apparently, I'm a pureblood human.

568
01:02:56,836 --> 01:02:59,400
And my blood is what you need, right?

569
01:03:05,058 --> 01:03:08,447
I can't just sit back and watch you in pain.

570
01:03:09,346 --> 01:03:14,436
You gave me enough happiness and interest.

571
01:03:16,066 --> 01:03:19,554
I can't live at ease without you.

572
01:03:21,276 --> 01:03:24,006
The reason why you can't drink my blood...

573
01:03:24,976 --> 01:03:28,148
is because, if you do, you may put me in danger.

574
01:03:29,136 --> 01:03:30,726
Right?

575
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,746
Just turn a blind eye and forget about it.

576
01:03:34,746 --> 01:03:36,253
Hyung.

577
01:03:40,042 --> 01:03:42,825
I'm not a kid.

578
01:03:42,825 --> 01:03:45,166
Don't put me before you

579
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:48,506
because I'm not doing this for you.
(T/N: Literally, he said "because I'm not thinking about you")

580
01:03:48,506 --> 01:03:51,120
If you want to do something for me,

581
01:03:51,876 --> 01:03:54,466
then drink my blood.

582
01:03:54,466 --> 01:03:56,875
This is for me and not you.

583
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:59,386
This is what I want.

584
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:20,850
If that's what you want...

585
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:23,503
let's not do what each other wants.

586
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:29,200
Let's not do what each other wants?

587
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,908
Yes.

588
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,514
Let's be selfish.

589
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:37,154
Then, Hyung, do you want to kiss right now?

590
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:40,656
No.

603

What time is it?

611
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:29,393
Hold on.

612
01:06:46,142 --> 01:06:47,930
Is your phone off?

01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:49,583
No.

614
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:53,700
What? It's already 9:00 a.m?

615
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,767
- Get up, Hyung.
- Why?

616
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:58,186
- We have to go to school.
- What?

617
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:08,410
[President Ok Mi Ran]

618
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,434
Is your heart at ease?

619
01:07:26,908 --> 01:07:28,200
Yes.

620
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:31,420
Then, it's all good.

621
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:16,133
I'm sorry. I came too late, didn't I?

622
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,620
Did something happen?

623
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,480
Why have you been acting like this since earlier?

624
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,350
Be quiet.

625
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:58,597
I'm never going to lose you.

626
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:12,043
Tell me. What is it?

627
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:17,400
I get anxious without you.

628
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:21,340
Because I'm so happy right now...

629
01:09:24,533 --> 01:09:26,373
and I'm scared.

630
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:32,637
Hyung.

631
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:36,392
Live a little longer with me.

632
01:09:36,392 --> 01:09:38,520
Drink my blood.

633
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,090
Please.

634
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:44,880
Fine.

635
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,380
Then drink it right now.

636
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:50,440
I'm ready.

637
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,270
It'll be night soon, so let's do it tomorrow morning.

638
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:56,334
Really? Don't run away.

639
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:03,478
I won't run away.

640
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:05,560
I've become afraid, now that death was near.

641
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,741
My final moment with you...

642
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,179
Hyung?

643
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:38,970
Hyung!

644
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,024
Hyung!

645
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,246
You were here...

646
01:13:04,508 --> 01:13:05,884

♫ I fall in love with you again and all over again ♫

651
01:13:31,183 --> 01:13:35,019
I guess I was too late. I'm sorry.

652
01:13:35,975 --> 01:13:37,845
Why are you leaving already?

653
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:43,130
You said you would be by my side.

654
01:13:44,982 --> 01:13:47,700
I didn't want you to see this side of me.

655

♫ 'Cause you are my only one ♫

656
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:58,620
I liked that you were by my side towards the end of my long boring life.

657
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,710
So much to the point that, even though I lived 500 years,

658
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:04,590
I want to constantly look back on those moments.

659
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:08,270
Don't say that.

660
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:13,070

665
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:34,340
I want to be with you even for just a day.

666
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,380

Didn't I tell you not to forget your phone?

693
01:17:14,424 --> 01:17:18,540
I have a lot of friends now. It's not that dangerous.

694
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:21,600
Listen to the president's words.

695
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,600
The president is even more nosy than you, Hyung.

696
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,990
There are so many spies at school now.

697
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:29,440
I'll get going.

698
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,780

♫ Forever isn't enough to ♫

720
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:10,261
♫ Make all of our memories ♫

721
01:19:12,098 --> 01:19:17,234
At first, I couldn't come to this place because I was afraid.

722
01:19:17,234 --> 01:19:19,884
Half a year later, and...

723
01:19:21,617 --> 01:19:24,237
this place was already cleaned up.

724
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:35,040
The only thing you left behind were the memories.

725
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,190
It caused me pain for a while.

726
01:19:38,117 --> 01:19:39,957
Memories...

727
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:44,123
can't be thrown out if you don't forget.

728
01:19:44,125 --> 01:19:48,764
♫ 'Cause I'm always next to you, yeah ♫

729
01:19:48,764 --> 01:19:50,964
I was tortured the most by that fact.

730
01:19:50,964 --> 01:19:54,975
♫ Just so beautiful to me ♫

731
01:19:54,975 --> 01:19:58,208
♫ Here I am ♫

732
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:03,417
♫ So every time you're down, down ♫

733
01:20:03,417 --> 01:20:06,650
♫ Don't you fear, you're not alone ♫

734
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:10,083
♫ How could I survive without you ♫

735
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:13,875
♫ Forever isn't enough to ♫

736
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:17,380
♫ Make all of our memories ♫

737
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:24,817
♫ I, I'll never let you go ♫

738
01:20:24,817 --> 01:20:30,097
♫ Not letting you be lonely ♫

739
01:20:35,084 --> 01:20:38,194
♫ I need you in my arms ♫

740
01:20:38,194 --> 01:20:41,634
♫ My world, you are my soul ♫

741
01:20:41,634 --> 01:20:46,831
♫ I'm always on your side ♫

742
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:53,364
♫ You are my life, you are my heart ♫

743
01:20:53,364 --> 01:20:59,484
♫ Nothing's gonna change my love for you ♫

744
01:21:06,124 --> 01:21:12,176
And... whenever I look back on those memories, it always comes back to me.

745
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:17,175
♫ How could I ever forget you ♫

746
01:21:18,192 --> 01:21:20,564
That I still miss him.

747
01:21:20,564 --> 01:21:23,559
♫ Just making our story ♫

748
01:21:36,774 --> 01:21:39,454
I dreamed about growing old with you.

749
01:21:40,184 --> 01:21:42,264
It was a very happy dream.

750
01:21:57,774 --> 01:22:01,374
But when I woke up, I realized

751
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:03,574
that this was the dream.

752
01:22:14,892 --> 01:22:17,582
I wish I had the chance to tell you

753
01:22:19,304 --> 01:22:21,084
that I love you.
