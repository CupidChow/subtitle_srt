1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
According to the popular novel, "The Queen doesn't care about morality." Adapted?

2
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,560
Do you know where my son is?

3
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,680
I have no idea.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,519
Did you send someone to look for it?

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,120
No.

6
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,280
My cousin has always been reckless.

7
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,480
Maybe he was abducted.

8
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,360
Impossible.

9
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,480
I picked those soldiers myself.

10
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,760
In this world,

11
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,840
can take my son away from them.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
Are you suspecting me?

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,320
No.

14
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,440
Do you have any clues, Your Highness?

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,760
I only know

16
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,720
my cousin is close to the Lady of the Thousand Houses.

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,479
The fairy of Tangjiang is here.

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Your Highness.

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Tangjiang Fairy.

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,160
I heard that you and Jin Shiquan

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,320
in Yan Academy.

23
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,800
Did you know that he brought troops into the mountain last night?

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,400
What do you mean?

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,480
Did she know that I used Kim Se-quan...

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
to stand up for him?

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,240
I don't know.

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,759
To be honest,

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,200
I see. You want me to pretend to be blind.

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm telling the truth.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,480
You may leave.

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
I feel sorry for Shiquan

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,280
Don't worry, brother.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,160
I'll send someone to look for it too.

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,920
Make my skin wrinkle.

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,320
Make the skin for me.

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,720
Why isn't he awake?

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's go find my treasure.

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,760
Crayon Shin-Chan's Moving Wave.

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,000
It's like this.

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,600
You won't get caught, right?

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,520
You're awake.

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,720
There's a kind of fox that wants a man's heart the most.

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,600
Are you that kind of bitch?

45
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,880
We're still friends.

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,520
You should say something nice.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
That sounds awful.

48
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,680
If you want to hear something nice,

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,600
Of course.

50
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,440
Give me some sweets.

51
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,040
What do you want to hear?

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,280
I want to hear

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,960
what you said when I was in a coma.

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,880
what did you hear?

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,480
I heard it.

56
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,320
you said to get better soon.

57
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,960
And then?

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,040
You said

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,960
you like me.

60
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,560
What about your answer?

61
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,800
I like you too.

62
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,880
What are His Highness and Her Highness talking about?

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,200
Why can't I hear anything?

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,000
Be quiet.

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,240
Nothing.

66
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
It shouldn't be.

67
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,120
Are we too far apart to hear clearly?

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,800
Mo Li.

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,520
Why didn't I know you had so many thoughts before?

70
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,800
I...

71
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,240
I'm just concerned about His Highness and Her Highness.

72
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,680
Myo-shim! Myo-shim!

73
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,480
I'll never eavesdrop on the corners again.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,159
It's so scary.

75
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,640
You said we heard something we shouldn't have.

76
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,440
Will His Highness get even with us

77
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,720
and chop us with a sword?

78
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,760
You proposed this.

79
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
If His Highness wants to chop, he'll only chop you.

80
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,360
Kill you?

81
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,960
That was the confession of Lonely Boat.

82
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,160
How did I pass out in the bath?

83
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,080
Congratulations.

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,200
Why is there another turtle?

85
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,240
I'm a turtle.

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
I'm here to deliver good news.

87
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,400
I didn't hear any good news from you.

88
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,360
We decided to give you a title.

89
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,760
It's quite fashionable.

90
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,760
What title?

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,320
Doctor Ghost.

92
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,680
Speak in human language.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,880
Doctor Ghost!

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,280
Can you say something realistic?

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,480
You can't eat or use this.

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,320
Oh my god.

97
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,000
Haven't you noticed that you've cured

98
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,680
by studying hard?

99
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,600
In the future,

100
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,280
you'll be the best doctor in the world.

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,600
Shouldn't you remind me that I don't have much time left?

102
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,480
It's good to stay here, right?

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,040
Everything here is real.

104
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,920
Real doesn't mean real.

105
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,640
I have a turtle here.

106
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,480
Take it and make soup for His Highness.

107
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,720
You win.

108
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
Qinghui Flower is really useful.

109
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,080
His Highness has been detoxified.

110
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,720
Great. We don't need to see the Ghost Doctor anymore.

111
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Ghost doctor?

112
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,600
Yes, we've been looking for the Ghost Doctor for a long time.

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,240
but we couldn't find him.

114
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,480
That's right.

115
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,440
That bastard gave me the Ghost Doctor Title.

116
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,080
Brother.

117
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,320
Changping.

118
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,480
I saw a lot of strange people

119
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,200
in Prince Qin’s Mansion.

120
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,280
And they're all powerful.

121
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,960
I can't follow them.

122
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,840
They're all General Jin's men.

123
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,159
You mean for Jin Shi Quan?

124
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,600
his target is more like Prince Qin and Princess Changping.

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,120
I always find it strange.

126
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
Kim Se-quan is not an idiot.

127
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,160
No matter how much he likes Tangjiang Fairy,

128
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,880
he

129
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,200
he wouldn't be so stupid

130
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,400
to kill me on the New Moon Festival.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,360
You mean someone is behind him?

132
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,360
An'an.

133
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,480
Pour Mr. Su a cup of good tea.

134
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,200
After you drink this tea,

135
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,880
after drinking this tea.

136
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,560
Why are you kicking me out?

137
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,760
I have important news to tell you.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,360
Please get to the point.

139
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,840
The Marquis found an iron mine

140
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,960
on his mountain.

141
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,400
and didn't tell anyone about it.

142
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,920
Iron mine?

143
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,040
The iron mine of our dynasty is prohibited from private purchase.

144
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,080
If you find it, report it to the court immediately.

145
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,440
or your whole family will be executed.

146
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,640
Exactly.

147
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
That's why I'm here to sue you.

148
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,520
Why did the Marquis take such a great risk

149
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,000
to hide the iron mine?

150
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,960
high risks always bring high profits.

151
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,280
You mean...

152
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,000
Come on.

153
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,240
Marquis of Wanhu has been in touch with the Crown Prince.

154
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,760
He wants to make a deal with the Crown Prince.

155
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,600
What do you want to do?

156
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,360
I'll prepare a big gift for them.

157
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,920
Mo Li, give me some ink and ink.

158
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,000
Coming.

159
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,880
The next plan

160
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,720
the specific strategy

161
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,720
to control the iron mine.

162
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,520
and how to use the iron mine resources

163
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,480
to create public opinion in the court

164
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,200
and weaken every detail of the Crown Prince's power.

165
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,120

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,320
