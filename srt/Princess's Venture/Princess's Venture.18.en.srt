1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
According to the popular novel, "The Queen doesn't have moral ethics." Adapted.

2
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,200
Tang Jiusong is back.

3
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,519
Have you ever thought about

4
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,120
With his temper, he'll surely be able to come back.

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
if he dares to come,

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,160
he must be fully prepared.

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,400
I could kill him once.

8
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,080
Now I can kill him twice.

9
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,280
Moreover, I'm in charge of Yan now.

10
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Coming.

11
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,120
Hill Leader knows I'm coming.

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,800
Are you here to return Little Box to me?

13
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,560
Forget it. Since you took it,

14
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,280
you're capable.

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,640
Tell me, what's the matter?

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,759
I want to know if the man in your portrait

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,920
is my father, Tang Jiusong.

18
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,240
Stop talking nonsense.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,000
This is Su Ling'er's notebook.

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,520
It records everything.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,479
There's nothing inside,

22
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,560
but now,

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,880
we can only trick him.

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Since you know,

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,960
why did you come to me?

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,600
I want to know how my parents died.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
The way of governing the world

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,840
should prioritize the word "authority".

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,360
If the country is not powerful,

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,840
how can we convince the people?

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,560
The way of governing the world

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,520
can't expand all strategies.

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,840
It can't last long by scheming.

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
The Song of Tang.

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,720
If he can be used by me,

36
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,160
the world will be in chaos.

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,200
Go and find out his background.

38
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,320
I've heard a lot about you.

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,880
I know you are talented.

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,480
Would you lend me a hand?

41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,080
I'll help you ascend the throne.

42
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,760
Why do you want to kill innocent people?

43
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,920
The real way of an emperor

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,400
It's not about conspiracy,

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,680
It's not a lonely place.

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,000
but the people.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
and recruit talents

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,760
and conspire with the world.

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,280
I have no choice.

50
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,760
Water can carry a boat

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,200
and overturn the boat.

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
Take care.

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,440
Come on, Nine Songs.

54
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,440
I can help him ascend the throne

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,079
and pull him down.

56
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,640
Nine songs.

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,760
Nine songs.

58
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,040
I don't want to hurt you.

59
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,360
But as long as you are here,

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,840
the world will only know your songs.

61
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,120
but not me.

62
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,200
You're all here.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Erasing everything can bury the past.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
But some things

65
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,720
are like sprouts buried under snow.

66
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,159
will come out eventually.

67
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,840
Why are you so obsessed with what happened years ago?

68
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,640
Isn't this good?

69
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,840
You are

70
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
the King of Qin.

71
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,280
may inherit the throne in the future.

72
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,720
You’re Princess Qin now.

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,760
You may become a motherly model in the future.

74
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,600
For the so-called secret,

75
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,720
for the so-called secret?

76
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm here to reveal the secret.

77
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,840
How much do you know about your father?

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,120
He's handsome and intelligent.

79
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,320
There's only one weakness.

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,280
is that you trust others too easily.

81
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,159
How did you come to this conclusion?

82
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,360
It's simple.

83
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,600
I'm so good-looking.

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,080
my father won't be ugly.

85
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,200
I'm so smart.

86
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,800
my father is not stupid.

87
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,880
If he didn't trust others too easily,

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,120
he wouldn't have

89
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,960
to see his wife and daughter?

90
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,640
Your deduction is basically correct.

91
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
Come to think of it,

92
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,720
I have no real grudge against your father.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,600
On the contrary, I admire him very much.

94
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,000
Ridiculous. I've always been self-righteous.

95
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,360
I can take his lead.

96
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,400
He's the real Mo's Ruyu.

97
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,440
Young Master is unparalleled.

98
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,720
Hill Leader,

99
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,920
Do you have a crush on my father?

100
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,680
Shut up!

101
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,640
There's no such perfect person in this world.

102
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,520
Except me.

103
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,640
The Song of Tang.

104
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,000
was the youngest warrior 20 years ago.

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,480
He was also the smartest man

106
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,960
No, the smartest person in the world.

107
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,440
Back then,

108
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,560
I conspired with Emperor Chengming to kill Tang Jiusong.

109
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,560
Emperor Chengming was worried about Jiusong.

110
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,960
So he wanted to use you

111
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,240
by using you as bait.

112
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,440
I’ve finished my words.

113
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,200
Please leave.

114
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,840
Your father killed my father.

115
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,160
I want to avenge my father.

116
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,680
It shouldn't be like this.

117
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Could it be?

118
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,040
You can't be blamed for what your father did.

119
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,920
That's not right.

120
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,360
No.

121
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,360
Why am I struggling with this?

122
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,200
Am I really affected

123
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,320
by this world?

124
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,000
No, we haven't figured it out yet.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,400
I should take the initiative

126
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,840
and get more clues.

127
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,360
I have a clue.

128
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Mother, I went to see Cheng Lixue.

129
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,760
He told me about the Song of Tang.

130
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,400
Tang Jiusong saved my life.

131
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,200
When His Majesty was trapped at Zhaoyang Peak,

132
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
His life was at stake.

133
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,080
I begged Jiusong to save him.

134
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,120
Unexpectedly, I saved a wolf.

135
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,720
So,

136
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,320
Father really killed Tang Jiusong?

137
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,800
His Majesty killed your father.

138
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,040
So,

139
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,920
Are you trying to define yourself

140
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,280
the son of someone's father's enemy?

141
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,760
I

142
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,720
For a determined reality,

143
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,640
you can choose to sink

144
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,640
or struggle.

145
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,840
or

146
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
you can choose to rewrite your destiny.

147
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,200
As long as you want,

148
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,760
you'll always have a way to go.

149
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
The most difficult thing in the world

150
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,760
is love and power.

151
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,840
It's just that the empire and beauty

152
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,640
between the empire and beauty.

153
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,440
If it were you,

154
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,680
what would you choose?

155
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,400
The empire is important,

156
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,960
but if you don't have someone you love,

157
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,600
the country

158
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,520
is just an empty shell.

159
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
I know you love Princess Qin deeply.

160
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,200
But as a prince,

161
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,520
shoulder the country,

162
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,600
and the people.

163
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,160
Don't let the entangled love

164
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,160
disrupt your ambition.

165
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
In your hands,

166
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,040
in your hands.

167
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,320
What ambitions?

168
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
Are you blaming me?

169
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,760
I dare not.

170
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,720
The empress's family is flourishing.

171
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
Its power is like an ancient tree.

172
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,080
and deep into every corner of the court and the people.

173
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,600
in every corner of the court and the people.

174
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,160
It's hard to touch.

175
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,360
Although I'm ranked 95,

176
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
I have many helplessness and constraints.

177
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,480
One of the moves

178
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,960
I'm afraid it will affect the whole situation.

179
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,600
So I knew she poisoned you and Changping.

180
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,600
I can't act rashly.

181
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,440
Then why did Father say these today?

182
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,680
I can make you the Crown Prince.

183
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,160
But you have to make the right choice.

184
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,960
Bring Princess Qin to me.

185
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,040
You can choose to sink

186
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
you can choose to sink

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,760
or

188
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
you can choose to rewrite your destiny.

189
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,160
