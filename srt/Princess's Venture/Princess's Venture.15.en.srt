1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
According to the popular novel, "Her Highness is not moral." Adapted?

2
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,560
May you have a happy life.

3
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,320
and longevity.

4
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,440
Yes, madam.

5
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,360
Are you celebrating your 50th birthday

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,320
or 60?

7
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,960
It's just an ordinary birthday.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,320
Happy birthday to you.

9
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,000
Xiaoxian.

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,039
So beautiful.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,680
Here comes the Crown Prince.

12
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,360
Your Highness, you're here.

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,360
This is...

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,160
My guard.

15
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,720
Nice to meet you.

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,759
The mansion is really lively today.

17
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,200
Exactly.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,039
What brings you here, Your Highness?

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,640
I've asked the servants to give you the gift.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,039
I'm so happy

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,160
my face has become brighter.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,880
How can I ask for a gift?

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,759
That's right.

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Your Highness.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
This outfit suits you very well.

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,280
What a beautiful couple.

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Yes, they are a perfect match.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,039
Your Highness.

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,000
How can you steal my thunder?

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,240
Daughter, I'm very happy

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,040
to have you here today.

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,960
You didn't expect it, did you?

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
I'm fine.

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,400
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,200
You are my daughter.

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,600
I want you to be safe.

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,960
As your daughter,

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,400
I also hope

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
can cherish the rest of her time.

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,040
After all,

41
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,400
not everyone can predict their ending.

42
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,400
What do you mean?

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,520
Seventh Brother looks safe.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,680
What do you mean?

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,320
A few days ago, on the New Moon Festival,

46
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,600
Seventh Brother suddenly disappeared.

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,000
I thought something happened to him.

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,560
Now it seems

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,120
someone else is in danger.

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,040
Really?

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,560
Your Highness, I'm tired from standing.

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,480
Let's go in and rest.

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,200
Your Highness, please.

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,120
This way.

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Watch the steps.

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,160
The guards are in the inner courtyard.

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,920
Why are you here?

58
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,360
I'm here to watch the show.

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,640
With the princess here,

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,720
it will be lively.

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,880
Here, Your Highness.

62
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,800
Since today is your birthday banquet,

63
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,040
I've prepared a sword dance performance for you.

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

65
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,920
Let's see.

66
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,360
Is this a Copy Hongmen feast?

67
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,680
Go get Mo Li in the yard.

68
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,520
You can't expose the fact that my poison has been detoxified yet.

69
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
The sword pointed at my lord.

70
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,680
Why?

71
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,960
Both of you are good.

72
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,360
Let's eat first

73
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Let's eat first.

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,880
Your Highness, please.

75
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,080
Why are you so careless?

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,720
Take Princess Qin to change.

77
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,600
Go.

78
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,040
Please.

79
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,040
Why are you still playing this?

80
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,000
Why is it blank?

81
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,520
Bitch!

82
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
You bitch!

83
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,720
Bitch!

84
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,760
Bitch!

85
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,200
Bitch!

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,360
How can I see such a scene?

87
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,080
Bitch!

88
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,680
You bitch!

89
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,440
Bitch!

90
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,800
Bitch!

91
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,600
How could it be so chaotic?

92
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,280
Prince Qin is really good.

93
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,200
Fortunately, I’m not your enemy.

94
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,480
But why do I feel like there's no audience here?

95
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,360
Don't worry.

96
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,520
She'll be here soon.

97
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,400
Your Majesty.

98
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,680
What happened?

99
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,720
When people drink alcohol smell the fragrance,

100
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,320
will have hallucinations.

101
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,320
and hallucinations.

102
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,960
Your Majesty.

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,960
Your Majesty.

104
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:39,880
Mother.

105
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,400
Prince Qin and Princess Qin

106
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,920
and Mr. Su seem fine.

107
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,040
That's because we didn't drink.

108
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,920
Why not?

109
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,600
Does anyone of you know about this?

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,960
I'm innocent.

111
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,360
I didn't have time to drink.

112
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
before I had time to drink it.

113
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,040
Everyone can testify.

114
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,720
According to the family rules,

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,080
you must faste on the fifth day of every lunar month.

116
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,240
No drinking.

117
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
What about Prince Qin?

118
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,680
I’m poisoned.

119
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,760
The imperial physician said you can't drink.

120
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,400
Wine and fragrance are all owned by the Marquis of Wanhu.

121
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,400
We didn't find any clues.

122
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,720
Very good.

123
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,920
