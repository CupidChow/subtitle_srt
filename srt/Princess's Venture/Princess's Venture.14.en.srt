1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
According to the popular novel, "The Queen doesn't care about morality." Adapted?

2
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,480
There's news about him.

3
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,160
Who is His Majesty talking about?

4
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,640
In that situation,

5
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,520
he had a small chance to live.

6
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,039
But he still has a chance to live.

7
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,360
You worry too much, Your Majesty.

8
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,920
Even if he was in the extreme situation,

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,960
with his ability,

10
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,920
he can give himself a chance to survive.

11
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,120
That's why His Majesty

12
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,200
to spread the name of the most talented woman in the world.

13
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,440
to lure that person out.

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,280
You know how deep

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,960
how deep his relationship with Ling'er was.

16
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,720
I'm sorry, Ling'er.

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,400
Why do you have to kill her daughter?

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,680
The throne

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,880
looks glamorous,

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,520
but it's actually very dangerous.

21
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,720
As long as that person is alive,

22
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,760
is still a threat to me.

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,360
May your wish come true.

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,320
Among my sons,

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,520
among my sons?

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
I don't care about the court anymore.

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Now in the capital,

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,880
only the Crown Prince and Prince Qin are left.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,760
Tell me.

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,040
who will win in the end?

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
The final winner

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,800
will be His Majesty.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,079
It's such a good opportunity.

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,440
It’s a good chance.

35
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,160
It's such a good chance.

36
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,320
because Tang Miaomxin missed it again?

37
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,040
Xiaoxian, don’t cry.

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,360
Did you forget what the fortune teller said?

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,640
He said you're the legitimate daughter of the Thousand Houses.

40
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,440
You're destined to be a motherly model.

41
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,080
Look at you.

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,120
So what?

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,040
In your heart,

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,080
than Jiang Hutong.

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,160
Fine, I promise you.

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
I'll take care of Tang Miaomxin for you.

47
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,520
My Lord.

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,000
What are you doing?

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
What are you doing?

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,280
My Lord.

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,280
Are you just going to watch

52
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,320
that Xiaoxin

53
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,600
bullied Xiaoxian.

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,800
What can I do?

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,640
She’s Princess Qin now.

56
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,480
My Lord, you just need to do me a favor.

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,680
Are you trying to kill someone?

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,600
How dare I?

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,600
After all, she’s Princess Qin.

60
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,520
I just want you to persuade her.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,680
My Lord.

62
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,520
Please wait here.

63
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
Little butler, let me ask you.

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,160
Prince Qin...

65
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,640
Just say what you want to say.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,960
Don’t beat around the bush.

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,760
I heard Prince Qin went missing on the New Moon Festival.

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,120
Don’t misunderstand.

69
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,320
Prince Qin is the prince of Yan.

70
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,399
and my son-in-law.

71
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,880
You should pay more attention to yourself.

72
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,280
What is this?

73
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,280
How dare you give me a hard time?

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,200
What are you talking about?

75
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,640
This is Prince Qin’s Mansion.

76
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,920
If you say something wrong,

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,800
I can't save you.

78
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,000
What are you talking about?

79
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,840
Myo-shim, I...

80
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,320
I know you have resentment.

81
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,480
But blood is thicker than water.

82
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,440
I'm here today

83
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,040
to solve the problem in your heart.

84
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,000
so that our family can get along with each other.

85
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,760
Don't you think it's too late?

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,520
Is it too late?

87
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,000
I treat you and Jiang Xian equally.

88
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,200
and loved you very much.

89
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,000
I was careless,

90
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
I didn’t mean it.

91
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,920
You are Princess Qin now.

92
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
If Jiang Xian becomes the Crown Princess,

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,640
wouldn't our family be more advanced?

94
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,160
I can't decide who the Crown Prince wants to marry.

95
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,440
There are osmanthus in it.

96
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,280
Tomorrow is your mother’s birthday.

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,160
remember to bring Prince Qin with you.

98
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,760
Let’s have a good chat.

99
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,280
Your mother won't harm you.

100
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,280
It seems that the Marquis doesn't know I'm allergic to osmanthus flowers.

101
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Why don't I use this as an excuse?

102
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,200
So you're here to make peace?

103
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Of course.

104
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,240
Let's talk about something sincere.

105
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
What do you want?

106
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,080
For example, who is my mother?

107
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,440
Your mother?

108
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,720
Isn't your mother my wife?

109
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,240
My Lord, you really take me as a fool.

110
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,760
No mother would be cold and cruel

111
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,400
cold and cruel to their children.

112
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,800
Don't try to fool me with the Monstrous Lonely Star.

113
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,680
Tell me your secret.

114
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,800
Otherwise,

115
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,080
it would be more embarrassing to be exposed in public.

116
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,760
I was totally crazy just now.

117
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,560
I'll scare you to pee.

118
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,240
What are you talking about?

119
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,840
Something is wrong with the cake.

120
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,560
Could it be...

121
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,840
This medicine looks bitter.

122
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,240
Can you not drink it?

123
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,640
Okay.

124
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,680
How about I make you a bitter one?

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,720
How is it?

126
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,720
It's not sweet at all.

127
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,320
Like this

128
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,880
Now,

129
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,720
he's not only a tsundere man,

130
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,360
but also a pervert.

131
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
I still don't smell anything.

132
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,800
Should we kiss longer?

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,480
It might be sweeter.

134
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,920
Take the medicine.

135
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,640
Just one sip.

136
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,760
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

137
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,080
I'll go with you tomorrow.

138
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,280
The Crown Prince will be there tomorrow.

139
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,160
Is it inappropriate for you to show up?

140
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,760
I tolerated it again and again.

141
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,280
Her Majesty still wants to kill everyone.

142
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,120
Why don't you take the initiative?

143
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,560
and I'll take care of it.

144
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,560
you can rest assured

145
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,080
in Wanhu Mansion.

146
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,160
You even know that?

147
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm the Chief of Tingyu Pavilion.

148
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,919
You are the master of Tingyu Pavilion?

149
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,559
Then why did you charge me 100,000 taels of silver?

150
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,080
Mine is yours.

151
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,720
Did you learn

152
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,640
behind my back?

153
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,560
Why are you so talkative?

154
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,480
What are all the love words?

155
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
Being sincere is the ultimate move.

156
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,880
What do you think?

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,480
Not good.

158
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,680
No.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,880
You can't make such an exaggerated expression today.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,800
It's easy to take off makeup.

161
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,600
Did you take off your makeup?

162
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,880
It's beautiful.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,640
It's just going to the Thousand Houses' Mansion.

164
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,280
Do you have to dress like this?

165
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,440
Your Highness.

166
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,800
She's going.

167
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,840
Energy.

168
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,240
