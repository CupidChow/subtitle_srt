1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
According to the popular novel, "Her Highness is not moral." Adapted?

2
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,680
His Majesty confined Ninggu Zhou.

3
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,920
Are you sure?

4
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,040
Yes.

5
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
We finally got this chance.

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,920
Control Concubine Yu and Ning Changping now.

7
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:19,960
An'an.

8
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,960
Have you seen His Highness?

9
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,680
He was summoned to the palace early in the morning.

10
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,720
It seems that something urgent happened.

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,520
Sister-in-law.

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,720
I found a big secret.

13
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,160
What secret?

14
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,160
I saw an auntie

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,320
I saw an aunt.

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,720
She looks like you.

17
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:38,680
Changping.

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,960
Can you see her face?

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,000
She's still calling your name.

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,640
She knows my name.

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,000
and looks like me.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,400
Could it be Su Ling'er?

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,720
Hutong.

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,680
I have something to tell you.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,039
The Crown Prince often came to my father.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,600
My father claimed to be ill and disappeared.

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,440
My father received a letter from Her Majesty

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,560
and started to see the Crown Prince.

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,320
and started to win over the officials.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,160
His Majesty hates the officials to form cliques for personal gains.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,600
How dare your father commit a crime?

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,320
My father is a cunning old fox.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,680
He never takes sides easily.

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,600
So,

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,960
the Prime Minister's action

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,920
can only prove one thing.

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,760
The Empress is going to rebel.

38
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,600
and she's confident to win.

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,880
Princess Consort.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,440
You have to come with me.

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,240
Now...

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,640
What happened?

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
I just got the news.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,040
Prince Qin is under house arrest.

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,400
What?

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,280
Only the World's Best City can protect you now.

47
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,720
No one can take my sister-in-law away.

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,720
I won't hurt you.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,400
Thank you for your kindness.

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,840
But I can't go with you now.

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,160
You're still waiting for the Lonely Boat?

52
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,200
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,160
Is it more important than your life?

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,360
I just trust my instinct more.

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,560
Rise.

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
Thank you, Father.

57
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,520
I've sent someone to send Concubine Yu back.

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
Don't worry.

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,280
Okay. Prepare the sedan.

60
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,680
I want to leave the palace.

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,560
Let's go.

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,200
See you, Father.

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,480
Something is wrong.

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,200
Your Highness.

66
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,560
I wonder why Your Majesty

67
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,800
to visit Prince Qin today?

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,200
I’m here to see Prince Qin.

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,600
Too bad.

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,720
Prince Qin was summoned to the palace by His Majesty.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,080
If you have something important,

72
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,200
I can tell him.

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,160
It's okay.

74
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,440
We just want to have a look.

75
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,920
But since you're here,

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,160
I do have one thing.

77
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,600
Go ahead.

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,240
I know Prince Qin and Princess Qin love each other very much.

79
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,200
So I want to invite Princess Qin to the Crown Prince’s Mansion.

80
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,520
Let’s wait until Prince Qin comes back.

81
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,800
It seems Princess Qin still doesn’t see the situation.

82
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
Don’t worry.

83
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
Because soon,

84
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,920
Prince Qin will come to reunite with your family.

85
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,159
It seems

86
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,159
there's a backup plan.

87
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,440
I'll play along

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,640
and go with them.

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,200
Your Highness.

90
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,760
Let's go.

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

92
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,120
Your Highness.

93
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,320
Concubine Yu.

94
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,960
Come with me.

95
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,080
Her Majesty asked you to come?

96
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,040
Cut the crap. I have Ning Changping.

97
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,880
Amitabha.

98
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,160
Give me some time.

99
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,200
I will never forget your kindness.

100
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,159
I wish to come to the next world

101
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:38,159
we can achieve true freedom and peace.

102
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's go.

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,400
Concubine Yu, what are you doing?

104
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,800
His Majesty ordered

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,080
not to leave the palace without permission.

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,840
Just see him if you want.

107
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,920
Why are you hiding?

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,800
That's how your mother looked at me.

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,720
It seems that you are my father.

110
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,640
How did you know I was coming?

111
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,200
Only you, the smartest person in the world,

112
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,360
is you, the smartest person in the world,

113
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,400
except you.

114
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,240
Cheng Lixue told you everything.

115
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,200
Almost.

116
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,320
I don't blame him for what happened back then.

117
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,159
After all, someone as good as me

118
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,159
will be jealous.

119
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,880
Cheng Lixue didn't say you are so narcissistic.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
Surround here.

121
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
In that case,

122
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,560
let's watch a big show tonight.

123
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
Aren't you afraid?

124
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,440
What's there to be afraid of?

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,360
A dozen years ago,

126
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,600
Emperor Chengming was defeated by me.

127
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,920
You almost got burned.

128
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,480
Emperor Chengming threatened me with Ling'er and Concubine Yu.

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,000
My mother-in-law is in it.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,440
I saved

131
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,960
who sold herself to bury her father 20 years ago.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,720
From now on, we'll call each other siblings.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,360
If it weren't for Ninggu Zhou, he would be Concubine Yu's son.

134
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,000
I wouldn't have let you marry him.

135
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,040
Mother.

136
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,880
Mother, you...

137
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,000
Mother, wake up.

138
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,520
Zhou.

139
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,800
Don't cry.

140
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,240
From now on,

141
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,480
do whatever you want

142
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,160
just do it.

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,760
Mother.

144
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,440
Mother.

145
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,360
I'm incompetent.

146
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,040
I failed to protect you.

147
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,400
I will avenge you.

148
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,960
Your character hasn't logged in for a long time.

149
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
[I'm connecting you again.]

150
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,720
Please continue your mission to ascend the throne.

151
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,039
Mission accomplished.

152
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,039
You will return to the real world.

153
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,920
I have a choice.

154
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,680
to ascend the throne.

155
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,560
is not the only way.

156
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,640
Stop!

157
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm the Crown Prince.

158
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,800
The future emperor.

159
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,360
If you dare touch me,

160
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,560
you will be sentenced to treason.

161
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,960
Do you think I care about these crimes?

162
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,680
It's fine. Brother Changping is here.

163
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,760
As a subject,

164
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,040
How dare you kill His Majesty?

165
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,400
It seems General Jin knew

166
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,600
his son was killed by the Crown Prince.

167
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,640
Otherwise, how could he

168
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,280
watch me kill the Crown Prince?

169
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,280
Prince Qin is indeed Prince Qin.

170
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,680
