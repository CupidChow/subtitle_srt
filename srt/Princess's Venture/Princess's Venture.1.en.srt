1
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,520
According to the popular novel, "The Queen is not virtuous." Adapted

2
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,760
This experience is really good.

3
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,320
Look at his face and flexibility.

4
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,160
Lady Ruan, why are there men in your room?

5
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,280
Even if you grew up in the manor,

6
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,840
you're still the legitimate daughter of the marquis manor.

7
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,920
You colluded with a man before getting married.

8
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,640
and did such a dramatic thing.

9
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
and disgraced the marquis manor.

10
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
You're already framing me?

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,360
Lady Ruan has degraded herself.

13
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,560
I can't let you go astray.

14
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,479
Kill that man!

15
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,600
What are you doing?

16
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,880
Whoever offends me will die.

17
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,520
Even fighting is so cool.

18
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,720
A man among men.

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
How dare you set me up?

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,000
This isn't right.

21
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
Special characters detected.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,200
[will give you ten minutes of unbeatable hang time.]

23
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,320
I didn't expect that I would become a martial arts master one day.

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,480
Interesting.

25
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,840
Why is your handsome face getting darker?

26
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,920
Should I say something?

27
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,880
I didn't mean to bite you last night.

28
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,680
Hug you.

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,640
Touch yours.

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,440
How dare you seduce me?

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
I'll make it up to you.

32
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
How about you say a number?

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,280
Oh, my. I'm so happy.

34
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,560
You think I'm a model?

35
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,600
Pretend to be crazy.

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Sir,

37
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,079
Can we pay the bill first?

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,600
Don't move.

39
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,000
The poison is the most poisonous poison in the world.

40
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,600
Those who are poisoned

41
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,520
will suffer the pain of bone corroding.

42
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,880
I lost my mind.

43
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,640
You're just leaving?

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,240
The system should be on a mission.

45
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,600
Speak in human language.

46
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,839
I think we need to do some specific movements

47
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,120
to translate into human language.

48
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,680
What's the movement?

49
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,800
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,240
Your damn system should have been destroyed long ago.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,960
Hey, girl.

52
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,120
The world is so beautiful

53
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,760
but you're so grumpy.

54
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,720
This is not good.

55
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,680
Here.

56
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,080
Why is it different from the environment I read in advance?

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Did you get the instance zones wrong?

58
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,320
I've customized a sweet instance zones.

59
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,520
I want to quit the game.

60
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,640
Sorry, sister.

61
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,920
You can't get out.

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,560
What does that mean?

63
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,520
I think I heard a special character.

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,400
You mean I

65
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,080
a member of this world?

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,400
Your Highness.

67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,880
I failed my duty last night.

68
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,160
I failed to stop you.

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,240
If anything happens to you,

70
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,600
if anything happens to you?

71
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
Go and receive your punishment later.

72
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,160
Yes, Your Highness.

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,760
What's the progress

74
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,800
How is it going?

75
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,240
Last night, the eldest daughter of the Marquis

76
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,320
went into the Crown Prince's villa.

77
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
She hasn't come out yet.

78
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,000
That evil woman.

79
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,200
Your Highness.

80
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,800
Your Highness, do you need me to spread the news?

81
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,840
Go and check

82
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,600
Young Lady Yu Zhu in the manor of the Thousand Houses.

83
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,920
Your Highness, did the poison attack again?

84
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,800
His poison is getting worse.

85
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,159
Only the Ghost Doctor can cure him.

86
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,920
But...

87
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,280
But we searched for a long time

88
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
but we couldn't find the Ghost Doctor.

89
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,120
Keep looking.

90
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,080
Prince Qin, Marquis of Wanhu, Empress and Emperor Chengming. Cheng Lixue.

91
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,640
What’s my relationship with this mysterious man?

92
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,160
Please reveal everyone's secret

93
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,840
before the rose petals fall.

94
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,840
Otherwise, you will stay here forever.

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Your unbeatable hang time is over.

96
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,840
Here are three basic skills for you.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,720
You can choose one from three.

98
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,560
Rejuvenating Magic.

99
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,200
No need.

100
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,760
Entering Skill

101
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,880
I'm pretty. I'm pretty.

102
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,600
acupuncture skill.

103
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,280
This is it.

104
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,320
I hope you can be yourself in this world.

105
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,840
Time is running out.

106
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,000
What do you mean?

107
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,640
How dare you!

108
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,560
How dare you commit such a crime in the mansion?

109
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,480
Then report it to the government.

110
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,000
You must be Lady Ruan.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,240
Why are you so rude?

112
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,000
Come and greet Madam.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,440
Where am I from?

114
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,400
Of course I'm the second daughter of the Marquis of Wanhu.

115
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,280
Lady Ruan of the Thousand Houses?

116
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,480
live in such a place?

117
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,560
How can a mother dislike her daughter so much?

118
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
There's something fishy about her.

119
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,320
The fortune teller said

120
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,000
that you're the Monstrous Lonely Star.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,400
You can't live with your parents before 20.

122
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,720
Otherwise, how could I

123
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,480
put you in the manor?

124
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
Let me have a look.

125
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,159
What do you mean?

126
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you here to take me home today?

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,440
Her Ladyship arranged you to marry Prince Qin.

128
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,560
Just stay in Zhuangzi and wait for your wedding.

129
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,480
Prince Qin.

130
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,240
Nice to meet you, Prince Qin.

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,200
You don’t know what kind of person he is.

132
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,680
It’s best if you can figure it out.

133
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
In this world,

134
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,200
she has to rely on the strong to survive.

135
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,040
Prince Qin is powerful.

136
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,880
If you marry him, you’ll be a respectable Princess Qin.

137
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,440
Honey.

138
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
My lady.

139
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,600
You're not the eldest daughter of the Marquis.

140
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Who do you think you are?

141
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,720
I'm also the legitimate daughter of the Thousand Houses.

142
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,280
Your Highness, please take me in.

143
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,840
I hate people who are frozen in the Li Dynasty.

144
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,760
A pheasant is a pheasant.

145
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,080
I can't fly up to the branches and become a phoenix.

146
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,919
Your Highness, I'm your man now.

147
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,800
You don't want to be your enemy, do you?

148
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,920
Fine. You look pretty.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,640
Come on.

150
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,240
No.

151
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,560
Your Highness, no!

152
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,560
You're not complete.

153
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
