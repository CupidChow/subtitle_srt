1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
According to the popular novel, "The Queen is not moral." Adapted.

2
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,560
You really set me up.

3
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
What should I do now?

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,080
I'll give you a choice.

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Break off with the Marquis of Wanhu.

6
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,480
No, no, no.

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,720
Take her away and apologize to your father.

8
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,600
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,760
Your Majesty.

10
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,160
Your Majesty.

11
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,560
Our plan will be moved up.

12
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,080
Do you still have any doubts?

13
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,920
I haven't found my son Shiquan yet.

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,360
I've sent more men to look for him.

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,880
I suspect someone is lying.

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
What do you want?

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,520
Leave Tangjiang Fairy to me.

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
My Lord, do something!

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,080
Do something!

20
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,000
What can I do?

21
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,840
How dare you come here?

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,160
My Lord, let's talk.

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,720
I'm dying.

24
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,440
What's there to talk about?

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,560
Well, let's have a good chat.

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,640
I have nothing to talk to you.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,280
Madam,

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,960
I don't think we have any deep grudges.

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,880
Why do you try to kill me again and again?

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,240
My daughter Fairy is already the crown prince's concubine.

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,320
She will come to save us soon.

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,840
Xiaotang just told His Majesty

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,200
you've done all the bad things in the Marquis's Mansion.

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,280
and committed a heinous crime.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,960
She was willing to kill her family with righteousness

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,480
and cut ties with the Wanhu Marquis.

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
What did you say?

38
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Thanks to your daughter,

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
She was grounded.

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,160
but now he's executed.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,520
Impossible.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,000
You lied to me.

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
She won't do this to us.

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,720
She won't do this to me.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,280
So, madam,

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm the only one who can save you now.

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,600
If you tell me everything you know,

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,920
I can get you out.

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,000
Why should I trust you?

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,920
Then you can tell me half of the news.

51
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,840
When I get you out,

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,000
tell me the other half.

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,920
What do you want to know?

54
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,280
Su Ling'er.

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,760
I don't know her.

56
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,400
Your Ladyship, you don't cry until you see the coffin.

57
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,640
Do you think you can live after you die?

58
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,320
Su Ling'er, you bitch!

59
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,120
Why are you still haunting me for so many years?

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,880
Su Ling'er is dead.

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,560
That bitch.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
married into our mansion

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
she married into our family.

64
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,720
She took away all my love as soon as she entered the marquis manor.

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,720
Shut up!

66
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,640
Stop talking nonsense.

67
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm your father.

68
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,680
Save your words to coax the ghost.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,120
After giving birth to Jiang Xian,

70
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,880
I secretly drugged you.

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,120
How could you have a baby with another woman?

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,040
You evil woman!

73
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,560
I'll strangle you to death.

74
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,760
I don't understand.

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,880
Since you love Su Ling'er so much,

76
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
why did you indulge me to harm her?

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,840
Shut up!

78
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,640
Fine, I got it.

79
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,920
Because you can't get her,

80
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
because you can't get her.

81
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,000
and let me be your executioner?

82
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,480
Nonsense!

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,040
So, Marquis of Wanhu is really not my biological father.

84
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,880
How did Su Ling'er die?

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,280
She bled and died when she gave birth.

86
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,800
It's karma.

87
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,160
Where is the body buried?

88
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
I asked someone to throw it to the mountain to feed the wolves.

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,720
His Lordship agreed to it.

90
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,640
Shut up!

91
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,720
I don't understand

92
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,320
why all men love Su Ling'er.

93
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,120
Except His Lordship,

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,640
Cheng Lixue from Yan Academy,

95
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,080
and that invincible man.

96
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,280
and the current...

97
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
I don't want her to hurt your mother again.

98
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,600
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

99
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,720
Li has always been jealous

100
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,280
and can't tolerate others.

101
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,400
Ling'er and I love each other very much.

102
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,360
You are my daughter.

103
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,840
Do you think I left you in the village

104
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,040
and leave you alone?

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,080
I actually visited you many times.

106
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
I know it's unfair to you.

107
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,640
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,840
I just hope that after I die,

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,200
after I die

110
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,120
to collect my body.

111
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,600
His Lordship

112
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,720
is really good.

113
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,200
Unfortunately, I don't believe a word.

114
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,480
Something is wrong.

115
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,600
The Marquis of Wanhu is a third-rate aristocrat.

116
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,360
He should have some money.

117
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,960
It's a secret that he can't tell even if he kills his wife.

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,280
Except for him.

119
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Don't.

120
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,960
Don't come over.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,800
Why?

122
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,120
Let's sleep in separate rooms.

123
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,840
What are you up to?

124
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,240
I thought about it.

125
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,800
I think our father

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,600
is probably the same person.

127
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,920
Your mother is the saintess of the World's Best City.

128
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,800
Whoever marries her

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
will get the help of the World's Best City.

130
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,040
If Father has feelings for your mother,

131
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,040
she would never

132
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,720
let her wander into the Thousand Houses Mansion.

133
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,280
And she won't let you wander outside.

134
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,159
Your Highness, I have a question.

135
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,360
about something.

136
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,800
What is it?

137
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,400
You went to see Hill Leader Cheng

138
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,000
to get the answer?

139
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,360
Have you heard of a name named Tangjiu?

140
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,640
No.

141
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
In my mother's palace,

142
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,360
I saw the memorial tablet of him and your mother.

143
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,960
That must be an important person.

144
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,640
I've been exploring Tingyu Pavilion for decades.

145
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,400
but I found nothing.

146
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,080
To erase a person's trace,

147
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,040
Except His Majesty,

148
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,920
except His Majesty.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,440
You mean

150
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,240
let us persuade Cheng Lixue?

151
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,360
Ling'er loves me.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,960
and loves me.

153
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,720
Otherwise, she wouldn't have married into the marquis manor.

154
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,039
She loves me. She loves me.

155
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,280
Who is it?

156
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,080
Long time no see.

157
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,160
Tangtang Nine Songs.

158
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,840
Why are you here?

159
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,760
Shouldn't you...

160
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,800
Yes, I should have been dead.

161
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,760
There's no need for us to be like this.

162
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,720
Please let me go.

163
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,840
You hid Ling'er back then.

164
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,160
No, she came to me.

165
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,960
And you indulged your wife to kill her.

166
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,440
So what?

167
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,200
She loves me.

168
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,360
She gave birth to a daughter for me.
