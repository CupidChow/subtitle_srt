1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
According to the popular novel, "The Queen doesn't have moral ethics." Adapted.

2
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,080
How dare you!

3
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Your Majesty.

4
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,360
When Kim Se-quan was going to use a hidden weapon,

5
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,800
Why didn't you say that you're being presumptuous?

6
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,120
It clearly stated in the arena that you can't use hidden weapons.

7
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,160
I just took it out, but it's useless.

8
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,400
This is Yan Academy.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,400
Hill Leader has his own decision.

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,960
Princess Qin won

11
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,400
Princess Qin won.

12
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,880
In one joss stick,

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,400
With love as the topic,

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,720
Draw a painting.

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,039
A poem.

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,320
Begin.

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,240
Sister.

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,840
It's not too late to admit defeat.

19
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,880
You asked for it.

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,200
It's an honor to see Miss Tang draw on the spot today.

21
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,240
It’s an eye-opener.

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
Why isn’t Princess Qin moving?

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,000
Is it because she knows she’s no match

24
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,520
So I quit.

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,760
How embarrassing.

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,800
Time's up.

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,760
The moon shines on the peach blossom shore.

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
The stars shine upon the Jade Water Pool.

29
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,120
The harmony and harmony are connected.

30
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,960
The Phoenix is like wings and the love is sweet.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,320
Miss Tang's poems and paintings match perfectly.

32
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,560
I can feel

33
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,840
the love of Miss Tang.

34
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,760
The red bean grows in the south.

35
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,440
When spring comes

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,520
May you pick more

37
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,400
I miss this most.

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,760
The western wind withered last night.

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,480
The light shined until dawn through Zhu Hu.

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,640
The western wind withered last night.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,640
went to the west tower alone.

42
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,560
and see the end of the world.

43
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,760
What a great story.

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,240
Which lover is my wife missing?

45
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,640
Your Highness, you've never heard of this poem?

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,720
Are you mocking me for being illiterate?

47
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,600
Don't get me wrong.

48
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,600
Of course I miss you.

49
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,360
Ever since you left,

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,279
I couldn't eat or drink.

51
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
to write this poem.

52
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,760
If you haven't heard it,

53
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,760
it means tomorrow's written exam

54
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,240
I can use the wisdom of my predecessors.

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,560
Moths, snow, willow, golden thread.

56
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,800
Laughs are beautiful and fragrant

57
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,040
Looking for him everywhere

58
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,560
When I look back,

59
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,800
But that person

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,560
In the blink of light

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,960
Just one tree.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,560
This poem is not bad.

63
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,640
But this painting

64
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,040
is fake.

65
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,960
That's impossible.

66
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,720
This tree is good.

67
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
This is just a tree.

68
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,240
Why is it better than ours

69
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,520
What season is it on your painting?

70
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,960
Peach blossoms. Can't you tell?

71
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,920
That's spring.

72
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,000
Spring birds should fly north

73
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,360
But sister's painting

74
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,520
is flying south.

75
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,040
Don't tell me

76
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,720
know such common sense?

77
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,520
I announce Princess Qin wins the last round.

78
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,040
I’ll take Princess Qin as my last disciple as promised.

79
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,200
Alright.

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
That’s all for today.

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,560
Princess Qin is the most talented woman in the world.

82
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,960
By the way, Hill Leader Cheng,

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,200
The New Moon Festival is in a few days.

85
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,080
Tell Princess Qin.

86
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,880
I’m looking forward to her performance on the festival.

87
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,360
Princess Qin is indeed unparalleled.

88
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
On the wedding day,

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,720
We were rude.

90
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,800
Please don't take it to heart.

91
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,280
No problem.

92
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,040
Let's go back to the palace.

93
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,040
Farewell, Your Majesty.

94
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,720
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

95
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,240
We have plenty of time.

96
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Same to you.

97
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,640
Princess Qin’s painting skills

98
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,159
is so fake.

99
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
I admire you.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,240
What are you talking about?

101
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,680
Actually the Queen's tea is honey water.

102
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,720
I added honey water into the ink.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,040
Then the butterfly will come when they smell it.

104
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,400
Smart boy.

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,520
He won.

106
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,520
Kim Se-Jeon, you jerk!

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,440
How dare you bully her?

108
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,280
What is Princess Changping angry about?

109
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,680
Jin Se-quan is such a bad guy.

110
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,400
How dare he attack his sister-in-law?

111
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,120
If I can play for my sister-in-law,

112
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
I'll beat him up.

113
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
and piss him off.

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,040
Kim Se-Jeon, you're such a coward.

115
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,480
Useless.

116
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's go, Jiang.

117
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,159
Useless!

118
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
How dare you

119
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,680
Cheng Lixue's last disciple.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,880
Shiquan, you may leave.

121
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,360
Ninggu Zhou has killed many of us

122
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,280
Mother, what should we do next?

123
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,040
Although he’s poisoned by heart corrosion,

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,320
the poison can be detoxified.

125
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,080
We can only wait?

126
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,000
The most important thing now

127
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,800
is to marry Jiang Hutong.

128
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,880
She is the most talented woman in the world.

129
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,320
With her assistance, I can feel relieved.

130
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,080
But that old fox of Prime Minister

131
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,720
doesn't sprinkle hawks when he doesn't see a rabbit.

132
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,520
I'm worried.

133
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,480
I know.

134
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,440
If it weren't for her birth mother's low status,

135
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,960
I would have married her.

136
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,240
Send someone to keep an eye on Ninggu Zhou.

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,640
What about Xiaotang?

138
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,800
Xiaoxin.

139
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,280
Although Princess Qin

140
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,400
is more interesting than I thought,

141
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,000
But we don't have to do anything.

142
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,840
Someone will deal with her for us.

143
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,000
My acupuncture skill

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,520
to cure the poison.

145
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,640
Hurry up and cure Ninggu Zhou.

146
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,080
Otherwise, before they find out the secret,

147
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,280
before they find out the secret.

148
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,080
Sister-in-law, get up.

149
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,960
Get up or you'll be late for school.

150
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,160
By the way,

151
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,080
is Hill Leader Cheng really as powerful as they said?

152
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,000
Everyone says Hill Leader is powerful.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,960
He can do anything.

154
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
he can do everything.

155
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,400
He must know medicine too.

156
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,680
Lixue, what do you think of Princess Qin?

157
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
Very smart.

158
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,920
Do you think

159
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,360
has such a daughter?

160
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,840
You must teach your disciple well.

161
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,120
Yes.

162
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,560
Hill Leader Cheng.

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,480
What are you looking at?

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,760
I heard that you have excellent medical skills.

165
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,600
I think...

166
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,040
I have sworn

167
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,440
to stop treating patients.

168
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,360
I haven't said anything yet.

169
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,160
Hill Leader Mo is ready.

170
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,640
Get out.

171
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
Hill Leader, what are you going to teach me?

172
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,480
I have nothing to teach you.

173
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,120
You must be joking.

174
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,800
You're the smartest person in Yan Academy.

175
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,680
Get out.

176
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Hill Leader.

177
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,720
Get out.

178
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,200

181

Photography team.

182
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,280
Art team.

183
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:09,840
The recording team.

184
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:11,840
Lighting Team.

185
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,440
Costume team.

186
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:19,760
Props team.

187
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,120
Late production.

188
