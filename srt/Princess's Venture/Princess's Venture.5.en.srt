1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
According to Seven cats' popular novel, Her Highness doesn't care about moral ethics. Adapted?

2
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,400
Your Majesty.

3
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,720
Princess Qin’s medicine is for you.

4
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,440
I hope you can help the royal family as soon as possible.

5
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,320
I’m so grateful.

7
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,960
Prince Qin,

8
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
You are getting more and more impolite.

9
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,240
Father, Princess Consort is weak.

10
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,720
She can’t afford such expensive medicine.

11
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,039
I know you feel wronged.

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,920
How about this? I promise you one thing.

13
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,200
Myo-shim lives in the countryside.

14
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,080
so she has never seen much of the world.

15
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,080
and admired Yan Academy.

16
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,920
I’m the daughter of the Marquis of Wanhu.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,040
and Princess Qin.

18
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,000
That means

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Other than that mysterious question mark,

20
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,160
The Ming Emperor.

21
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,080
Empress.

22
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,759
I can contact the Marquis of Wanhu and Prince Qin.

23
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
The only thing I need to do

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,160
is Cheng Lixue from Yan Academy.

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,160
Go to Yan Academy then.

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,040
I will study hard.

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,079
I won't let Your Majesty down.

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,800
We've been here for so long.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,560
It's time for you to meet Concubine Yu. You may leave.

31
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,480
Don't eat anything in the Imperial Study anymore.

32
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,520
Why?

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,720
If you don't want to die, do as I say.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,240
He is protecting me.

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,440
Zhou, you are here.

36
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,680
Greetings, Mother.

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,120
Get up.

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you, Your Highness. Thank you, Mother.

39
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,280
Brother and sister-in-law.

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,680
Why are you standing here?

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,480
Sister-in-law, come here.

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,160
Mother.

43
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,480
I'm hungry. We want to eat cakes.

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
Changping, you...

45
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,720
Here comes His Majesty.

46
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,240
Greetings, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,520
Get up.

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,000
What?

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,920
I came at a bad time.

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,880
Your Majesty, you must be joking.

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,560
Father came to see mother

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,800
for something important.

54
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,000
We won't disturb you then.

55
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's go.

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:53,880
Leave.

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,720
Go!

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:55,960
Go!

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
What brings you here today, Your Majesty?

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,520
Have you seen that child?

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,120
Don't you think

62
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,480
she looks like someone?

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,040
Your Majesty.

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,040
They are all dead.

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,839
Your Highness.

66
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,040
This is the medicinal bath therapy I read in the book.

67
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,640
Ask Mo Li to come here later.

68
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,320
with special massage techniques

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,760
can effectively suppress your poison.

70
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,800
Tonight,

71
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
we must find out the secret of the lonely boat.

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,520
Come out.

73
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,720
Already?

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm not ready yet.

75
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,200
His Highness's heart...

76
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,520
It hurts.

77
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,040
Help me.

78
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,240
What are you doing?

79
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,600
Didn't you ask me to come here?

80
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,600
Your Highness.

81
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,200
[Have you heard of a word called "Effect from the East"?]

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,200
What does she want?

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,440
I don't believe I can't handle you.

84
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,440
Make the fan bigger.

85
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,760
You'd better give me an explanation.

86
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,360
Give me another chance.

87
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,040
Your Highness, why didn't you tell me what's on your mind?

88
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,320
How would I care about a mere beauty scheme?

89
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,400
Your Highness.

90
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,440
Get out.

91
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,720
I told you not to show up here.

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,920
How dare you come here?

93
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,120
This land is dirty.

94
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,159
Since you agreed to let me enter Yan Academy,

95
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,760
why can't I come to school?

96
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,720
Because I hate you.

97
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,720
Then don't look at me.

98
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,960
How dare you talk back?

99
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Yan Academy

100
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
has always been learned.

101
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,720
If I ask Young Master Jin for advice,

102
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,720
will Young Master Jin agree?

103
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,400
This girl is so interesting.

104
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,560
Love it.

105
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,640
Changping.

106
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,920
Why isn't Yan Academy allowed to go to school?

107
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,880
Who are you?

108
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:23,840
Do you know my father is General Kim?

109
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,360
Do you know my father is the general?

110
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,040
I'm General Jin's only son, Kim Se-quan.

111
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,960
Who are you?

112
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,160
She's my sister-in-law.

113
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,560
So you are the shameless

114
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,560
who stole my sister's kiss.

115
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,520
I think you're ugly.

116
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,360
Jin Shi Quan, your words are too mean.

117
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,159
You should be happy

118
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,400
you should be happy.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,800
Jiang Hutong.

120
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,680
Don't think you can rest assured

121
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,320
after entering Yan Academy.

122
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,159
Sir,

123
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,560
You seem to like bullying women.

124
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,800
So this is the general's manor.

125
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,120
What's going on?

126
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,000
My sister is new here.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
She doesn't know the rules.

128
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,840
Please be magnanimous.

129
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
and forgive her.

130
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,600
For the sake of Jiang Xian,

131
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,800
for the sake of Jiang Xian.

132
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,160
If you wanted to come,

133
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
why would he show up now?

134
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,840
How could he admit

135
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,840
for no reason?

136
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,520
Miss Jiang, what do you mean?

137
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
Don’t you understand?

138
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,720
She said you were pretending.

139
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,080
She said you have ulterior motives.

140
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,960
Let's not argue with them.

141
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,640
If we want to enter Yan Academy,

142
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,720
you have to pass the basic exam.

143
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,280
This is hard.

144
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,000
You’ve never been to school.

145
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,200
Why don’t you go back and beg Prince Qin

146
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,559
to talk to the hill leader

147
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,799
to exempt you from the exam.

148
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,919
This is...

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,520
How do you know

150
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,080
how do you know I can't pass?

151
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,760
If you can,

152
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll lie on the ground and learn to bark

153
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,400
to cheer you up.

154
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,640
Sorry.

155
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,640
Many people want to be my dog.

156
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm afraid Mr. Jin can't make it.

157
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,720
But

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,880
if the bet is 100,000 taels of silver

159
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,160
I can think about it

160
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,520
You're really poor.

161
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
I have plenty of money.

162
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,200
But if you fail,

163
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,600
you'll be Jiang Xian's maid for three years.

164
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,040
Mr. Jin, it’s not appropriate.

165
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,160
Princess Qin is my maid.

166
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,200
Isn’t that embarrassing?

167
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,720
I admit defeat.

168
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
If Prince Qin dares to make trouble,

169
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,600
our General’s Mansion won’t be easy to deal with.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,560
Sure.

171
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,160
As long as you can give me money,

172
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,040
you’re dead this time.

173
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,360
Princess Qin.

174
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Flowers match beauties.

175
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,080
Stop fighting!

176
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,000
Stop!

177
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,600
Your face...

178
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
What happened to my face?

179
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,520
Didn’t you say Prince Qin was disfigured?

180
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,680
The World's Best City?

181
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
I'll keep that in mind.

182
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,400
It's an honor.

183
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,640
Director team.

184
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,520
Vice director, Li Haihao.

185
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:02,920
The production team.

186
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,560
Photography team.

187
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:12,720
Art team.

188
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,280
The recording team.

189
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,280
Lighting Team.

190
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:19,880
