1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
According to the popular novel, "The Queen doesn't care about morality." Adapted.

2
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,320
The Song of Tang.

3
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,440
and become the Ming Emperor.

4
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,400
You're still in my hands.

5
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,480
All these years,

6
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
I'm not the only one you want to see.

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,840
Nine songs, Myaomiam.

8
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,480
Ling'er.

9
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,039
Don't worry about me.

10
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,039
Nine songs.

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,880
die in your arms.

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,360
I'm very happy.

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,800
Ling'er is fine.

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
[Why is there someone else who's messing around?]

15
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,080
One more thing.

16
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,080
I want to know where my mother Su Ling'er is.

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,520
I heard that after Li threw Su Ling'er into the mountain,

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,360
we looked for her immediately.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,400
There's no trace of Su Ling'er.

20
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,600
As for Su Ling'er's life,

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,840
I really don't know.

22
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,960
Changping said he saw Su Ling'er in the palace.

23
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,400
I thought it was strange.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,400
Why did I find out about Su Ling'er

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,160
and found out about Su Ling'er,

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,000
someone sent the news to us.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,600
If I'm not mistaken,

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,919
you knew I was investigating my mother.

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,240
So you set me up to lure my father out.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,480
Then you told my father through me

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,040
my mother is in your hands.

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,680
Indeed.

33
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:22,079
You like playing with people's hearts the most.

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,280
Take a look.

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,360
Divorce Agreement? For me?

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,360
It's indeed the handwriting of Ninggu Boat.

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,360
The Song of Tang.

38
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
You lost to the word "love".

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,079
Today, your daughter was hurt by love like you.

40
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,400
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,600
I never divorced my wife.

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
I only lost my husband.

43
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,720
Bad news, news from the palace.

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
The Empress has rebelled.

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,160
What?

47
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,760
If you stay here and choose to kill me,

48
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,680
your throne will change.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
It's your obsession to kill me and sit on the throne.

50
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,320
I look forward to your choice.

51
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,520
Do you think I dare not kill you?

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,640
The Ming Emperor.

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,920
I advise you to do more good deeds.

54
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,800
After all, you're not from the right place.

55
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,640
Your hands are full of blood.

56
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,680
Is this good?

57
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,960
The Empress has rebelled.

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,000
Your Majesty, let's go back to the palace first.

59
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,600
It'll be too late.

60
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,160
Shut up!

61
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,760
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,560
Your Majesty, I advise you to go back first.

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,840
Otherwise, the house will be stolen.

64
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,840
The Song of Tang.

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,000
I will kill you sooner or later.

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,320
I can protect you.

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,760
Changping.

68
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,600
Prince Qin.

69
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,560
Take care of the princess.

70
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,880
Your Majesty.

71
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,480
Look at you.

72
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,920
How pathetic.

73
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,960
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,920
What do you mean by this?

75
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,240
Do you know?

76
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,240
Not long ago,

77
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,840
Tang Jiusong gave me a letter.

78
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,040
The letter described

79
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,360
how to take down the palace step by step.

80
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,960
How can I make you, an invincible emperor,

81
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,200
lose everything.

82
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,680
I knew

83
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,280
there must be Tang's Nine Songs.

84
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,080
You couldn't be the emperor

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,280
you couldn't be the emperor.

86
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,960
Twenty years later,

87
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,600
you'll still be defeated by him.

88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,480
Look at you now.

89
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,080
How pathetic.

90
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,560
How dare you

91
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,440
under my nose?

92
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
You shouldn’t treat our family as fools.

93
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,320
In order to help you ascend the throne,

94
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,440
to help you ascend the throne.

95
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
In the end, you broke the bridge.

96
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,520
This is outrageous.

97
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,440
Why do I only deserve to work for you?

98
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,880
You can only be the emperor.

99
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,680
Do you think the Tangtang Nine Songs will go as you wish?

100
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
This person is deep-minded.

101
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
He didn't miss anything.

102
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,600
Today, you and the Crown Prince forced the palace.

103
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,880
might be just a part of his big game.

104
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,600
It's okay. After I kill you and Ninggu Zhou,

105
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
I'll deal with Tang Jiusong.

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,200
You're still alive.

107
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,320
It's time to end this.

108
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,520
What?

109
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,840
You want to kill me too?

110
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,120
Don't you think about your sister?

111
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,800
Your Majesty.

112
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,720
Ning Changping is ready, too.

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,840
Kill him!

114
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,560
Kill me!

115
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,320
If you kill me, your sister will die too.

116
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,320
As long as you still have a weakness,

117
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,240
you can never kill me.

118
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,800
Have you seen His Highness?

119
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,400
No.

120
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,720
No.

121
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,560
But we heard that

122
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,760
the emperor is going to make the prince the Crown Prince.

123
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,720
Rumors from the palace

124
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,840
is most likely true.

125
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,920
The lonely boat in the dogs

126
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,480
really wants the empire and beauty.

127
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll kill him for you.

128
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,400
Who are you?

129
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
I forgot to introduce myself.

130
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,920
I'm your princess's father.

131
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,320
Your lord's ex-father-in-law.

132
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,080
Your ex-father-in-law?

133
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,000
Because your lord

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
just gave my daughter a divorce letter.

135
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,360
Divorce letter?

136
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,000
That's impossible.

137
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,480
His Highness loves her so much.

138
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,080
He must have his reasons.

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,799
This is not the reason he gave me the divorce letter.

140
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,320
What should we do next?

141
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,880
Looks like the emperor won't let the prince go.

142
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,760
Get ready.

143
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,679
Ready for what?

144
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,560
Are you rebelling?

145
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,360
Otherwise, how can I get into the palace to save my husband?

146
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,080
My love.

147
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,400
Are you serious?

148
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,640
We need the army to rebel.

149
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,720
To be honest,

150
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,920
I have to tell you

151
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,760
a secret I've kept for years.

152
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,560
What secret?

153
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,640
Actually, I'm a king who has returned to the country.

154
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,240
You mean the most mysterious and invincible foreign country?

155
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,160
Stop joking.

156
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,400
My father never jokes.

157
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,560
I'll go to the palace to see Ning Jiuzhou.

158
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,280
Ninggu Zhou?

159
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,200
Don't think you can divorce me with a divorce letter.

160
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,240
I don't agree.

161
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,840
Myo-shim.

162
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
Kill me.

163
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
What did you say?

164
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,560
I said kill me.

165
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,720
Lonely boat.

166
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,440
In this world,

167
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,680
some outsiders with missions

168
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,560
They can show themselves in the court

169
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,080
with their wisdom and knowledge.

170
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,200
But as time goes by,

171
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,480
[people's hearts are mixed here.]

172
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,960
[Kwon Ryoc's game is getting more and more complicated.]

173
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,240
They're getting deeper and deeper

174
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,840
become the same as this world.

175
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,040
The clear goal gradually became blurred

176
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,040
Till I die here

177
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,240
Lone boat.

178
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,800
Myo-shim wants to go out, so she can't have any worries.

179
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,240
Kill me.

180
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,680
Kill me.

181
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
How do you know that?

182
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,920
I'm also an outsider.

183
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,720
Congratulations on finishing

184
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,160
on passing the first instance zones.

185
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,200
Yan.

186
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
After three seconds countdown,

187
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,560
will enter the second instance zones.

188
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,240
Three, two, one.

189
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,800
