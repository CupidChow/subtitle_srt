1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
According to the popular novel, "The Queen doesn't have moral ethics." Adapted?

2
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,320
what happened in your mansion

3
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,480
What's your explanation?

4
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,400
Your Majesty,

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
We don't know anything.

6
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,640
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,960
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

8
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,880
The Crown Prince is going to marry the Crown Princess tomorrow.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,880
Is it going to end with you?

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,960
How are you going to get married?

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,800
Shut up!

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,200
Then take her to the Eastern Palace as a concubine.

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,480
Your Majesty.

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,640
Your Majesty, Xiaoxian can’t be a concubine.

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,200
How dare you!

16
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,960
If you don't want to be a concubine, do you want to be the Crown Princess?

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,039
I will tell His Majesty

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,640
what happened today.

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,000
If you dare to gossip,

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,360
don't blame me for being merciless.

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,680
Farewell, Your Majesty.

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,600
My daughter.

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,720
I know.

24
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,960
You did all this.

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,440
I knew it.

26
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,520
you are the Monstrous Lonely Star.

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,240
It's not good for anyone who gets involved with you.

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,400
But in terms of despicable,

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,960
no one is better than you.

30
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,160
Oh, right.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,920
I forgot to tell the Empress.

32
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,040
There's a pair of wild mandarin ducks in my room.

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,720
You little bitch!

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,079
I'll kill you!

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,040
Mind your words.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,240
Forgive us, Your Highness.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,480
We neglected you today.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,960
Princess Qin is your daughter after all.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,160
I don’t have a daughter like her.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,520
Then let's cut ties.

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,079
Myo-shim.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,240
Don't be angry.

43
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,000
My Lord, as you can see,

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,000
The cakes Her Ladyship sent yesterday

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
just to kill me.

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,720
You made my princess suffer.

47
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,160
Either you admit that you intentionally murdered the princess,

48
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,480
or break off with her.

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Sign it.

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,920
Take it. Take it.

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,720
Hurry up.

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,160
Your Highness, let's go home.

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,440
Let's go home.

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,440
I should have left earlier.

55
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,000
It's okay.

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,000
It's okay.

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,760
Li, are you hiding something from me?

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,160
No.

59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
I don't mind you losing your enemy.

60
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,280
But Myo-shim is

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,400
the queen.

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,640
Why do you always go against her?

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,440
My Lord, are you blaming me?

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,520
Have you forgotten how she treated Jiang Xian?

65
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,320
Father, what about me?

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,280
That's right.

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,640
Our Jiang Xian is going to be the Crown Princess.

68
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,600
The Crown Princess?

69
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,560
Now it seems

70
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,680
we can only talk to the Crown Prince.

71
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,120
Leng Ning.

72
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,440
You come eight times a day.

73
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,400
Do you really think this is your home?

74
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,960
Don't force me to close the door and leave you alone.

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,240
Go away.

76
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,760
Why isn't she cute?

77
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,920
Pour me a glass of water.

78
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,120
I have something important to tell you.

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,920
Let me guess.

80
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,280
The Marquis handed the mine to the Crown Prince.

81
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,840
You guessed right.

82
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,240
In order to promote the status of the fairy of Tangjiang,

83
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,440
he's willing to do so.

84
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,680
One more thing.

85
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,800
The guard behind the Crown Prince

86
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,760
is General Jin.

87
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
I've seen his kung fu.

88
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
It seems

89
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,480
I should give General Jin a big gift.

90
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,159
Mo Li.

91
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,720
Your Highness.

92
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
It's time to take your medicine.

93
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,560
Your Highness, do you still feel unwell?

94
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,720
I...

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
It hurts here.

96
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,960
It's fine.

97
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
Why does my heart hurt?

98
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Because I think

99
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,120
you are hiding a lot from me.

100
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,840
Your Highness, are you flirting with me?

101
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,040
No.

102
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,080
I'm just telling you

103
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,240
how you feel right now.

104
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,520
Do you hear me?

105
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I put him in my heart.

106
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,720
Then you won't feel the pain.

107
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,720
If you think this won't do,

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,880
I'll do it again.

109
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,760
My Lord, I ate you in my stomach.

110
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
You won't feel pain anymore, right?

111
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,880
Not yet.

112
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,760
Can you feel my heartbeat?

113
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,240
It's only beating for you at this moment.

114
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,280
I don't just want this moment.

115
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,680
but every moment.

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,040
Please start your performance.

117
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,720
Let me tell you.

118
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,560
Miss Tang has an affair with the Crown Prince.

119
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,560
If Young Master Jin finds out,

120
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,640
if Young Master Jin finds out.

121
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,520
Young Master Jin is also a loving seed.

122
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,159
I heard Young Master Jin is missing.

123
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,600
Could it be the Crown Prince?

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,080
Don't talk nonsense. Let's go.

125
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,360
Okay.

126
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,520
Come back.

127
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,720
Well done.

128
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,920
Stop acting next time.

129
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,680
Your Highness, you're right.

130
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,960
We purposely talked about the Crown Prince

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,960
in the back mountain of Yan Academy.

132
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,800
General Jin is really interested.

133
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,800
But what's the use of our acting?

134
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a little flame

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,640
of General Jin.

136
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,840
I know that.

137
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,960
This is called a dog bites a dog with a mouthful.

138
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,400
What's going on, Your Highness?

139
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,520
I just received the news.

140
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,960
that Marquis Wanhu hid the mine.

141
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,240
and didn't report it.

142
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,520
to investigate.

143
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,360
Should I send someone to investigate or circle them up?

144
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,960
I dare not.

145
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,560
You dare not?

146
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
No wonder Her Majesty asked you

147
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,640
to make you take the legitimate daughter of the Marquis as your concubine.

148
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,360
So this is your plan.

149
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,880
Why are you quiet?

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,680
You stole the mine.

151
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,040
According to the law, it's a major crime to execute the whole family.

152
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,320
Do you know

153
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,280
Prince Qin,

154
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,200
What do you think?

155
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,680
The Marquis of Wanhu didn't report it.

156
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,840
I thought

157
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,960
I thought you would bite the Crown Prince to death and know about it.

158
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,200
After all, you found out all these.

159
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,799
I'm just telling the truth.

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,440
What are you talking about?

161
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Then confine the Marquis and the others.

162
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,880
You may leave.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,240
