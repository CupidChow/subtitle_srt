[Episode 11]

32
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:40,079
Xu Li,

33
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,159
Mr. Ji said that I should start
by following you.

34
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,640
I look forward to learning more
from you in the future.

35
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,200
Okay, if there's anything
you don't understand later on,

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,519
feel free to ask me at any time.

37
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:57,840
Okay, is there anything I can do now?

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,319
I just arrived and want
to learn as much as I can.

39
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,840
Hold on a second, let me check.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,879
Alright, take these files first
and have a look at them.

41
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,840
If there's anything you don't understand,
come and ask me anytime.

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,560
Okay, but I need to stop
by the HR department first.

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
- I'll be back later.
- Okay.

44
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,392
Thank you for your scales.

45
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,199
Xiaoning, what a coincidence
we are colleagues again.

46
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,240
It is quite a coincidence. I didn't expect you
to join the Development Department.

47
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,560
Because there are some very important issues

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,680
that I need to finish here.

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,280
By the way, I heard you and my senior
were high school alumni.

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,328
Are you close with him?

51
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,159
We were alumni, same grade,
but not in the same class.

52
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,800
Not very close.

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,879
That's rather good,
otherwise it would be like me.

54
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:06,159
Having to act unfamiliar with him
to avoid suspicion is quite troublesome.

55
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,840
By the way, Xiaoning,

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,479
about the office supplies
and work badges for us staff,

57
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,759
is it you who gets them all?

58
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,759
Could you get a set for me too?

59
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,912
Why?

60
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,080
When I was in the lobby before,

61
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,240
it was the workers who hadn't been made
official who did these tasks.

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,360
Now we're in the Development Department.

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,759
I am an assistant to the Account Manager,
and so are you.

64
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,040
Okay.

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Tu, try these newly bought plum candies.

66
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,960
Feels like being overzealous
without cause, Zhao.

67
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Do you have an issue with Tang?

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,560
There's no such issue of getting along or not.

69
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,768
They're pretty tasty.

70
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,479
I'd like to treat everyone
to a meal on my first day.

71
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,159
I've reserved a private room at Juchuan.

72
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,360
I hope you will do me the honor of attending.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,000
Our leader seems to have
an unusual relationship with Tang

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,279
You know it again?
Zhao, you seem to know everything.

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,959
We'll head over first.

76
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,519
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

77
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,240
- Take it easy. Bye.
- See you in a bit.

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,879
Tang, can you give me a lift later?

79
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,879
Xu Li, I still have something to do.

80
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,120
You go ahead, I'll be there shortly.

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,839
Alright, no problem.

82
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,439
Jing, neither Zhao nor I drove today.

83
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,399
Can I catch a ride with you?

84
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,439
Sorry about that.

85
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,639
My passenger seat is only for young guys.

86
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,688
You'll have to figure it out yourself.

87
00:04:58,688 --> 00:04:59,800
Tu, come with me.

88
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,832
Let's go.

89
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,839
Better to rely on ourselves, take the subway.

90
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,040
Okay.

91
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,079
- Wait for me a bit, bro.
- I won't.

92
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,160
What's up, Tang?

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
My senior, time to get off work.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They all went to Juchuan, let's go too.

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,399
They've already left?

96
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,839
I waited especially for you to finish work.

97
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,896
All right.

98
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,720
By the way, Tang, call me Mr. Ji
at the office from now on.

99
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,904
Okay.

100
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,560
Disinfect the dishes?

101
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,616
Shall I disinfect you?

102
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:54,600
What time is it now?

103
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,879
Why haven't the boss
and Tang Yuhui arrived yet?

104
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,680
Senior and junior, they come in pairs.

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,439
They will definitely come together.

106
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,759
- Is it here?
- It's here.

107
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,920
- Sorry.
- Sorry, everyone.

108
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,040
The road was too congested, we are late.

109
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,056
I'll sit here.

110
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,744
Then I'll sit over there.

111
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,120
Tang, let's swap seats.

112
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,440
This is where the vent is.

113
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,120
I've been a bit under the weather
these past two days.

114
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,800
Okay, bro, you sit here.

115
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,000
My senior, now that everyone's here,
shall we start?

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,080
Everyone, please start eating.

117
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,040
You go ahead.

118
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,639
Xiaoning has always been my senior,
you go first.

119
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,720
Sure.

120
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, I will toast everyone first.

121
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,759
Everyone, earlier in the lobby,

122
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,720
although I have achieved a little bit,

123
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,639
I am still a newcomer
to the Development Department.

124
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,959
I hope you will take good care
of me in the future.

125
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,360
If you need my help in the future, just ask.

126
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,439
Cheers, everyone.

127
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,240
Don't worry, we will definitely
take care of Mr. Ji's junior.

128
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,839
In fact, most people from our department
at Qingbei University

129
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,759
are in the Finance Department.

130
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,920
Speaking of the financial industry
and our company, Dairui,

131
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,839
there are seven or eight juniors here with us.

132
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,319
Xu Li, why don't you take care of them all?

133
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,040
Mr. Ji is right.

134
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,319
You shouldn't be biased just because
Tang is Mr. Ji's junior

135
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,800
and give her extra care.

136
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,439
This undermines her ability as a graduate
from a prestigious university.

137
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,120
Besides, those who can join
our Development Department Division One,

138
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,160
none relied on nepotism.

139
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,600
Yes, it's my fault.

140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,720
Well, I'll punish myself with a drink.

141
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,000
Xu Li, since you can drink so much,

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,839
is one drink enough?
Punish yourself with a whole pot.

143
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,439
Okay, you drink with me, bro.

144
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,920
My senior, try this.

145
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,800
This is particularly fresh,
I requested it specially.

146
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,864
Okay, thank you.

147
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,848
Right, Tu,

148
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,560
I noticed that doctor from Renji Hospital

149
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,039
hasn't come to see you recently.

150
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,279
Does that mean it's completely over
between you two?

151
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,952
No worries, how about this?

152
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:42,320
Tell me about your ideal type.

153
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,399
I happen to know a few excellent young men.

154
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,600
Ideal type?

155
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,240
Artistic young men, looks don't really matter.

156
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,279
With long hair over their shoulders.

157
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,000
The key is to know how to maintain distance
from the opposite sex.

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,519
Having a proper sense of boundaries.

159
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,320
Yes, my classmate's younger brother
is just this type.

160
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,600
Next week, I'll set up a meeting with him.

161
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,799
You two can meet and have a good talk,
what do you say?

162
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,799
Blind dating, huh?

163
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,519
Sure, thank you, Zhao.

164
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,919
Then it's settled.

165
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,348
My senior, are you okay?

166
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:26,399
Thank you.

167
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,552
My senior, you are…

168
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:30,720
What's your ideal type like?

169
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,840
Get lost.

170
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,399
Tang, come on.

171
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,879
- Bro, drink less.
- Okay.

172
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,120
I can't hold my liquor well.

173
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,360
This place we've chosen today
is especially delicious.

174
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,639
- Tasty, isn't it?
- Delicious.

175
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,720
- I reserved it specifically.
- Especially tasty.

176
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,799
- Then I'll add more.
- Come out for a bit.

177
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,559
Sure.

178
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,856
- Tang.
- Jing.

179
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:46,919
- I'm going to the restroom.
- Come on.

180
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,720
Let's drink too, if there's any trouble
in the future,

181
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,320
- Okay.
- just tell me. If I can help, I certainly will.

182
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,039
- Bro, please take care of me.
- No problem.

183
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,080
Cheers.

184
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:16,384
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

185
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:19,488
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

186
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:24,552
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

187
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,160
♫ My fast heartbeat ♫

188
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,936
♫ Hide in a few seconds ♫

189
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:37,032
♫ When I close my eyes ♫

190
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:41,060
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

191
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,548
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

192
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:48,460
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

193
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:52,772
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

194
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:59,240
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

195
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,384
Were you serious just now?

196
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,159
What?

197
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,480
Are you serious about your standards
for an ideal type?

198
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,320
Doesn't everyone have an ideal type?

199
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,879
What's wrong? Can't I have one?

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,136
So you're going for a blind date?

201
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,184
Is this why you asked me to come out?

202
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,296
♫ I hope you know ♫

203
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,632
Let me go first.

204
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,519
Zhao cares a lot about face.

205
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,919
There were so many people there.
I couldn't just snub him.

206
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,360
I can just find an opportunity to refuse later.

207
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,080
No need to wait or look for another chance.

208
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,600
Tell him after it's over.

209
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
This is my own business. I'll handle it.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,399
My senior, are you in there?

211
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,559
Mr. Ji, you better take care
of your own matters.

212
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,000
Your junior is looking for you.

213
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,679
My senior, how come you came out from there?

214
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,440
Wrong room, let's go.

215
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,176
My senior, when you were in college,

216
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:32,919
you said you liked girls with high ponytails.
What about now?

217
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,600
Jing, well,

218
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,360
we have to go to the next place.

219
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,559
Zhao didn't drive, could you please
give him a ride?

220
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,919
- I take him?
- Yes.

221
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,320
I can't take him. I tell you,
my car is only for handsome guys.

222
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,720
- You give him a ride back.
- Take him back.

223
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000
Go.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,039
Why are you leaning on my car?

225
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,759
Xu Li, take me back.

226
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:04,519
Zhao Fanggang, you get off.

227
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,639
Rao Jing, sorry, I can't take you today.

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,240
You get off.

229
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,639
Zhao Fanggang, I'll count to three.

230
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,120
Three, two…

231
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,559
My senior, you've been drinking,
let me take you back.

232
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,639
No need, usually it's Tu
who drives everyone back.

233
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,159
Sorry, it's not on my way today.

234
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,296
I'm leaving first, Mr. Ji.

235
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,384
Not on the way?

236
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,279
My senior, let's go then

237
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:31,080
[Your smile is as bright as sunshine to me.
I hope we can have more stories. Ji Yuheng]

238
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,080
I thought he had such high standards
and good taste.

239
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,559
So the one he has been pining for
all these years is just this.

240
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,519
Since his ideal one isn't far away,

241
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,559
why did he seek to have a marriage-oriented
relationship with me in the first place?

242
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,799
His ideal is taking him home.

243
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,279
He must be very happy.

244
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,352
Glad I made it.

245
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,240
How did you come to the subway station?

246
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,120
Aren't you driving? Where's the car?

247
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,679
Since you don't want to drive,
I've parked it at Juchuan.

248
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,960
The parking fee there
is very expensive, a waste.

249
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,440
That's better than you being unhappy.

250
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,200
Are you mad at me?

251
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,559
I'm not mad at you, who said I was?

252
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,600
If he really likes Tang Yuhui,

253
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,240
wouldn't my blabbering questions
be asking for trouble?

254
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,039
I got my period.

255
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,639
It's normal to be a bit emotional.

256
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,440
Does your stomach hurt?

257
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,559
When we get back, I'll make you
a bowl of brown sugar ginger soup.

258
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,688
Whatever.

259
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,600
Let me carry it for you.

260
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,624
No need, I'll take it myself.

261
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,176
You say you're not angry.

262
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,120
Let me ask you a question.

263
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,919
What kind of girl did you like
during your college days?

264
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,639
Why do you suddenly want to ask this?

265
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,879
If you don't want to answer, forget it.

266
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,519
I don't have a specific type.

267
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,159
As long as it's her, any appearance is fine.

268
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,679
Isn't that the same as saying nothing?

269
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,720
Clear-headed and righteous,
cheerful and confident.

270
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,440
That's what you'd find in a job advertisement.

271
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,424
Then I'll rephrase.

272
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,000
The girl I like wears a high ponytail.

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,919
Her laugh is hearty.

274
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,216
High ponytail, that's something
many girls have…

275
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:02,240
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

276
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,360
It's okay.

277
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,880
- Are you okay?
- It's okay.

278
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
Don't move, let me see.

279
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,680
It was just a bump,
no need to make a big deal of it.

280
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,000
Then good, I have a question for you too.

281
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,920
You said today that an artistic young man
was your ideal type.

282
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,040
Are you serious?

283
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,720
Just like you,

284
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,039
as long as it's him, any way is fine.

285
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,240
Xiaoning, I made you
a bowl of brown sugar water.

286
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,920
Just leave it at the door for me, thanks.

287
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,008
Okay.

288
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,799
By the way, is your forehead okay?

289
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,559
It's fine, it was just a slight bump.

290
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,839
Alright, if you're not feeling well,

291
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:42,200
rest early, don't stay up too late.

292
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,480
Drink it while it's hot.

293
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,279
Do I look good with a ponytail?

294
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,880
Is my laugh hearty?

295
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,759
Are you alright? Have you been hacked?

296
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Artistic youth.

297
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,319
Should I strive to be your ideal type?

298
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,824
You already are.

299
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,599
Hello, this is Dairui Bank speaking.

300
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,799
I would like to follow up with you
about the loan from last time.

301
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,119
It's okay if you don't have time right now.

302
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:31,440
Please let me know after you are free.

303
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,200
May I call you back? Thank you.

304
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:54,039
What are you doing?

305
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,960
That's going too far.

306
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,759
- What happened?
- Was it you

307
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,519
who left me on the subway last night?

308
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,319
I missed my stop by ten stations.

309
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,759
After all the good treatment I've given you.

310
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,920
Xu Li, that was over the line.

311
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,279
- It wasn't me.
- Then who was it?

312
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,559
Mr. Zhao, since it's come to this,

313
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,160
I have no choice but to speak up.

314
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,776
Yesterday, you shamelessly insisted
on sitting in my passenger seat,

315
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,440
refusing to get out,
and then you threw up in my car.

316
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,528
It cost me 200 yuan to get it washed.

317
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,960
Transfer it to me on WeChat. Thanks.

318
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,608
So it was you, that's pretty harsh.

319
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,759
Do you even know?

320
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,759
It's also dangerous for young boys
to be out there nowadays.

321
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:33,119
Young boy, you're overestimating
your own looks.

322
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,880
You're also underestimating
women's taste in aesthetics, Mr. Zhao.

323
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,519
Rao Jing, what goes around comes around.

324
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,799
One day, you'll meet your end at my hands.

325
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,400
Thank you very much, read my gesture.

326
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,160
Tang Yuhui didn't come to work today?

327
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,519
She went with the leader to visit clients
at the second phase of the park this morning.

328
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,160
Tu, you look so pale, must be tired, huh?

329
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,319
Although preparing for exams is hard,
it's important to balance work and rest.

330
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,880
Remember to touch up your makeup after work.
I'll take you to meet a prospective match.

331
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,519
Blind date? I was joking yesterday.

332
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,799
Zhao, I have to not only take exams
but also look for clients.

333
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,400
Where do I have the time
to think about blind dates?

334
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,279
Think about it now,
I made all the contacts last night.

335
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,000
It would not be good to stand him up, right?

336
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,079
It's okay to do so.

337
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,160
Don't feel pressured.

338
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,079
With me here to back you up, don't be scared.

339
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,240
Remember to touch up your makeup after work.

340
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Mr. Zhao, stay away from my apprentice
in the future.

341
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,248
What goes around comes around.

342
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:56,072
[Come out.]

343
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,839
Didn't even send a WeChat message.

344
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,079
This guy is too unreliable.

345
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,160
Late but didn't even give a heads up.

346
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,240
He's already five minutes late.
Don't get angry.

347
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,519
When he comes, I'll have a good talk with him.

348
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,440
I'm not angry, Zhao.

349
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,400
Is it possible that he has something to do
or doesn't want to come

350
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,000
and is embarrassed to say it?

351
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,440
How about we change
to another restaurant? My treat.

352
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,599
Let's go and switch to another restaurant.

353
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,000
No, Tu, let's wait another ten minutes.

354
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,319
He was very enthusiastic
when I spoke to him on the phone yesterday.

355
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,759
He must be tied up with something right now

356
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,000
and can't get away to reply to messages.

357
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,720
Just ten more minutes. If he doesn't show up,

358
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,119
this meal is on me.

359
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,000
No need, Zhao,
didn't we agree on this beforehand?

360
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,960
No matter how urgent it is, one should
at least send a notification. Let's go.

361
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,599
He's replied to the message.

362
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,920
He says there was a little scrape on the way.

363
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,279
He'll definitely make it within half an hour.

364
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,808
Mr. Ji?

365
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,400
Didn't he say he wouldn't
show more care for her?

366
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,599
Where there's a good project in the park,

367
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,240
it ends up in the hands of his junior.

368
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,960
How come you've sat down again?

369
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,079
Didn't you say your classmate
would be here soon? Go on a blind date.

370
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,079
Okay, I'll send him a message right now

371
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,160
and urge him to hurry up.

372
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,312
Okay.

373
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,488
Does it suit your taste?

374
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,136
This brown sugar glutinous rice cake
tastes really good.

375
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,720
Tasty, isn't it?

376
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,519
This restaurant was chosen by Mr. Ji.

377
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:04,799
His choice of flavor is definitely right.

378
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,000
Chosen by Mr. Ji? It's really good.

379
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,440
Mr. Zhang, I'm glad you're pleased.

380
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,839
- This flavor is indeed good.
- Yes.

381
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,960
Let me tell you, today, if we settle the deal,

382
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,680
the park will soon see
an increase in performance.

383
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,079
Mr. Ji, have a taste.

384
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,039
I'm not too fond of sweets.

385
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,440
Sweet but not cloying.

386
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,504
Thank you.

387
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,640
You two, please try this.

388
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,799
This is their signature dish.

389
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,400
This taste is indeed good.
Xiaoning would probably like it too.

390
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,759
Eat some more.

391
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,928
Okay, thank you.

392
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,440
Pretty good.

393
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,680
Have you tried this one?

394
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,039
This is their signature dish.

395
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,119
Please excuse me for a moment.

396
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,152
Alright, I'll give it a taste.

397
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,000
Hello, could you add a serving
of brown sugar glutinous rice cake for me?

398
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,359
I'll get it to-go.
I'll pick it up when I leave.

399
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,440
- Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.

400
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,400
I'm not blowing my own trumpet.

401
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,039
My classmate's younger brother
is truly outstanding.

402
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,839
In every aspect, his conditions
can match up with our leader.

403
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,400
Not only does he completely fit the ideal type
of an artistic youth you fancy,

404
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,039
most importantly,
he's good at making conversation.

405
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,920
He'll often coax you.

406
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,680
He'll fully boost your emotional value.

407
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,680
If put on the market, he might even be
more sought after than Mr. Ji.

408
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,760
Is that so?

409
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Mr. Ji.

410
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,640
Sir, what a coincidence that you're here too.

411
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,640
I've scheduled a meeting with the leader
of the second phase of the park next door.

412
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
What you were just saying…

413
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,680
I got excited talking to Tu just now.

414
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,440
I blurted out some nonsense without thinking.

415
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,799
Don't take it to heart.

416
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,720
It's not nonsense, though.

417
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,279
I think Zhao has a point.

418
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,039
That person does sound pretty good.

419
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,960
Send him a WeChat message to slow down.

420
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,240
If he can't get here in half an hour,
I'll wait for him for an hour.

421
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,319
Alright, if the two of you really hit it off,

422
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,160
you'll have to invite me
to your wedding banquet.

423
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,320
Of course, that's a given.

424
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,119
Have the application documents
for that garment company been revised?

425
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,680
Almost done. I remember the deadline
is next week, isn't it?

426
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,240
You remembered wrong. I said this afternoon,
not next week.

427
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,119
Afternoon? The afternoon is almost over.

428
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:29,240
How about this? I'll make sure to give it
to you after finishing tomorrow.

429
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,680
Sir, as you can see,

430
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,359
I'm here accompanying Tu on a blind date.

431
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,880
My classmate's younger brother
will arrive shortly.

432
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,039
If I am not here,

433
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,400
it would be so awkward for them
just staring at each other.

434
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,319
I need to stay here to help them break the ice.

435
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,680
It won't be awkward. I am right here, aren't I?

436
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,079
When your classmate comes,
I'll be the one to help out.

437
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,248
You help out?

438
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:09,799
Tu, for us in marketing,
cold calling skills are the basics.

439
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,279
Isn't it just a first meeting?

440
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,160
Just treat him as if he is your client.

441
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,759
Communicate more, chat more,
get to know each other better.

442
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,240
It will definitely be fine.

443
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,640
I'll give you his WeChat right now.

444
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:24,680
I'm off.

445
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,000
Zhao.

446
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:37,799
I'm just next door, call me anytime
if you need anything.

447
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,160
I'm telling you,

448
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,680
if we close this big deal today,
we'll bring in at least two hundred million.

449
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,880
Both of you take a week off first.

450
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
[You there?]
Okay, thank you, boss.

451
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,200
Thank you, boss

452
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,359
This time, thanks to Yuhui's matchmaking

453
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,000
Are you still there? Has that person arrived?

454
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,880
The dishes ordered are also particularly good.

455
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,160
Have you tasted that shrimp?

456
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,640
Yes, I have, it's quite delicious.

457
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,160
I'm going to the restroom.

458
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,759
You're going again? My senior, are you okay?

459
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,160
Why aren't you replying to my messages?

460
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,312
I didn't look at my phone.

461
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,079
Seems like this person is not reliable.

462
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,920
He's so late and still not here.

463
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,519
Why come to this kind of blind date?

464
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,519
You can look after your junior.
Why can't I come for a blind date?

465
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,039
Can this be the same thing?

466
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,720
There's a very prestigious company
in phase two of the industrial park.

467
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,240
Tang Yuhui volunteered.

468
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,279
She said she had connections with that boss,
so I brought her along.

469
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,440
Zhao said

470
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,712
in our line of work, knowing one more person
means one more path.

471
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:01,359
That's why I came.

472
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,720
If you want more paths,
I can pave them with you.

473
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,039
No need for others.

474
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,680
I never thought about relying on you for work.

475
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,119
What I'm saying is not just about work.

476
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:19,528
[Tang Yuhui]

477
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,952
You continue.

478
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,880
You should hurry back, don't make her worry.

479
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
[Tang Yuhui]
My senior, are you okay?

480
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,400
I noticed you didn't look well just now.

481
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,920
Shall I accompany you to the hospital now?

482
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,104
It doesn't matter.

483
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:47,848
[Tang Yuhui]

484
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,039
Hello, I'm fine, I'll be back in a bit.

485
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,208
It's good that you're fine.

486
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:03,039
But my senior, when they ask about the contract,
I'm afraid I'll answer incorrectly.

487
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,680
I know, I'm coming over now.

488
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,920
We'll talk about it at home later.

489
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:17,680
I've looked it up online.

490
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,240
Menstruation can cause hormonal changes.

491
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,799
It's easy to let one's thoughts run wild.

492
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,440
Order something to eat first.
I'll pay the bill in a while.

493
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,640
Wait for me to come pick you up after I'm done.

494
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,336
Don't be angry.

495
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,640
I'll order the dishes.

496
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,680
Madam, please place your order.

497
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:00,232
Finally, it's done.

498
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,759
Is everything okay with Tu?

499
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,559
Shall I hurry over and take a look?

500
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,640
Come on, swipe this one.

501
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,160
Here, boy, give you a card.

502
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,168
Here, you have one too.

503
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,200
This money is not enough.

504
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,960
- That one has it for sure.
- Rao Jing?

505
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,319
I'll give you all of this everything to you.

506
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:17,839
If you swipe it, there is money for sure.

507
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,079
Ms. Rao, get up.

508
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,400
You have days when you drink too much.

509
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,584
Sir.

510
00:33:28,388 --> 00:33:30,359
[Bill]

511
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,519
Spent 8,000?

512
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,519
How long has she been drinking?

513
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,519
Two hours.

514
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,000
8,000 spent in two hours?

515
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,240
Well,

516
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,599
this lady's cards she took out
all show insufficient balance.

517
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,720
So now I have to pay this money?

518
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,640
Since the two of you are friends,

519
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,839
could you please…?

520
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,104
I can't.

521
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,559
Let go.

522
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,359
You pay.

523
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,640
Let go.

524
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,119
Look at this guy. It's clear he doesn't
want to take responsibility.

525
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,720
- Really not manly enough.
- Indeed.

526
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,000
Looks like a love her and leave her guy.

527
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,360
Wanting to leave the woman here by herself.

528
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,440
Truly shameless.

529
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,159
I shouldn't have come in.

530
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,960
Swipe it.

531
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,599
Swipe faster. I'll feel a bit better inside.

532
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,216
Thirsty.

533
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:26,280
- Thank you.
- Get her a glass of water.

534
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,296
Okay.

535
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,800
Pour me a glass of water too.

536
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,559
Take me home.

537
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,519
Any outfit on you

538
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,000
is worth 8,000 to 10,000.

539
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,280
In the last quarter the quarter before last,

540
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,639
you got quite a few bonuses.

541
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,239
How come a breakup leads to not being able
to afford even the money for drinks?

542
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,639
Why do you talk so much?

543
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,880
Who's heartbroken? What heartbreak?

544
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,760
Just be a tough talker.

545
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,320
The waiter just now told me

546
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,719
the one who came with you was a young boy.

547
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,719
He threw you down and left on his own.

548
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:21,320
That's not a boyfriend anyway.

549
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,440
It's just for fun to relieve boredom.

550
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,280
I apologize. I underestimated you before.

551
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,199
Keep a pond of fish just to relieve boredom.

552
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:36,400
You didn't think you are just someone
to relieve boredom in others' hearts?

553
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,239
Isn't it good to relieve boredom
with each other?

554
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,760
At least not alone, not lonely.

555
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,719
Zhao Fanggang, it's good to have you

556
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,199
arguing with me every day. It is much more fun.

557
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,119
I'm desperately

558
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,280
chasing after you.

559
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,239
It turns out I'm just there
to amuse and entertain you.

560
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:07,360
You're really underestimating me.

561
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,599
Zhao Fanggang, let me tell you.

562
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,960
It's your good fortune
that I amuse myself with you.

563
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,320
I thank you. Do you want
this good fortune or not?

564
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,199
Last time you left me at the subway station.

565
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:33,000
This time, I won't bother with you either.

566
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,320
No.

567
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,840
Come, I'll tell you my home address.

568
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,719
Did you remember it?

569
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,559
Are you drunk or not?

570
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:10,519
Anyway, when we get home, just tell me.

571
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:26,519
Taxi.

572
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,079
Looking forward to our formal cooperation.

573
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,824
- Let's make an appointment another day.
- Alright.

574
00:37:29,824 --> 00:37:32,168
- I'll go first.
- Alright.

575
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,368
Be careful.

576
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,880
My senior.

577
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,480
I'll leave first.

578
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,568
Be careful on the road.

579
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,568
Okay.

580
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,079
Ji Yuheng, am I overthinking?

581
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,880
But what if all my thoughts are true

582
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,800
and I've see through who your ideal is

583
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,559
and your subtle affections?

584
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,679
How can we get along after this?

585
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,639
Can our relationship continue?

586
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:31,519
Silly with just a smile.

587
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:37,079
That type like Tang Yuhui
must be Ji Yuheng's ideal, right?

588
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,472
Xiaoning.

589
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:52,199
Locked.

[His Ideal Type]

621

- Take a break first.
- Alright.

622
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,559
- You guys continue.
- How come Top Student Ji

623
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,360
was so amazing on the court today?

624
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,639
Do you think it's because someone
he likes is watching?

625
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:18,440
How outstanding must someone be
to be liked by him!

626
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,280
My senior, what kind of girl do you like?

627
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,639
High ponytail, with a hearty laugh.

628
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,880
High ponytail.

629
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,159
Isn't that just like you, the one he likes?

630
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:04,760
