[Episode 6]

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,120
Get out of the way.

33
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,400
We have a new colleague?

34
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,359
How should I know? I didn't receive any news.

35
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,400
Can you tell how tall he is?

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,519
How should I know?

37
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,359
Anyway, he looks tall and thin.

38
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,639
Looks like a neat man.

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,824
He's my type.

40
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,680
Look at the way he smiles.

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,520
A man who doesn't respect himself is terrible.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,520
He is smiling quite normally.

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,599
Mr. Zhao, are you satirizing someone?

44
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,080
I think he's better than someone.

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,680
Sadly,

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,199
someone can't attract any attention

47
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,800
from any woman.

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,240
Really? I am proudly single.

49
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,800
Qi Yu.

50
00:02:58,368 --> 00:02:59,439
Xiaoning.

51
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,824
It is you.

52
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:02,919
Long time no see.

53
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,360
What are you doing here?

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,560
- I'm here to--
- Qi Yu?

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,256
Mr. Ji.

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

57
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,680
He's not one of us.

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,464
Did the Bank President arrive
at the provincial branch last night?

59
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,879
- Yes, he did.
- Bank President?

60
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,199
- The Bank President will be away for days.
- Bank President?

61
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,719
He asked me to give you documents

62
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,719
and express his concern for you.

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,199
How's your arm doing?

64
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,439
Much better, thanks for his concern.

65
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,919
Okay, please come to my office.

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,759
Bank President? What's going on?

67
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,360
I'm the Bank President's new driver.
See you later.

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,464
Okay.

69
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Jing, here are the documents you wanted.

70
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,248
- Go back to work.
- Okay.

71
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,560
Xiaoning, you work here too.

72
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,319
I've been working for a while.

73
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,479
When did you come back?

74
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,919
Why did you come back?

75
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,080
You know why.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,360
Well, you…

77
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,600
I know what you're going to say.

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,319
But I want to take a chance.

79
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,199
Have you figured out what to do?

80
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,160
Turns out he's the Bank President's driver.

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,720
Yes.

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,839
Mr. Zhao.

83
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,920
You two…

84
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,800
There's a thing between you two.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,839
What?

86
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,279
Qi applied for the job because of you.

87
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,616
- No.
- No.

88
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:49,399
You got the wrong idea, Mr. Zhao.

89
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,680
Is it an office romance?

90
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,319
An office romance? You're quite bold.

91
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,839
It's exciting and romantic.

92
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,959
What are you talking about?

93
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,360
- I think he's funny.
- Yes.

94
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,000
- Why?
- Last time…

95
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,000
That's too bad.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,439
Send it to me.

97
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,839
I'll send it to you,

98
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,000
- Okay.
- Guys.

99
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,279
It's been an hour after the noon break.

100
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,879
You have left for so long.

101
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,879
Why? Did you have urgent work to do?

102
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,040
I left home in a hurry this morning

103
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
and didn't have time to use the toilet.
So I just did it.

104
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,639
All of you used the toilet for an hour?

105
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,759
I guess you drank a lot yesterday.

106
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,519
Xu Li, your client just came by.

107
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,560
But he couldn't find you, so I received him.

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,439
It's not allowed to happen again.

109
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,600
Come on. Say thank you to Mr. Ji.

110
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,959
Thank you.

111
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:13,879
Li Xiang, this is your third time being late
this week.

112
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,879
According to the rules,
half a month's bonus will be deducted.

113
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
If it happens again

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,680
you'll be transferred or fired.

115
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,560
How so? I'm a regular worker.

116
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,759
On what grounds should I leave my job?

117
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,160
As an employee,

118
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,399
you must abide by the bank's rules.

119
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,120
Mr. Ji, what exactly do you mean?

120
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,519
Mr. Ji, Li Xiang's home is far from here.

121
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,199
Sometimes he's late
for waiting for the elevator.

122
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,079
It's not intentional.

123
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,759
Mr. Ji, you talk about rules,
so let's follow the rules.

124
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,079
Now, it's working hours.

125
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,720
Guys, get back to work.

126
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,040
Zhao, thank you.

127
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,959
Who knows what will happen?

128
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,399
Zhao, I didn't mean
to put you in that position.

129
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,680
Alright, listen to me.

130
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,199
Let's all keep a low profile.

131
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,959
Don't let Mr. Ji get anything

132
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,992
on us.

133
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:31,552
Get back to work.

134
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:32,680
Don't be mad.

135
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,824
It's okay.

136
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,319
Grab your medical kit
and come up to the rooftop.

137
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,720
So, a new meeting place?

138
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,120
It's not safe to meet in the stairwell.

139
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,240
If necessary, we'll meet on the rooftop.

140
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,759
Why are you looking at me?

141
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,759
It's not safe to meet in the stairwell.

142
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,679
What do you mean? You knew about Qi Yu?

143
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,960
Know what? When you were chatting
with Qi Yu in the stairwell,

144
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,159
Zhao Fanggang and the others saw you two?

145
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,799
They said he's either your suitor
or ex-boyfriend?

146
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,039
That's nonsense.
He's not my suitor or ex-boyfriend.

147
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,559
There's nothing between Qi Yu and me.

148
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,639
It's a headache for me
to work with you in the same company.

149
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,240
Am I out of my mind?

150
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,840
Why do I work with my ex?

151
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,704
I know.

152
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,456
About what?

153
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,519
You used to be in one relationship.

154
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,440
I know you well. You can't have two exes

155
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,039
in one relationship.

156
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:19,620
It hurts.

157
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,640
You deserve it.

158
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:24,720
Do you enjoy this feeling?

159
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,919
The feeling about controlling others.

160
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,799
You know I have no relationship with Qi Yu.

161
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:32,240
Yet you still tease me.

162
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,840
You knew where Mr. Zhao went.

163
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,080
Yet you questioned him
and made an example out of him.

164
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,039
So you think I was scaring them?

165
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,759
Shouldn't Li Xiang and the others be blamed?

166
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,759
They should be.

167
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,039
But don't do it in public.

168
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,519
Otherwise, you'll not be convincing.

169
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,080
Mr. Zhao helped you out of the situation.

170
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,536
It's done.

171
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,960
Qi Yu's things are none of our business.

172
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,840
After all, we work at the same bank.

173
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,360
We still need to hide our relationship

174
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,200
from him.

175
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,679
He was your classmate?

176
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,799
More than that.
He's my best friend's ex-boyfriend.

177
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,984
I have no idea

178
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:25,840
what will happen when they meet.

179
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,279
Why is the business so good?

180
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,360
So many people.

181
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,759
Are they faking buyers?

182
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,279
Don't you know?

183
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,080
This store launched a group-buying deal
on a short video platform yesterday.

184
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,000
Buy two cheese cake, and get one free.
Today is the first day.

185
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,519
If I don't use the group-buying coupon,
I won't have to queue up, right?

186
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,120
Are you a big spender?
Everyone's lining up here.

187
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,200
Don't try to jump the queue.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,039
I have to give up.

189
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,624
I gotta go.

190
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:42,944
♫ Refresh my memory ♫

191
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:46,080
♫ I finally met you ♫

192
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,448
♫ We used to share so many ♫

193
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:53,248
♫ Unforgettable memories ♫

194
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:57,640
♫ I've been expecting to see you again ♫

195
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,799
You must be hungry. Eat.

196
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,816
♫ I've never forgotten ♫

197
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:07,556
♫ About you ♫

198
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:11,168
♫ As time goes by ♫

199
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:14,752
♫ I start to realize ♫

200
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:16,992
♫ How much I miss you ♫

201
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:22,280
♫ I remember it as if it was yesterday ♫

202
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,600
I'm sorry about before.

203
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,888
My parents wanted me
to find a job in my hometown.

204
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:26,960
And I didn't want to disappoint them.

205
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,600
So I neglected your feelings. I'm sorry.

206
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,240
It's not your fault.

207
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,320
There's not just one path to choose in life.

208
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,200
You made your choice. What's wrong with that?

209
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,232
I made a mistake.

210
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,399
I thought I could balance things between us…

211
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,039
Weiyi, I found a job
in the building where you work.

212
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:07,320
It's stable.
We won't be in a long-distance relationship.

213
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,279
Whenever you need me, I'll always be there.

214
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,200
No wonder Xiaoning called me.

215
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
You ran into her at the company?

216
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,399
I joined Dairui as the Bank President's driver.

217
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,399
I can tell you all you want to know.

218
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,680
You must be hungry.
Do you want to eat something?

219
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,720
I bought you your favorite food.

220
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,360
How do you know I'm hungry?

221
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,919
I heard from Xiaoning
that you took the day off to rest at home.

222
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,600
You always forget to eat at home.

223
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,640
Irregular daily routine.

224
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,664
How could I not know?

225
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,840
You know me so well.

226
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,159
You should know I can't come back to you.

227
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,919
Qi Yu, I've gotten over you.

228
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,720
I admit I was waiting for you to regret it
and come back to me.

229
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:12,120
But now, you mean nothing to me.

230
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,799
Sir, it's your shift today?

231
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,799
Yes.

232
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,679
- Have a cigarette.
- No.

233
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,679
Take it. Feel free to take it.

234
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,440
- Just take it.
- Thanks.

235
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,159
How have you been?

236
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:54,039
I'm good. There are many visitors.

237
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,072
Mr. Wu's car is over there.

238
00:14:58,304 --> 00:14:59,360
Thanks.

239
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,416
You're welcome.

240
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,080
Are you wondering why I talked
to the industrial park's gatekeeper?

241
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,679
After all, he's not associated

242
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,519
with the businesses.

243
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,600
I am indeed curious.

244
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,159
[Industrial Park]
The guard room is a hub of news.

245
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:17,824
The security guard knows
about people's vehicles here,

246
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:20,080
their entry and exit times,

247
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,600
and even their personalities.

248
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,279
But I remember
this man is not interested in loans.

249
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:31,399
I know what you're thinking.

250
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,919
He could need loans in the future.

251
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,200
We can often visit him to impress him.

252
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,840
He will come to you when he's in need.

253
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,080
Very clever. You can't rush marketing.

254
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,759
Even top companies

255
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,519
could face cash flow problems.

256
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,720
We have to learn to play the long game.

257
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,896
It's almost mealtime. Just grab something.

258
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:05,960
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

259
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,976
You're welcome.

260
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,960
So, you can't wait
to learn the business from me

261
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,919
just to prepare for the test, right?

262
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,679
I'm taking online courses

263
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:25,519
on business in my off-time.

264
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,519
But I found I lacked practical experience.

265
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,679
So my understanding is not sufficient.

266
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:33,759
You're right.
You have to change on the fly in marketing.

267
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,960
Taking notes is useless. Use your brain.

268
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,919
Mr. Zhao, I know
you're not obliged to teach me.

269
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:43,519
But you patiently explained to me.

270
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,399
I've followed you around the park all day.

271
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,159
I've learned quite a lot in practice.
Thank you.

272
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,279
You're welcome. Here.

273
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,840
When I joined Dairui,

274
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,200
a senior taught me hands-on.

275
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,120
Now, I'm your senior.

276
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,279
Shouldn't I teach you as well?

277
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,000
If you really want to thank me,

278
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,720
don't call me Mr. Zhao anymore.
It's too formal.

279
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,920
Just call me Zhao.

280
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,952
The Bank President's driver is your boyfriend?

281
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,039
No, he's not.

282
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,079
You liar. I think you two are a good match.

283
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,000
But you have to keep a low profile.

284
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,319
It's an office romance.

285
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,519
He isn't my boyfriend.

286
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,519
Listen to me, it's good not to admit it.

287
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:38,480
So you won't get caught
by that person and be criticized.

288
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,519
Being late costs half a month's bonus.

289
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,400
If he discovers your office romance,

290
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,200
you'll end up being fined

291
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,680
or fired. That's possible.

292
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,920
You mean Mr. Ji?

293
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't think he's that kind of person.

294
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,920
How do you know?

295
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Are you his girlfriend, or what?

296
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,160
You're a rookie in the workplace.

297
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,624
Let's go.

298
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,759
Here. I made coffee for you.

299
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:27,160
Try it. Does it suit your taste?

300
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,359
This morning, I took your student
to the industrial park.

301
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,559
She's clever.

302
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,799
Anyway, today,

303
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,799
I'll have one new client

304
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,216
this month.

305
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:42,279
Did you hear the news?

306
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:45,519
The bank has started
to investigate the matchmaking loans.

307
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,519
I helped, didn't I?

308
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,592
Will I get rewarded?

309
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:51,759
For what?

310
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,640
I submitted the core evidence.

311
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,599
It directly exposed Qian Li Yuan.

312
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,119
I left them no room for denial.

313
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,200
Do you mean the blank contracts without stamps?

314
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,920
Are you kidding me?

315
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,799
Seems like you're not convinced.

316
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,720
I think your recordings are not convincing.

317
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,496
If they fired the employee who received you,

318
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:13,559
claiming that employee doesn't exist,
what can you do?

319
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,599
However, you did make an effort.

320
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,480
I'll put in a good word for you.
Remember to drink the coffee.

321
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,720
Tu, don't worry.

322
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,559
I'll speak well of you to Mr. Ji later.

323
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,000
Does my student need your help?

324
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,960
I'm talking about the matchmaking loans.

325
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,056
Although I submitted the core evidence--

326
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,144
Jing.

327
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:43,160
Hurry.

328
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,960
Alright, excuse me, Zhao.

329
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,400
I submitted the core evidence,

330
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,000
but you were involved too.

331
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,559
When Mr. Ji asks me about it,

332
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,279
I will emphasize your role.

333
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,759
Unlocked.

334
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,864
I'm back.

335
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,880
You're back.

336
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,519
How come you cook
when your injury hasn't healed?

337
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,160
Just a small injury.

338
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,519
Wash your hands. Dinner is ready.

339
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,039
Sweet and sour pork.

340
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,279
You can make this dish?

341
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,559
Have a try and see if it suits your taste.

342
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,680
Okay.

343
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,519
How is it?

344
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,400
Delicious. It's authentic.

345
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,119
Did you make it
because I like sweet and sour pork?

346
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,799
What a coincidence.
It happens to be your favorite.

347
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,000
What do you like to eat?
I'll make a note of it.

348
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,400
So I can cook for you.

349
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,599
I'm not picky with food.

350
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,440
Gao.

351
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,400
I have avoided being defrauded.

352
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,960
Luckily, you warned me

353
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,640
to seize the chance
to negotiate with Qian Li Yuan.

354
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,008
If they go bankrupt,

355
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:05,039
I can't get my money back.

356
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,599
Anyway, thank you.

357
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,400
You're welcome. If you're in need,

358
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,119
feel free to ask me for help.

359
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,799
I was too impulsive before.

360
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,640
I hurt Mr. Ji, so I want to apologize to him.

361
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,880
That's alright.
You don't need to take it to heart.

362
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,759
Mr. Ji is a forgiving man.

363
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,440
He won't be angry with you.

364
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,240
Oh, right, and Mr. Zhao.

365
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,160
He also called to comfort me.

366
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,279
And he helped me solve a personal problem.

367
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,279
Please thank him for me.

368
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,880
Okay, I'll do that.

369
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,200
Alright, thank you.

370
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

371
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,032
It's Gao. Gao told me--

372
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,599
He got his money back.

373
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,559
And Zhao Fanggang helped him a lot.

374
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,960
He wants to apologize to me.

375
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,519
Did you hear it all?

376
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,480
Have you met him or called him?

377
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,839
You've known all this already?

378
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,039
Why didn't you tell me?

379
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,559
It's better to hear your words

380
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,519
of thanks personally, right?

381
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,880
Yes, it is.

382
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,839
But it's not just about his matter.

383
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,640
Things settle down

384
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,279
in the Development Department Division One.

385
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,960
After all, Zhao worked so hard

386
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,759
to resolve issues properly.

387
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,480
Everyone doesn't have to work
in a scary situation.

388
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,400
Let's eat.

389
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,799
The bank has found the truth about Qian Li Yuan

390
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,960
and checked other similar consumer loans.

391
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,240
Thank you all.

392
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,079
The issue was dealt with promptly.

393
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,519
Ms. Rao played a positive role.

394
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,759
She set an example for us.

395
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,279
Next, I will announce the results

396
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,799
of this matter.

397
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,799
For Zhao Fanggang,

398
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,400
the handler of the matchmaking loans,

399
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,319
he will be criticized by Division One.

400
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:15,839
This month's bonus will be reduced
by 30 percent.

401
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,240
Additionally, transfer five clients.

402
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,519
You blame me and deduct my salary? Why?

403
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,599
Can you explain it to me?

404
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,920
I've made it clear. No explanation.

405
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,720
Mr. Jiang initiated the matchmaking loans.

406
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
You know that, right?

407
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,880
You asked me to investigate it, and I did it.

408
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,319
That's a fact, right?

409
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,680
I don't need your praise.

410
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,519
But you just gave me a hard time
at the meeting.

411
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,519
I can't figure out why, so I have to ask you.

412
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,559
You didn't initiate the matchmaking loans,

413
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,720
but you were the responsible person.
You're to blame.

414
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,759
What? Mr. Ji, you can't say that.

415
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:57,279
I'm responsible, but I resolved it.

416
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,880
I dealt with the issue.

417
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,640
I got implicated.

418
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,559
I have done a lot to make amends.

419
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:07,519
You got implicated.
You're not the only one implicated.

420
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,960
It's the whole Division One.

421
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:14,720
Alright, I see.

422
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,720
You're determined to pin the blame on me.

423
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,400
You did it all at the meeting

424
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,559
just to annoy and embarrass me

425
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,720
and show them who calls the shots.

426
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,119
That's why you were so angry?

427
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,839
Zhao Fanggang, if you have a complaint,

428
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,839
you can report it to the superiors.

429
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,039
How would I dare to?

430
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,960
Today you just criticized me.

431
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,440
Tomorrow you could fire me.

432
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,119
But remember.

433
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,312
I have been in Division One
for nearly eight years.

434
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:51,680
I know what I can do.

435
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,240
We work at the same place.

436
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,079
Who knows what will happen?

437
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,119
Let's raise our glasses for Zhao.

438
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,240
Come on.

439
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,440
Zhao, he's so shameless.

440
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,079
This was over the line.

441
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,136
I feel bad for you.

442
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,319
Zhao.

443
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,240
I'm a coward, Tu. I'm too weak

444
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,559
I'm bullied. It's so embarrassing.

445
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,279
Sometimes, you--

446
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,359
I can't be a laughing stock. I get it.

447
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,799
I became a laughing stock.

448
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,160
No, buddy.

449
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,480
This is on me. I'll order more drinks.

450
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,839
- Thanks, Zhao.
- Come on.

451
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,759
Thanks.

452
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,000
Waiter.

453
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,839
Hello?

454
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,168
Group buying?

455
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:02,279
No, but we have special offers.

456
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:06,119
Cocktails are half-price if you order
three sets or more. It's a great deal.

457
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,480
I'll take three sets.

458
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,720
Okay.

459
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,240
Folks, let's drink something fancy.

460
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,680
Cocktails B-52, three sets.

461
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,024
- Zhao is generous.
- So generous.

462
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:22,079
- Zhao.
- Bottoms up.

463
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,119
Bottoms up.

464
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,480
[Mom]
I'll drink up.

465
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,039
- Drink from a bottle.
- Come on.

466
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,640
Hello, mom, what's up?

467
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,559
Xiaoning, where are you?

468
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,839
I'm at a party with colleagues. What's up?

469
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,559
Today is Ji's mom's last day of treatment.

470
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,119
Aren't you going to the hospital?

471
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,920
Mom, how do you know?

472
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,400
We've been wanting to visit her.

473
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,000
Today is her last day of treatment.

474
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
She just let us know.

475
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
How about this? I'll head over now.

476
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,240
See you at the hospital.

477
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,279
Alright.

478
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,304
Alrighty, bye-bye.

479
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,672
Is that Rao Jing?

480
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,559
The one in a red dress.

481
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,759
Is that Jing?

482
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,856
Yes, that's Jing.

483
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,599
She's with a new guy, right?

484
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,519
Zhao, I have to go.

485
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,000
Someone in my family is ill in hospital.

486
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,920
Sorry, I have to go.

487
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,799
- Go ahead.
- Bye-bye.

488
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,440
- Be safe on the road.
- Be safe.

489
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,039
Jing looks hot.

490
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,319
Oh, my gosh.

491
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,376
Come on.

492
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,240
You've been working all day.
You don't have to come.

493
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,359
It's okay, madam.

494
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,440
Mom.

495
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,568
Let me do it.

496
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,272
It's bruised.

497
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,216
Xiaoning.

498
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,480
Is Yuheng usually very quiet?

499
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,296
No.

500
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,119
Let me tell you.

501
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:52,400
He keeps everything to himself.

502
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,720
If he makes you angry, you should tell him.

503
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,039
Don't keep it to yourself.

504
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:03,000
A couple needs to communicate well.

505
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,279
We're good now.

506
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,839
Mom, don't overthink it.

507
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,119
You two are already married.

508
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,759
How come Xiaoning has no ring?

509
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,119
Yuheng, in my bedroom, there is a gift box

510
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:29,559
in the bottom drawer of the nightstand.

511
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,519
Couple rings for you.

512
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:39,440
I should have bought you a diamond ring.

513
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,720
When you have time, you buy it yourself.
I give you the money.

514
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,200
Actually, I've always wanted
to give you a gift.

515
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,319
But I didn't know
whether you prefer bracelets or necklaces.

516
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,359
And I didn't dare to ask Yuheng.

517
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,079
It's not necessary, mom. I don't want gifts.

518
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:06,720
Mom, the immunotherapy course is quite long.

519
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
How do you feel?

520
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,319
Much better, here's something I want to say.

521
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,759
After a while, I'll go home. Is that okay?

522
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:23,119
Of course, that's great.

523
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,440
You can live in my…

524
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:32,720
No, I mean you can live in our bedroom.

525
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,839
Okay.

526
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,839
Why did you call me out?

527
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,400
Are you upset about Zhao Fanggang's matter?

528
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,519
Deduct his bonus and transfer five clients.

529
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,279
It's not severe punishment.

530
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:54,039
Is it not?

531
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:56,880
If it happens to you for no reason--

532
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,279
For no reason?

533
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,039
Zhao Fanggang knows the situation very well.

534
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,559
Still, there should be a proper way to do it.

535
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,240
You just punished him severely.

536
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,319
It's like you were using Zhao
to make your mark and vent your anger.

537
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:12,799
Fine, I get it now.

538
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,680
So in your mind, you think

539
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,079
I ignored Zhao Fanggang's feelings

540
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,079
when dealing with this matter.

541
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,880
Xiaoning, what I value at work is efficiency.

542
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,079
If I think

543
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:25,640
about everybody's feelings,

544
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,519
how can I do my work?

545
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,160
So you think you did nothing wrong, right?

546
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,279
Indeed, you don't like explaining things.

547
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,960
How can I expect you

548
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,839
to tell us what you're thinking?

549
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,519
What we think doesn't matter to you.

550
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,799
That's not what I mean. You can't--

551
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,920
Can't what? Make a big fuss?

552
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,720
Mr. Ji, I finally get it.

553
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,200
I don't understand you at all.

554
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,920
I think we're emotional.

555
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,319
Let's calm down and leave that on one side.

556
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,799
Xiaoning and Ji?

557
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah.

558
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Are they quarreling?

559
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,559
They are quarreling.

560
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,960
What are you nervous about?

561
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,359
It's quite normal, isn't it?

562
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,720
What should we do now?

563
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,039
What's wrong?

564
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,119
We asked the kid

565
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,200
to take us to meet Ji's mom.

566
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,440
Now they are going in opposite directions.

567
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,559
No worries, we can go up ourselves.

568
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,640
Is that okay?

569
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,160
What's wrong with that?

570
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,584
Besides, we've bought things and made soup.

571
00:32:41,412 --> 00:32:43,432
Let's go.

572
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,079
Actually, we've long wanted to visit you.

573
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,519
But we hear you're not in good health.

574
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,240
You have been receiving treatment.

575
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,920
- The treatment works.
- Yes.

576
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,119
You look great.

577
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,759
Thank you for coming.

578
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,240
I'm truly sorry.

579
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,079
It doesn't matter.

580
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,519
I've been sick.

581
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,960
Two kids have been married,

582
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,119
but we just met now.

583
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,359
It's not too late to meet now.

584
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Mrs. Tu, Yuheng has been introverted

585
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,599
since he was little.

586
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,480
He's silent and not sensible.

587
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,559
If he's caused any trouble or made you angry,

588
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,119
please forgive him.

589
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,839
Not at all, Ji is sensible.

590
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:44,559
Yes, I can tell he's well-educated.

591
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,640
- A good kid.
- He's polite.

592
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,400
Yes.

593
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,160
I'm relieved.

594
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,880
But still, I'm a bit worried.

595
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,279
They just got married.

596
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,920
I'm afraid they won't adjust well.

597
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,519
Xiaoning just slipped and said something.

598
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,679
They are sleeping in separate rooms.

599
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,559
- Try this dish.
- It's so tender.

600
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,079
The vegetables are so fresh and tender.

601
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,159
Alright, do it yourself.

602
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,760
Did you come back alone today? Where's Ji?

603
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,400
He's busy. Leaders are always quite busy.

604
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Don't help your dad. You have some soup.

605
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,960
Have some soup.

606
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,840
I've just changed the bedsheet

607
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
and duvet cover for you.

608
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,320
Why don't you stay tonight?

609
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,280
What? The room--

610
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,400
It's clean.

611
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,199
Right? I've tidied up her room.

612
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,559
That's what I mean.

613
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:08,096
Your mom has cleaned it up.

614
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:09,152
Sure.

615
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:11,559
You haven't stayed here since you got married.

616
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,360
Your room is empty.

617
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,400
Stay and keep your mom company.

618
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,840
Mom, if you miss me,
I can stay for a few more days.

619
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,079
Sure, you must try this dish.

620
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,920
Your dad made this.

621
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,280
He just learned to cook it. It's delicious.

622
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,992
He made it for the first time. You try it.

623
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:31,000
Is she taking a nap?

624
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,079
I thought you asked them here

625
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,000
to get them to make up?

626
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,800
That's what I wanted.

627
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,079
Who knew Xiaoning would come back without Ji?

628
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,440
It means she's not comfortable being with Ji.

629
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
Leave her alone.

630
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,000
Couples need to communicate after a fight.

631
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,064
No worries.

632
00:35:56,064 --> 00:35:58,719
Ji, as a man, should solve problems

633
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:01,079
I can't push my daughter to do that.

634
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,159
If both of them do nothing,
I fear they will break up.

635
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,880
What if they act impulsively

636
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,559
and end up getting a divorce?

637
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:10,519
Don't be silly. Is that serious?

638
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,679
Shut your mouth. Fold this for me.

639
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,079
Young people

640
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,599
don't take marriage and divorce that seriously.

641
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,840
Split the assets

642
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,320
and be single again.

643
00:36:36,932 --> 00:36:39,936
♫ Say something to myself ♫

644
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:43,520
♫ Among these memories ♫

645
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,096
♫ Life is not always smooth sailing ♫

646
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:53,088
♫ Say something to myself ♫

647
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:56,832
♫ I know you've tried your best ♫

648
00:36:56,832 --> 00:37:02,916
♫ Don't be afraid, just be yourself ♫

649
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,568
♫ Another way ♫

650
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:08,832
♫ Nothing seems so perfect ♫

651
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:13,056
♫ Although the past can't replay ♫

652
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:16,224
♫ I'm always here to stay ♫

653
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:18,816
♫ Till you say ♫

654
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:22,048
♫ The strongest part of you ♫

655
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,952
♫ Nothing can defeat you ♫

656
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,744
♫ I know ♫

657
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:32,488
♫ Time heals everything ♫

658
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,552
♫ Say something to myself ♫

659
00:37:39,552 --> 00:37:43,296
♫ Among these memories ♫

660
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:49,416
♫ Life is not always smooth sailing ♫

661
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:59,599
Why not eat something while it's hot?

662
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,639
Meeting you is already a betrayal.

663
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,760
If I eat your food,

664
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
it'll be a bribe.

665
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,159
Please don't misunderstand.

666
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,559
I'm not trying to buy you.

667
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:14,840
You know my situation with Xiaoning.

668
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,119
I just want to seek your advice.

669
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,320
What on earth is she thinking about?

670
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,440
The two of you are dating.

671
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,159
One of the closest relationships.

672
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:31,760
You should ask her yourself.

673
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,000
No, if she's always emotional,

674
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,840
I can't tell what her true feelings are.

675
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,559
You seem to be sincere. Go ahead.

676
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,039
You know she's been upset with me lately.

677
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:52,280
It's because of the matter with Zhao Fanggang.

678
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,400
And then?

679
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,599
I just want to know

680
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,000
why she cares so much
about Zhao Fanggang's matter.

681
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,920
Do you think she cares

682
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,800
about Zhao Fanggang?

683
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,719
Doesn't she?

684
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,320
You don't even know why Xiaoning is mad?

685
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,039
You deserved to be dumped.

686
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:10,599
Whether she's angry or disappointed,

687
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,360
it has nothing to do with that colleague.

688
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,840
It must be because of your personality

689
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,480
and your way of handling things.

690
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,104
Got it?

691
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:24,079
Basically, you make her feel insecure.

692
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,360
Insecure?

693
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,360
Yes, think about it. You're her leader at work.

694
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,840
But it's not a simple relationship.

695
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,960
Your every move has a great impact

696
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,239
on her.

697
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,159
You asserted your authority at the office.

698
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,760
The colleagues got the wrong idea,
and you didn't help explain.

699
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,719
You dealt with Zhao Fanggang

700
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:46,199
in a stubborn way.

701
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,320
These things happened.

702
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Think about how she will feel.

703
00:39:50,912 --> 00:39:52,079
Anyway, if I were her,

704
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,599
I'd think you are stubborn,

705
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,079
arrogant, and inconsiderate.

706
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,719
I'd regret seeing you and would've dumped you.

707
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,880
No, I…

708
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,199
And most importantly, you don't talk.

709
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:10,039
Being silent is a taboo in a relationship.

710
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,239
You're in trouble.

711
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,880
Didn't you say it was a bribe?

712
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,440
Yes, if I said nothing.

713
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,559
I'm helping Xiaoning with her love matters.

714
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,680
This is what I deserve.

715
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,088
It's quite tasty.

716
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,400
Look at him.

717
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,119
Look how young your dad was.

718
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,360
Your dad and I got married quickly.

719
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,039
We got married less than a week after meeting.

720
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:45,199
I became a wife for the first time.

721
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,079
And he became a husband for the first time.

722
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,880
So we didn't adjust well.

723
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,320
Feels like someone

724
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,400
suddenly becomes a part of your life

725
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,719
and disrupts all your life habits.

726
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,079
You know what? Back then,

727
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,880
I liked to get up early,
while your dad liked to sleep late.

728
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,360
We had totally different living habits.

729
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,519
We never had breakfast together
for the first three months.

730
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:09,639
I remember before I went to school,

731
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,159
my dad made breakfast for me

732
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,920
We had adjusted well before that

733
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,360
by arguing with him.

734
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,960
But dad didn't dare to argue with you.

735
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,199
Ever since I can remember,

736
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:23,559
my dad has always been doing

737
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,519
what you say.

738
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,559
Couples argue.

739
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,960
Isn't it normal for couples

740
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,880
to have disagreements?

741
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,760
The key is to solve problems seriously.

742
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,679
So, don't you tell me
about what's going on with you and Ji?

743
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,599
I've heard about it from Ji's mom.

744
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,719
You two sleep in separate rooms.

745
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,519
There is a big change in life.

746
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,079
It's normal to feel unaccustomed.

747
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,639
You can get used to it

748
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:12,840
step by step.

749
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,039
But you must figure out

750
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,920
where the problems lie between you.

751
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,239
I just think that he

752
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,719
and I are going too fast in this relationship.

753
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:28,519
I'm afraid I haven't thought it through.

754
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,719
Life is full of small things.

755
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,280
You can't figure out everything.

756
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,599
I think

757
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,880
if the two of you have decided to be together,

758
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,880
then try to make a good life.

759
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,392
If one day you can't be with him,

760
00:42:51,392 --> 00:42:53,239
just get a divorce.

761
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,360
A divorce?

762
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,360
It's no big deal.

763
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,440
You can start a new relationship if you want.

764
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,360
Otherwise, just move back in with us.

765
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,440
Just like now, living with mom and dad.

766
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,159
But I don't think

767
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,559
my daughter will give up

768
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:15,920
or back down easily.

769
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,440
Mom, are you persuading me

770
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,039
to keep moving forward, right?

771
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:26,320
You have the courage to forge ahead

772
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,199
and the confidence to retreat when necessary.

773
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:32,519
Your dad and I are your support.

774
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,599
But if you back down,

775
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,039
remember to pay the living expenses monthly.

776
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:41,039
Living expenses?

777
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:43,880
But I never paid before.

778
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,400
So make up for it.

779
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,592
No.

780
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:28,040
[Take It Seriously]

781
00:44:29,508 --> 00:44:31,784
[Sweet and sour pork is delicious, isn't it?]

782
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:34,880
Sweet and sour pork?

783
00:44:40,128 --> 00:44:42,024
[How to make sweet and sour pork]

784
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:09,896
Come on.

785
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,008
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

786
00:45:32,008 --> 00:45:35,108
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

787
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:40,268
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

788
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:44,452
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

789

♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

790
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,852
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

791
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:56,164
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

792
00:45:56,164 --> 00:46:03,044
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

793
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:07,268
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

794
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:12,004
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

00:46:12,004 --> 00:46:15,140
♫ To you and no one else ♫

796
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,972

♫ I hope you know ♫

801
00:46:33,316 --> 00:46:39,908
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

802
00:46:39,908 --> 00:46:45,348
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

803
00:46:45,348 --> 00:46:52,100
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

804
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,356
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

805
00:46:56,356 --> 00:47:01,508

♫ To you and no one else ♫

807
00:47:04,452 --> 00:47:09,124
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

808
00:47:09,124 --> 00:47:11,556
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

809
