A set of gold is so expensive.

I plan to treat it as a family
heirloom and pass it down.

78
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,519

00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:03,160
So, Mrs. Ji, how do you plan to pass it on?

If I have a daughter, I'll use it as her dowry.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,920
If I have a son, I'll pass it on
to my daughter-in-law.

82
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,759
That won't do. This was bought for you alone.

Now you remember to call me honey.

89
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,759
I'm just not used to it yet. Sorry.

90
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,759
Well, that means I get a reward.

Let's go home.

95
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,000
The bridal photoshoot he booked
allows you to choose a total of four outfits.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,879
He has made his choice.

97
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,360
He has? I didn't see much of a difference.

98
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,519
It's still the set from before.

99
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,279
They are all black suits, but different styles.

100
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,519
Honestly, your husband is very handsome.

101
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,439
His looks and figure are impeccable.

102
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,879
Have you been together since you were students?

103
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,519
He had a crush on me back then.

104
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,560
But I hadn't taken a fancy to him yet.

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,759
Oh my, he must have been god-like
in his student days, right?

106
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,600
And to think he had had a crush on someone.

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,920
It wasn't just a crush in our school days.

108
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,800
After we started working,

109
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,240
I created some coincidences
to meet her at matchmaking events.

110
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,879
I truly loved deeply, with great sincerity.

111
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,519
So, I was moved by you

112
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,519
and took you in.

113

118
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,079
Madam, why don't you try this one?

119
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,639
Couples who have been together
since their student days

120
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,399
really like this style. There's a contrast.

121
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,480
I think it's a bit sexy.

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,720
I don't really want to reveal that much.

123
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,279
Why not try it on? You never know.

124
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:17,888
♫ The wind blew across the crowded street ♫

125

I feel a bit weird.

129
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:33,320
Not at all.

130
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,440
Indeed, a handsome guy should be
matched with a beautiful woman.

131
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,120
Yeah, these two standing together
are really a sight for sore eyes.

132
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,159
It's still a bit too revealing.

133
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,159
Perhaps a different one?

134
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,559
I think it looks quite nice. Do you like it?

135
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,759
You like it. Then let's go with this set.

137
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,559
Then we'll settle on this set.

♫ Even if the moon sets and the stars move ♫

151
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:36,360
I like it.

I'm a bit tired.

153
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,320
You're tired from trying them on?

154
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,440
What about taking wedding photos?

155
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,039
It's more exhausting
than running through five parks.

156
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,159
If you're so tired today,

157
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,799
what are we going to do
about taking photos tomorrow?

158
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,240
Then you'll just have to drag me.

159
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
Alright, let me recharge you.

160
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
You can do it, Mrs. Ji!

161
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Isn't it just an appreciation banquet?

162
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,960
Why do we need to sleep apart a day in advance?

163
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,440
What's the matter, can't sleep?

164
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,799
You have to admit, it's strange.

165
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,159
I used to come back to stay often,
every now and then.

166
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,879
Staying for a few days
didn't seem like a big deal.

167
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,799
But why do I especially miss you today?

168
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,519
Is this your rebellious phase?

169
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,879
No, I just miss you.

170
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,312
I miss you too.

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,759
Why don't you come out to the balcony?

172
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,688
Balcony.

173
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
What are you doing here?

174
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,336
To see you.

175
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,240
I want to go down and hug you now.

176
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I'll wait for you.

177
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,624
Wait for me, okay?

178
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,799
How do you know me so well?

179
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:37,399
You knew that I would miss you
so much I couldn't sleep.

180
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,480
Silly, of course, I know you.

181
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:56,896
[Mom]

182
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,480
Mom.

183
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,440
It's true, a grown daughter
can't be kept at home.

184
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,960
It's just for one night.

185
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,320
Look at you acting as if it's
a parting of life and death.

186
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,000
Isn't this just because I have
a good relationship with your son-in-law?

187
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,159
Weren't you the same with my dad
when you were young?

188
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,440
You must have been very close to my dad too.

189
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,480
Tu.

190
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,840
Have you been talking nonsense
to your daughter again?

191
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
I'll take care of you later.

192
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,720
I… I mean, what did I say?

193
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,919
Stop being so lovey-dovey over there.

194
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,000
Get back here quickly.

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,440
There's a pile of work to do at work tomorrow.

196
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,120
Hey, Mom, we hear you.

197
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,440
Xiaoning will go back in a while.

198
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,200
Ji, be careful on your way, huh?

199
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,360
I will. Good night.

200
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,504
Good night.

201
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,240
She's not there.

202
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,399
My mom really likes you.

203
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,399
She speaks to you so gently.

204
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,159
It's because I'm likable.

205
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,919
Alright, it's too late today.

206
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,919
Go back and rest early.

207
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,919
Come pick me up earlier tomorrow.

208
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,960
I'll come at the earliest time.

209
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,976
Come over when you wake up.

210
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:05,096
Okay.

211
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,320
Hurry back.

212
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,639
Then I'm leaving.

213
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,639
Good night.

214
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,720
- Good night.
- Good night.

215
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,760
Sleep well.

216
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:40,519
Appreciation banquet, and you're invited, Zhao.

217
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,440
Brother, congratulations to you.

218
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,480
Let me tell you, Tu.

219
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,559
You never drink juice
when you socialize on a regular basis.

220
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,840
Today's a big happy day.
You've got to have a drink at least.

221
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,879
I really can't drink today.

222
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,928
Why?

223
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:55,072
That's what I'm saying.

224
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,759
Special circumstances.

225
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,856
What special circumstances?

226
00:13:57,856 --> 00:13:59,424
Are you having your period or what?

227
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:00,519
What are you talking about?

228
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,960
Well, Zhao, today is his special day.

229
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,519
What if he drinks too much
and makes a fool of himself?

230
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,799
Come, I'll drink with you. Come on.

231
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,519
Alright. Uncle, here's a toast to you.

232
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,039
The baby's moving, so energetic.

233
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,639
Dad, I'm actually not worried
about making a fool of myself.

234
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,080
It's because Xiaoning and I
are planning for pregnancy.

235
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:30,912
Really? No way!

236
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,000
Really, Mom.

237
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,919
That's fantastic! Your dad and I
never dared to rush you two.

238
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,440
We thought maybe you two wanted
to enjoy some couple's time alone.

239
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,919
But in our hearts, we've been
longing for a grandson.

240
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,399
A granddaughter would be nice too.

241
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,960
Right. Both are fine, all is good.

242
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,840
This is good news. Let's all
have a drink together then.

243
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,200
- Come on.
- Cheers.

244
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,679
- Good news, good news.
- Congratulations!

245
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,799
- Cheers.
- Come on, come on, come on.

246
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,028
Come on, come on, come on.

247
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:01,384
[Joy]

248
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:12,576
♫ As time goes by, I fall for you ♫

249
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:15,552
♫ As I feel the warmth in your palms,
I fall for you ♫

250
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:19,336
♫ Parallel kite strings take a turn ♫

251
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,679
Look what you've done in the early morning,

252
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,879
insisting on taking wedding pictures
before going to work.

253
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,720
- But…
- We're in such a rush.

254
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,120
Sorry, bro, no worries.

255
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,919
They only have time in the morning.
This is the only free time.

256
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,039
Besides, we're in a hurry
to get back and go to work, aren't we?

257
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,399
It's a good thing that the photographer
was recommended by my friend.

258
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,120
Otherwise, he wouldn't bother
coming out to take pictures for us.

259
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,200
Hurry up. We need to go to work.

260
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Sorry about that.

261
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,759
Alright, are the two newlyweds ready?

262
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,480
Buddy, make sure to photograph
my wife beautifully, okay?

263
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,799
Don't worry. Trust my skills.

264
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,360
Look here, good.

265
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Keep smiling, good, right.

266
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,320
Be happier, a little closer.

267
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,000
That's a bit too close.

268
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,320
Our wedding photo would be
inappropriate if we get any closer.

269
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
- Be serious.
- Good, right.

270
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,519
Look at me, come on, smile.

271
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,639
Good, not bad. Let's take a few more.

272
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,759
- Okay.
- This way, we have options.

273
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,480
Can I, can I pose a bit?

274
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,919
What kind of pose do you want
for a wedding photo?

275
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,200
Posing for a portrait is fine.

276
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,679
Next time, pay me to take your portrait.

277
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,424
- Okay.
- Okay, okay, let's go.

278
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,759
Ladies, here's the thing.

279
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,240
You see, we're using a digital camera.

280
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,320
People tend to look slightly heavier in photos.

281
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,759
But don't worry, we can fix it
in post-production.

282
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,519
Man, what are you talking about?

283
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,600
My wife has never been overweight.
She doesn't need editing.

284
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,240
Alright, alright.

285
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,080
For the wedding dress photo,
let's go to Provence.

286
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,672
You see, I do look heavy in that photo.

287
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:49,879
That can't be.

288
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,559
Have I gotten fatter after getting pregnant?

289
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,639
No, on the contrary, I think
you've slimmed down recently.

290
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,320
I'll make you some good dishes later
to help you gain some weight.

291
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,440
Look at how defined your jawline is now.

292
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,096
I've definitely gained weight.

293
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:05,119
No.

294
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,720
Then why did the photographer tell me

295
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,640
that digital cameras make people look fatter?

296
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
And he only told me.

297
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
He didn't tell you.

298
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,640
Are you wearing the new perfume I gave you?

299
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,200
What? I'm talking to you
about something serious.

300
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,440
A photo by digital camera

301
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,680
can't look the same
as in a selfie on the phone, right?

302
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,079
Haven't the actors all said

303
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,160
that the camera adds twenty pounds, right?

304
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,920
Didn't you want to go
to the bathroom? Go on then.

305
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,960
Right, I'll hurry then.

306
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll come back to choose the photos.
We still need to go to work.

307
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,960
Yes, yes.

308
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,000
Don't rush. Slow down.

309
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,759
You've been in such a hurry recently.

310
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,720
Friend, can I ask you a favor?

311
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,440
Could you retouch my photo
to make me look a bit fatter?

312
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,359
Make my wife look slimmer in the photo, please.

313
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,200
How is it going, have you
chosen the pictures yet?

314
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,640
Let's go. I've been waiting for you.

315
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,440
- Let's go, go, go.
- Then, let's go. Choose.

316
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,448
Let's see.

317
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,920
What you said was true.

318
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,440
After taking these pictures, we do look
as if we've gained twenty pounds.

319
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,240
You know, my husband's face
is usually only as big as a palm.

320
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,720
How did it turn out
looking like a pig's kidney face?

321
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,000
No, I think it's quite good.

322
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,240
And quite festive, isn't it?

323
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,720
All smiles, look how happy we are.

324
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,759
- Satisfied?
- Satisfied, very satisfied.

325
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,039
Thank you so much.

326
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:55,440
Then, please fine-tune it for us.

327
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,576
Don't worry.

328
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,319
Hello, Boss.

329
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,336
What's going on?

330
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,319
Weiji Company.

331
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,359
- Thank you.
- Okay.

332
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,319
Alright, I'm coming right away.

333
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,363
I'm sorry.

[Five Years Later]

335
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,960
Honey.

336
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,008
Mom.

337
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,319
Mom's big boy. What are you doing here?

338
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,960
Come here for a hug.
Mom has missed you so much.

339
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Are you here to pick Mom up from work?

340
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,880
Mom, you work overtime every day,
and I miss you so much.

341
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,000
I worry about you
staying up late and working hard.

342
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,119
Mom, come home and rest with me and Dad.

343
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,920
Shuai, if you say things like this,
Mom is going to cry.

344
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,240
Who taught you to speak so well?

345
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,119
That's of course because my son
is exceptionally talented.

346
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,720
Good genes, you know.

347
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,688
Give Mom a kiss, and I'll get off work, okay?

348
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:55,799
Off work now.

349
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,880
Alright, come on. Shuai.

350
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,079
Mom has worked hard all day.

351
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:02,016
We should learn to walk on our own, right?

352
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:04,319
- Let's go home.
- Honey.

353
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,720
Get on.

354
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,640
What are you doing in front of the child?

355
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,000
Look at our son. He's so smart.

356
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,480
We should let him learn
how to take care of his wife

357
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,680
by listening and watching from a young age.

358
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,799
Alright then, I'll grab the bag, let's go.

359
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,640
The bag should be carried by our son.

360
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,480
Let the baby carry it. Baby gets the bag.

361
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,400
All right then.

362
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,200
I'll get on then.

363
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,240
I've gained quite a bit of weight
since getting married.

364
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,119
It doesn't matter. No matter
how heavy you get, I can carry you.

365
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,200
Son, let's have a race.

366
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,319
Let's see who gets home first.

367
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,720
I'll count three, two, one.

368
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,599
Three, two.

369
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,079
Don't fall, son.

370
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:55,100
[Dairui Bank]

371
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,599
Zhao Fanggang, don't touch him.

372
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,319
You stand up too.

373
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:10,000
Zhao Xiaoshuai, I am speaking
to you nicely now.

374
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,000
Haven't we already agreed before

375
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,079
that you can only buy a toy once a month?

376
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,359
Have you already used up this month's quota?

377
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,519
Honey, don't be angry.

378
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,599
Don't get mad at a three-year-old child.

379
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,960
How can I not be mad? Let go of my hand.

380
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,759
Three-year-old child. Are you not a man?

381
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,680
Hasn't Mom told you before?

382
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,480
A man should have a spirit of commitment.

383
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,839
I want the shark toy.

384
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,559
Did I give birth
to a tape recorder, Zhao Fanggang?

385
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,840
Honey. Calm down. Calm down.

386
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,920
How can I calm down?

387
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,359
I'm telling you, if you don't get up…

388
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,160
Honey, so many people are watching.

389
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,680
Calm down a bit. Just look at the fish first.

390
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,440
I, I'll go deal with him, let's go.

391
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,336
Shuai, we mustn't make Mom angry, right?

392
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:47,359
Yes.

393
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,440
See?

394
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,400
Didn't you promise Dad
to take good care of Mom?

395
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,039
Yes.

396
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,039
Are you a man?

397
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,319
Yes.

398
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,480
Making a scene is something
only the incompetent do.

399
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,079
You're not incompetent, right?

400
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,240
No.

401
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,920
So, what should a man do?

402
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,319
Buy the shark toy next month.

403
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,440
That's right.

404
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,519
That's my son. Good boy.

405
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,920
Seeing that you've recognized
and corrected your mistake,

406
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,519
Dad will make an exception
and buy you a shark toy today.

407
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,039
- Okay?
- Okay.

408
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,200
But, next month, the month after next,

409
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,359
you will still only get one toy.

410
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,176
Let's pinky promise.

411
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:27,559
Pinky promise, hang ourselves on it,
no changing for a hundred years.

412
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,559
There's also another thing.
When we get back home later,

413
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,440
you must properly apologize to Mom, okay?

414
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,680
Okay.

415
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,816
I'm so angry.

416
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,760
Remember that.

417
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:43,000
Sorry, Mom.

418
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,839
It's okay, son. Mom is sorry too.

419
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,720
Mom was so harsh on you.

420
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,160
Sorry, my dear.

421
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:55,592
Zhao Fanggang.

422
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,359
Why is he suddenly being so good?
You didn't hit him, did you?

423
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,799
I have used some special methods!

424
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,119
Special methods? Did you really hit him?

425
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,359
How could that be? I can't bear to hit him.

426
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,519
Shuai now knows to care about Mom's feelings.
He's learned his lesson.

427
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,039
He gets that from me.

428
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Alright, don't be angry, honey.

429
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Our family of three came out to have fun.

430
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,160
Let's enjoy ourselves.

431
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,920
Don't think about that toy anymore.

432
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,519
Come, come, take a look.

433
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,720
Look over there, see those seals?

434
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Are you happy, son?

435
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,039
Shuai, look, they're showing
their bellies, see?

436
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,080
Here come the seals!

437
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,599
Here come the seals!

438
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,696
Shuai.

439
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,480
Mr. Jia, you can rest assured.

440
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,200
There's one thing I can assure you.

441
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,160
The interest rates offered by Ji'an branch
must be the most favorable.

442
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,079
Bank President Ji.

443
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,400
Ms. Tu.

444
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,000
Mr. Jia, you are here too? What a coincidence!

445
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,759
I wanted to bring my two apprentices today

446
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,880
to learn from President Ji.

447
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,200
I didn't expect to run into you
by such a coincidence.

448
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,024
Please.

449
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,920
Ms. Tu and President Ji are old colleagues?

450
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,032
Yes.

451
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,839
How does Mr. Jia know Ms. Tu?

452
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,319
I am a fan of Mr. Jia.

453
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,400
Previously, I saw the great scene
of Getong Tech at the Service Trade Fair.

454
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,319
Immersive human-computer
interaction application products.

455
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,680
It was truly both shocking and admirable.

456
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,559
Later, I heard that Getong needed a loan.

457
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,079
I also talked to Mr. Jia.

458
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,000
Unfortunately, the interest rate offered
at that time must have been unsuitable.

459
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,640
Seeing President Ji here today puts me at ease.

460
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,240
Ms. Tu, you flatter me.

461
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,319
Since we're all one of our own,

462
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,079
I won't be stingy with praise.

463
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,359
In recent times,

464
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,079
we have indeed consulted quite a few banks,

465
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,839
but we've never seen anyone

466
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,839
who's hands-on like Mr. Ji.

467
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,328
Of course, Ms. Tu is also
the Account Manager I admire the most.

468
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
Thank you, thank you.

469
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,920
The proposal you previously made for Getong

470
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,000
also fits our current stage
of development very well.

471
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,000
Mr. Jia, you're too kind.

472
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,119
Our Ji'an branch won't let you down.

473
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,839
I can guarantee that.

474
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,559
Whatever Mr. Ji says will certainly be done.

475
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:30,160
If Mr. Jia has any questions
regarding loans later on,

476
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,759
you can call me at any time.

477
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,319
Can your two branches help each other out?

478
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,559
Of course.

479
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,920
- I thought your businesses…
- He's taken the hook!

480
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,079
- Were completely independent.
- Our master is quite impressive.

481
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,519
Indeed, sometimes, this happens.

482
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,240
However, some clients do not like it.

483
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,519
After all, the process becomes more complicated

484
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,000
and it takes longer.

485
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,759
Certainly, the process is a test
for the Account Manager.

486
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,000
With a long working time comes rich experience,

487
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,359
and if there are enough people on hand,

488
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,599
it should not be too slow, right, Mr. Ji?

489
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,880
Ms. Tu is right.

490
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,519
The large branches are more reliable,

491
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,880
and the small branches are more convenient.

492
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,480
In Ji'an, my word is final.

493
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,519
So, Mr. Jia, if you have any requirements,

494
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,240
you can tell me directly.

495
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,920
Bank President Ji is anxious.

496
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,960
Apart from post-loan services
and loan renewals,

497
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,079
Ji'an is top-notch at Dairui.

498
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:33,759
Loan renewal?

499
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,880
Yes.

500
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:40,079
Ms. Tu, did you mention
this in your plan before?

501
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,440
Yes, I did.

502
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,799
But it wasn't analyzed in detail.

503
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,480
However, logically speaking, loan renewal

504
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,400
is an absolutely crucial part of Getong.

505
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,720
Mr. Jia, we have been communicating
for a while now.

506
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,319
You know me quite well.

507
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:00,400
And I am very clear about your needs.

508
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,640
This is a great advantage
for our subsequent cooperation.

509
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:19,519
Mr. Ji, is the type of cooperation
mentioned by Ms. Tu

510
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,000
acceptable on your side?

511
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,880
The method, of course, is for you to decide.

512
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,000
However, I think the specific details

513
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,079
might need to be discussed further
between Ms. Tu and me.

514
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:35,160
We'll get back to you as soon as possible.

515
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,400
Rest assured, Mr. Jia.

516
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,319
We will definitely address the issue

517
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,680
from the company's perspective.

518
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,759
We will certainly customize

519
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,079
the most suitable plan for your company.

520
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,000
Rest assured, Dairui is a powerful brand.

521
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,400
One plus one is definitely greater than two.

522
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,720
Good, I believe in you.

523
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
If there are no issues,

524
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,960
Mr. Ji, looking forward to working with you.

525
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,368
Pleasure working with you.

526
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,216
Thank you.

527
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,720
Why are you acting all contemplative here?

528
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,319
Weren't you quite capable during the day?

529
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,319
Brazenly coming over to snatch customers.

530
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:23,680
Please distinguish clearly
between work and private matters.

531
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,359
It was a fair competition.

532
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,456
Fair competition.

533
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,519
Now that we've signed this big client,

534
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,920
why are you still in a bad mood?
Is it because of Rao Jing?

535
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,359
Tomorrow, Jing will report to the headquarters.

536
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,079
Then it'll just be me left.

537
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,640
Before, no matter the issue, big or small,

538
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,680
I had Jing to discuss it with.

539
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,079
Jing is going to the headquarters
tomorrow, leaving me alone.

540
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,920
Even with the biggest issues,
I could discuss them with her.

541
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,119
Even if she doesn't help me,
I will still feel at ease.

542
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,240
I'll be alone in the future.

543
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,599
I'm a bit scared and worried.

544
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,160
But I believe in you.

545
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,240
I think you'll definitely be fine on your own.

546
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,480
Think about it, all this way,

547
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,440
you started from being a lobby manager.

548
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,599
Although it wasn't all smooth sailing,

549
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,839
you've managed to turn danger into chances.

550
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,680
I think the most important thing

551
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,359
is your own effort and dedication.

552
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,559
And you have gotten

553
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,640
the position of General Manager of Division One
that you dreamed of.

554
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Isn't this worth celebrating?

555
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
Of course, it is.

556
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,240
Mr. Ji, you have to work hard.

557
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,480
What if in a few years,

558
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,119
I'm fortunate enough
to become the bank president,

559
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,680
and if you are still a Bank President,

560
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,880
what will we do?

561
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,440
Becoming the bank president is a good thing.

562
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,240
Then I'll stay at home
to be a good husband and father,

563
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
and you'll provide for me.

564
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
You wish

565
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,384
Are you not happy with it?

566
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,519
How can I become a bank president?

567
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,319
Xiaoning, trust me.

568
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,759
Our future will surely get better and better.

569
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:37,028
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

570
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:41,284
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

571
00:30:41,284 --> 00:30:46,436
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

572
00:30:46,436 --> 00:30:49,380
♫ To you and no one else ♫

573
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,052
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

574
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,484
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

575
00:30:56,484 --> 00:30:59,692
♫ No one knows ♫

576
00:31:00,264 --> 00:31:02,468
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

577
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:06,636
♫ I hope you know ♫
