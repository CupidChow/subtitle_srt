Let me tell you, he is baffling.

39
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,759
To prevent this from ever happening again,

40
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,280
later I will add each colleague on WeChat

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,319

Sunday is our day off.

77
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,600
This way, we could have
a clear division of work

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
and clear boundaries.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,920
Do we need to divide
the off-duty time so clearly?

Of course.

00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,960
I'd like to hear about your career plan.

186
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,039
My plan is to grow and strengthen
in the role of Account Manager.

187
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,240
Relying on these 18 clients?

188
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,216
I think it's a lot.

189
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,559
Mr. Ji.

190
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,039
You may not know much since you've just
joined the Development Department Division One.

191
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,440
More government clients,

192
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
more deposits under their names.

193
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,399
This is the most practical.

194
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,120
The state is now strongly supporting
privately-owned enterprises,

195
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,159
and all banks are also
making structural adjustments.

196
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,679
If this trend goes on, you're only

197
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,279
[Statistician: Zhao Fanggang]
in charge of four privately-owned enterprises,

198
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,159
and one of them is substandard.

199
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,080
Are you satisfied with it?

200
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,976
I think it's pretty good.

201
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,240
Okay, I'll try my best.

202
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,799
This is something you tell yourself.

203
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,240
What I want is the results.

204
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,759
After the meeting,

205
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,399
I will go out to visit clients.

206
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,960
Starting from this month,

207
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,000
one more privately-owned
enterprise client every month.

208
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,759
I'll try my best.

209
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,159
One more client per month,

210
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,279
is it demanding to you?

211
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,919
Mr. Ji.

212
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,360
I'll do

213
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,480
whatever you say.

214
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,720
Tu Xiaoning.

215
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,639
May I ask what kind of business
are you in charge of now?

216
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,759
The process of enterprise access,

217
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,840
rating,

218
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,039
bank draft,

219
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,720
and domestic letter of credit

220
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,000
I asked about the business,

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,424
not the process.

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,279
If you can't complete

223
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,679
the necessary performance
assessment within six months,

224
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,279
someone will take your place.

225
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,160
Okay, Mr. Ji.

226
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,279
You asked for equal treatment.

227
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,679
Keep it up, Tu Xiaoning.

228
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,600
Hello.

229
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,120
Well, excuse me,

230
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,519
how do I get to
the loan department of Dairui Bank?

231
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,759
Do you have an appointment?

232
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,960
My friend works here.

233
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,519
I need to talk to him.

234
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,919
I just called him,

235
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,120
but he didn't answer.

236
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,399
Can I go up and wait for him?

237
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,600
Sorry, we have a policy here

238
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
that no visitor can enter
without staff accompanying.

239
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,600
Why don't you go sit

240
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,639
in the lounge and wait?

241
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,992
Okay, thank you.

242
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,759
Security, there's a guy
dressed in black forcing his way in.

243
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,320
That meeting got me all steamed up.

244
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,519
Me too.

245
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,879
Zhao has a good temper.

246
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,759
If it were me, I would have flipped the table.

247
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,159
Hello, may I ask

248
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,559
if you are responsible for loan project?

249
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,240
I have a question I'd like to ask.

250
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,559
Please wait a moment.

251
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,799
Don't ask questions.

252
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,519
We do not handle outward services here.

253
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,320
You need to go to that lobby

254
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,519
and get a number.
Then you can get it done there.

255
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,679
And this is not the time.

256
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,679
- Yes.
- Maybe later.

257
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,799
You always say so.

258
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,519
Do you have time now?

259
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,519
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

260
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,600
Wait. It's the regulation.

261
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,399
- You…
- Bro, please calm down.

262
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,559
Can we talk nicely? Please put down the knife.

263
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,440
The time for good talk is over.

264
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,279
- You put that knife…
- Did you even care about me?

265
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,519
Tu?

266
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,759
Hello, sir.

267
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,919
I'm Tu Xiaoning, Account Manager Assistant.

268
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,960
This is my staff card. Please take a look.

269
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,039
Do you have any requests?

270
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,279
Tell me, I will definitely
try my best to help you out.

271
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,399
We all will.

272
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,919
Right, right.

273
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,200
Qian Li Yuan.

274
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,240
Qian Li Yuan.

275
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,759
Qian Li Yuan asked me

276
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,799
to take out
the matchmaking loans for 88,000 yuan.

277
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,360
I took this 88,000 yuan

278
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,320
and gave it to my girlfriend met
on the matchmaking organized by Qian Li Yuan.

279
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,720
Then my girlfriend took the money and ran away.

280
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,960
And now Dairui Bank
is pushing me to pay the money back.

281
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,080
It's not fair.

282
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,600
Why is she taking the money

283
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,360
and you're asking me to pay it back?

284
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,559
Qian Li Yuan, right?

285
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,600
I know.

286
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,279
A matchmaking company.

287
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,120
They were the ones in the middle

289
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,159
that secured the loan.

290
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,120
Bro, it was Qian Li Yuan
that did it for you, you…

291
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,360
You guys gave me all this big talk

292
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,799
when you asked me to take out a loan,

293
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,360
and now you don't care about it, right?

294
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
No, absolutely not.

295
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,440
Definitely not.

296
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,519
Today…

297
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,639
Today, I'll die right here

298
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,399
to show you.

299
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,799
- Calm down.
- You calm down.

300
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,960
Call the police and security.

301
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,120
- Okay, be careful.
- Okay.

302
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,039
Don't rush, there's a process involved.

303
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,759
Put the knife down first,
and let's talk this through.

304
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,039
You…

305
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,840
go…

306
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,279
cancel it…

307
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,440
for me now.

308
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,919
Go cancel it now!

309
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,919
Okay, then do you…

310
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,960
Do you remember the code of your loan contract?

311
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,840
I will…

312
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,840
I will find it for you.

313
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,519
Code, code…

314
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,559
It's okay if you don't remember.

315
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,240
We can do face recognition.

316
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,840
Face this camera

317
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,480
and do the face recognition.

318
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,800
Yes.

319
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,519
Look, look.

320
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,296
Look here.

321
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,000
Liar!

322
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,399
You are all liars!

323
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,840
You are all liars!

324
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,240
You are all liars!

325
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:17,720
Security!

326
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Catch him.

327
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
It's bleeding.

328
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,159
I'm okay. Are you okay?

329
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:38,840
[Small consumer loan contract]

330
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,080
Tu.

331
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
You are truly from the lobby.

332
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,320
What a heroine you are!

333
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,159
Not at all. We should thank…

334
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,200
Mr. Ji.

335
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,559
Luckily he was quick.

336
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,840
It was dangerous.

337
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,919
I wanted to help.

338
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,279
But I happened not to be there.

339
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,039
But you can't be on the same side of him

340
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:02,240
because of this.

341
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,000
Who is Ji Yuheng's family?

342
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,680
Doctor, how is he doing?

343
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,119
The wound isn't deep, but it's quite large.

344
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,440
We've made preliminary treatment.

345
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,759
Next, he needs to rest well.

346
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,799
No spicy food during recuperation.

347
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,400
And the wound must not contact water.

348
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,039
What are you doing here?

349
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,200
How are you?

350
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,519
I'm fine.

351
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,720
You are so bold.

352
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,799
Aren't you afraid they'd see us?

353
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,799
Let me check on your hand.

354
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:33,279
It's fine.

355
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,400
You!

356
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,359
If Gao did it harder,

357
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,680
he would injure you seriously.

358
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,000
That's still better than injuring you.

359
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,880
It's nothing for me to get a small injury.

360
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,599
But you, you…

361
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,680
Others were just standing there,

362
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,359
why did you go up to handle it?

363
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,279
I've been in the lobby for three years.

364
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,519
I've seen such things a lot.

365
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,200
It has become natural to me.

366
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,456
I'm used to it.

367
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,119
What did the doctor say?

368
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,559
Do you need to stay in the hospital?

369
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,000
Does it hurt?

370
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,519
Not anymore.

371
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,640
I'll get an IV.

372
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,400
The doctor said
staying for a few hours should be enough.

373
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,359
Okay.

374
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,759
What about Gao?

375
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:22,279
Jing has called the police.

376
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,759
Gao should have been arrested.

377
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:27,200
If they are going back to the company later,

378
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,279
I'll go back with them

379
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,880
and find an opportunity to come back.

380
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,079
No need, it's working hours now.

381
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,319
Have you forgotten
the agreement we signed last night?

382
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,960
Mr. Ji.

383
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,200
Is your hand okay?

384
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,839
It's fine, the doctor has
already taken care of it.

385
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,120
That's good.

386
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Where's Tu?

387
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,039
She was with us.

388
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,319
Right, I'll give her a call.

389
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:22,474
[Mute]

390
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,248
Tu is also here?

391
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:30,151
[Rao Jing]

392
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,799
Not answering.

393
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,279
Maybe she went back to the bank first.

394
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
Then we go back as well.

395
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,079
The doctor said

396
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,519
that you need to stay
in the hospital a bit longer.

397
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,319
Ms. Rao, then you can go back first.

398
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,359
Mr. Zhao, stay with me.

399
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,264
Alright.

400
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,440
Let's have a drink together tonight.

401
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,680
I'm not as carefree as you guys.

402
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,000
By the way, Americano and latte,
which one do you want to drink?

403
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,279
- Latte.
- Latte, okay. Here you are.

404
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,960
You may go back.

405
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,079
Okay, I'll go get busy then.

406
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,039
How would she come to the hospital?

407
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,279
Are you okay? You got scared, right?

408
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,359
A bit.

409
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,200
You worked in the lobby before,

410
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,839
must have seen a lot of troublemakers.

411
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,519
But there are few to be with a knife.

412
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,960
Indeed. Take it as an experience.

413
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,880
But you were so reckless back there.

414
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,000
And,

415
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,640
you never should have
shown him your staff card.

416
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,880
Think about it.

417
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,079
You are not a regular worker now,

418
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,920
what if he complains you?

419
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,480
I didn't really think about it that much,

420
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,079
and just wanted to help him out.

421
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,160
So, what would you do with that Gao?

422
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,039
It depends on the police.

423
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,119
But that person…

424
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,599
He shouldn't have tried
to stab anyone with a knife.

425
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,359
And Mr. Ji…

426
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,759
He just came to our department,

427
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,119
acting so impulsively.

428
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,680
What if he really

429
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,079
got injured seriously?

430
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,664
Who is to blame?

431
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,160
Jing, what are the matchmaking loans?

432
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,559
I didn't know our bank has this service.

433
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,119
That matchmaking loans are something

434
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,920
that the matchmaking industry itself
has created in the past two years,

435
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,559
similar to the consumer loan that our bank
has been doing for the last two years.

436
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,960
Mr. Jiang was in charge of these.

437
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,440
But hasn't Mr. Jiang already been fired?

438
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,079
Although Mr. Jiang has been fired,

439
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,519
before that,

440
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,680
he's not the only one handling this business.

441
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,000
Consumer loan is
a business promoted by the head office.

442
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,920
It's neither against the regulations
nor illegal.

443
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,240
Whether the clients taking out loans

444
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,920
to get married or to handle funeral affairs,

445
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,640
it's not my business.

446
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,000
The consumer loan
is indeed a legitimate business.

447
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,839
But it doesn't mean there aren't
any irregularities in the process

448
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:35,519
when you handled it.

449
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,960
Have you fully understood
the customer's demands and situations

450
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,640
and clearly informed the relevant provisions

451
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,680
of the contract?

452
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,960
Then let me put it formally,

453
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,279
if someone secretly works with
the matchmaking platform

454
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,400
by means of deception or inducement

455
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,359
to facilitate a loan from the customer

456
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,920
and get some kickbacks from it,

457
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,119
just like what that man said today.

458
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,079
Mr. Ji.

459
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,160
You can't say so.

460
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,200
The business was approved by Mr. Jiang.

461
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,759
And the customers were brought in by Mr. Jiang.

462
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,599
I'm just an errand boy.

463
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,319
You can't blame this on me.

464
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,359
I didn't blame you.

465
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,519
But Mr. Zhao,

466
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,200
you are the handler.

467
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,079
You're going to have to work hard

468
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,880
to get to the bottom of this
if you want to be clear.

469
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,448
Want to quit?

470
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,559
Mr. Ji.

471
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,839
You…

472
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,960
have just joined our department,

473
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,359
maybe you don't know

474
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,400
that disputes always happen

475
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,839
when we deal with people every day.

476
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,680
Not to mention that we deal with
money in people's hands all the time.

477
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,559
It's perfectly normal to meet

478
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,720
some troublemakers.

479
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,200
If we get to the bottom of every one of them,

480
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,920
then nobody could work,

481
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,200
might as well go solve cases instead.

482
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,759
Then let me ask you a question.

483
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,519
Do you think that loans from our bank

484
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,799
under the name of matchmaking loans

485
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,656
are unique?

486
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,400
If this matter were
to blow up on a large scale,

487
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,559
the head office would definitely get involved.

488
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,319
Then this conversation today

489
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,960
is not only between you and me.

490
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,400
Fine. You want me to get the bottom of it,

491
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,584
then I'll do it.

492
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,599
Then you take a rest here.

493
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,792
I'm leaving.

494
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,880
Doctor.

495
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,400
My friend still has one bottle of IV to finish.

496
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,160
Please keep an eye on it.

497
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,088
I have to go.

498
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,559
It doesn't matter if it hurts a bit

499
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,888
when removing the needle.

500
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,359
Call Rao Jing.

501
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,559
Calling Rao Jing.

502
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,839
Ms. Rao.

503
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,160
Go ahead.

504
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,519
I have a client's business card on my desk.

505
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,640
Could you take a photo and send it to me?

506
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,279
You are at the office, right?

507
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,920
I have a dog at home,

508
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,559
and the dog's had some diarrhea lately.

509
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,680
I have to clean up the mess

510
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,960
and wipe its butt. I have to go.

511
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,279
What do you mean?

512
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:36,559
What? Hello…

513
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,559
Aren't we going back to the office?

514
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,200
Why?

515
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,960
This is a good opportunity.

516
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,720
The matchmaking loans have caused quite a stir.

517
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,200
If she handles it well,

518
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,960
she could even make a good impression
on the leaders.

519
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:53,799
What a scheming woman.

520
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,799
Have you attended
the drama club at school before?

521
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,880
Put on a show with me later.

522
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:50,056
[Qian Li Yuan]

523
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,720
Pretty fast.

524
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,096
You're not slow either.

525
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,440
Looking for a partner?

526
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,519
Have you filled in your information?

527
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:06,240
We've covered 90% of the single men and women

528
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,599
in the city.
I'm sure you'll find your loved one.

529
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,359
Sir, you must be anxious.

530
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,936
I'll give you a 20% discount on the membership.

531
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,279
Miss Tu.

532
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,720
You should inform me in advance.

533
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,799
Recently,

534
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,640
a really nice man just joined.

535
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,559
He's same age as you, studied abroad,

536
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,920
and working in the bank,

537
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,920
called Ji…

538
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,799
Did you issue the invoice
last time I asked you to?

539
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:38,559
Not yet. Issue one right now.

540
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,200
Sir, what type do you like?

541
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,039
We have all types here, whatever you want.

542
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,079
Tell me what you like, I'll introduce you.

543
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,440
Take a look, take a look.

544
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,799
Go, hurry.

545
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,759
Miss Tu, the invoice you mentioned…

546
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,079
I don't remember any of it.

547
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,640
Sorry, I remembered it wrong.

548
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,720
No problem.

549
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Let me tell you,

550
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,440
if others say someone is handsome,

551
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,799
you don't believe them.

552
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,519
But if I say someone is handsome,

553
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,960
[Qian Li Yuan, Matchmaking Members]
that must be the best one.

554
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,240
Here. Miss Tu. Take a look.

555
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,920
No way.

556
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,079
Miss Tu, what did you say?

557
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,319
Why don't you take a rest?

558
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,599
I'll wander around by myself.

559
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,319
I'm not busy. Let me tell you.

560
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,960
I'll go find some profiles for you.

561
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,680
You'll definitely like it.

562
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,352
Come on, follow me.

563
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,000
Miss Tu, have a cup of coffee first.

564
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,279
- I'll go get the profiles.
- Thank you.

565
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,960
Luckily we didn't get the certificate.

566
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,400
If we had gotten the certificate,

567
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,799
they'd have to put
the marriage certificate on the wall.

568
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,599
I got so scared.

569
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,720
Rest assured, everyone here
is of the highest quality.

570
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,599
Madam, you're the one
who came with Miss Tu, right?

571
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,720
Yes.

572
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,799
I got this. You go ahead with your work.

573
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,880
Okay.

574
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,799
This way, please. Let me tell you.

575
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,720
I just flipped through it.

576
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,400
They were in the same high school.

577
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,160
They're so destined.

578
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,839
If you ask me, they

579
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,759
should just get the certificate
and get married right away.

580
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,279
A day late is a disrespect for the fate.

581
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,559
Please take a seat.

582
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,839
Fate?

583
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,008
What?

584
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,400
Miss Tu, this is

585
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,720
Mr. Ji's profile.

586
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,519
Come and look at this fate destined for you.

587
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:36,720
No, no need.

588
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
No need, no need.

589
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,799
Three.

590
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,319
Two.

591
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,352
One.

592
00:29:47,431 --> 00:29:50,297
[Ji Wushuang]

593
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,576
How is it?

594
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,880
He looks quite humble.

595
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,920
You can get to know each other.

596
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,880
I think I don't deserve him.

597
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,079
No way.

598
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,519
No worries. We can check others.

599
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,680
Let me get to know more.

600
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,160
Come in.

601
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,839
Teacher.

602
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,319
Yuheng, come on.

603
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,559
Come on.

604
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,279
How is the injury? Is it serious?

605
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,559
Nothing serious.

606
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,000
Come on, have a seat.

607
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,319
He's stabbed you.

608
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,160
This is the first time it has happened
in the Development Department.

609
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,680
I am truly sorry.

610
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,559
I didn't expect this to happen.

611
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,880
Besides, I have asked Mr. Zhao

612
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,119
to deal with this.

613
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,000
There should be a conclusion very soon.

614
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,079
These are all old issues.

615
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,519
There's no need to apologize.

616
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,720
But that Zhao Fanggang…

617
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,319
How dare you still use him?

618
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,880
Even though it was Mr. Jiang's fault,

619
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,160
after all, he was the main handler.

620
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,759
And now,

621
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,640
are you still expecting him
to make up for this?

622
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,160
Actually, that's what I wanted

623
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,799
to talk about.

624
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,160
I've had a good look over

625
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,319
the contracts of the consumer loans these days.

626
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,559
In fact, the part handled directly
by Zhao Fanggang is very limited.

627
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,319
In addition, I also observed
his working state in the past two days.

628
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,680
He seems a little lazy,

629
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,880
but he's serious

630
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,599
and meticulous about the work.

631
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,519
Another important point is

632
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,000
that he has the most of government clients

633
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,279
in the entire

634
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,039
Development Department.

635
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:28,000
This shows that he is a man
with a strong capability.

636
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,880
I don't doubt his capability.

637
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,519
But the question is,

638
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,880
is he on your side?

639
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,680
Well, I don't really

640
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
care about if he's on my side.

641
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,440
What I care about more is if he has contributed
to the Development Department Division One.

642
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,519
He is the handler for the consumer loan.

643
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,119
He must be more anxious than anyone else

644
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:49,519
that this matter be resolved.

645
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,440
So he'll get the bottom of it

646
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,880
for his own sake.

647
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,240
Matchmaking loans?

648
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,519
This thing really exists?

649
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,359
Gao didn't lie to me.

650
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,079
We're all men who need money to get married.

651
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,240
He can loan out the money to get married.

652
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,119
I can't be worse than him.

653
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,279
Of course.

654
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,599
This loan that we offer

655
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,759
isn't demanding.

656
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,640
And it doesn't require
any qualifications from you.

657
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,240
Are you some kind of private loan shark?

658
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,519
[Recording]
No, I can guarantee you

659
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,720
that it's a formal loan from a bank.

660
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,400
It's the special benefit of our platform.

661
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,799
We know

662
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,759
someone in bank.

663
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:31,759
That's good.

664
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,920
Well, what if I don't make the payments?

665
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,519
We are all ordinary folks.

666
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,599
At most, we only need
one hundred thousand yuan to get married.

667
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,839
It's nothing to a large bank.

668
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:44,559
If I take out a loan from you,

669
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,240
I wonder if my matchmaking service fee
can be included in that.

670
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,400
Those people out there

671
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,119
have to pay a service fee of 5%,

672
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,799
but our members only need to pay 3%.

673
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,119
Only 3%

674
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:59,000
can you solve the big event in your life.

675
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,039
Right.

676
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,000
If this problem is solved,

677
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,839
then the biggest barrier to my marriage

678
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,359
is solved, right?

679
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,599
So what bank are you working with?

680
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,279
Look.

681
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,519
It's not easy for us to earn money.

682
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,319
I want to check the contract

683
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,160
to make sure.

684
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,039
Dairui.

685
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,119
You must know Dairui.

686
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,920
We offer an intermediary contract.

687
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,079
Well,

688
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:34,039
your relationship with Dairui
is particularly good.

689
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,599
If she takes out a loan from the bank,

690
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,519
there won't be any problems, right?

691
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,079
What if something goes wrong,

692
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:41,480
we would be worried.

693
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,680
Thank you for waiting.

694
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,200
Here, take a look.

695
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,680
Alright.

696
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,799
I don't really understand it either.

697
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,680
So many words are all closely packed together.

698
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,000
Let me tell you.

699
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,240
When our boss started the company,

700
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,079
he took out the loan
by Account Manager Jiang of Dairui.

701
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,720
The two of them are really close.

702
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,079
Later, this person

703
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,519
has become the manager of the loan department.

704
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,720
You have such a strong relationship?

705
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,920
Then you must have given that manager

706
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,280
a lot of favors.

707
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,039
Money counts nowadays.

708
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:15,639
I don't know if my boss did so.

709
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,079
But rest assured.

710
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,519
As long as Mr. Jiang remains in his position,

711
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,679
I'm sure we can get you this loan.

712
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,079
That's great.

713
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,920
Xiaoning.

714
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,719
My personal problem

715
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,880
has finally been resolved.

716
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,440
Thank you.

717
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,639
Look, after talking for so long

718
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,719
and taking you such a long time,

719
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,760
I still haven't signed

720
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,000
the contract for matchmaking services.

721
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
Well, bring me the contract.

722
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,199
I'll sign them altogether today.

723
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,599
No problem, please wait.

724
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,840
I'll go get it right now.

725
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,424
Okay.

726
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,280
Mr. Zhao, you look quite happy.

727
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Although the matchmaking loans
don't have much to do with me,

728
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,639
as a member of Dairui,

729
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,599
I should share the worries of the bank.

730
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,719
Mr. Zhao,

731
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,119
looks like you must have obtained

732
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,280
some evidence.

733
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,800
I wonder if the evidence is enough

734
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,239

809

♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

922
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,296
♫ To you and no one else ♫

923
00:44:46,296 --> 00:44:51,128
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

924
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:53,304
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

925
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:56,480
♫ No one knows ♫

926
00:44:57,372 --> 00:44:59,640
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

927
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,008
♫ I hope you know ♫

928
00:45:04,472 --> 00:45:11,064
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

929
00:45:11,064 --> 00:45:16,504
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

930
00:45:16,504 --> 00:45:23,256
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

931
00:45:23,256 --> 00:45:27,512
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

932
00:45:27,512 --> 00:45:32,664
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

933
00:45:32,664 --> 00:45:35,608
♫ To you and no one else ♫

934
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:40,280
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

935
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,712
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

936
00:45:42,712 --> 00:45:45,920
♫ No one knows ♫

937
00:45:46,492 --> 00:45:48,696
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

938
00:45:48,696 --> 00:45:52,864
♫ I hope you know ♫
