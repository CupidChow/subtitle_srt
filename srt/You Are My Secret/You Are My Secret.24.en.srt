[Episode 24]

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,640
At that time, a large parcel fell from above.

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,856
Do you still remember it?

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,319
I used to watch you play
on that basketball court.

35
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,120
Do you remember it?

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,519
I really never noticed.

37
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,280
How could that be?

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,359
At that time, your roommate Chen
was in love with my best friend Liu Liu.

39
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,519
I was there when you guys played basketball.

40
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,239
And we often had meals together.

41
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,920
I have a bit of an impression.

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,239
But we barely talked.

43
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,800
Tang, the past is the past.

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,319
Now we are superior and subordinate.

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,919
I hope that in the future,
no matter on any occasion,

46
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,080
do not use vague words to lead others

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,120
to misunderstand our relationship.

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,199
I know you're afraid of others to find it out

49
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,719
and gossip about me behind my back.

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,520
It's okay. I don't care.

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,719
Right, I've arranged
a classmate gathering tonight.

52
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,680
Will you join?

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
I have things to do, so I won't go.

54
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,784
See you at the office on Monday.

55
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,768
Xiaoning.

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,096
They are not that great.

57
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,680
Back then,
I was the top small forward in the school.

58
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,120
In terms of strength, speed, and skill,
I outperformed all the boys.

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,000
If you'd seen me back then,

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,560
you would definitely
have been captivated by me.

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,319
No one would boast about himself like this.

62
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,120
Ji, you are so narcissistic.

63
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,159
Thank you.

64
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,439
When you were in college,

65
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,719
you probably weren't the type
to arrive just on time for class, right?

66
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,680
Of course not.
I practically lived in the classroom.

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,759
Really?

68
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,800
Of course not.

69
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,904
Annoying!

70
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,759
I used to come to this library
every day when I was in college.

71
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,039
This road leads back to the dorm.

72
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,520
I know exactly
where there is a bad one on this floor,

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,719
what season the bushes along this road

74
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,719
bloom.

75
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,319
At that time, when I was walking every day,

76
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,439
I wished there's someone to accompany me.

77
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,616
I am accompanying you.

78
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,120
Now I walk every one of these roads with you,

79
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,976
so when I think back
on my college days in the future,

80
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,128
I won't feel lonely anymore.

81
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,040
Is it true that all you knew
was study in your college days,

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,208
without having a relationship?

83
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,480
Of course not.

84
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,319
That's because you have
that dream girl in your heart, right?

85
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,639
The dream girl is so powerful.

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
Don't you trust me?

87
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,040
No, no.

88
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,920
This is my dorm.

89
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,839
All these years have passed,

90
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,808
even the balcony has been closed off.

91
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:56,879
What's wrong?

92
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,800
Do you have a story with the balcony?

93
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Let me tell you.
Our dorm is the farthest from the library.

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,160
Every time the library closed, so did the dorm.

95
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,439
So I could only climb in from this balcony.

96
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,160
You studied that hard?

97
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,439
That's like four more years of twelfth grade.
Can't believe it.

98
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,728
When we have kids,
you'll see how important it is

99
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:20,160
to have a husband who loves to study.

100
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,639
Who's going to have kids with you?

101
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,720
Wait, who agreed to marry you?

102
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,800
Fine. We won't have kids.

103
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,040
So no one can interrupt us.

104
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,439
When we're old, we'll go to the nursing home.

105
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,319
You're talking about having kids now
and a nursing home next.

106
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,680
Maybe you're thinking a little too far ahead.

107
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,319
That's because you are always in my life plan.

108
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,680
Do you feel embarrassed?

109
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,704
No.

110
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,040
You are really shameless.

111
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,112
Ji Yuheng?

112
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,879
Sun Chen?

113
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,519
Yuheng, it's really you!

114
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,600
What are you doing here?

115
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,040
Yuheng, have you forgotten?

116
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,920
After graduated, I stayed to become a teacher.

117
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,032
I really forgot it.

118
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,680
This is…

119
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,279
I'm his girlfriend, Tu Xiaoning. Hello.

120
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,224
Look at him.

121
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:22,560
- I think he's getting more handsome recently.
- Right.

122
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,152
Ji Yuheng is really…

123
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:28,120
He's really busy and hard to meet now.

124
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,639
He never shows up for gatherings either.

125
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,439
He is indeed busy with work now.

126
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,199
So he asked me to come
and apologize to you all.

127
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,879
Yuhui is still defending him.

128
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,560
Tell me, you two aren't just colleagues, right?

129
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,920
You're out of the loop.

130
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,800
They were really close
when they were in college.

131
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,680
Really? I don't think so.

132
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,879
That time, in front of
the First Building, he saved her.

133
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,279
Don't you remember it?

134
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,319
Hey, wait a moment.

135
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,600
Actually, that's quite simple.

136
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,496
Be careful.

137
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,400
Are you okay?

138
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:33,000
Here.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,144
Thank you.

140
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,399
Did you just call me for something?

141
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,639
Nothing. I mistook you for someone else.

142
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,399
Let's go.

143
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,160
Are you okay? You scared me.

144
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,120
- I'm fine.
- What's going on?

145
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,240
Oh my. A hero saving a beauty.

146
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,120
Isn't this method
of picking up girls a bit too cliché?

147
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,360
Picking up girls?

148
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,560
Yes, it's obvious.

149
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,439
Pretending to mistake you for someone else,

150
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,639
actually, he just wants you to remember him.

151
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,439
Is that person Sun Chen's roommate?

152
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,199
He's quite handsome.

153
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,600
Tell me, did he save you because he likes you?

154
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,240
Or did he fall in love with you
at first sight after saving you?

155
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,759
Is there a difference?

156
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,240
Anyway, the look in his eyes
when he first saw Yuhui

157
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,799
was full of love.

158
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
Well, that makes it easy now.

159
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,679
Ji Yuheng can win her over more easily now.

160
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,720
I've only been in Dairui for a year,

161
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,639
now, we are still focused on work.

162
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,919
I got it.

163
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,720
Give Bank President Ji some time.

164
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,639
- Men need to…
- Be tested.

165
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,120
Then I'll wait for your wedding.

166
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,799
It's still early for me, I'm waiting for yours.

167
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,840
It's early for us too.

168
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,679
Sorry, everyone.

169
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,159
- Sorry I'm late.
- What takes you so late?

170
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,159
I ran into an old acquaintance on the way
and chatted with him for a bit.

171
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,679
Guess who I ran into?

172
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,832
Who?

173
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,856
You'll never guess.

174
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,879
Ji. Ji Yuheng.

175
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,928
My roommate, remember him?

176
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:26,039
Let me tell you.

177
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,399
I saw Ji Yuheng touring the campus
with his girlfriend.

178
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,320
Really. He's pretty slick. Let me tell you.

179
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,799
- Are you just guessing?
- Yes.

180
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,759
He can't have a girlfriend, right?

181
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,159
I can guarantee it.
He introduced her to me himself.

182
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,960
And the girl admitted to being his girlfriend.

183
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,480
Let me tell you, the way of Ji Yuheng
looked at his girlfriend

184
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,440
was so gentle.

185
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,279
Actually, at first I thought

186
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,600
Yuheng should like the kind
of dazzlingly beautiful women.

187
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,159
But I didn't expect he'd find someone
with a refreshing beauty. Well…

188
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,240
He told me to keep it a secret,

189
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,080
but ended up being caught.

190
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,320
So you knew it.

191
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,000
- You knew it.
- What a misunderstanding.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,080
I thought I'd discovered some secret.

193
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,159
Sun Chen, you're late.
Punish yourself with three cups.

194
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,279
Pour it.

195
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,519
Three cups, come on.

196
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,240
Okay, I'll enjoy drinking today.

197
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Pour less.

198
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,360
Fill it up.

199
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,919
I have classes tomorrow.

200
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,360
I'll drink first as a toast, sorry.

201
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,408
Be careful.

202
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,064
Be careful. Come on.

203
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,159
Actually, during college,

204
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,960
my only pastime was reading here.

205
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,799
When I didn't have class,

206
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,840
I would sit quietly in that corner alone

207
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
for the whole day.

208
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,279
It is really you, Ji.

209
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,240
I thought I saw it wrong.

210
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,919
Boss, you still remember me?

211
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,519
How could I forget you?

212
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,679
You came here every now and then
when you were in college.

213
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,759
Such a handsome man

214
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,440
was always sitting alone in the corner
reading philosophy books.

215
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,039
You seemed low-key,
yet actually very eye-catching.

216
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,824
This is the first time you've brought
someone here. Your girlfriend?

217
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,576
My girlfriend.

218
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,519
Boss, he's never brought
another girl here before?

219
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,559
Yes, I even asked him

220
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,159
why he didn't bring a girlfriend here.

221
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,960
He said she had someone already.

222
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,039
I asked him what his crush was like
and he said…

223
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,120
I forgot the exact words.

224
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,696
Seemed like a girl like you.

225
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,440
Like me?

226
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,960
The only thing I remember is…

227
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,488
Her eyes curved into a line as she smiled.

228
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:03,000
Especially bright and cheerful,
just looking at her makes one feel good.

229
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,592
Stop making fun of me.

230
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,240
Getting shy now?

231
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,799
Okay, then feel free to look around.

232
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,919
- Okay.
- You go ahead.

233
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,720
So the girl the boss mentioned
is your dream girl, right?

234
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,688
Yes, but actually…

235
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:24,679
I don't want to know who she is.

236
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,559
Whoever she is, we're together now.

237
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,639
Even if she comes back,
I won't give you to her.

238
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,879
You two can forget about it.

239
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,519
You are quite lucky.

240
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,240
You missed a dream girl,
but found another one similar.

241
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,264
It's lit.

242
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,159
Nothing serious, just the air switch is loose,

243
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,159
causing intermittent tripping.

244
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:08,600
I'm going to wash up.

245
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,240
The restroom is over there.

246
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,720
My hand is full of lubricating oil.
I need to scrub it with detergent.

247
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,968
That simple?

248
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,679
What happened to your kitchen plumbing?

249
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,039
That one? That one doesn't need fixing.

250
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,639
I don't use this kitchen much.

251
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,679
Not like that electrical box
which must be fixed.

252
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,488
I'm here. I'll fix it for you.

253
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,080
It's not necessary.

254
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,519
I won't rent the house when it's due.

255
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,919
Well, you…

256
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,799
You don't care about the quality of life,

257
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,320
but you are carrying branded bags,
wearing branded shoes

258
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,200
and getting manicures regularly every week.

259
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,960
How come do you live such a displeasing life?

260
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,240
You are not washing clothes,
collecting garbage,

261
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,159
and leaving the plumbing dripping.

262
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,759
You are not that busy now.

263
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,759
You could cook something at home.

264
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:03,440
You can cook.

265
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,360
Don't eat pre-made packages all day.

266
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,639
It's not good for your health.

267
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,919
If you really don't want to cook,

268
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,120
go find those young boys
and let them cook for you.

269
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,080
You know those are young boys.

270
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,759
They are still
their parents' precious darlings.

271
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,720
How could they be willing to cook
and wash dishes for me?

272
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,000
To be honest,

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,296
those young boys

274
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:29,799
are just fascinated by mature women.

275
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,104
And I am

276
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,360
living carefreely and spending generously.

277
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,720
And I'm not that bad looking.

278
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,840
So we're just having fun.

279
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
It's a tacit understanding.

280
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,879
Why force them to live a life with me?

281
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,000
Alright, your hose is broken.

282
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,600
I'll wrap it with tape for now.

283
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,080
Later on, I'll buy you a new one.

284
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:06,919
I think you're a good fit for life.

285
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,759
What's the use?
After all these years, I'm still single.

286
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,159
Me too.

287
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,960
Let me tell you, do you know

288
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,679
how miserable it was when I first lived alone?

289
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,440
Once, my home appliance broke down,

290
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,919
I asked the landlord to fix it,
guess what happened?

291
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,759
He scammed me out of half a month's rent.

292
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,960
And, a burglar broke into my house,

293
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,039
I was terrified at the time.

294
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,559
I just lay on the bed and didn't dare move.

295
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,360
And then I listened to him
rummaging around in there.

296
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,399
I didn't know what he ended up stealing.

297
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,039
Anyway, I didn't have anything valuable.

298
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,200
One time, in the kitchen,

299
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,799
I went into the kitchen to get something.

300
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,240
But the kitchen door was broken,

301
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,639
and I couldn't get out.

302
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,200
And my phone was left in the living room.

303
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,320
Guess what happened in the end?

304
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,519
I broke the lock on the kitchen door

305
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,679
with the kitchen knife, so I could get out.

306
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,919
You don't have to look.
It's not this apartment.

307
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,240
I didn't have much money.

308
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,679
The apartment I rented
was almost out of the Star City.

309
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,679
No way. Given your character,

310
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,759
you should be tough
with the landlord over rent,

311
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,679
cornered the burglar and called the police.

312
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,240
If the kitchen lock made you upset,

313
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,679
you could just break the whole door with it.

314
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,120
I told you that was when I first lived alone.

315
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,399
Okay? When I first lived alone.

316
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,159
Besides, who is born to be strong?

317
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,188
I've become like this

318
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:37,960
after all those years on my own.

319
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,799
Why are you telling me this?

320
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,720
Nothing.

321
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,120
You were chatting with me.

322
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,679
So, I made some complaints.

323
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,824
During our chatting, I was thinking

324
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,000
I've spent most of my time on work

325
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,400
or living a game-like life.

326
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:16,759
I wonder if my life
could have another possibility.

327
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:22,880
Having a partner I can trust and rely on,

328
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,240
and always having warm food waiting for me

329
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,016
is also nice, right?

330
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:56,032
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

331
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,920
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

332
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,799
Wait a minute. What exactly does that mean?

333
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,119
I'm ready for a serious relationship.

334
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:13,799
But whether we get anywhere
depends on your performance.

335
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,148
I won't let you down.

336
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:21,184
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

337
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:24,672
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

338
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:28,812
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

339
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,736
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

340
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:38,792
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

341
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,216
Weiyi.

342
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
What are you doing here?

343
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,440
I'm here to pick you up from work.

344
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,152
How do you feel about officially starting work?

345
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:02,920
It's quite interesting.

346
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,312
Did you see that duck neck store
on your way here?

347
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,359
Where is it?

348
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,119
Just the one right out the door and turn right.

349
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,599
It's the century-old brand,
and has long queues every day.

350
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,288
There's a new nail salon right next door.

351
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:15,072
It's newly opened and very popular with girls.

352
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,079
These two store owners

353
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,039
always argue at the entrance.

354
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,319
They argue very day.

355
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,039
Today, we had to go out to mediate.

356
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,304
Really?

357
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,359
And this one.

358
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,400
That serious?

359
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,440
Let me see.

360
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,480
Little dog? Chasing dogs
is also one of your duties?

361
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,960
Yes. The people turn to us when they encounter

362
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,279
various problems in their lives.

363
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,920
From minor issues like
illegal renovations and neighbor disputes,

364
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,960
to major ones like company bosses
being threatened with acid by shareholders.

365
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,240
I've learned a lot.

366
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,960
You seem quite serious about it.

367
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,119
You guys have a lot of work to do.

368
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,400
Then you need to keep fit
and build up your strength.

369
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,848
How about we do exercise together this weekend?

370
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:57,119
Sure, what kind of exercise?

371
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,519
A friend of mine opened a new windsurfing club.

372
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,200
It's in the coastal area of Star City,
really fun.

373
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,880
You'd go with me.

374
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,328
Do I have to pay in advance
to participate in this kind of activity?

375
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:09,000
How much is it? I'll transfer it to you.

376
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,680
It's not much. I'll pay for both of us.

377
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,720
Have you forgotten again?

378
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,352
We agreed not to spend your money.
How much is it?

379
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,319
This windsurfing club

380
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,400
requires a personal trainer
for one-on-one sessions.

381
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,400
6,000 yuan. I know you don't
want to spend my dad's money.

382
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,599
Then just consider this a loan from me for now.

383
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,759
When you get paid, you can treat me
to play something else, okay?

384
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,440
Weiyi, it's not a matter of money,

385
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,640
but the gap between our consumption views.

386
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,359
We're both nearly 30,
and we can't just keep playing around.

387
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,519
We have to think about the future.

388
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,119
I want to save the money,

389
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,400
so when we want to buy a house,

390
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,240
the pressure of the mortgage can be a bit less.

391
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,319
Why are you talking about
the future and the house again?

392
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,208
Are we going to sacrifice our present happiness

393
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,744
for our future house?

394
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:00,928
I have money.

395
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:04,880
Why do I have to worry about
how to spend money?

396
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,599
This is so boring.

397
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,519
I just want you to go windsurfing with me.

398
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,680
Instead, you are overthinking everything.

399
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,279
Talking about financial capacity
and consumption views.

400
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,359
If you don't want to play, just say so.

401
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,200
I didn't say I didn't want to play.

402
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,200
I didn't ask for your company.
I can go by myself.

403
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,160
Weiyi.

404
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,119
Thank you.

405
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,960
Weiyi, will you come again tomorrow?

406
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll come when I'm available.

407
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,640
I think this sport is quite fun.

408
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,880
Right? Do you want to chip in
for the equipment with me?

409
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,240
It's a big gift package.

410
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,160
It includes a sail,
a three-sectioned slender mast,

411
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,319
and mast lifting ropes.

412
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,960
Anyway, it has all the equipment
a beginner needs.

413
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,000
Two-person group gets
a 20% discount, only 4,800 yuan.

414
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,359
We're both nearly 30,
and we can't just keep playing around.

415
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,519
We have to think about the future.

416
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,200
I want to save the money,

417
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,400
so when we want to buy a house,

418
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,936
the pressure of the mortgage can be a bit less.

419
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:04,160
I don't buy it yet.

420
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,960
I'll buy it when I'm sure I really like it.

421
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,039
Alright then, I'll ask someone else.

422
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,079
- Bye.
- Bye.

423
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,279
It's been the whole day,
and he's not even giving me a single message.

424
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,119
He can't really break up with me

425
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,320
over money.

426
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,880
I wonder when

427
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,160
more and more of these things
start to affect our relationship.

428
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,640
Fine, Qi Yu. Since you don't come to me,

429
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,680
then I'll come to you.

430
00:22:52,132 --> 00:22:53,720
[Police]

431
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,240
We agreed to play online games together,

432
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,799
sell the looted equipment and split the money.

433
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,680
Why did it come to this now?

434
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,359
Don't get physical. Come here.

435
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,904
Make sure you understand each other's demands.

436
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:04,920
I can't refuse it.

437
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,799
- You should have told me.
- Calm down.

438
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,839
If you told me, would I not lend it?

439
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,319
That money is partly mine.

440
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,799
That money is partly mine too.

441
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,224
- I find you quite unreasonable now.
- What's the matter?

442
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,400
What makes me unreasonable?

443
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
You are just being unreasonable.

444
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,680
Then why should I have to tell you this?

445
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,000
That's our money.

446
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,799
So tell me, would I not lend it?

447
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,599
Let's go hang out for a while, okay?

448
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,319
Did you respect me?

449
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,599
Calm down, let's talk nicely.

450
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,920
Isn't this money important? You just lend it.

451
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,736
You should tell me in advance.

452
00:23:28,736 --> 00:23:29,880
Then it'd be too late.

453
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,039
Sir.

454
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,000
My son stole my bankbook in the dark.

455
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,319
- Are you guys going to take care of it?
- Yes, yes.

456
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,519
Yes. Write down his situation.

457
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,920
Okay.

458
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,240
Sir, do you think I should lend it?

459
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,032
You haven't eaten all day?

460
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,319
I didn't have time today. I was so busy.

461
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,720
I was supposed to be on the day shift today,

462
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,640
and I was thinking of
picking you up after work.

463
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,400
But when we changed shifts,

464
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,319
my colleague's mom was suddenly
hospitalized with a cerebral infarction.

465
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,920
So I stayed to cover for him.
You're not mad, are you?

466
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,720
It's okay.
I didn't realize your work was so hard.

467
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,880
Today you came at the busiest time.

468
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,984
Normally, there aren't as many people.

469
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,960
Making money is really not easy.

470
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,720
Earning money is definitely not easy.

471
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,640
But serving the people is kind of rewarding.

472
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,000
Busy indeed, but it feels very reassuring.

473
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,319
Feels like I'm getting things done.

474
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,456
That's good then.

475
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,680
I do have a paid job, though.

476
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,880
I've never thought of living
on that 3,000 yuan.

477
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,279
Every time, I spend
whatever amount of money I have.

478
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,799
And I don't think there's any problem.

479
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,480
I'm sorry.

480
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:11,680
I always used to demand of you
according to my standards,

481
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,359
yet never considered your feelings.

482
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,599
Weiyi, don't say that, actually…

483
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,880
I went windsurfing today.

484
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,920
After I played,

485
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,640
I found that it doesn't
seem to be that interesting.

486
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,960
The leather shoes before
and the windsurfing this time

487
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,400
were all things imposed on you by me.

488
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,720
I've thought about it. I was indeed wrong.

489
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:43,480
If there's anything in the future,
let's discuss it together, shall we?

490
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,599
Okay.

491
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,752
Qi.

492
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,400
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

493
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,432
I'm coming.

494
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,519
In fact, after Mr. Jia agreed
to join as a financial expert,

495
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,400
Mr. Xia obviously became more interested.

496
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,680
We have arranged to meet again in five days.

497
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,000
Great! You said last night
that Mr. Xia's attitude has changed.

498
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,599
The head office leadership attaches great importance
to this and asked me to deliver a message to you.

499
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:19,359
They said that the bank
will arrange all relevant departments

500
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,279
to cooperate with this

501
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,440
to help the best proposal execute.

502
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,079
That's what they said.

503
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,599
Seize the opportunity
and give it your all, understand?

504
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,799
Understood. Yu can rest assured.

505
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,440
I will definitely try my best
to facilitate this cooperation.

506
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,599
We agreed to relax together.

507
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,720
He is really so shameless.

508
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,440
And he even brought his own mentor over.

509
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,640
What is this for?

510
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,759
Telling me he went to a better school than me?

511
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:04,160
Don't be angry, Mr. Xing.

512
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,000
The outcome is not certain yet.

513
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,160
I've been thinking these past two days.

514
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,079
Isn't it too hasty to give up

515
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,720
on the project of Weiji?

516
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,160
Yes, if we had found an entry point,

517
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,640
then we Division Two can get the spotlight now.

518
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,264
Hello, Zhang.

519
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,759
Gossip? I definitely have to listen.

520
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,816
Really?

521
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:56,200
I knew it. I am not one to give up easily.

522
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,680
To those things I said no,

523
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,920
no one could make any difference then.

524
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,559
Okay, thank you, Zhang.

525
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,200
I'll treat you to a meal later on. All right.

526
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,039
Mr. Xing, any good news?

527
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,200
I think you got it right.

528
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,960
The head of Weiji Company's overseas
business division is going to resign.

529
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,880
Xia Mingrui has to go there to deal with it
and will leave the day after tomorrow.

530
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,960
His schedule is so full these two days.

531
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,000
So he has no time to see that Ji Yuheng.

532
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,599
Well,

533
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:41,000
the appointment Ji Yuheng has been longing for
might come to nothing.

534
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,599
Xia Mingrui spends
more than half of the year abroad.

535
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:48,920
I don't know how long
he's going to stay abroad this time.

536
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,400
If he ends up staying
for two or three months this time,

537
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,839
then the financing deal could go in vain.

538
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:57,559
Yes. In the sales industry,

539
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,599
delay is the most taboo.

540
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,920
Mr. Ji had a hard time
securing an appointment with him.

541
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,240
No one knows how anxious he might be.

542
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,712
Where are you going?

543
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,832
Go out for a walk.

544
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:19,599
Together.

545
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,704
Wait for me.

546
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,552
Xiaoning.

547
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,279
Do you think you can help him now?

548
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:33,039
I saw you two on the road

549
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,112
the other day.

550
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,279
And you went with him to Jinghai
on the business trip, right?

551
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,359
I know you have a thing for him.

552
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:45,759
Now he's sad about his mom's death

553
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,160
and you got in his heart.

554
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,000
You can't really be that naive
to think he's into you, right?

555
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:57,519
I could leave Dairui just to be with him.

556
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,592
Do you?

557
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,559
Okay, I'll get back to you later.

558
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,200
Please remember to knock before entering.

559
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Senior.

560
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,720
What's wrong?

561
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
I can help with Weiji's matter.

562
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,319
I only found out yesterday

563
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,960
that my dad has recently
gotten involved with Weiji.

564
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,720
I can let you meet him.

565
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,759
The company my dad invested in

566
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,400
is recently helping
the Star City subsidiary of Weiji go public.

567
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,359
Xia Mingrui will stay with them
until he goes to America.

568
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,368
What is the term?

569
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,839
Will you agree to anything?

570
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,720
I will seriously consider anything
within my authority.

571
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,119
I can report those beyond
my authority to the bank.

572
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,400
It's unrelated to work.

573
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,152
Senior, I know
you were in a bad shape a while ago

574
00:30:57,152 --> 00:30:59,240
because of your mom's death.

575
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,119
You need someone
to care about you and be with you.

576
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:04,416
That's how Tu Xiaoning found an opportunity.

577
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:06,279
I can understand all of this.

578
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:08,720
But it's been a long time,

579
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,720
do you want to be stuck in

580
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,640
this meaningless relationship?

581
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
She can't help you at all.

582
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,039
And if your relationship gets out,

583
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,319
it will only be a scandal and ruin your career.

584
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,080
Stay away from Tu Xiaoning,
that's my only term.

585
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,799
If you can do that,

586
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,119
I promise to let you meet Xia Mingrui.

587
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:32,279
And I'll make any other connections

588
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,400
you need.

589
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,680
I will take care of
Weiji company's matter myself,

590
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,759
thank you for your kindness.

591
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,440
Senior, you are a smart person.

592
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,359
It is a critical time
to apply for a new Bank President.

593
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,079
If you fail this time,

594
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:01,519
who knows how many years you'll have to wait.
Don't regret it.

595
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,960
Tang Yuhui, I'll say it one last time.

596
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,599
This is the last time I tolerate you

597
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,400
talking about my personal life
in the workplace.

598
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,880
Mixing the private and the private
are a taboo in the workplace.

599
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,559
I believe you're well aware. Get out.

600
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,640
Did anyone really think

601
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,880
anything good would come out of having

602
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,200
this kind of sneaky, illicit
relationship at the office?

603
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,680
Who are you talking about?

604
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,599
They'd know it. Think about it for yourself.

605
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,680
If there's any problem,
can you handle the consequences?

606
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,672
She knows it?

607
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,160
What's the matter with Tang?

608
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,200
Saying all sorts of odd things suddenly.

609
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,839
Who knows? She's been like this these days.

610
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,872
As if she's gobbled up gunpowder.

611
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,720
Does she know about our thing?

612
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,799
She has told Mr. Ji?

613
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,319
Look at you.

614
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,240
If you're scared, just give up now.

615
00:33:56,672 --> 00:33:58,792
Give up?

616
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,792
What? What's wrong?

617
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,680
Mr. Li, we have discussed
this project for such a long time,

618
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,599
we can't just give up like that, right?

619
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,400
Well. Let's have dinner together after work.

620
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:18,480
Oh my. You're acting weird
early in the morning.

621
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,880
Don't worry about it.

622
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,440
She hasn't told anyone yet.

623
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,599
Besides, she has a thing for your Mr. Ji.

624
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:29,000
If she reveals this matter,

625
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,760
Ji Yuheng would never let her go.

626
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,840
I don't think she's that foolish.

627
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,800
But neither of us dares to bet on it,
especially him.

628
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,320
Others may not understand,
but I know it all too well.

629
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,199
He's had a rough six months.

630
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,400
He's getting a little better in every way now.

631
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,599
I don't want him to get caught up in this.

632
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,504
If she really uses this to ask you

633
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,280
to break up with him, would you?

634
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,599
Of course not.

635
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:55,000
That's settled.

636
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,920
As long as the two of you are determined
to overcome the difficulties together

637
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,519
and work together,

638
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,280
then there's nothing can stop you.

639
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,119
I do get healed by this mindset.

640
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,632
Let me tell you.

641
00:35:13,632 --> 00:35:17,599
If I'd known you guys were so eager
to see that Xia Mingrui,

642
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,599
I'd block him
in front of Jinlinxuan last night.

643
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,000
You saw him last night?

644
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,159
Last night my dad drank too much
at Jinlinxuan. I went to pick him up.

645
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,400
At that entrance,

646
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,800
I saw him and Geng Nianyi
got into the same car.

647
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,639
There's something wrong with these two.

648
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,920
Geng Nianyi?

649
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,679
Is that Geng Nianyi?

650
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,720
Exactly.

651
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,599
Didn't she get married?

652
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,519
There is a rumor
that she married some mysterious man.

653
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:53,960
Maybe that mysterious man is Xia Mingrui.

654
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,519
In a place like Jinlinxuan,

655
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,679
one couldn't even get into the parking lot
if he's not a VIP.

656
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:01,119
Probably she just hasn't been photographed.

657
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,800
Are you sure you didn't see it wrong?

658
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,199
Anyway, they were particularly close.

659
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,920
If they're not a couple,
that's even more problematic.

660
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:22,599
Weiyi, I just got my salary.

661
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,679
I plan to go to the nearby supermarket
to buy some stuff. Will you come with me?

662
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,904
Go ahead.

663
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,079
He has to work the night shift.

664
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,960
If we don't meet at lunch, I'm afraid
we won't see each other again today.

665
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,079
Okay, I got it.

666
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:37,960
Hurry up then, your mind has absent already.

667
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,639
Indeed. I have
the sweetest and most wonderful love

668
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,199
in the world.

669
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,320
Cheesy, off you go.

670
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,559
Alright, then I'm leaving.

671
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,639
Take two aromatherapies.

672
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,039
This can enhance the atmosphere of a home.

673
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,440
And take a kettle.

674
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,800
We should focus on maintaining health.

675
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,559
This is the kind that I use at home.

676
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:15,920
In pretty color. Just looking at it
makes me feel good.

677
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,119
You choose clothes hangers by color, right?

678
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,679
The quality is also good.

679
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:23,920
Don't worry. I'm all tensed up inside.

680
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,119
Everything bought is an essential.

681
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,159
Okay.

682
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,920
Take this too.

683
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,320
Shirts should be hung on this
to avoid wrinkles.

684
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,199
Mr. Policeman's shirts

685
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,800
will certainly be both clean and neat.

686
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,512
Otherwise, if they're wrinkled,
you'll lack authority.

687
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:42,920
Got it. Let's go.

688
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,199
What else do we need?

689
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,639
It seems like we didn't buy laundry detergent.

690
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,800
The laundry detergent I use is especially good.

691
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,360
It leaves a long-lasting
fragrance and is refreshing.

692
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,000
I'll ask Auntie what brand it is.

693
00:37:57,636 --> 00:38:00,360
[3 wide shoulder non-slip hangers 169 yuan]

694
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,520
[5 dopamine color coat hangers 128 yuan]

695
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,536
Got it. Let's go.

696
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,599
The total is 1,385 yuan.

697
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,883
How would you like to pay?

698
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:17,880
Hold on. These items cost over 1,300 yuan?

699
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,800
The aromatherapies and the towel,

700
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,960
- I don't want it. Please return them.
- Okay.

701
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,199
Hold on. Keep it if you like it.

702
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,920
I can use my credit card.

703
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,400
I've thought about it.

704
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,119
I actually don't really need these items.

705
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,136
Return them.

706
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,159
Okay, the total is now 1,160 yuan.

707
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,239
I'll scan you.

708
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,920
Still need over 1,100 yuan?

709
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,360
Here.

710
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Alright, it's okay.

711
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,119
It's my first time
checking the shopping receipt.

712
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,800
The laundry detergent is so expensive.

713
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,000
It's okay, these will last for half a year.

714
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,239
And these chopsticks,

715
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,239
why do they cost 40 yuan?

716
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,679
I might as well use
the disposable chopsticks from takeout.

717
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,800
It's not important. This is eco-friendly.

718
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,840
It's so easy to spend money.

719
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,199
Feels like I didn't buy much.

720
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,000
But a third of your probation salary is gone.

721
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,280
What you bought are all necessities of life,

722
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,039
and I don't have much to spend money on.

723
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,280
The remaining salary is enough for me.

724
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,440
Maybe I can save the rest of the money.

725
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,320
I feel bad about it.

726
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,312
Don't be. I'm fine.

727
00:39:29,312 --> 00:39:34,559
I feel bad about spending money.
So this is what it feels like.

Miss Geng, hello. Sorry to disturb you.

729
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,840
It doesn't work. She meets
so many people every day,

Come here.

Going out?

I'm going out to meet a client.

739

Okay.

Miss Geng, hello.

Thank you.

Hello, what would you like to drink?

744
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:04,760
No, thanks.

745
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,112
Bring her a glass of banana milk.

746
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:07,680
Alright.

747
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,704
Thank you.

748
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:10,519
I should be the one thanking you.

749
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:13,000
You didn't take the money I gave you.

750
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,599
I didn't mean anything else.

751
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:17,440
I just want to sincerely thank you.

752
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,639
I don't like to owe others' favors.

753
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,360
I came here to thank you again sincerely.

754
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,760
Please accept it.

755
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,400
Miss Geng, I really can't accept this money.

756
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,519
Then, Miss Tu, what would you like?

757
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,119
You wouldn't have asked me out
if you didn't want anything.

758
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,032
You go outside and wait for me.

759
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,280
Alright, now you can speak.

760
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,000
Miss Geng, I would like to ask you

761
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,920
to arrange a meeting
between Dairui's Ji Yuheng and Mr. Xia.

765

Ji, what are you up to?

766
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,079
You got up early in the morning today,

767
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,199
washed your hair and got dressed up.

768
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:38,960
You're acting like a peacock.

769
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,152
Did you take a fancy to some girl?

770
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:42,239
Stop it.

771
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:44,679
Don't you want to be a loner?

772
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,360
Hey, wait a moment.

773
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,368
Be careful.

774
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,728
Thank you.

775
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,920
Did you just call me for something?

776
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,239
Nothing. I mistook you for someone else.

Let's go.

778
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,880
Are you okay? You scared me.

779
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,679
- I'm fine.
- What's going on?

780
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,440
Who would do so in broad daylight?
