I have to turn you down.

38
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,976
Are you referring to Bank President Ji?

You know what, Xiaoning?

The first time I saw you,

41
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,840
I saw you fiddling with the printer.

But you're smarter than I imagined.

46
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,759
Following the leader is indeed a shortcut
to climbing up.

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,960
Besides, you're not married yet, are you?

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,280

If you're never satisfied,
I'll have to give up.

There can be no other possibilities.

by following the leader.

That's not only an insult to me
but also to my fiance.

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,840
Hello, this way, please.

183
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,440
When we first met at the matchmaking park,

184
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,600
I thought our meeting was a coincidence.

185
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,720
So you came back specifically for me.

186
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,159
Later, I proposed that I wanted to marry you.

187
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,840
I thought you felt the same way,

188
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,519
thinking the two of us were a good match.

189
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,840
We started a relationship
in a frenzy of wonder.

190
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Is that because we are classmates

191
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,879
and know each other well?

192
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:14,240
Love is not a must in marriage.

193
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,799
Comfort and stability also matter.

194
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,679
In fact, you had made up your mind to marry me

195
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,919
not because we were a good match,
but because you loved me.

196
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,559
These are my documents.

198

200
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,600
and the details of my savings in recent years.

201
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
I know it might be somewhat inappropriate.

202
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,080
But this is the quickest way

203
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,000
for you two to get to know me.

204
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,159
I like you.

205
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,360
I can't stop crying.

206
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,759
It's been such a long time, Mr. Ji.

207
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,039
You have always given me enough space

208
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,240
and a sense of security.

209
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,159
Have you been waiting for the moment
I fall in love with you?

210
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:06,159
So, all of this is not a long-awaited reunion.

211
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,159
You've planned this
for a long time, haven't you?

212
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,400
You fool.

213
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,559
It's a long-awaited reunion.

214
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,159
It's just a bit too long for me.

215
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,440
It's so long that I fear I will miss you.

216
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

217
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,679
I thought
someone else was your unattainable love.

218
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,440
You didn't even explain it to me.

219
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,799
I can't believe you.

220
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,519
I thought our relationship
was getting better and better,

221
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,159
and the youthful stuff could be a secret.

222
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,139
It won't affect our love, anyway.

223
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,848
Besides,

224
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:53,879
Didn't I tell you when it was about Tang Yuhui?

225
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,240
I fell in love with you at first sight.

226
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,440
Has your love at first sight lasted too long?

227
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,759
After so many years, in this relationship,

228
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,400

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,279
Thank you.

364
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,319
One for each.

365
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,440
Two, three, happy marriage.

366
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,528
Happy.

367
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:53,720
Nonsense. My daughter and son-in-law
have only been married for just over a year.

368
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,839
They're good. How could they get a divorce?

369
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:00,079
It's true. I saw them come out
of the Civil Affairs Bureau.

370
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,799
They went their separate ways.

371
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,799
Xu, I know you're sad.

372
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,359
But the kids are grown up.

373
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,000
It's normal not to tell us
before making a decision.

374
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,519
What do I have to be sad about?

375
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:11,759
How can I not know

376
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,079
how their marriage is going?

377
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,960
You made a mistake.

378
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,319
I'll find my daughter right now,

379
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:19,759
take a picture of the marriage certificate,
and send it to you.

380
00:26:20,576 --> 00:26:21,759
Boring.

381
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,816
What the heck?

382
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,839
Where are you going?

383
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,079
I'm going to find Xiaoning.

384
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,000
I'll take a photo of the marriage certificate

385
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,279
to embarrass her.

386
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,279
She was talking nonsense.

387
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,759
Just ignore her.

388
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,039
Fake news can't become true.

389
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,440
She started it.

390
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,640
She talked nonsense. Should I ignore it?

391
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
- Dad.
- Dad, mom.

392
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,200
Dad, mom, we're back.

393
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,920
Did you make anything delicious?

394
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,400
You two…

395
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,680
Look, they're getting along well.

396
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,000
I knew that was not true.

397
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,200
Look how beautiful these flowers are.

398
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,279
It's been so long since I've received flowers.

399
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,759
My daughter and son-in-law are so thoughtful.

400
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,200
As long as you like them.

401
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,256
Put the flowers in a vase.

402
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,400
I'll buy you some later.

403
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,976
Make them look nice.

404
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
Sit.

405
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,119
I need to rest.

406
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,680
It's a long day.

407
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,680
I was so angry.

408
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,839
An absurd thing happened today.

409
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,519
Ms. Zhao, from the building next door,

410
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,759
gave me a call.

411
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,599
She saw you two go to the Civil Affairs Bureau
to get a divorce today.

412
00:27:33,664 --> 00:27:34,680
Ridiculous.

413
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,920
Isn't it? You think so, right?

414
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,680
So I talked back immediately.

415
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,000
How could it be possible?

416
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,312
You two are in a good relationship.

417
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:42,432
Anyway,

418
00:27:42,432 --> 00:27:44,519
give me your marriage certificate.

419
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,519
I must take a photo to embarrass her.

420
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,039
Why are you so quiet?

421
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:07,039
Mom, we indeed went
to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

422
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,432
Why?

423
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:15,599
Dad, mom, there's something

424
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,079
I need to confess to you.

425
00:28:21,588 --> 00:28:24,488
[Tu Xiaoning]

426
00:28:26,068 --> 00:28:28,456
[Ji Yuheng]

427
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:37,119
Dad, mom, about the marriage certificate,

428
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,079
we need to apologize to you.

429
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,200
We should have told you

430
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,519
about this matter.

431
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,839
But a lot of things happened.

432
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,039
We didn't find the right moment to tell you.

433
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,640
However, this year we have come
to understand each other better.

434
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,640
I think we're more responsible
for our marriage.

435
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,728
Yes.

436
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,359
It's a false alarm.

437
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,119
Fortunately, the outcome is good.

438
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,559
Let's not take it to heart anymore.

439
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,672
The outcome is good.

440
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,519
I take it to heart.

441
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,839
My daughter has grown up.

442
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,680
She doesn't tell me anything.

443
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,759
Now she got married without telling me.

444
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,279
In a few years, she might have a daughter

445
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,720
and prevent me from seeing her
when she turns 18.

446
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,856
What?

447
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,400
I feel heartbroken.

448
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,000
Mom, you're overreacting.

449
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,848
I know you lost face

450
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,839
in front of Ms. Zhao.

451
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,519
How about this?

452
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,880
I'll take a photo

453
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,960
and change the date to last year's.

454
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,000
Anyway, we are married. We're not lying.

455
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,079
Saving face is one thing.

456
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,640
Being sad is another.

457
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,968
Anyway, my heart is broken by my daughter.

458
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,408
Mom, don't be sad.

459
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,119
I'm close to tears.

460
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,680
So what can we do to make you feel better?

461
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,160
Don't you know about your mom?

462
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,240
Your mom likes lively occasions.

463
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Think about it. What occasion could be lively?

464
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,519
You two are married now.

465
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,000
Dad, I get it.

466
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,200
Mom.

467
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,720
Let's schedule the wedding as soon as possible.

468
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,000
Schedule it now.

469
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,279
Ji is sensible.

470
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,984
So when?

471
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,119
Mom, you're happy now.

472
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,759
Alright, we'll take care of it
after the annual leave.

473
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,880
Are you satisfied with that?

474
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,079
Okay, it's settled.

475
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,312
Meeting adjourned. You cook.

476
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,768
Let me help you.

477
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,040
Let me show you.

478
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,119
Look at this.

479
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,079
This is the hotel where my colleague's son

480
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,839
held his wedding. Look at the decorations.

481
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,240
Look, it's so beautiful.

482
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,279
This hotel has the biggest feature.

483
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,920
Inside the lobby,

484
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,799
there is a bridge like this.

485
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,400
I have an idea.

486
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,400
You and Ji will walk over this bridge,

487
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,720
walking over the top of everyone's heads.

488
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,559
A meeting on the Magpie Bridge.

489
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,880
Mom, it's inappropriate
to walk over the top of people's heads.

490
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,799
A meeting on the Magpie Bridge?

491
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,920
So, we'd only see each other once a year?

492
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,640
No, I made a mistake.

493
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,920
Anyway, I just think the bridge is beautiful.

494
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,799
By then, you dress up beautifully.

495
00:32:01,524 --> 00:32:03,359
[Moments]

496
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,279
The official designated exclusive partner.

497
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,160
My love for you has no expiration date.

498
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,359
No revocation needed. Never change.

499
00:32:19,296 --> 00:32:20,640
- Good morning.
- Tu.

500
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,400
Congratulations.

501
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,839
Thank you all.

502
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:30,039
Congratulations to Tu and Mr. Ji.

503
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,440
Tu, when will we give the wedding red envelope?

504
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,799
We've all prepared it.

505
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,319
Xu Li, forget the wedding red envelope.

506
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,960
If Zhao were here,
he'd criticize you for instigating this.

507
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,039
Here is the thing.

508
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,160
No rush to give it.

509
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,279
I'll send the QR code to the chat group.

510
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,519
All of you.

511
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,336
Alright, let's wish Tu…

512
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:53,864
Happy marriage.

513
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,760
What's going on with Mr. Fu Junior?

514
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,848
He suddenly told me

515
00:33:06,848 --> 00:33:09,160
he would not work with us.

516
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,640
Close the door and sit.

517
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,599
Okay, I see. Thank you.

518
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,319
Mr. Fu Junior has announced

519
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,519
to find a new partner.

520
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,640
I'm sorry, Jing.

521
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,960
The deal failed because of me.

522
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,400
Please don't say that.

523
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,799
It's not your fault, and neither is Mr. Ji.

524
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,688
Sadly, I just wasn't there.

525
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:39,720
If I were there,

526
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,119
I would slap him hard.

527
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,519
A pregnant woman can be tough.

528
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,079
Alright, calm down.

529
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:49,680
But indeed, a big client is lost

530
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
because of me.

531
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,960
If I landed the deal,

532
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,160
you would have been promoted
to department manager smoothly.

533
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,000
Who would have thought…

534
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,839
I'm experiencing high hormones
during pregnancy.

535
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,799
Don't make me upset, okay?

536
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,680
Being promoted is my business.

537
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,904
I don't need you

538
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,799
to give your all for me.

539
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:07,720
And I don't need you as a bargaining chip

540
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,960
to gain benefits for me.

541
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,079
If you did this,

542
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,599
I'll be the first one to scold you.

543
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,119
Just ignore Mr. Fu Junior.

544
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,960
He has ill intentions
and threatens his partners.

545
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,159

Actually, it's a pity.

You used the performance
of the next six months as a pledge

to get the preferential interest rate.

In this industry,

we normally negotiate for the best rates
during the pricing stage

579

after the initial establishment
of business relations.

580

For the rat Fu Yijun,

581
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,039
you applied to the head office for this rate.

582
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,119
Ultimately, the deal failed.
