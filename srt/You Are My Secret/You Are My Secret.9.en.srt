00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,679
I took four hours off just to see a doctor,

181
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,639
but without the medicine,
how am I supposed to go back to work?

182
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,879
Right.

183
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,879
Once this news gets out,

184
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,559
other banks will definitely
try to snatch this client.

185
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,440
And they are strong in this aspect.

186
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,039
So you must handle this well here.

187
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,080
I'll go talk to the dean.

188
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,120
Okay.

189
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,279
Hold on.

190
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,120
- Our settlement system…
- What's going on?

191
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,080
Please calm down.

192
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,240
Everyone, please calm down
and listen to me, okay?

193
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,559
Thank you. I'm an employee from Dairui.

194
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,919
Our bank is responsible
for this hospital's system.

195
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,080
I'm sorry about the situation to happen today.

196
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,679
I sincerely apologize to you all.

197
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,320
And I hope you can all forgive us.

198
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,279
Our techs have confirmed it.

199
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,879
In at most 15 minutes.

200
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,320
It will be resolved in at most 15 minutes.

201
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,200
- We've been waiting for so long.
- Yes, yes.

202
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,960
I'm very sorry.

203
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,000
To apologize, I've got
a thermos cup for everyone.

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,799
You can all get one.

205
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,080
Who wants the thermos cup?

206
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,159
I need to make the payment
and get back to work.

207
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,039
How about this? Give me your prescriptions,

208
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,720
and I'll send them to the pharmacy.

209
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,960
Once the system is fixed,

210
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,120
you can get your medicine
as soon as you pay, is it okay?

211
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,559
Then hurry up.

212
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,759
Okay, thank you.

213
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,792
Hurry, hurry up.

214
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:18,848
I need to find the doctor.

215
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:19,872
Okay, okay.

216
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,039
Thank you, thank you all
for your understanding.

217
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,368
Do you need help?

218
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:23,799
- No.
- Hello, madam.

219
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,759
Are you the doctor who just treated me?

220
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,120
- Yes, yes.
- How would I take this medicine?

221
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,200
You can't take this one.

222
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,399
Twice a day, more than ten hours apart.

223
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,840
Is that all? Thank you, everyone.

224
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,096
Take it with meals to protect your stomach.

225
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:34,159
- Okay.
- But the doctor just said

226
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,120
that my personal account
of the health insurance card has no money.

227
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,600
What does it mean?

228
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
You may need to activate it.

229
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,480
Okay, thank you.

230
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,399
Come on, don't rush.

231
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,600
You can all have one.
Those who haven't got it, come here.

232
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Doctor, please prescribe these medicines first.

233
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
They'd come to collect them
after they have paid.

234
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,240
- Okay.
- Thank you.

235
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
It's fixed.

236
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,399
It's fixed?

237
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,519
Thank you.

238
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,600
Liu Xiaoqian.

239
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,768
Mine, mine.

240
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:10,840
Here's your medicine.

241
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,639
Ma Qiang, here you are.

242
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,480
How is it, is it resolved?

243
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,519
After all, I have been
a lobby manager for three years.

244
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,039
I can handle this kind of thing well.

245
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,168
What about you, Jing?

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,879
After all, I'm the best
in Development Department Division One.

247
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,559
I have handled this kind of thing before.

248
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,000
As a staff I've led, you've done well.

249
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,159
I heard that your ex-boyfriend
has helped a lot this time.

250
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,519
Thank you for today.

251
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,799
You're welcome. May I invite you for a coffee?

252
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,720
I don't expect anything in return

253
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,600
for doing you a little favor.

254
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,679
I just want to talk to you.

255
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,936
It's almost time to get off work.

256
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:49,600
It depends on you.

257
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,519
See you next time, Dr. Lu.

258
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,544
Bye, Jing.

259
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,799
Alright then.

260
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,279
I'll go change my clothes first.

261
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,280
See you downstairs.

262
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,720
Have you resolved it?
Let's have dinner together tonight.

263
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:19,720
Later, perhaps.
I have things to talk to Lu Sijing.

264
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,720
Mom, have you received
this month's living expenses?

265
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,799
Okay, yes. I've transferred a bit more. Bye.

266
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,559
Ms. Rao, you're so dedicated.

267
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,919
You've come back from the hospital
even after work hours.

268
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,952
To get some documents.

269
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,080
Right, I haven't congratulated you
on receiving the Outstanding Individual Award.

270
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,416
That's a compliment, right?

271
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,600
Look, you made me get goose bumps.

272
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,080
After so many years,

273
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,080
you're not just a nobody in the workplace,

274
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,279
kind of a worthy opponent for me.

275
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,248
Congratulations.

276
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,519
Alright, then I'll take that
as a compliment too.

277
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,616
Thank you.

278
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,264
Thank you.

279
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,240
Black coffee with lemon,
sandwich without mayonnaise.

280
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,000
Thank you for remembering my taste.

281
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,039
I used to ignore a lot of things.

282
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,840
But now that I've come back and met you again,

283
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,720
things from the past
have surged forth like the tide.

284
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,320
What you like

285
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,879
and what kind of life you really want to live,

286
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,360
I've only realized them now.

287
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,600
That's because you've realized
your dream of becoming a doctor,

288
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,279
so love has been elevated

289
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,320
becoming a bit more important.

290
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,639
Xiaoning, you might have
really misunderstood me.

291
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,928
I was under a lot of pressure abroad
by myself at that time.

292
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:06,016
But that doesn't mean I didn't care…

293
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:09,640
Let bygones be bygones.

294
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,279
You know,

295
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,759
medical students are eligible for admission
to hospitals only if they study further.

296
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,359
I've tried my best

297
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,799
to have a foreign university accept me.

298
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,039
They have the most advanced technology

299
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,880
and the research subjects
I've been dreaming of.

300
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,519
I have to graduate with top grades

301
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,640
to stay.

302
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,759
That's my only chance.

303
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,599
I know it and understand you.

304
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,279
Now your dream has come true,

305
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,759
so all the past efforts have not been in vain.

306
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,839
As your old classmate,
I'm really happy for you.

307
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,880
Xiaoning.

308
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,720
I know I'm being quite annoying
by pestering you like this.

309
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,000
But I want to fight for it one more time.

310
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,680
Give me one more chance, okay?

311
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,400
Sorry, I can't give you this chance.

312
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,480
We'll never work out anymore.

313
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,599
I stayed here today to tell you,

314
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,160
thank you for being with me for seven years.

315
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,319
We have so many beautiful memories.

316
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,599
I want us to part on good terms.

317
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:43,519
I will have my new life.

318
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,559
So will you.

319
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,400
But we'll never work out anymore.

320
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,680
Can you understand what I mean?

321
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:02,240
I think I really messed up our future.

322
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:06,720
If I hadn't left,

323
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,599
or had come back to find you earlier,

324
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,799
perhaps everything between us
would have been different.

325
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,936
Perhaps.

326
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,688
No one

327
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:21,920
will always stand in the same place
waiting for another person.

328
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,480
Besides, I have someone I like now.

329
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,448
Ji Yuheng?

330
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:30,480
Yes.

331
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,240
Our bank does not allow the office romance,

332
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,599
and we are in the same department.

333
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,519
It's not okay to tell others.

334
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,000
But I think that I should have let you know.

335
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,160
♫ The silent, everlasting promise ♫

336
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,240
Sorry, I have to go.

337
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,000
I wish you all the best in the future, goodbye.

338
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,128
Goodbye.

339
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,319
What are you doing here?

340
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,359
I came to the hospital to see my mom.

341
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,040
Done talking?

342
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,359
Why do you seem a bit upset?

343
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,200
Just remembering things from the past.

344
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,599
I can't tell you I've forgotten everything,

345
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,359
but rest assured, I will handle it very well.

346
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,839
It's all in the past now. Let's go see my mom.

347
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,079
Okay.

348
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,184
Let's go.

349
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:42,440
[Xinchao Liu's Steamed Dumplings]

350
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,520
Alright.

351
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,039
Okay, why did you order so much?

352
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,839
Didn't you have enough for dinner?

353
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,848
I didn't have dinner.

354
00:21:50,848 --> 00:21:53,079
You didn't eat?

355
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,519
That's perfect, I'll join you.

356
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,960
These three flavors are all your favorites.

357
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,799
How do you know?

358
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,200
Did you notice me back then?

359
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,519
You were the school hunk in school.

360
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:07,119
The girls would often talk about you.

361
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,559
It's hard not to notice you.

362
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,720
Now that you mention it, I do recall

363
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,440
there was this one time,

364
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,680
you were waiting for someone at our class door,

365
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,359
and then you turned and ran away
after you saw me.

366
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,519
Were you waiting for me?

367
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,440
No, no, I wasn't waiting for you.

368
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,079
Then why did you run?

369
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:38,039
I was indeed waiting for you.

370
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,200
But I was asked to do so.

371
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,119
My desk mate wanted me
to send you a love letter for her.

372
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,160
Delicious?

373
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Are you happy eating something delicious?

374
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,519
What's wrong? Why are you so down today?

375
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,319
Even your mom has noticed it.

376
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,559
What? Does it have something to do with me?

377
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,519
Nothing.

378
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,319
Don't just eat. I'm talking to you.

379
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:10,472
What did I do?

380
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,799
Actually, I've been thinking

381
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,440
we started based on being suitable.

382
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,279
What about now? Is it still the same?

383
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,368
♫ Say something to myself ♫

384
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:41,824
♫ Among these memories ♫

385
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:48,356
♫ Life is not always smooth sailing ♫

386
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:51,488
♫ Say something to myself ♫

387
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:55,072
♫ I know you've tried your best ♫

388
00:23:55,072 --> 00:24:00,640
♫ Don't be afraid, just be yourself ♫

389
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,720
Now I think we're getting along really well.

390
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,664
But…

391
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,752
Let's eat. I don't want to hear you finish.

392
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:17,120
♫ Till you say ♫

393
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,936
♫ The strongest part of you ♫

394
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,079
It's this street.

395
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,440
A lot of girls were waiting here at that time

396
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,680
just to see you.

397
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,599
Sometimes they had to wait for half an hour.

398
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,784
So you were one of them?

399
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:36,599
No.

400
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,160
I still don't understand

401
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,759
why they had to wait so long

402
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,319
just to see you.

403
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,960
It wouldn't make you theirs.

404
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,559
That makes sense.

405
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,039
Well,

406
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,920
what would they think

407
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,920
if they knew we were together now?

408
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,559
I'm yours anyway. They can't take me from you.

409
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,279
Since we're already here,

410
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,000
how about getting in?

411
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,052
Is it okay? I wonder if security allows us.

412
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:13,000
[Campus Security]

413
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,000
Follow me.

414
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,208
Be careful.

415
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,279
This place is…

416
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,400
I used to see the most beautiful sunset

417
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,960
in the world from this place.

418
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,240
I remember it.

419
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,559
You were sitting there before.

420
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,799
I thought you were going to commit suicide

421
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:54,279
and I even went over to hold you.

422
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,920
You told me to take care of myself,

423
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,519
so I could see the sun shine through.

424
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,079
At that time, I wasn't…

425
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,960
Alright, stop it.

426
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,319
I found out later
you weren't going to jump off.

427
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,640
I was so young back then.
I had been thinking wild.

428
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,160
How come you still remember
such an embarrassing thing?

429
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,928
Of course.

430
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,119
Xiaoning, actually…

431
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:36,279
You don't have to comfort me. I'm really fine.

432
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
You know

433
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,680
there's not only one person
can see how amazing you are.

434
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,319
Anyway, I've thought it through.

435
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,799
He always talked about
how many years we had been together

436
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,519
and how he liked me for many years,

437
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,559
and how many good memories we had.

438
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,119
And he didn't do what he said,

439
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,160
to cherish our relationship

440
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,640
and put our love first.

441
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,319
I don't have any affection for him anymore.

442
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,559
It's all in the past.

443
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,000
Let bygones be bygones.

444
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,720
Don't let it affect us now.

445
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,928
Come on.

446
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,559
Someone will set off fireworks, right?

447
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,920
Xiaoning, if I tell you
I've secretly loved you for ten years,

448
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,119
would it also be a pressure to you?

449
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,920
But never mind. Let bygones be bygones.

450
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,799
We can create new memories together.

451
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,039
Will this Lu Sijing

452
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,400
become furious because I rejected him

453
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,839
and report me and Ji Yuheng?

454
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,359
He shouldn't be that bad.

455
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,400
But I can't bet both of our futures

456
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,920
on him, what if…

457
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,160
Xiaoning, let me do it.

458
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,799
No need, it's not my turn to clean today.

459
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,760
Are you sure?

460
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:14,088
Sorry.

461
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:19,039
I want to discuss something with you.

462
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,680
The two of us should set a protocol.

463
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,519
Look. We spend little time together.

464
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,680
It's difficult to understand each other.

465
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,039
And we are working together,

466
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,799
which makes it easier
to have misunderstandings.

467
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,039
I think the two of us

468
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,279
should set a new way of communication

469
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:39,759
to separate our roles in private life
from those at work.

470
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:42,799
Otherwise, it is easy
to creates disputes over time.

471
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,920
That makes sense.

472
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,720
Private life and work should be separate.

473
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,079
Then you go first.

474
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,680
If we argue privately,

475
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,519
we can't affect the work.

476
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,680
I believe that Mr. Ji will never

477
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,440
do things with grudges, right?

478
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,880
We can't be emotional.

479
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Of course, then I'll also make one.

480
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,119
Okay.

481
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:06,559
Don't call me Mr. Ji anymore after work.

482
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,440
If you have anything against me at work,

483
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,720
you can't bring that into our private life.

484
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,799
And don't get mad at me about work.

485
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,000
So, at work, it's Mr. Ji and Tu.

486
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,160
And at home, it's Tu and Ji.

487
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,279
Okay, Mr. Ji.

488
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,960
No, Ji.

489
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,200
Since the two of us live under the same roof,

490
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,000
it's inevitable that our living expenses
will get mixed together.

491
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,039
Well, there should be someone
in charge of the money.

492
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:40,039
Sounds like you want
to take charge of the money.

493
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,119
No, no.

494
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,359
I think you are more experienced
in this aspect.

495
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:56,200
[Your account 2359 received an online bank transfer
totaling RMB 30,000 at 8:19 on November 4, 2023]

496
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,319
What's this?

497
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,599
These are all my current savings.

498
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,279
And I have invested a portion
in financial products.

499
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,599
I'll sort it out and send it to you later.

500
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,559
I'll associate my pay card
directly to your phone later.

501
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,480
The passcode is the same as the lock code.

502
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,519
Are you sure you want me to manage the money?

503
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,568
Any problem?

504
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,319
No, if I were to manage the money,

505
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,079
should I give you
the living expenses each month?

506
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:25,319
Then how much would you like?

507
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,200
Living doesn't cost money.

508
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,256
Clothing, Food, Travel,

509
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,119
and I need to go fishing
with the Bank President occasionally.

510
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,519
That's all of my expenses.

511
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,680
Just give what you think is appropriate.

512
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Don't you have any entertainment?

513
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,279
You need some for that, right?

514
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,079
How much would you like?

515
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,039
Then whether I have any entertainment
depends on you.

516
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,279
But honestly,

517
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,960
I really want to go somewhere with me.

518
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,136
Where?

519
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,728
It's quite crowded there.

520
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,559
Ji, you used to come here often?

521
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,799
The first time.

522
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,880
What a coincidence. It's also my first time.

523
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,599
So you'll think of me

524
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,359
whenever you want to go camping?

525
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,168

♫ We know there's a new beginning in life ♫

♫ Chasing happiness with all my heart ♫

542
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,680
Why are you so good at this?

543
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,599
You can do it without even reading the manual.

544
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,296
Thank you.

545
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,159
Sometimes I think,

546
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,639
I'm only a year younger than you,

547
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,639
why do I always feel
that you are much more mature than me

548
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,639
and know more than I do? You know everything.

549
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,639
If you say so,

550
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,920
it's probably because
I have more social experience.

551
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,559
Tell me more.

552
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,159
Since I was very young,

553
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,519
I began to live on my own.

554
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:32,840
I did my own laundry and cooked.

555
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,960
I remember it was during my freshman year,

556
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,239
I would use my spare time to do internships.

557
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,599
Securities firms, banks, investment banks,

558
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,039
I've been to them all.

559
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,400
And then later on, I went abroad
for postgraduate studies.

560
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,960
I interned on Wall Street for a while.

561
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,239
So if you say so,

562
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,320
it's that my social experience is indeed
richer than the average person.

563
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,400
You had such a full schedule.

564
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,360
So you didn't have any spare time life
when you were in college?

565
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,119
Reading, listening to music,
and playing basketball, do they count?

566
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:10,199
No. I mean, playing video games
or going to Internet cafes.

567
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,800
Internet cafes?

568
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,199
Yeah, back in my college days,

569
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:18,016
those guys in my class would often spend
the night at internet cafes playing games.

570
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,136
I didn't.

571
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,728
Self-discipline.

572
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:31,599
Did you have a relationship
when you were in college?

573
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,768
I didn't.

574
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,280
Then, did you have a crush on anyone?

575
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,840
Don't tell me you didn't even
have a crush on anyone.

576
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,280
Of course I did.

577
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,320
Then why didn't you
have a relationship with her?

578
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,760
Didn't you confess or pursue her?

579
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,760
Actually, when I wanted to confess,

580
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,840
she already had a boyfriend.

581
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,400
So she never knew that you liked her.

582
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,408
No.

583
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,679
What a pity.

584
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,480
Why?

585
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,800
I feel pity for that girl.

586
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,079
You're that outstanding.

587
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,280
What a pity she missed you.

588
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,400
You said I know everything,

589
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,519
but I don't.

590
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,400
Actually, I've always thought
of myself as an average person.

591
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,880
My father passed away early,

592
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,199
and my mother fell ill.

593
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,440
So there's a lot I don't know.

594
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,920
After graduation,

595
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,039
I must continuously
accumulate experience and keep learning,

596
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:55,599
so there's no time for anything else.

597
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,519
So no one can succeed easily.

598
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:05,639
Look at you.

599
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,320
You've achieved a lot at your age.

600
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,360
It's all because you climbed up step by step

601
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,119
by making great efforts.

602
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,639
Others only see your glamorous side,

603
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:23,360
but they can't see the hardships
behind it, including me.

604
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:30,800
Ji, thank you for sharing this with me.

605
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,639
I feel like I know you a little better.

606
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,920
Actually, I should be the one thanking you

607
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,599
for being willing to know my story.

608
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,192
I'll finish it.

609
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:02,239
Ji Yuheng,
when I accompanied you to meet clients,

610
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,239
weren't you good at holding your liquor?

611
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:06,639
We've only had a few bottles of beer.

612
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,432
Oh my.

613
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,079
Ji Yuheng, didn't you bring two sleeping bags?

614
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,119
I remember bringing two sleeping bags.

615
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,239
Where has it gone?

616
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,360
Can't believe it.

617
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,119

I don't remember anything.

However, I didn't black out last night.

What did I say?

656
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,440
You said I am nice and handsome,

Impossible. I would never say so.

662
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:52,800
