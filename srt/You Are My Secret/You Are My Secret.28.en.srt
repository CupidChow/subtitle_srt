[Episode 28]

32
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,120
Starting from today, I'll be acting
as the interim General Manager.

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,376
I'd like to introduce Yuan Lang
and Ren Tingting.

34
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,400
Account Manager. Let's get to know each other.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,079
Hello, I am Ren Tingting.

36
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,760
Hello, I am Yuan Lang.

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,079
Let's assign the work.

38
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,640
First, Xu Li.

39
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,680
You talk to Tang
about Shunjue's deposits for next quarter.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,920
Who?

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,120
You heard me.

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,359
Tang?

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,120
Listen, don't mix personal feelings into this.

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,480
Performance comes first. Got it?

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,719
Okay.

46
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,080
Li Xiang, you follow up on the loan
for the foreign trade company

47
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,176
south of the city.

48
00:02:10,176 --> 00:02:11,280
Okay.

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,080
Xiaoning.

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,400
It's about the domestic letter of credit
for small and micro enterprises.

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
They think our quotation is too high

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,919
and want to apply for a discount.

53
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,400
You check if there is any room

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,464
for a discount.

55
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:23,599
Alright, Jing.

56
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
Ms. Rao, about the letter of credit,

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,840
I've worked on a few cases
with the manager at the branch office.

58
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,199
Would you consider me for this?

59
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,639
You two just joined our department.

60
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,840
Get familiar with the new environment first.

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,400
Well, since you are so ambitious,

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,639
you work on that case with Xiaoning.

63
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,039
- Okay.
- Okay.

64
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Good for you, sir.

65
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,759
You refuse to repay the principal,
pay the interest, or negotiate.

66
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,360
And you're not afraid of being a deadbeat.

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,599
In my opinion, you are just hoping for luck,

68
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,800
thinking that the bank

69
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,039
wouldn't care about this small amount of money.

70
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,919
Nor would it sue you.

71
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,159
But don't forget.

72
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,080
The bank is not a pushover, after all.

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,560
Besides suing, the court can force a sale

74
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,680
to recover our losses.

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,360
Your aquaculture base

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,919
is managed well.

77
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,400
If it's put up for auction,

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,496
it might fetch a good price.

79
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:19,639
If you don't repay the money,

80
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,639
we can directly sell your things

81
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,680
or recover the loans

82
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,680
from your third-party properties

83
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,360
by exercising the right of recourse.

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Here's my advice.

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,560
Either way, it's not good for you.

86
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,936
You'll find it hard to work on fish farming

87
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:37,960
in the future.

88
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,136
So think it through.

89
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,759
Hey, honey, I just left Ji's company.

90
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,759
His Account Manager needs

91
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,599
to take the elderly at home
to Beijing for medical treatment.

92
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,840
I have to work here for two months.

93
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,360
The salary is quite high.

94
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,159
How about you, Ms. Rao?
Was your first day on duty smooth?

95
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh, you only had a steamed bun this morning.

96
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
You must be hungry by now.

97
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,280
I'll bring you cheese pastries.

98
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,000
Alright, I'm not hungry.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I won't eat. Stop nagging me.

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,039
I'm discussing work with Xiaoning.

101
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,080
Hold on, don't order takeout.

102
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
I'll bring you food.

103
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,199
I'll make scallion braised pork chops,
minced pork with eggplant,

104
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,959
and Hangzhou cabbage.
I'll try to make the food light.

105
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,560
I'll give you a balanced diet
without making you fat.

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,439
Okay, got it. As you wish.

107
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,879
So sweet.

108
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,120
You kidding? Guess what he said to me.

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,240
He told me not to tire myself out.
Is it possible?

110
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,319
In a few months, my belly will start to show.

111
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,079
I'll have to give birth.

112
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,160
I have to achieve something before that.

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,720
Otherwise, I could lose my position
as acting manager.

114
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,519
Marriage and childbearing
are the biggest obstacles for women

115
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,000
in the workplace.
I'm personally experiencing how hard it is.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,439
No need to be so anxious.

117
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,360
Jing, don't worry. With your ability,

118
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,959
you'll be the formal general manager.

119
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,319
Besides, you have us as your right-hand men.

120
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,680
What are you worried about?

121
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,279
Yes. I hope so.

122
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,279
I need to discuss with you
about the letter of credit.

123
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,839
If we can't compete with state-owned banks,

124
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,160
we should change the mode of cooperation.

125
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,160
Mr. Ji, will he start repaying the interest
from next week?

126
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,319
How did you persuade him?

127
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,680
Every time we talked to him before,
he kept silent.

128
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,160
No matter what we said, he never responded.

129
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,279
I did some research on him before I came.

130
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,240
He's a local person, deeply rooted here.

131
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,920
He has no fixed assets outside the village.

132
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,319
When you deal with him,

133
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,839
it's useless to talk about defaulters,
restricting his high expenditure,

134
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,680
or stopping him from taking planes.

135
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,879
The thing he cares about the most
is the entry point for negotiation.

136
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,040
Impressive, Mr. Ji.

137
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,639
You know about negotiation and psychology.

138
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,519
With you in our branch,

139
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,120
the bad debts can be fixed.

140
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,240
You've worked hard.

141
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,519
Get some coffee after we return
to the office. It's my treat

142
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,720
- Thank you, Mr. Ji.
- Let's go.

143
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,456
Coffee.

144
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,920
[American Coffee]

145
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:27,048
[Latte]

146
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:29,672
[Development Department Division One,
Tu Xiaoning]

147
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,920
Why did you buy so much coffee?

148
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,040
It's to show you I've been thinking about you.

149
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,879
So are you trying to have me bribe colleagues?

150
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,720
I want to bribe them.

151
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,120
When I'm not with you,

152
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,519
let them say something nice about me to you.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,720
They haven't returned yet.

154
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,920
Have some coffee.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,720
So much coffee.

156
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,000
This was sent by a client?

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,440
How dare I accept coffee from a client?

158
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,600
I'll take it myself.

159
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,639
Sent by the former boss.

160
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,720
Mr. Ji? I knew he was still thinking about us.

161
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,079
By comparison, Zhao is stingier.

162
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,160
He makes me deliver meals to Jing every day

163
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,240
but never buys me a meal.

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,399
Mr. Ji is really a good man.

165
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,360
During work, you're still on his mind,
and he even cares about those around you.

166
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,040
Your relationship with him
is even sweeter than coffee.

167
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Such a good liar.

168
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,240
Be careful, or I'll tell Zhao.

169
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,279
Back already? Have some coffee.

170
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,839
What's the special occasion today?
There's even coffee to drink.

171
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,920
Sent by the former boss.

172
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,680
Come on. Let's share.

173
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,160
- Thank you.
- We'll take this.

174
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,879
Take this.

175
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,720
This coffee smells good.

176
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,319
In terms of seniority,
we are on par with Tu Xiaoning.

177
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,000
Is it proper to let her lead us?

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,199
Tu has quite strong capabilities.

179
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,079
She is the one who infiltrated Weiji.

180
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,639
We will surely learn something from her.

181
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,800
You're too naive.

182
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,560
It's not certain
whether she infiltrated Weiji or not.

183
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,519
Mr. Ji is her boyfriend. Remember?

184
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,639
He could share his dividends
and performance with her.

185
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,240
Now Mr. Ji has been transferred
to the countryside because of their matter.

186
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,776
She can't accomplish anything now.

187
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:33,600
Chitchatting?

188
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,240
Tu.

189
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,519
If you're drinking his coffee, stop gossiping
about his girlfriend.

190
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,960
I'll handle the work
on the letters of credit this afternoon.

191
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,679
Yuan Lang, if you have time, come with me.

192
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,480
Yes.

193
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,000
The Shentong Bank is right across the street.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,960
We'll meet the client here.

195
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,000
Aren't you afraid the client will head straight
to the bank across the street?

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm not meeting with the client
but Shentong's Account Manager.

197
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,759
I've talked to the international department
about the letter of credit.

198
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,840
Even if we waive the handling fees,

199
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,759
our prices will not

200
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,600
be more competitive
than the state-owned Shentong Bank's.

201
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,759
One of the reasons
companies choose letters of credit

202
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,360
is to manage cash flow
and control corporate cost spending.

203
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,039
Since we can't save them money,

204
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,559
they will find other partners.

205
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,200
But we can't just give clients away like this.

206
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,759
Who told you?

207
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,159
We're looking to collaborate.

208
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,840
I've discussed it with Ms. Rao.

209
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,360
By partnering with Shentong,
we exchange clients with them.

210
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,720
This way, we can help clients
save money on financial expenses

211
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,096
and also do a favor for Shentong.

212
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:46,679
Naturally, they are willing
to exchange with us enterprises

213
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:49,039
that are hard to deal with for them.

214
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,679
This is a mutual benefit and a virtuous cycle.

215
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,720
Hello.

216
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,879
- Hello.
- Mr. Qiao?

217
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,552
Yes, hello, I am Qiao Mu.

218
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:00,799
I'm pleased to work with you.

219
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,559
Hello, Tu Xiaoning, have a seat.

220
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,600
This is my colleague, Yuan Lang.

221
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Hello.

222
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,120
We have communicated
about the small and micro enterprise

223
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,879
that wants to apply for credit loans.

224
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,720
You are already aware of that.

225
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,264
May I know about the enterprise you want

226
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,159
to exchange with us?

227
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,720
The client deals with bedding products.

228
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,360
The factory has been mortgaged to us.

229
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,399
They want to use the land behind the factory

230
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,960
as collateral to apply for a loan.

231
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,960
But Shentong can't
offer them the interest rate they want.

232
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,679
Have you checked their tax system?

233
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,240
Of course, their company is formal
in financial matters.

234
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
If you think there are no issues,

235
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,639
we can begin by collecting information
for reporting and approval.

236
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,360
While applying for granting credit,
they claim incentives from the bank.

237
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,279
Once the credit is granted,

238
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,000
if they find the interest rate suitable,
then proceed to withdraw funds.

239
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,519
- What do you think?
- No problem.

240
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,080
- I'll handle the letter of credit.
- Okay.

241
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
I'll send you the company tax invoice
as soon as possible.

242
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,240
Ms. Tu, thank you for giving me the client.

243
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,279
I've completed an assignment target.

244
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,320
Don't mention it.
Our prices indeed have no advantage.

245
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,600
If we do it this way,

246
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,679
it can save the company
a large amount of expenditure.

247
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,039
We did it all for the client.

248
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,159
We're helping each other, actually.

249
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,360
Okay, let us cooperate more in the future.

250
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,720
Okay.

251
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,440
When we were on our way back,

252
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,279
Yuan Lang apologized to me,

253
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,240
saying he shouldn't have thought of me
that way.

254
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,200
Actually, I am quite capable,

255
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,639
not the kind who depends on men.

256
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,559
So what did you say?

257
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,360
I told him

258
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,279
that you and I were both capable,

259
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,279
and no one could beat us if we worked together.

260
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,368
Did you really say that?

261
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,399
Of course not. That sounds stupid.

262
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,720
But that's what I think.

263
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,799
That's what I think too.

264
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,159
In my eyes, you are the most outstanding person
in the world.

265
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,279
It's their loss
for not recognizing your true value.

266
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,919
The Account Manager from Shentong
praised me like that today as well.

267
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,600
His name is Qiao Mu. Do you know him?

268
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,960
I hear he's one of the four handsome men
in Shentong.

269
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,679
Really? Is he as handsome as me?

270
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,080
He's a little handsome.

271
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,679
A little?

272
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,519
Do you know how much I missed you today?

273
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,399
Rest assured, I'll be transferred back
as soon as possible.

274
00:12:52,676 --> 00:12:55,212
[Survey report on customer classification
and credit line approval of Hongda Bedding]

275
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,080
Xiaoning, I'm here to deliver the materials.

276
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,519
I'll wait for you in the parking lot.

277
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,519
Wait a moment. I'm coming down.

278
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,560
Qiao Mu.

279
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,159
Try the coffee from the new coffee shop.

280
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,960
Sorry for making you spend money.

281
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,279
Mr. Ji? What brings you here?

282
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,799
I have to complete some transfer procedures.
And you?

283
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,159
Hello, Mr. Ji. I'm Qiao Mu from Shentong.

284
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,240
We have similar tastes.

285
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,279
A new coffee shop.

286
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,639
I bought you coffee from this shop yesterday.
How did it taste?

287
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,440
Not bad.

288
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,679
Mr. Ji, would you like to try it?

289
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,360
I'm feeling a bit sleepy after driving here.

290
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,016
Thank you.

291
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,399
About the documents required
for the letter of credit,

292
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,240
I've organized them all
according to your requirements.

293
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,759
Later on, I will send you

294
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,000
a scanned copy of the presentation letter.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,248
I will send the original copy to you later.

296
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:22,304
Thank you.

297
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:24,120
Okay, I won't disturb you.

298
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,840
I have to go.

299
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,976
Thanks.

300
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,600
Is he one of the four handsome men in Shentong?

301
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,720
Since Zhao works in Shentong,
he's the most handsome man.

302
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,960
You don't wear a ring at work, do you?

303
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,559
Why are you wearing it?

304
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:46,399
I'm doing it on purpose.
That's what a married man should do.

305
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,799
Weren't you doing this too obviously?

306
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,912
Not at all.

307
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,879
Whose car are you driving?

308
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,080
Yours.

309
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,600
Mine?

310
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:04,840
It's for you. I just received a bonus.

311
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,120
Why did you spend money recklessly?

312
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,440
No, I didn't. You need a car now.

313
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,399
I know the dealer for this car.

314
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,679
That's why I chose this one.

315
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,600
The vehicle registration and driving license
are in the storage box.

316
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,159
The daily necessities like wipes
and tissues have also been prepared.

317
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,799
Besides, the dashcam has been tested.
Feel free to drive.

318
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,919
He's suddenly giving me such an expensive gift.

319
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,960
Will he propose to me?

320
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,879
Why are you suddenly
giving me such an expensive gift?

321
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,879
Before, we could go to work
and go home together.

322
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,600
Even if it was windy or rainy,
there was no need to worry.

323
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,000
Now, I'm working in Nan'an County,

324
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,559
If the weather is bad,

325
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,039
or if you work overtime too late,

326
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,360
you can drive home. Don't let me worry.

327
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,976
Is that all?

328
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,320
But it's too expensive.

329
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,279
Isn't it ostentatious?

330
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,320
Not ostentatious at all.

331
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,519
Besides, you're now the Account Manager.

332
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,399
You're a senior in the department.

333
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,360
This car isn't ostentatious at all.
It's just right for you.

334
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,759
It's pretty good.

335
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,279
What do you mean?

336
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,919
I think you're quite lucky.

337
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,600
You already met Qiao Mu

338
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,928
and gave me such a big gift in front of him.

339
00:16:20,928 --> 00:16:21,960
Very soon,

340
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,559
everyone will know how much you dote on me.

341
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,559
So it seems I gave you the right gift.

342
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,639
Of course, I like it.

343
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,399
Thank you.

344
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,488
I'm glad you like it.

345
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:42,879
Jing.

346
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,600
Mr. Ji, long time no see.

347
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Long time no see.

348
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,960
What are you doing downstairs at noon?

349
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,080
Are you talking with Tu?

350
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,159
It's fine. Don't be shy.

351
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,200
Take your time. I have to go.

352
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,159
- I'll come up right away.
- Okay.

353
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,879
See you.

354
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,399
I came out for a date during working hours

355
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,879
and got caught by my leader.
It's so embarrassing.

356
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,080
I can't help you with this.
You have to face it alone.

357
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,119
You park the car in the garage for me.

358
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,176
Give the key to Ling Weiyi.

359
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,400
- Okay, Ms. Tu.
- I'm leaving.

360
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,519
Jing, didn't you visit
the new private high school this afternoon

361
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,440
to discuss salary distribution?

362
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,960
Is it not going smoothly?

363
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,319
That project has been taken by someone
outside our area.

364
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,720
But the contract hasn't been signed yet.

365
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,640
I'll think of a solution.

366
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,519
But I don't think there's much hope.

367
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,039
I've made a deal with Shentong.

368
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,880
I'll try to review the documents
and the agreement today

369
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,064
to proceed with the process tomorrow.

370
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:49,120
If that's the case,

371
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,960
the performance for the month will be done.

372
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,960
Jing, don't be too anxious.

373
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
Li Xiang and Xu Li

374
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,920
are dealing with their clients well.

375
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,039
Tingting and Yuan Lang are enthusiastic
about bringing in deposits.

376
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,640
Let's work harder together

377
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,160
to develop one or two new clients.

378
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,920
Before you give birth,

379
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,519
you will undoubtedly achieve great results

380
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,200
to impress the leaders.

381
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,680
That way they will trust you even more.

382
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:21,079
To be honest, I have been anxious recently.

383
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,599
Do you think I look thinner

384
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:25,359
after getting pregnant?

385
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,640
Anyway, I can tell from the face.

386
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,672
Yes.

387
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,079
When I was an Account Manager,

388
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,119
I had lots of work to do under great pressure.

389
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,720
But after I got off work,

390
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,400
I could have drinks and dance.

391
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
That released the pressure.

392
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,160
But after I'm pregnant, Zhao won't

393
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,839
let me touch this or that.

394
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,680
I've had enough of him.

395
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,640
Zhao told me not

396
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,696
to let you drink coffee or tea.

397
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:55,359
He asked me to keep an eye on you.

398
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,079
He told you about that?

399
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,640
He's pushing around my people.

400
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,279
He's thinking about you.

401
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,960
Fine. After I return home,

402
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,559
I want to play games in bed

403
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,000
to relieve some stress.

404
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,400
He doesn't even allow me to play games.

405
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,799
Guess what the reason is.

406
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,200
He's afraid my teammates might make me mad.

407
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,680
Then, I get angry at him.

408
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,359
I argue with him, but he doesn't talk back.

409
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,160
Whatever I say, he takes it all.

410
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,119
So it seems like I am irritable now.

411
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,160
With the rise of pregnancy hormones

412
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,680
and the pressure of work,

413
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,039
I feel like I'm going to explode.

414
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,559
I have had enough of this.

415
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,832
Xiaoning, please. Let me take a sip of coffee.

416
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,599
You and Mr. Ji are in the best phase now.

417
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,559
You're in a loving relationship.

418
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,079
Zhao and I have taken a big step.

419
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,599
And it's hard to adapt.

420
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,279
Zhao suddenly became a married man.

421
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,759
And then, he's going to be a dad,

422
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,799
living cautiously, for fear of upsetting you.

423
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,839
Actually, he does nothing wrong, right?

424
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,839
Yes.

425
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:12,079
So, Jing, under the premise

426
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,519
of not harming yourself,

427
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,880
it's okay to reminisce about the old days

428
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,079
and try to find an outlet.

429
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,880
You think so?

430
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,279
So I think

431
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,720
there may be a communication problem
between the two of you.

432
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,799
If arguing doesn't solve the problem,

433
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,720
why not try a different approach?

434
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,279
You are not yet married.

435
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,519
Are you acting like a senior guiding me?

436
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,319
So, are you listening or not?

437
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,359
Come on. Tell me about it.

438
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
I'm full.

439
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,799
It seems the food suited your taste.

440
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,880
Yes.

441
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,160
I feel like I'll gain three pounds
after eating this.

442
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,519
No worries. After you give birth,
I'll accompany you to do postnatal exercises.

443
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,680
I'll get you the folic acid.

444
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,559
No need. I've had enough supplements.

445
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,559
I feel a bit unaccustomed
to your self-discipline.

446
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,839
What makes you say that?

447
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,839
I am a grown-up.

448
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,799
I know that I am pregnant.

449
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,599
How can I not take good care of myself?

450
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:23,640
I argued with you before
because you always nagged me.

451
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,240
We argued,

452
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,440
but I always listened to you, right?

453
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,359
That means what I said made a bit of sense.

454
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,680
More than just a bit of that.

455
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,119
It made a great deal of sense.

456
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,759
Let me tell you.

457
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,640
I've eaten fish, shrimp,
and asparagus today, right?

458
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,839
At 4:00 PM, I ate the bird's nest soup.

459
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,119
Before getting off work,

460
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,680
I finished the dried fruits
you prepared for me.

461
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,839
My husband has been taking good care of me.

462
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:55,720
Can I possibly not do what he says?

463
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,119
Now, are you happy?

464
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:02,039
Yes, I am. I'll give you a star as a reward.

465
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,319
If you

466
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,960
promise me one thing,

467
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,640
I promise I won't argue with you anymore.

468
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,000
Okay, what is it?

469
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,920
It's still early, and it's a good night.

470
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,088
Shouldn't we go out and have fun?

471
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:22,960
Where to?

472
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,839
To an old place to look for our memories.

473
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:33,039
Honey, walk slower.

474
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,279
I can't hear you.

475
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:36,119
Don't shout so loud.

476
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,119
What's wrong with that?

477
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,640
Could it harm the baby?

478
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Pah. Hurry.

479
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,680
- Pah.
- Pah.

480
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,440
Knock on wood, one, two, three.

481
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,520
You're superstitious.

482
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,392
Sir, place the order.

483
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,576
I'll keep my voice down.

484
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,200
Waiter.

485
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,640
Hello, sir, what can I do for you?

486
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,720
Could you change the music to a piano piece?

487
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,000
My heart can't take it.

488
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,240
I'm sorry, sir.

489
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,920
People come here for disco dancing.

490
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,359
They just can't dance to piano music.

491
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,559
- Ignore him. Place an order.
- Okay.

492
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,704
Keep my voice down.

493
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,839
Listen to the rhythm and its beat.

494
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,319
Our child will be born a rhythm master.

495
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,440
You must be kidding.

496
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,799
Honey, haven't you been afraid

497
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,519
that I might get antenatal depression?

498
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,599
If you don't want me to suffer
from antenatal depression,

499
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,759
don't ruin my mood tonight.

500
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,799
I promise you.

501
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,240
If I feel even a tiny bit unwell,

502
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,079
we'll go home immediately, okay?

503
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,759
Swing more slowly.

504
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,152
I'll swing more slowly.

505
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,000
My favorite tune.

506
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,448
Quick, honey, I can't dance now.
You dance for me.

507
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,759
Honey.

508
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,848
Honey.

509
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:52,872
I was asleep.

510
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:59,920
It's non-alcoholic, without even ice.

511
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,759
Honey, let's go home.

512
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,200
It's just past nine o'clock.

513
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,240
We rarely go out. Enjoy yourself.

514
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,359
I haven't been to this place for a long time.

515
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,880
Coming here today, I find it quite boring.

516
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Let's go home.

517
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,344
Okay.

518
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,440
You tricked me into going to a bar.

519
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,440
And then you left early. Why?

520
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,680
Feeling bored? I don't think so.

521
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,839
Or are you afraid I'll criticize you?

522
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:49,160
I realize you're too tired.

523
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,960
We were in a noisy place, and you didn't drink.

524
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,279
If not for being too tired,

525
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,400
how could you fall asleep?

526
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:02,599
I guess I don't feel much
for places like a nightclub.

527
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,680
You know I tend to be quite calm.

528
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,240
As for getting pregnant,

529
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,880
it happened too suddenly for both you and me.

530
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,160
I've been adjusting lately

531
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,440
to the new role of being a mom.

532
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm also adjusting to our new life.

533
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,519
But you know, sometimes hormones fluctuate.

534
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,240
So inevitably
some emotions get vented onto you.

535
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,279
I'm sorry.

536
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,720
It's not easy for you either.

537
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,559
My parents passed away early.

538
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,680
You let your parents take care of me.

539
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,599
And you have to take care of me
and the child every day.

540
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,440
Three nutritious meals a day.

541
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,960
You've taken all the household chores
upon yourself.

542
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,319
You have to work overtime after I fall asleep.

543
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:03,144
That's why I especially want to say thank you.

544
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,839
That's it? No big deal.

545
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,880
If I can't even do this well,
why did I marry you?

546
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:21,559
You've been free for over 30 years.

547
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,119
Marriage and children are
like two shackles on you.

548
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,359
It would upset you.

549
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,759
I've thought it through.

550
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,039
From now on, I'll hang out
with you for one day a week.

551
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,759
But you have to promise me not
to look at any blond handsome guys.

552
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,680
I wasn't looking just now.

553
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,880
Just this once.

554
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Besides, is that blond guy
as good-looking as your husband?

555
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,279
Is he as elegant and steady as your husband?

556
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,839
I really didn't look. How can you not trust me?

557
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,680
I was telling the truth.

558
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,720
Wait for me.

559
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,656
Think about it. If the bank treats companies

560
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:05,759
as adversaries to confront head-on,

561
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,279
the outcome can only be a lose-lose situation.

562
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,240
So we have to think of ways

563
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,400
to revitalize companies.

564
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,200
Only then can we achieve a win-win result
between banks and enterprises.

565
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,000
I have reviewed the loan contracts

566
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,488
of the private enterprise.

567
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:20,759
They failed to repay on time.

568
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,519
There indeed are problems with the companies.

569
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,319
But our bank had issues

570
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,039
when disbursing the loans.

571
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,759
Back then, we were only thinking
of rapidly disbursing the funds

572
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:31,279
without analyzing the actual situation

573
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,319
of the companies and their loan needs.

574
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,720
The loan amounts, terms, and repayment methods

575
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,319
were not suited
to the companies' operating conditions.

576
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,160
Let's consider one thing.

577
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,400
During the repayment period,

578
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,319
if the companies' sales proceeds
are not in place,

579
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,039
how could they repay the bank?

580
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,559
This is the root cause
of the situation we face today.

581
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,200
Mr. Ji, we didn't think so much.

582
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,839
We just wanted to make loans quickly
to complete the task.

583
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,920
I'm not one to dredge up the past.

584
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,000
But if the old issues can't be resolved,

585
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,359
the Nan'an County branch

586
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:11,000
will never have new clients

587
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,240
or achieve the key performance indicators
set by the head office.

588
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,079
You don't want to just have the base salary
every month

589
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:19,279
without a penny of bonus, do you?

590
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,440
And you also don't want criticism
from the leaders, right?

591
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,079
Of course, Mr. Ji.

592
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:26,319
We've been having a hard time.

593
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,640
Mr. Ji, what do you think we should do?

594
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,039
As long as we can finish the task,

595
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,160
we'll do what you say.

596
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,920
The next two months might be tough.

597
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,759
We need to take root in every company

598
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:41,079
to gain a deeper understanding of them.

599
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,496
If some of these companies

600
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:45,599
really have their problems and difficulties

601
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,359
and the person in charge is sincere
about getting things done,

602
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:50,279
we'll work with them to find ways

603
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,720
to resolve the non-performing loans.

604
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:11,072
♫ I can always see the faint glimmer of light ♫

605
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:14,280
♫ Flowing through the gaps between my fingers ♫

606
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:17,120
♫ As the wind along the way ♫

607
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,096
♫ Accompanying me through yesterday ♫

608
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:24,896
♫ Rushing towards
all the destinations of the future ♫

609
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:27,784
♫ Sweat poured down every step ♫

610
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:32,200
♫ Chasing happiness with all my heart ♫

611
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,944
♫ Every scene passed by ♫

612
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:40,072
♫ We know there's a new beginning in life ♫

613
00:30:40,576 --> 00:30:44,040
♫ Refreshing all the unknowns ♫

614
00:30:45,056 --> 00:30:48,104
♫ Gathering the fulfillment of desires ♫

615
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,040
♫ Every moment counts ♫

616
00:30:53,056 --> 00:31:01,028
♫ You know there's a new beginning in life ♫

617
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,599
♫ The next second awaits ♫

618
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,960
How's it going?

619
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,519
Mr. Ji, they said he went
to buy raw materials by car.

620
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,079
Who knows if that's true?

621
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,160
I guessed it.

622
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,319
Mr. Sun

623
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,680
is one of the toughest nuts to crack
among the bank's borrowers.

624
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,079
He always talks tough.

625
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,759
He said he had no money but a factory
to repay the loan.

626
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,359
It's up to us whether we sue
or auction his factory.

627
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,119
Yeah, when we first came,

628
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,240
he was kind to us.

629
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,440
But later on, he didn't even pretend.

630
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,960
As soon as we came, he hid away.

631
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,559
No comment on this person.

632
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,759
In my opinion,

633
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,839
Mr. Sun is not afraid of the bank.

634
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:39,119
He bets we don't want this loan

635
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,839
to be made non-performing quickly.

636
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:42,920
Just think about it.

637
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,079
If the newly issued loans become non-performing
within the same year,

638
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,079
the whole branch's performance will be gone.

639
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,519
So the best solution now is to wait for him

640
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,759
to negotiate with him.

641
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:55,559
Use time to gain space.

642
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:05,240
Mr. Ji, looks like it's going to rain soon.

643
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,519
After all, we still have time.

644
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,920
How about we go back and come again tomorrow?

645
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,799
Yes, Mr. Ji, we have a week left.

646
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,680
Let's come back tomorrow.

647
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,799
Well, since it's about to rain,

648
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,279
you two go back. I'll wait a bit longer.

649
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,759
It's getting late.

650
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,839
The kids are out of school.

651
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,519
Hurry home and cook for them.

652
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,559
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

653
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,000
Mr. Sun is simply good for nothing.

654
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:46,079
Hey, Xiaoning, I'm not finished yet.

655
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,680
I probably won't make it back tonight.

656
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,160
The weather looks bad, and it's about to rain.

657
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,240
You go to your parents' house today.

658
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,079
Otherwise, I'll worry about you.

659
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:58,200
Alright then, you take care.

660
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,400
You have your overnight bag with you, right?

661
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,119
Of course, it's in the car. Don't worry.

662
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,880
Take care and be safe. Bye.

663
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,912
Bye.

664
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,968
[Mr. Ji, Go for it!]

665
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,784
Try some of this.

666
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,320
It's a downpour
and the temperature is dropping.

667
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,960
Ji is out there alone.
I fear he will catch a cold.

668
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,920
He's a man. A bit of wind toughens him up.

669
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,840
Getting a bit wet in the rain trains the mind.

670
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,519
Ji is steady and responsible. No worries.

671
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:28,719
He will take care of himself.

672
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,280
That sounds nice.

673
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,800
Why don't you go out and get soaked

674
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,280
to temper your strong will as well?

675
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,840
I'm too old to do that.

676
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,679
If I get sick,

677
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,039
I will have to trouble you to look after me.

678
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:46,840
To be honest, I think Ji is a really good kid.

679
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,360
Your dad and I really like him.

680
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,199
Before your relationship was made public,

681
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,960
I was really worried
that your work would be affected.

682
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,119
I was too anxious to sleep.

683
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,599
But I didn't dare to tell you to upset you.

684
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,840
Not at all.

685
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,079
I know how you felt.

686
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,239
When people found out about your relationship,

687
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:08,400
your mom looked pretty calm,

688
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,000
but she was very anxious inside.

689
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,280
Can't you say something nice?

690
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,599
But fortunately,

691
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:19,239
only your romantic relationship was exposed.

692
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,719
No one knows
the two of you have registered for marriage.

693
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,360
If you know we haven't actually done that,

694
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,039
your attitude will change.

695
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,719
But I do think Ji is reliable.

696
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,519
Look, to save your job,

697
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,599
he transferred himself to the county town.

698
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,720
As your parents,

699
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,760
we know he can

700
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,280
look after you wholeheartedly,

701
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,559
all worries have vanished into thin air.

702
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,199
Honestly, mom, I used to just think

703
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,239
that he and I just loved each other.

704
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:54,400
But through this incident,
I realize I don't just love him,

705
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,079
and he is the man that I deserve.

706
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:59,760
No matter what happens,

707
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,840
we can definitely solve it together,

708
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,719
just like the two of you.

709
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,239
Our daughter has grown up.

710
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,199
Why do I suddenly feel sentimental
after hearing that?

711
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,360
Alright, save your tears for the wedding.

712
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,760
Yeah, what's going on with your wedding?

713
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,639
It's been more than half a year
since you got your marriage certificate.

714
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,599
You used to worry about your work.

715
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,320
So, can I expect your wedding now?

716
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,440
I've been a bit busy.

717
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,519
He's just been transferred to the county.

718
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:38,639
Besides the time for work and sleep,

719
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,599
it's all spent on commuting.

720
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,599
He doesn't have the energy for that. No rush.

721
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,239
When can he be transferred back?

722
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,199
Otherwise, the commuting is tiring.

723
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,360
Exactly.

724
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,920
Anyway, problems will be solved
sooner or later.

725
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,119
It's just a matter of time.
I'll tell you both after it's resolved.

726
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,880
I need to work overtime
to deal with some things.

727
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,280
You two go to bed earlier.

728
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,760
Take this tea. I'll add some more for you.

729
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,896
No need.

730
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:12,679
She ran away again.

731
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,760
He even hasn't proposed,
let alone held a wedding.

732
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,360
How come you haven't slept yet?

733
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,159
No, I haven't.

734
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:43,960
I have to work overtime
on such a beautiful night.

735
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,800
Ms. Tu, you seem quite busy.

736
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,840
Aren't you the same?

737
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,360
Jing is more than three months pregnant.

738
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,960
She's experiencing severe morning sickness.

739
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,519
And it's a critical period
for her to become the general manager.

740
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,719
She has to secure at least two major cases.

741
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,920
I'll definitely help her develop more clients.

742
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,239
That's perfect. I also need to rush a report.

743
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:10,376
Let's do it together.

744
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,039
We keep each other company.

745
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,320
Don't just peek at me. Focus.

746
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,440
How do you know I'm looking at you
if you don't look at me?

747
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:33,748
♫ Lemon goes with coffee.
We have a rapport, flustered ♫

748
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:38,656
♫ We continue the warm moments of the past ♫

749
00:38:38,656 --> 00:38:44,036
♫ Thoughts surge like waves and fluctuate ♫

750
00:38:44,036 --> 00:38:46,692
♫ In the pouring rain ♫

751
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:49,444
♫ I start to refresh my memory ♫

752
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:53,892
♫ Your eyes are as clear as the sky ♫

753
00:38:53,892 --> 00:38:56,836
♫ As time goes by, I fall for you ♫

754
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,780
♫ As I feel the warmth in your palms,
I fall for you ♫

755
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,468
♫ Parallel kite strings take a turn ♫

756
00:39:02,468 --> 00:39:04,580
♫ Shining brightly ♫

757
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,588
♫ As I'm touched, I fall for you ♫

758
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:10,436
♫ As I feel the warmth in your palms,
I fall for you ♫

759
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:13,280
♫ Capturing all happiness for you ♫

760
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,736
♫ And making it into an everlasting song ♫

761
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,944
♫ You are my only one, my love ♫

762
00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:21,159
♫ You are my only one, my love ♫

763
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,208
Are you asleep?

764
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,199
Tu Xiaoning. You fell asleep?

765
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,472
♫ You are my only one, my love ♫

766
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:32,719
♫ You are my only one, my love ♫

767
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,119
Good night.

768
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,144
Guys, come.

769
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:31,679
- Unload goods.
- Okay.

770
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,719
Hurry up.

771
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:35,199
Hurry.

772
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,119
Hurry up. Follow up.

773
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,679
Work harder.

774
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,760
These materials are ruined if they get damp.

775
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Sir, what are you unloading?

776
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,519
It's all food processing ingredients.

777
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,880
Sir, are you Mr. Sun?

778
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,360
No, you made a mistake.

779
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,880
That's Mr. Sun.

780
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,400
He knows I injured my shoulder.

781
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,920
So he replaced me.

782
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,960
Guys, move faster.

783
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,519
After these goods are sold,

784
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:03,000
you'll have your wages next month. Keep it up!

785
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,872
Give it to me.

786
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:51,679
Dry you off. Have a seat.

787
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,408
Okay.

788
00:41:53,408 --> 00:41:54,519
There are no clothes in the factory.

789
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:57,000
You have to wear work clothes.

790
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,159
Alright, thank you.

791
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,264
You're welcome.

792
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,880
Mr. Sun, let me introduce myself to you.

793
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,840
I'm from the Nan'an County branch
of Dairui Bank.

794
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,800
I'm Ji Yuheng, the new manager.

795
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,079
You can call me Ji.

796
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:13,639
I'm here to learn

797
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,800
about your loans and repayments.

798
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,719
As long as I have this factory,

799
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:19,679
I will keep working.

800
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,159
If the bank takes it back,

801
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,599
I'll have to retire and go back home.

802
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,960
But I have no money for repayments.

803
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,119
Mr. Sun, don't worry.

804
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,719
I've heard of your thoughts

805
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,519
from my colleagues.

806
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,079
Today is our first meeting.

807
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,119
You look different from what I thought.

808
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,079
I've gotten something

809
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,880
from your employees.

810
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,519
They all support you

811
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:49,880
and say you've been deceived by the bank,

812
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,920
which is why you owe so much money.

813
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,728
So I want

814
00:42:53,728 --> 00:42:56,639
to know what exactly happened.

815
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:00,880
Actually, it can't entirely be blamed
on the bank.

816
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,320
Mainly, I blame myself.

817
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,800
Back then, I tried to expand the factory

818
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,079
to lead them to get rich.

819
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:13,880
At that time, many banks came
to me to offer loans.

820
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,719
I thought that was a good thing.

821
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,440
So I accepted their offer.

822
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,159
I expanded the factory
and added production lines.

823
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:23,960
The production did go up,

824
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,599
while the sales did not.

825
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,119
A lot of goods remained unsold and piled up.

826
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:33,960
The cash flow was cut off.

827
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,360
The loans can't be paid off either.

828
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,519
I had even less money to expand sales channels.

829
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,039
I have a solution.

830
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,719
I wonder if you're willing to give it a try.

831
00:44:00,484 --> 00:44:05,064
[Gift]

832
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:28,000
Hello, Mr. Liu, are you still up?

833
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,519
Mr. Ji, would you like to come out for a drink?

834
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:33,320
Thanks, but I'll pass. It's too late.

835
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,159
There's something I want to ask you.

836
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:39,440
Can I get the car I ordered from you this week?

837
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,679
I guess so.
I'll notify you when the car arrives.

838
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,519
Okay, thank you.

839
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,159
Not at all. I'm hanging up.

840
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:49,280
Alright, thank you.

841
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,760
Xiaoning, when I'm not by your side,

842
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,280
let it temporarily shelter you
from wind and rain

843
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,599
and take you wherever you want to go.
