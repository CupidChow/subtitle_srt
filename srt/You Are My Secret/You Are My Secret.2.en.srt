[Conference Room]

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,560
Did you help Zhou Kai
with the discounting of a commercial draft?

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,479
Yes, I did it.

52
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,872
The commercial draft discounting

53
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:54,800
requires bank-endorsed undue paper tax bills
and draft bills.

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,319
The bank has yet to receive the tax bills

55
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,879
because Zhou Kai colluded with scalpers
and absconded with the funds.

56
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,960
You filed the records for him
and were the second handler.

57
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,919
You need to cooperate with the investigation.

58
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,439
Ms. Rao, I just did him a favor.

59
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:09,000
I promise I'm not in collusion with him.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,120
Whether you helped him
or not is none of my concern.

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,960
We are just workmates.

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,360
You don't need to pledge loyalty to me.

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Many departments are trying
to give the Development Department a hard time.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,720
And you have given them an opportunity.

65
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,639
So you mean I should take responsibility,

66
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,759
and resign
to protect the Development Department?

67
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,120

but I can't take the blame.

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,759
I will prove my innocence.

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,288

When I encounter problems in the workplace,

77

why did you never stand up for me?

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,199
You're a strong woman in the banking world,

in a greenhouse.

You've succeeded, anyway.

86

If she can do it,

87
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,360
it will silence all the external doubts
about our department.

88
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,879
If she can't do it,

89
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,920
we won't have to pay a useless person.

91
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,079

101

from a labor dispatch company.

00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,839
I think contract workers are incompetent.

103
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,560
We must investigate it thoroughly.

to prove that I have not colluded with him.

in the lobby for three years.

182
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,159
As others are working hard,

183
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,399
I'm working like a dog.

184
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,360
But even so, I haven't been made permanent.

185
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,480
On top of that,

186
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,240
I've been dispatched

187
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,159
to the Development Department Division One.

188
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,639
The funniest thing is,

189
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,440
I can't even stay in that development.

190
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:51,519
I have more enthusiasm for work
than the staff employees.

191
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,639
But that isn't enough.

192
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,559
If you can't solve problems,
you'll still have to leave.

193
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,264
I know.

194
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,039
But I believe

195
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,679
that no one does things
without leaving a trace.

196
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,840
I am suspected now

197
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,600
because those traces
have not yet been discovered.

198
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,399
But they definitely exist.

199
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,919
I believe I'll find them.

200
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,200
Because of the meaning of work

201
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,759
and the three years of effort,

202
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,024
you feel frustrated and unfulfilled?

203
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:39,112
Sure.

204
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,000
I knew it.

205
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,200
This is the girl I remember

206
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,120
who never gives up.

207
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,240
Are you trying to cheer me up?

208
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,919
In an old-fashioned way?

209
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,159
But it works, right?

210
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,368
Yeah.

211
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,399
Have you thought of a solution?

212
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,039
You are from the Compliance Department.

213
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:06,159
I am currently the subject of suspicion.

214
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,639
It seems we shouldn't discuss this in private.

215
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,039
But I haven't revealed anything to you

216
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,759
about how my department will handle it.

217
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,919
But it's work.

218
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,840
We need to follow the rules.

219
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,639
Keep it up, Tu Xiaoning.

220
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,720
It's my duty.

221
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,399
I won't show favoritism
when dealing with your issue.

222
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,440
No worries, Ji Yuheng.

223
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,200
I won't leave my job easily.

224
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,208

Let's start.

236
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,640
Tu Xiaoning, we need to ask you

237
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,880
about Zhou Kai's business issue.

238
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,480
As a bank employee,

239
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,920
you need to take responsibility for your words

240
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,200
and the truthfulness of each word.

241
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,559
No concealment, understand?

242
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,480
Understood.

243
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,519
Answer the first question.

244
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,319
Did you assist Zhou Kai

245
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,960
from start to finish?

246
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,064
No, I was only responsible
for archiving the documents.

247
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,400
Zhou Kai handled the early collection of data

248
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,160
and filled out the information.

249
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,480
This can be checked on the company's website.

250
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,640
And the chat records between Zhou Kai

251
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
and me can also prove what I said.

252
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,116
This is my evidence.

254
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,264
Take a look.

255
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,400
Do you know how much you can get
after discounting one bill?

256
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,440
No.

257
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,440
But you still helped Zhou Kai with his job.

258
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,559
Don't you care

259
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,920
about your bonus?

260
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,839
I'm an assistant to the account manager,

261
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,839
but I am a contract worker,

262
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:43,480
not a regular bank employee.

263
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,880
The calculation way of my salary

264
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,079
is different from that
of other formal employees.

265
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:50,200
I don't have clients, so I have no bonus.

266
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,000
The evidence I provided
includes my salary information

267
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,599
and the statement of all bank cards
under my name.

268
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,839
They can prove

269
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:59,960
that I've never
received any performance-related payments

270
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,319
or any payments with unidentified sources.

271
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,319
Have you concealed anything else?

272
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,344
No.

273
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,279
We have a general idea of the situation.

274
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,519
You may go back.

275
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,696
Thank you.

276
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,272
I have one more question.

277
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,000
Regarding the two transactions,
the company did not provide taxation receipts.

278
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,839
Were you aware of this?

279
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,279
Yes, according to the regulations,

280
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:37,839
if a company can't
provide tax receipts immediately

281
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,559
or in a real emergency,

282
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,519
they can be completed within a month.

283
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,359
Zhou Kai is currently missing.

284
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,000
You filed the documents,
so you were the second handler.

285
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,160
The bank is highly concerned about this matter.

286
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,599
Do you have any other clues?

287
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,720
Don't panic. There must be other traces.

288
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,799
Mr. Zhou, the tax receipts are not attached
to the documents.

289
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,319
I know. I will get them done soon.

290
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,319
Alright, Mr. Zhou.

291
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,799
However, you need to sign this promissory note.

292
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,519
Okay, l'll do it tomorrow.

293
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,559
I'm afraid that won't do.

294
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,839
I can't file for you with incomplete documents.

295
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,119
This is the bank's rule.

296
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,279
If you can't come back,
I can deliver it to you.

297
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,904
I have proof.

298
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,000
The tax receipts are not completed,

299
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,359
but the account manager is required
to provide a tax receipt promise

300
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,559
that's signed by the heads
of other departments.

301
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,559
This tax receipt promise should be
in the archives now.

302
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,720
Director, I have no further questions.

303
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,808
You may go back.

304
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,784
Okay.

00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:18,519

Who? Your classmate and colleague?

329
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,359
Yeah.

330
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,640
He advised me in advance

331
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,680
to pay attention to the details of the rules.

332
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,960
Moreover, he seemed strict
when asking questions.

333
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,880
In fact, he asked about many things
that everyone else had overlooked.

334
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,440
He cleared me of suspicion.

335
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,160
He also showed people my professional side.

336
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,400
He's excellent and thoughtful.

337
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,519
I think he's interested in you.

338
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,759
He proposed to me.

339
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,279
What?

340
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,839
He proposed to me.

341
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,359
- Proposed?
- Yes.

342
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,920
- Did you say yes?
- Of course not.

343
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,640
I've only met him a few times.
I can't marry him.

344
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,000
What's the big deal?

345
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,440
He's quite a catch. What does he see in me?

346
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,880
Why do you care?

347
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,480
Just think about what you see in him.

348
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,839
Ji Yuheng is an eligible man.

349
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:39,480
If you let go of him
and put him back on the dating market,

350
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,359
you will lose a good man.

351
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,640
That's true.

352
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,599
He's definitely an eligible man.

353
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,759
I haven't had much contact with him,

354
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:52,440
but every time I'm with him,
I feel quite at ease.

355
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,519
That's because you two knew each other before

356
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,519
and met again at a marriageable age.

357
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:01,119
He even proposed to you.

358
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,119
You two are meant to end up together.

359
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,559
What's wrong with getting married quickly?

360
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,920
Think about Lu Sijing.

361
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,120
In the end, he has no stable marriage

362
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,359
or exciting romance.

363
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,440
That's true.

364
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,480
Lu Sijing taught me a lesson.

365
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,599
He made me realize

366
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,039
the length of time
couldn't determine the outcome.

367
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,799
So in that case,

368
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,160
a quick marriage might end well, right?

369
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:32,279
Yeah, and I can tell from your words.

370
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,160
Although I have never met this man,

371
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,559
I can tell he's much better than Lu Sijing.

372
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,799
I remember

373
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,759
Lu Sijing belittles your job

374
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:45,000
because you're a contract worker.

375
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,680
It makes me angry.

376
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,039
Now, you met a good man. He will feel sorry.

377
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,279
What's there to be angry about?

378
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,680
You want me to play with him?

379
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,079
Pretending to be complacent?

380
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:00,440
No. Just be impressive.

381
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,799
Okay, I got it.

382
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,968
I'll think about it.

383

Mr. Zhao.

384
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:12,000
Thank you.

385
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,240
Tu, the Compliance Department
didn't give you a hard time.

386
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,279
Do you have connections?

387
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,599
If I do,

388
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,640
I've long been made permanent, right?

389
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,440
Don't be shy about it.

390
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,720
Connections can help

391
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,200
when you're in need.

392
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,920
I have no connections, Mr. Zhao.

393

Okay, let's not talk about this.

394

Let's talk about your regular job.

395
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,599
You'll be regular if you work for me.

396
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:49,279
Mr. Zhao, I hear you're good at making coffee.

397
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,640
Could you make coffee for me?

398
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,359
I haven't drunk from this cup.
Would you drink it?

399
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,872
I'll pass.

400
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,960
We are equal.

401
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,680
Making coffee for you isn't proper, is it?

402
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,359
Mr. Zhao is a man who observes the rules.

403
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,480
Do you know

404
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,079
Tu Xiaoning is my assistant?

405
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,720
If you ask my assistant to make coffee for you,

406
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,519
you'd better notify me first
to avoid breaking the rules.

407
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,880
Tu, my client got injured.

408
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,559
He's in the inpatient department
of Renji Hospital.

409
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,079
Mr. Jiang and I have something else to do.

410
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,416
I'll join you after I'm finished.

411
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:22,480
Okay, I'm on it.

Can't you save face for me in front of her?

Hello, Jing, I just saw Mr. Li.

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,279
He injured his left hand,
but he's recovering well.

418
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,000
He probably won't refuse to see visitors.

419
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,400
Okay, got it. I'll head over once I'm done.

420
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,920
I just had a word
with his caretaker in private.

421
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,519
Someone from another bank came by this morning.

422
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,160

Sorry, madam.

Yuheng's girlfriend. Come in.

434
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:19,319
Mom, the doctor said you can't keep sitting.

435
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,960
Why did you get up?

436
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,920
I've been lying down every day.

that you're very busy with work.

I'm sorry for being like this

Yuheng is kind of introverted.

454

I hope you don't mind.

He's quite good.

But once he speaks up,

459
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,680
it will be a promise. He'll keep it seriously.

Her condition is bad right now.

I used to eat it near my school.

543
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,436
Let's try the next snack.

544
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:49,608
[Mango Sticky Rice]

545
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm stuffed.

546
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,760
I'll buy you digestive tablets.

547
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,280
No need. I have another way.

548
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,376
Follow me.

549
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,400
Why do we come here?

550
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,079
I want to take a walk

551
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:25,880
and reminisce about my past school life.

552
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,599
I didn't have to worry

553
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,079
about my livelihood, job,
or failed relationships.

554
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,264
How nice.

555
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Back then, I looked forward to graduating.

556
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,119
There are many things only adults can do.

557
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,000
I have wishes too.

558
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,360
I wish for a good job,

559
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,960
a happy marriage,

560
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,159
and a promising future.

561
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,832
That sounds nice.

562
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:56,840
How will you achieve them?

563
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,679
Although the Development Department
isn't my best choice,

564
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:01,199
I've joined it.

565
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,719
I will give it my all and work hard.

566
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,920
As for marriage,

567
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,239
I've seriously considered your proposal.

568
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:14,960
After some time, I think you are a suitable man

569
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,519
for me to marry.

570
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,880
I've always had a question.

571
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,360
Why is it me?

572
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,199
Even for the sake of your mom,

573
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:29,639
you have many choices given your qualities.

574
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,679
Why choose me?

575
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,239
I feel a sense of compatibility

576
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,599
and security when I'm with you.

577
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:47,480
Indeed, we are in sync in many ways.

578
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,039
Is that because we are classmates

579
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:52,559
and know each other well?

580
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,920
Love is not a must in marriage.

581
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,639
Comfort and stability also matter.

582
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,920
You're right.

583
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,920
Start a marriage with no expectations.

584
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,800
The following days might be filled
with surprises.

585
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:15,199
If the starting point is low,
the sense of happiness will be high.

586
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,719
But my work is currently a mess.

587
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:22,360
It's a bit unfair to you.

588
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,400
How so? A career is just a part of life.

589
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,440
That's not the whole meaning of marriage.

590
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,519
Imagine if we got married.

591
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:39,199
If you're tired,
someone is waiting for you at home.

592
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,159
Two people watch a movie.

593
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,679
When confronted with a tricky job,

594
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:44,800
we can figure out ways together.

595
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,400
We can complain about work stuff.

596
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,239
Aren't these the benefits of marriage?

597
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,960
Sounds quite nice.

598
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,536
No rule says

599
00:40:57,536 --> 00:41:01,079
that we have to achieve success and fame
before getting married.

600
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,280
In my ideal marriage, two people should

601
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,320
anticipate what future life might be like.

602
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,639
We'll figure it out together.

603
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,239
Yes, as long as we bravely start a new life,

604
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:20,880
we might find the right answer.

605
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,639
Ji Yuheng, I've decided.

606
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:31,360
Let's get married.
We'll register for it tomorrow.

607
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,248
Yes.

608
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:45,344
♫ The wind blew across the crowded street ♫

609
00:41:45,344 --> 00:41:50,944
♫ Lemon goes with coffee.
We have a rapport, flustered ♫

610
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:55,520
♫ We continue the warm moments of the past ♫

611
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,832
♫ Thoughts surge like waves and fluctuate ♫

612
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:03,744
♫ In the pouring rain ♫

613
00:42:03,744 --> 00:42:06,208
♫ I start to refresh my memory ♫

614
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:11,104
♫ Your eyes are as clear as the sky ♫

615
00:42:11,104 --> 00:42:13,728
♫ As time goes by, I fall for you ♫

616
00:42:13,728 --> 00:42:16,448
♫ As I feel the warmth in your palms,
I fall for you ♫

617
00:42:16,448 --> 00:42:19,264
♫ Parallel kite strings take a turn ♫

618
00:42:19,264 --> 00:42:21,664
♫ Shining brightly ♫

619
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,512
♫ As I'm touched, I fall for you ♫

620
00:42:24,512 --> 00:42:28,776
[Redemption]

621
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,079
Heng, your dad passed way.

622
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,639
From now on, it's just the two of us
in this home.

623
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,599
There are rumors that your dad took bribes.

624
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,280
Coincidentally, he passed away.

625
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,920
Who knows if it was a suicide
out of fear of punishment?

626
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,960
After such an incident,

627
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,159
who dares to associate with him?

628
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,840
He's a top student,

629
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,239
but his dad is a criminal.

630
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,039
Rousong.

631
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,079
Hey, don't be impulsive.

632
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,472
Are you okay?

633
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,024
The cat is fine.

634
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,880
I'm asking about you. Are you okay?

635
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,920
Ji Yuheng, right?

636
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,840
I've heard some things about you.

637
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,039
I occasionally heard from others.

638
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,239
Not too much.

639
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:37,559
But I want to tell you to look forward.

640
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:40,800
If you keep looking back,
you'll have to face losses.

641
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,280
But if you look forward,

642
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,920
you'll see something different.

643
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,960
Remember to use an umbrella on rainy days.

644
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,599
Otherwise, you'll catch a cold.
Take care of yourself.

645
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,880
I give you my umbrella.

646
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,079
It helps you through the toughest times
until the rain stops and the sky clears.

647
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,920
Take it.

648
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,599
Let's go, Rousong.

649
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:53,559
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

650
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:56,659
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

651
00:45:56,659 --> 00:46:01,819
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:06,003
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

653
00:46:06,003 --> 00:46:09,491
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

654
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:13,403
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

655
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:17,715
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

656
00:46:17,715 --> 00:46:24,595
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

657
00:46:24,595 --> 00:46:28,819
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

658
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:33,555
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

659
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:36,691
♫ To you and no one else ♫

660
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:41,523
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

661
00:46:41,523 --> 00:46:43,699
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

662
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:46,875
♫ No one knows ♫

663
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:50,035
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

664
00:46:50,035 --> 00:46:53,403
♫ I hope you know ♫

665
00:46:54,867 --> 00:47:01,459
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

666
00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:06,899
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

667
00:47:06,899 --> 00:47:13,651
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

668
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:17,907
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

669
00:47:17,907 --> 00:47:23,059

♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

672
00:47:30,675 --> 00:47:33,107
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

673
00:47:33,107 --> 00:47:36,315
♫ No one knows ♫

00:47:39,091 --> 00:47:43,259
♫ I hope you know ♫
