[Episode 32]

32
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,799
In fact, I have liked you

33
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,480
since then.

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,519
I'll jump.

35
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,600
Just do it.

36
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,319
I've been eating a bit too much lately.

37
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,439
You've got to catch me.

38
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,079
Don't worry. I can catch you.

39
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,680
Come on. Give me your hand.

40
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,456
Come on.

41
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm too fat for you to catch.

43
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,208
It's okay.

44
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,840
Ling Weiyi, you have to say yes.

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,080
We won the game,

46
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,280
it's all thanks to Qi Yu.

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,720
How can you use a beauty trap like this?

48
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,759
It's okay, Weiyi.

49
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,439
If you don't say yes, next year
we'll have Qi Yu support our department.

50
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,199
We'll beat you all.

51
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,599
What does it matter to me
whether you win the game or not?

52
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,599
Anyway, I support the team
whichever team Qi Yu is in.

53
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,728
After all, he will win.

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,520
Does it count as a yes?

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,664
Wait.

56
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,000
Do you really like me?

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,479
So, will you treat me the best?

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,640
Of course.

59
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,216
Alright then.

60
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,639
Do you still like me?

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,479
You can just say it.

62
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,240
Hesitating is not your style.

63
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,040
Sorry, actually I've wanted
to call and apologize to you every day.

64
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,040
But I don't think it's going to work this time.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You don't need to apologize to me.

66
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,839
You haven't done anything wrong.

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,560
There are some problems between us.

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,279
Actually, we don't have to

69
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,839
solve these problems, right?

70
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,079
I like you, and you like me.

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,240
Then why do we have to consider

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,639
the money, house and all that stuff?

73
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,959
Can't we just love each other day by day?

74
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,279
That way, I don't have to change myself,

75
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,519
and you don't need to make yourself

76
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,800
under great pressure, right?

77
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,279
Weiyi, I know you don't want to accept it.

78
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,344
Neither do I.

79
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,040
But I have to think about our future.

80
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,439
But you never know the future.

81
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,360
Can't we just live happily day by day?

82
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,680
We had agreed

83
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
to watch the sunrise and sunset together,

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,560
stay home and watch movies when it rains,

85
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,519
go out for a picnic when it's sunny,

86
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,279
go surfing in summer and skiing in winter.

87
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,040
If we can't sleep at night,

88
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,720
then you'll accompany me
to watch the sea at night.

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,199
Isn't it wonderful?

90
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,920
We can't be in love for a lifetime
without considering the reality problems.

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,800
If there's no future,
then I'm just wasting your time.

92
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:40,199
So you are going to break up with me, right?

93
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,759
Ling Weiyi, let's break up.

94
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,839
You deserve someone better.

95
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,959
And to you, I am

96
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,296
not the one.

97
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:04,640
♫ As time goes by ♫

98
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,128
♫ I start to realize ♫

99
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,080
♫ How much I miss you ♫

100
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,720
♫ I remember it as if it was yesterday ♫

101
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,336
♫ We used to share many memories ♫

102
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:21,856
♫ But I've already locked them away ♫

103
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:24,224
♫ Placed in a corner ♫

104
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:28,896
♫ They're waiting to be found again ♫

105
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:33,184
♫ Those cherished quiet moments ♫

106
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:36,672
♫ Are hidden in the dark ♫

107
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:43,328
♫ Light them up again and again,
and never let go ♫

108
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:47,424
♫ The silent, everlasting promise ♫

109
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:52,840
♫ Are secretly hidden within my heart ♫

110
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,800
I remember we once watched a drama, Endless…

111
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,959
What are you doing? Do you want
me to find someone else?

112
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,759
That drama was a tragedy, wasn't it?

113
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,000
But I believe

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,240
we will definitely not end up like that.

115
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,000
You will be alright and so will I.

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,959
We will always be together,

117
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,160
never apart.

118
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,440
Why did you only run for half an hour today?

119
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,840
I had already run for an hour before you came.

120
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,360
I thought

121
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,519
to exhaust my body, then I won't feel that bad.

122
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,200
But I found the more tired I get,
the more I want to rely on someone.

123
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,000
Come on.

124
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,160
Lean on me.

125
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
I'm glad you are here.

126
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,919
But today, you…

127
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,519
You have to find a new client
because of that scumbag named Fu.

128
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,320
Isn't staying here with me
holding you back from your time?

129
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,759
My best friend just had a breakup.

130
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,320
Why would I still work?

131
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,919
Work is not important now.

132
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,639
Even if I had a client worth one billion
come to me right now,

133
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,559
I wouldn't go to work.

134
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,279
My only work today is to be with you.

135
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,639
A client worth one billion!

136
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,919
Then you have to go.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
What if your best friend
has a breakup every two months,

138
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,759
then you might miss the chance
to be the richest person in the world?

139
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,159
Can you not jinx it, please?

140
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,360
This breakup will be your last one.

141
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,080
The next person you meet
will surely like you very much,

142
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,759
treat you well
and want to stay with you for life.

143
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,000
This time, just consider it a regret.

144
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,679
Everyone has regrets in life.

145
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,879
It's not fun to have no regrets, right?

146
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,968
I'll get the phone.

147
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,399
Tu, your friend, Mr. Yu,

148
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,360
came today to make a large deposit.

149
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,960
Those clients you worked on these days

150
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,320
have all entered the approval process as well.

151
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,639
Your performance for this month is secured.

152
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,559
You can rest assured and take an annual leave.

153
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,960
Go have fun with your newlywed husband.

154
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
Sorry, Ji.

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,016
Compared to my best friend,

156
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,559
you have to step aside for now.

157
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,832
Lean on me.

158
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:53,360
Where do you want to go for fun?
I have a holiday now.

159
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,720
We'll go wherever you want to go.

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,120
I want to go alone.

161
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,440
No. I'll be worried.

162
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,639
I've been with Qi Yu for so many years.

163
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,159
We've been through so much together.

164
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:15,639
It's also time for me to sort things out alone.

165
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,279
Don't worry. I won't stay single forever,

166
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,279
or get discouraged.

167
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,159
I'll be back myself when I'm better.

168
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,472
Just like last time.

169
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,919
Someone said,

170
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,159
as long as there's a holiday,

171
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,720
she would go on vacation with Ji.

172
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,679
Alright, don't worry about me.

173
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,559
I just want to be alone for a while.

174
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,360
How can I not worry?

175
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,559
I've been waiting for you.

176
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,879
Good news.

177
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,679
The new energy company
you personally negotiated with

178
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,759
is going through
the financing approval process.

179
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,200
As long as we secure this top-notch big client,

180
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,240
it also lays a foundation
for the future development

181
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,639
of Ji'an branch.

182
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,440
When the comprehensive cooperation starts,

183
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,120
we won't have to worry about our performance
for quite a while in the future.

184
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,080
Sounds like good news.

185
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,840
However, you have to keep a closer eye on it.

186
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Rest assured.

187
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,080
By the way, I've taken an annual leave.

188
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,200
Together with the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.

189
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,960
Mr. Zhao, please be more attentive
in the upcoming period.

190
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:41,608
Mr. Zhao? You just said Mr. Zhao?

191
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:43,976
What does that mean?

192
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Honey, let me tie the apron on you,

193
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,279
so you won't get your white shirt dirty.

194
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,399
It's so delicious.

195
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,320
I've looked up the information.

196
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,279
Having hot pot once in a while is okay.

197
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,840
I've already told you so.

198
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,279
And having one or two cups of milk tea
occasionally is okay.

199
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,279
I've already told you so.

200
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,960
This milk tea is almost finished.
I'll order you another one.

201
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,200
Get me a cold one.

202
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,232
No way.

203
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:09,240
Alright then. Get me a warm one.

204
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,919
Both eating hot pot and drinking milk tea
are okay for me.

205
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,279
But there's something wrong with you.

206
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,480
What's wrong with me?

207
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,879
Is getting promoted
to a department manager that happy?

208
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,720
Setting up such a big table just for me?

209
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,728
Well, what else?

210
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,919
To put it big,

211
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,600
my career has achieved a milestone success.

212
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,200
To put it small, from now on,

213
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,608
I'm finally on an equal footing with you.

214
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,679
Congratulations.

215
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,039
Such a great joy.

216
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,000
Let alone having a hot pot
or a cup of milk tea,

217
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,720
even if you want to go to the club
tonight and see the blond guy,

218
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,080
- I'll keep you company.
- I didn't see him last time.

219
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,759
That's more like it.

220
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,080
Besides, that blonde guy
is not as handsome as your husband.

221
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,168
Exactly.

222
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,240
Come on, have a piece of meat.

223
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
I'm much better now. You'd eat.

224
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,000
I knew it. Ji always keeps his word.

225
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,639
He doesn't make empty promises.

226
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,080
Don't compliment Ji here to me.

227
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,200
You're the only one who doesn't know
that Ji made you the department manager

228
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,080
just so he could put all the work onto you,

229
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,159
and then he can go on annual leave,

230
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,039
taking his wife to go have fun.

231
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,600
Where's my milk tea? Did you order it?

232
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,639
I'm not ordering anymore.
Too much milk tea is bad for your health.

233
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,159
Believe it or not,
I will pour this hot pot on your face.

234
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,792
It's already on the way.

235
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,952
Keep eating.

236
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:50,760
[Be happy]

Hello, can you take a picture
of me and my wife?

248
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,279
- Thank you.
- Sure.

249
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,336
Let's take a picture together.

250
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,399
Get closer and smile.

251
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,552
Go check it.

252
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,480
It's nice, thank you.

253
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,672
How do you think?

254
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:10,159
Thank you.

255
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,168
No problem.

256
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,919
Ji said you could find him by this cat.

257
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,984
Go for it.

258
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,360
I'll hold this for you for now.

259
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,440
The story begins with that cat.

260
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:08,296
[You complete me.]

261
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,192
Shall we go back and look for it?

262
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:13,856
It should still be there.

263
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:17,200
Forget it. Let's go buy a new one.

264
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,599
I used this kind of eraser
back in high school too.

265
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,776
Take it.

266
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,839
Why do you have this umbrella?

267
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,200
This umbrella is from my father's company.

268
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,256
Why do you have it?

269
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,160
You still remember this umbrella?

270
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,680
Of course, back when
my father was still working,

271
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,720
his company would give out
these umbrellas every year.

272
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,559
We've got a lot at home,

273
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,440
at least fifteen.

274
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,759
Do your relatives work at Puling?

275
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,480
If I was the first guy

276
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,960
to walk to you when you
graduated from senior high school,

277
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,039
would you say yes?

278
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:41,119
Indeed, there are not so many ifs in life.

279
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,680
You didn't like me back then.

280
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,104
There are no ifs in life.

281
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,400

♫ I even feel happy when waiting for you ♫

285
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,519
If it wasn't me this morning,

286
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,519
would you also help?

287
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:16,440
Yes. But if it were someone else,
I would do it as a boss.

288
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,304
But if it were you,

289
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
apart from being your boss,

290
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,480
I am also your future husband.

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,519
This is how you see yourself?

294
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,599
Tu Xiaoning, you weren't like this before.
You've changed.

295
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,160
I've changed. People change.

296
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,839
Just look at you now.

297
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,599
You are no longer the guy I knew

298
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,759
at first.

299
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
Actually, I have many flaws.

300
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,079
I hope in the future, if you see the ordinary

301
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,319
or even mediocre me,

302
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,440
don't be so disappointed in me
and don't despise me.

303
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,359
Why would I laugh at you?

304
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,640
You are Ji Yuheng, after all.

305
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,200
I am Ji Yuheng only if you like me.

306

365
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,559
Mom, dad. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

366
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,519
We are here to visit you.

367
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,240
Right, I have some good news.

368
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,000
You're going to be grandparents.

369
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,720
I've already married and have my own family.

370
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,160
From now on in this world,

371
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,799
I'm no longer alone.

372
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,880
The person I found

373
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,960
isn't very tall

374
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,119
or handsome.

375
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,400
He is my colleague.

376
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,799
But he loves me very much.

377
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,640
Of course, I love him very much too.

378
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,759
But I don't usually tell him about it.

379
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,480
Right. He was here when I came back last time.

380
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,400
Did you arrange him to me

381
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,279
because you thought he's good?

382
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:57,000
Of course. In the eyes
of my father-in-law and mother-in-law,

383
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,359
I must be a good son-in-law.

384
00:27:02,112 --> 00:27:04,319
Let's offer incense to them.

385
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,880
Dad, mom, rest assured.

386
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,599
I truly love Rao Jing.

387
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:20,039
And my parents like her very much.

388
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,960
In the future, I will take good care of her.

389
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,640
I will love her, accompany her,
and take care of her with all my heart.

390
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,799
So she will no longer be alone.

391
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,848
In the future, the two of us

392
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,119
will come to visit you often.

393
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:48,759
I am quite talkative.

394
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,168
Don't find me annoying.

395
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,232
Don't cry.

396
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,079
Calm down.

397
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,040
Alright.

398
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:55,476
♫ I can always see the faint glimmer of light ♫

399
00:28:55,476 --> 00:28:58,920
♫ Flowing through the gaps between my fingers ♫

400
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,472

♫ Rushing towards
all the destinations of the future ♫

403
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,920
Come on. One, two, three.

404
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,359
Good, perfect. Thank you.

405
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,839
I'm so tired. My feet really hurt.

406
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,319
I'm so tired. Aren't you tired?

407
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,200
You carried me.

408
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,759
But you didn't seem to be tired.

409
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,279
I have always been physically strong.

410
00:29:32,864 --> 00:29:36,200
Sorry, can I take a few more photos for you?

411
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,559
Both of you are pretty.

412
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,519
We'd like to use your photos as a showcase

413
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,680
and post them on the online shop.

414
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,359
Of course. Once the photos are out,

415
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,880
we will give them to you as soon as possible.

416
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,480
And we can offer you a half price.

417
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,319
Half price? Then I…

418
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,584
Sorry, my wife is a bit tired today.

419
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:52,864
We can't help you.

420
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:53,888
It's okay.

421
00:29:53,888 --> 00:29:55,559
We certainly respect your personal wishes.

422
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,119
Then, please go change your clothes,
sorry for the disturbance.

423
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,168
Okay, thank you.

424
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,480
Half price is quite a good deal.

425
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,584
Why didn't you agree?

426
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,759
I don't want others to see your beauty.

427
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,759
Where did the generous you go
when we were trying on clothes yesterday?

428
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,279
But that's true.

429
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,559
I also don't want too many people

430
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,480
to see the photos of my handsome Ji.

431
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,680
I have to keep him to myself.

432
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,920
How?

433
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
I can't tell you.

434
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,968
Alright.

435
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,559
Ji, thank you for your hard work today.

436
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,039
You've been so cooperative with the photoshoot.

437
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,079
I really like it.

438
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,400
What are you saying?

439
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,440
You don't need to thank me.

440
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,584
Love you.

441
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,152
Me too.

[A Harmonious Family Leads To Prosperity]

443
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:13,160
Xiaoning looks beautiful in the wedding dress.

444
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,799
My daughter is finally getting married.

445
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,632
Alright, alright.

446
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:27,440
Tu, calm down.

447
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,680
Your daughter getting married
is a happy occasion.

448
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,168
Alright.

449
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,759
But my meeting on the magpie bridge
will be a waste.

450
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,880
We'd go.

451
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,920
We're going there
for our anniversary this year.

452
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,440
Walking over everyone's heads, how about that?

453
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,640
- How about that?
- Okay.

454
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,720
How about we do another wedding photo shoot?

455
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,400
- Okay.
- Right.

456
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,544
I'll also wear a wedding dress.

457
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,880
We didn't take them when we got married.

458
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,599
From that…

459
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,640
- Unforgettable…
- Watching her wear the wedding dress,

460
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,376
I still feel sad.

461
00:32:09,376 --> 00:32:11,496
Alright, alright.

462
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,000
What familiar flavors
and familiar surroundings!

463
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,200
What a familiar sky and a familiar moon!

464
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,288
That excited?

465
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,680
Do you still remember?

466
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,359
That day, you told me about something about

467
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,119
backpack theory.

468
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,359
No one remembers it at all.

469
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,079
I remember it all.

470
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,960
This is your precious dark history.

471
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,240
I'll mention it now and then.

472
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,599
That day you even said
life was meaningless and dull,

473
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,839
and you were envious of my carefree living.

474
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,319
Boring.

475
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,960
I don't mention it anymore.

476
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,240
Take a seat. Let's chat.

477
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:57,960
So I can say anything?

478
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,359
- Say it.
- Then I'll say it.

479
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,920
Let's say,

480
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,160
you drank too much that day,

481
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,599
and couldn't even get out of bed the next day.

482
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,200
You couldn't even walk in a straight line

483
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
in the hotel.

484
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,119
You walked weirdly

485
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:14,839
until boarding the ship.

486
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,799
Okay, stop.

487
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,880
I'm sorry, honey. I was wrong.

488
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,079
Let's make a pact, the two of us

489
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,839
will never mention each other's dark history.

490
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,599
We throw all these nasty memories

491
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,536
into the dustbin of the years

492
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:31,359
and lock them up, okay?

493
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,240
No. It's you who allows me to say it,

494
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,519
and it's you who forbids to say it.

495
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,559
Who do you think you are?

496
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,279
The center of the world and the universe?

497
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,079
Stop talking about it.

498
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,079
I think you're just feeling bored,

499
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:45,480
wanting to make fun of me.

500
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,880
Thank you, my honey.

501
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,640
Because of you, my life has become lively.

502
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,039
Now, I just want some peace and quiet.

503
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,720
Alright, come on.

504
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,200
You want peace and quiet? I'll shut up.

505
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,599
The next time we come to Xihai Town,

506
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,480
the child will have been born.

507
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,000
Let's hold a wedding in Xihai Town.

508
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,079
We're not inviting anyone,
just the three of us.

509
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,239
And the child will be our witness.

510
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,632
Alright, honey.

511
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:16,760
You decide. I'll listen to you.

512
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,719
Moreover, this way is
more meaningful and economical.

513
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,880
It was a good thing,

514
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,800
and you had to say it's economical.

515
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,519
You are really the stingy man.

516
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,440
We have to live our lives. So…

517
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:32,199
Who is it?

518
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,312
My dad.

519
00:34:36,512 --> 00:34:37,559
Mom, dad.

520
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,880
Happy holidays, mom, dad.

521
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,968
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

522
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:41,519
Have you eaten mooncakes?

523
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:44,960
Yes, we did. Have you eaten?

524
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Yes.

525
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,679
Jing, last time Fanggang said

526
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,159
you've been having insomnia lately.

527
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,480
I ground the sour jujube kernel
we produce into powder

528
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,280
and sent it to you. It's all natural.

529
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,280
You should receive it soon after you return.

530
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,464
Why do you tell them everything?

531
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:03,599
It's for your own good.

532
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,159
- Sour jujube kernels are effective for insomnia.
- You're always troubling them.

533
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,280
You should try it.

534
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,239
