[Episode 12]

32
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,400
Good morning.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,920
Did you finish your report
and have no work to do?

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,079
No.

35
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,239
Watching funny videos early in the morning

36
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:04,040
can make my day more motivated.

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,760
I don't think you have enough work.

38
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,080
And you have time to set up
a blind date for a colleague.

39
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,312
Well,

40
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:15,360
You'll work on the
Enterprise Specialized And New Declaration

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,000
for the electronic software

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
of the industrial zone Phase II.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,360
Such a laborious task.

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,936
I'll do it.

45
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,800
I arrived too early.

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,280
Jing, good morning.

47
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Morning.

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,919
She's so motivated.

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,520
Ms. Rao, you're glamorous today.

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,879
I'm glamorous every day.

51
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,400
Don't you remember?

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,520
What should I remember?

53
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,159
Last night, you and I…

54
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,199
- What?
- That.

55
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,719
Get to the point.

56
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,759
It's like we're having an illicit relationship.

57
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,159
What?

58
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,759
You forgot you owe me money?

59
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,016
I owe you money?

60
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:19,759
- You must be dreaming.
- What?

61
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,520
You're so stingy.

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,159
We could never have a financial connection.

63
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,000
You lend me money? You must be crazy.

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,120
What do you mean?

65
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,648
Come with me.

66
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:33,319
Where am I going with you?

67
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,560
I'm telling you, don't get physical.

68
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,000
Just look and keep a safe distance.

69
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,280
Hello, I am a waitress at this bar.

70
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,439
This gentleman

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,879
is concerned that you might
deny the bill tomorrow.

72
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,520
Wait, you don't need to say this.

73
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,599
- Then let me start over.
- No need, continue.

74
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,439
So, I shot this video

75
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,759
to provide proof for him.

76
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,120
You've spent 8,000 with us today.

77
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,560
It's all covered by this gentleman.

78
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,159
And the bill has nothing to do with him at all.

79
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,439
- Go on.
- Who's denying the bill?

80
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,960
Exactly, it has absolutely
nothing to do with him.

81
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,680
- And then…
- What proof?

82
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,439
You just give me…

83
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,879
- Ignore her.
- Be careful.

84
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,240
Madam, that one is more expensive.

85
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,280
Don't you touch that one!

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,719
- Open it.
- Come here.

87
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,720
Pull that chair out for her to sit on.

88
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
Deleted it.

89
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,240
Impossible.

90
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,920
What if I delete it, and you don't pay me back?

91
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,759
Besides, such an exciting video,
it's a pity to just delete it.

92
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,040
I need to keep it.

93
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
You'll be eight years at Dairui next year,
if I remember it correctly.

94
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
We'll have a celebration for you.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,600
And I'll play this video at the ceremony.

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
I've thought of the theme for you,

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,512
it's called Rao You Don't Know.

98
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:37,680
Zhao Fanggang, let me tell you.

99
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,000
Delete it right now. Hurry!

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,120
I won't delete it if you kill me. No way.

101
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,368
Give me the phone.

102
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:44,720
- Don't snatch it.
- Give me the phone.

103
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,879
It's my new phone,
I only bought it half a year ago.

104
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,959
It costs 10,000 yuan.

105
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,319
Look. You've smashed the screen.

106
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,079
It's your fault for not holding it tightly.

107
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,319
Good. It can't be turned on now.

108
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,399
How much did you say I owe you?

109
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,456
8,000.

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
I can't even turn it on now.

111
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,439
Don't get mad.

112
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,759
Plus this 10,000, that makes 18,000.

113
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,680
When do you give it to me?

114
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,439
This darn door. Just wait.

115
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,639
She's pretty strong.

116
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,560
- Hello, President Lin.
- Hello, President Lin.

117
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,879
Your Development Department Division One
seems to be very enthusiastic lately.

118
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,360
Morale has been lifted.

119
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,720
I knew I was right to choose you.

120
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,079
I'm flattered.

121
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,160
Our department's working spirit
has indeed improved a lot,

122
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,639
but our performance still needs to be enhanced.

123
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,519
Now there is still some gap

124
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,680
between the requirements of the head office.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,720
Right. I want to try to

126
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,360
make more deposit before the end of the year,

127
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,720
and bring in a few big clients
to increase the total amount.

128
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,864
Good.

129
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:09,040
I found

130
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,399
you can always accomplish anything you want.

131
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,360
How's it going with your girlfriend lately?

132
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,680
I hope work hasn't ruined your relationship.

133
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,279
Quite good.

134
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,384
So when do you plan to get married?

135
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,120
There's no rush to get married.

136
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,208
It'll probably be next year.

137
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,759
Then I'll wait for your good news.

138
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:57,759
Qi.

139
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,199
What kind of gifts do young people
usually give for weddings these days?

140
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,279
Besides the red packets.

141
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,399
Mainly depends on your personal relationship.

142
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,000
Like the relationship I have with Ji.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,128
What should I give him?

144
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:14,600
Mr. Ji?

145
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,639
Mr. Ji is getting married?

146
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,279
No.

147
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,040
I've noticed you young people do things fast.

148
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,079
So I have to prepare in advance.

149
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:26,344
Just drive.

150
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,519
What? You didn't even look at me.

151
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,519
You are on call 24 hours a day with your boss.

152
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:51,079
It's rare to meet you
and you're just sitting there.

153
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,800
I wonder what you are waiting for.

154
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,519
I am not waiting for anything.

155
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,439
It feels so great.

156
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,519
Next time, don't ask me to come
when auntie is here.

157
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,759
No more.

158
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,519
Auntie, you can get off work now.

159
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,080
There's no need to return the extra money.

160
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,000
Thank you, Yi, then I'll go back.

161
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,639
Yi, see you tomorrow.

162
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,640
Alright.

163
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,960
Do you know how hard it is
to wait for you to get off work?

164
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,679
I feel like you're not
in a relationship with me,

165
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,879
but with your bank president instead.

166
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,600
Speaking of the president, he asked me today

167
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,320
how much money young people
should give for a wedding gift.

168
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,080
Were you thinking…

169
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,679
No, it's Mr. Ji of our bank.

170
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,080
But Weiyi, should we also…

171
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,960
What did you say?
Tu Xiaoning is getting married?

172
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,200
Why didn't she tell me?

173
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,279
No, it's Mr. Ji of our bank.

174
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,519
What does it have to do with Xiaoning?

175
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,360
What?

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
I am so wealthy.

177
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,279
How could I let my bestie eat instant noodles?

178
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,840
Besides, as a corporate slave all day,

179
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,360
you have to eat something good.

180
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,559
This meal is worth two days of my salary.

181
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,840
What's up? Did you do anything wrong?

182
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,879
Do I treat you well usually?

183
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,559
Yes.

184
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,960
If you don't want to eat this,

185
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,120
I'll take you to eat something nice after work.

186
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,559
No need. I haven't had much appetite lately.

187
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,728
Alright then.

188
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,200
Is this Ji Yuheng's dream girl, Tang someone?

189
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,519
Keep your voice down. Don't let her hear you.

190
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,679
It'll cause trouble for Ji Yuheng.

191
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,840
You are not even married,
yet you've shared interests.

192
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,080
The two of us don't
get the marriage certificate,

193
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,960
but we're like a normal married couple.

194
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,399
We're living together and sharing money.

195
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,000
So causing him trouble is just
causing trouble for myself.

196
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,200
It's an excuse.
I think you have a crush on him.

197
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,400
So what?

198
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,000
I wonder what he is thinking.

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,960
He did that to you at camping.

200
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,159
And you still don't know what he's thinking?

201
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,399
I am not sure about it.

202
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,080
If you are not sure about it, just ask him.
Send him messages now.

203
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,679
No, no. When the two of us first got together,

204
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,840
it was not based on love.

205
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,600
We got together
because we felt suitable to be together.

206
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,759
Well, isn't it too much for me

207
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,679
to be unilaterally raising

208
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,840
the bar for love?

209
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,080
Besides, every man
can have his dream girl, right?

210
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,639
He did nothing wrong.

211
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,159
Tu Xiaoning, why are you being so coward now?

212
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,399
What?

213
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,759
Fine. In that case,

214
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,279
I give you an advice.

215
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,360
Don't care about the dream girl.

216
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,080
You are in a favorable position now.

217
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,679
Just make some flirtation with him,

218
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:50,279
then you can get him.

219
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,679
Got it?

220
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,840
Never mind. I have an exam coming up soon.

221
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,080
I don't want to get distracted by this.

222
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,720
Fine, whatever.

223
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,840
One of you is with an awkward mouth,

224
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,120
and the other one is with an awkward mind.

225
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,919
You two are really perfect for each other.

226
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,440
Don't tell me about any more

227
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,559
relationship problems like this.

228
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,759
You are the one
who's worrying about the relationship,

229
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,399
but I'll be the one who ends up
in the hospital from anger.

230
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,399
You really pissed me off.

231
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,216
Unlocked.

232
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,904
Xiaoning.

233
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,519
Locked.

234
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,600
Xiaoning.

00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,840
Miss Tu, sorry to bother you.

240
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,799
I'm really sorry for being late
and making you wait last time.

241
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,000
Are you available this weekend?

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,639
I'd like to invite you
for a meal to make amends.

243
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,919
She's taking a shower
and indeed got bothered by you.

244
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,016
You…

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,600

Inconvenient…

250
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,159
When did you come back?

251
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,720
Listening to the question while
doing the paper, you're not concentrating.

252
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,080
The exam is coming up soon.

253
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,320
I wish I could use everything I have right now.

254
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,800
Let me see.

255
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,559
The synchronization rate indicator
is incorrect.

256
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:32,919
Case Analysis Management System,
this choice is incorrect.

257
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,920
Let's see which one to choose.

258
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,399
Let me see, choose A.

259
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,919
A, are you sure?

260
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,159
Not quite sure.

261
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,200
The management model application system here,

262
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,519
you did it correctly.

263
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,000
How can you do this wrong? Think it over.

264
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,320
Choose B.

265
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,392
Are you sure?

266
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,384
Correct.

267
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,559
Don't care about the dream girl.

268
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,639

The reason I'm upset is not for my period.

282
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,520
I know it.

283
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,079
Although Tang Yuhui calls me senior,

284
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,880
when we were in school,

285
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,640
we barely talked and we weren't close at all.

286
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,304
Her transfer to Division One
was a recommendation from the bank,

287
00:17:58,304 --> 00:18:00,488
not by me.

288
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,359
So if you hadn't been with me,

289
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,400
who would you be with?

290
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,240
If I was the first guy

291
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,079
to walk to you when you
graduated from senior high school,

292
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,104
would you say yes?

293
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,599
Indeed, there are not so many ifs in life.

294
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,039
You didn't like me back then.

295
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,759
There are no ifs in life.

296
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,240
So I would still be with you.

297
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,319
I don't bother thinking about it.

298
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,880
The exam is coming up soon.

299
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,279
I've wasted too much time on this already.

300
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,408
Don't think about it anymore.

301
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,359
Let's talk about it after the exam is over.

302
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,559
This tastes bad.

303
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,160
I wonder how cows and sheep

304
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,279
have survived all these years
just by eating these.

305
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,519
Just make do with it.

306
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,519
You saw Qi Yu has six-pack abs,

307
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,119
and insisted on regaining your own vest line.

308
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,799
Even if you're extremely wealthy,

309
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,440
everyone is equal in love.

310
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,224
What are you doing?

311
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,960
You have to study anyway, so eat less.

312
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,279
Well, you mentioned the dream girl that day.

313
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,240
Do you have some pressure?

314
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,319
What do you mean?

315
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:50,359
It sounds like there's been a switch.

316
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
He doesn't like Tang Yuhui.

317
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
So who is this girl

318
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,376
with the high ponytail and the big laugh?

319
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,008
It's you?

320
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:00,640
I don't care who she is.

321
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,279
I just want to study hard now

322
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,720
and pass the probation exam successfully.

323
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,440
And then I can enjoy the New Year well.

324
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,784
You are in the sweetest period in love now.

325
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:11,880
Let me tell you.

326
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,359
Don't go any further in your current state.

327
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,079
Just maintain the carefree vibe,

328
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,000
and try to play hard to get.

329
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,759
But you told me to flirt to him the other day.

330
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,200
The situation has changed.

331
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,799
Back then, you loved him, but he loved her.

332
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,960
So you had to leave it

333
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,000
to the body to lead you.

334
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,119
But now, you two are in a pure love.

335
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,519
Of course, you need to take it slow.

336
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,680
My love consultant,

337
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,799
what would you like to eat? On my treat.

338
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,960
Tell me more.

339
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,400
I want to eat meat, more meat.

340
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,319
For your own good, just forget it.

341
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,640
Your vest line.

342
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,559
Yes, it's quite effective.

343
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,952
What's wrong?

344
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,440
The KPIs set by the leader
are too difficult to meet.

345
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,160
It's almost the end of the year,

346
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,119
and I'm still one-fifth away from the target.

347
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,519
Will he deduct my annual bonus for this?

348
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,519
I don't think so.

349
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,640
The leader has only been here for two months.

350
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,440
And I don't think we'll be responsible

351
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,799
for any of the lost time before.

352
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,960
Don't worry. He is a reasonable guy.

353
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,928
Li Xiang, you have to go for it.

354
00:21:28,928 --> 00:21:31,319
Keep it up. Do a good job.

355
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:37,160
Xu Li, this is a deposit
of 10 million US dollars.

356
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,960
Please sign to confirm my personal performance.

357
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:44,000

358
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,120
US dollars?

359
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,880

my dad used to work with.

They have large amounts
of funds transferred daily.

361
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,519
So I got in touch with their CFO,

362
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,359
asking them to transfer a portion over
to us for settlement.

363
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,359
Okay, which import-export company?

364
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,519
Shunjue.

365
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,039
Okay, Tang, with your speed,

366
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,599
you can become a formal Account Manager soon.

367
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,000
Thank you. I'll keep it up.

368
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,720
Indeed, she is really something.

369
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,039
Just one phone call, and ten million
US dollars are transferred from Shunjue.

370
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,759
I have contacted Mr. Jiang
for a few months before.

371
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:22,799
And they didn't even let me get in the office.

372
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,240
You've known about
her background since day one.

373
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,680
I wonder if her parents
are still in need of a son.

374
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,359
Your stupidity is always so creative.

375
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,000
Are we forming a clique now?

376
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,880
No, this is a normal communication
between departmental mentors and apprentices.

377
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Tu is my apprentice.
She has nothing to do with you.

378
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:54,152
[Dairui, the Leaders]

379
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,759
Leader, Tang has brought in
a ten million US Dollars deposit.

380
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,504
That's quite something.

381
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:03,640
Really?

382
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,680
Congratulations.

383
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,920
Mr. Ji, I'd like to invite everyone out
tonight to celebrate.

384
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,000
I'll treat you to karaoke.

385
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yes, let's all go together.

386
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,680
I won't go.

387
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,759
I have plans tonight.

388
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,599
You have plans?

389
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,440
Tu, I want to ask you something.

390
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,319
Zhao, just say it if you want to talk to me.

391
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,279
Don't scare me.

392
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,880
I was just afraid of exposing your secret.

393
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,896
What secret?

394
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,559
It's about my friend's younger brother,

395
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,519
whom I introduced to you for a blind date.

396
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:51,039
He called you and a guy answered.

397
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,960
Then he hung up the phone really fast.

398
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,968
Who was it?

399
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,640
It's my dad.

400
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,656
Y-Your dad?

401
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:01,640
You're not that young.

402
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,559
And your dad still screens men for you?

403
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,359
I'm preparing for exams, studying quite hard.

404
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,240
So my dad doesn't allow me to get distracted.

405
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,759
Work matters most.

406
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,279
Besides, my parents
have to screen the man I date.

407
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:19,160
Having a daughter is worrisome.

408
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,119
A father has endless worries.

409
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,599
But daughters are cuter than sons.

412
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,952
Childish.

413
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,839
Tu, don't talk about personal matters
during work time.

414
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,280
Come on.

415
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,416
Not done yet.

416
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,039
You're doing it on purpose, right?

417
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,200
I am doing it on purpose.

418
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,000
You must rest a bit. To balance work and rest.

419
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,240
You can't always be studying.

420
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,119
You've finished cleaning up.

421
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,440
But I haven't finished studying.

422
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,759
- Give it to me.
- No.

423
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,720
- Give it to me.
- No.

424
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,752
Give it to me.

425
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,624
Forget it.

426
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,799
Don't be angry.

427
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,759
You are studying every day

428
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,580
and you need to have a proper rest.

429
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,616
I'm not angry.

430
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,319
Your mom will be discharged
and come home to stay next week.

431
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:04,279
I'm afraid I won't have time to study,

432
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:07,519
so I want to take the time.

433
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,559
I see.

434
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,080
Don't worry.
I'll take care of her when Mom arrives.

435
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,400
No way. You'll wear yourself out.

436
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,680
I can share you the burden.

437
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,960
Well, should we change the bed in the study?

438
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,519
If mom comes here…

439
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,039
I've told you not to worry.

440
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:33,200
I've already ordered one,
and the bed has arrived.

441
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,400
Have you figured out anything?

442
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,200
No. Ji, you are smart and capable.

443
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,216
And I'm clumsy and useless.

444
00:26:53,216 --> 00:26:56,799
Alright then. I'll be the leader
in the bank from now on,

445
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,279
and you'll be the leader at home.

446
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,920
I am a leader now,

447
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,319
then I can't just watch you work alone.

448
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:07,160
How about I help you clean up?

449
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,359
Thank you then.

450
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,039
Not at all, this is all I can do anyway.

451
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,256
Just right.

452
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,319

453
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,400
Help me get something.

454
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,640
What should I take?

455
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,799
The No.5 nut on the ground.

456
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,760
Almost there.

Yuheng.

458
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,759
Maybe I should stay
in the hospital a bit longer.

459
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:14,759
I'm used to living here and it's convenient.

460
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,799
Mom, the doctor has already said

461
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,200
that you can be discharged now.

462
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,599
Besides, bringing you home

463
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,559
would also benefit your recovery.

464
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,880
Well, I can just go back and stay at my place.

465
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,000
Going back to your place?

466
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,319
What if you get tired cooking for yourself?

467
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,519
I can cook if I want to,

468
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,200
or order takeout if I don't.
I won't starve anyway.

469
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,519
How can you rely on takeout? What's wrong?

470
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,039
Mom, don't you want to live with us?

471
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,599
You all are busy with work.

472
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,680
You are preparing for the exam, right?

473
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,640
I might bother you.

474
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,880
So you want to live with us, right?

475
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,440
Then what are you afraid of?

476
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,599
Afraid that I am hard to get along with?

477
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,279
Nonsense.

478
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,519
Then let's go back.

479
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,400
Your son has been longing for you
to go home. Finally, you're discharged.

480
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,536
Let's go home.

481
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Go home.

482
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,920
This young couple is really
affectionate and filial.

483
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,720
You're blessed. Just enjoy.

484
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,200
Okay.

485
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,599
Let's go, let's go home.

486
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,880
Go home.

487
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,079
Take it slow.

488
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,079
I have to enjoy it. I'm leaving now.

489
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,519
We are leaving. Wish you get well soon.

490
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,128
Its mouth is moving.

491
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,248
Don't be afraid.

492
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,559
No way. Well, maybe you…

493
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:08,119
Don't just watch, come and help me.

494
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,279
You said to do it yourself.

495
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,359
But it's not quite
the same as the recipe I looked up.

496
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:18,079
According to the recipe,
the fish can be put directly into the pot.

497
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,440
I'll do it.

498
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,240
This fish hasn't been cleaned yet.

499
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,519
Usually, this kind of task is done
by a chef assistant.

500
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,039
Being the chef, you shouldn't do it.

501
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:30,799
Right? Then you help me clean it.

502
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,640
After you're done, then I'll cook.

503
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,640
Give it to me, off you go.

504
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
Are you sure?

505
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,656
Yes.

506
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,680
Be careful. I've prepared
the green onions, ginger, and garlic.

507
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,912
Okay.

508
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:03,400
Ji Yuheng, come and help me.

509
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,039
Wait, don't lead the way if you don't know.

510
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:08,119
Is it here?

511
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,440
I think so.

512
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,559
It should be this one.

513
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,519
You're the kind of guy who's blindly confident.

514
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,319
Look, look, just like I said.

515
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,440
It really is here.

516
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,240
Dad, Mom, come in.

517
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,288
Come in.

518
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,519
Should we change shoes?

519
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,839
- Are we changing shoes?
- Yes.

520
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,640
Come on, in-law, have some black chicken soup.

521
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,319
Xiaoning's dad has been simmering it
all afternoon. It's really good.

522
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,079
- Is that so?
- Try one bowl.

523
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,240
Thank you for making all these dishes.

524
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,000
Not at all.

525
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Give it a try.

526
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,200
Mom, have one bowl too.

527
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,079
It smells so good.

528
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,440
You came without telling me.

529
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,559
Had I known you'd prepared
such a table of dishes,

530
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,200
I wouldn't have almost burned down the kitchen.

531
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,400
How dare you to cook!

532
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,079
Don't you know your daughter?

533
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:02,464
She loves to be brave
and is extremely confident.

534
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,440
Just like her dad.

535
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,568
Being ordinary yet confident.

536
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,400
I know Xiaoning just wants to take care of me.

537
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,160
It doesn't matter if she can't cook.

538
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,319
She is busy with her work.

539
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:20,839
She should rest when she gets home.

540
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,640
In the future, you go to work,

541
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,839
and I'll cook for you.

542
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:29,000
No way.

543
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,359
Let me tell you, in-law.

544
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,000
They brought you here

545
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,279
just to take good care of you.

546
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,720
If you can't stay idle and keep yourself busy,

547
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,519
they would feel burdened too.

548
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,039
Dad is right.

549
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,720
And I have already found a caregiver.

550
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,519
The caregiver will work during the day,
and I'll cook at night.

551
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,519
- That's great.
- Good.

552
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,544
- This is good.
- Right.

553
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:52,512
Don't move.

554
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,519
- What's the matter?
- Turning your head.

555
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,288
It got on your nose.

556
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,680
I just had a little rub.

557
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,880
Alright, I'll listen to you.

558
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,759
Then Yuheng will do the cooking from now on.

559
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,519
Xiaoning, let's just sit on the sofa,

560
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,279
watch TV, and wait to eat.

561
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,079
- That's right.
- Just wait to eat.

562
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,160
Come on, let's have a toast.

563
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Okay.

564
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,960
Thank you, in laws.

565
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,519
- Not at all.
- It's nothing. Wish you a good health.

566
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,400
I'll make it some other day.

567
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,416
Thank you.

568
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,296
It's fine.

569
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:45,839
You guys should rest early. I'm going to bed.

570
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,440
Maybe I'll sleep with you.

571
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,400
If you want some water at night or anything,

572
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,440
I can do it for you.

573
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,559
I can still move around.

574
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,720
I'm fine. You don't need to do so.

575
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,519
I can't bother you newlyweds.

576
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,319
Go on.

577
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,079
Mom is used to sleeping alone.

578
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,096
Let's go back.

579
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:12,400
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

580
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,336
We're leaving.

581
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,280
Maybe I should sleep on the sofa.

582
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,760
That won't do.

583
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,639
What if mom sees and thinks we had a fight?

584
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,680
How would we explain that?

585
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,880
This bed is quite large.

586
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,199
It should be large enough

587
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,440
for each of us to sleep on one side.

588
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,400
Are you sure?

589
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,512
Yes.

590
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,320
Which side do you prefer?

591
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,400
I'll just sleep on this side.

592
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Then I'll sleep on this side.

593
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,119
You rest early.

594
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,920
I have to study for a while.

595
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,912
Don't stay up too late.

596
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,136
Rest early.

597
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,424
Rest early.

598
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:34,199
You are up?

599
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,679
Xiaoning, you are up? Come have breakfast.

600
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,320
Okay, I'll be right there.

601
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,719
You got up by yourself,
why didn't you wake me up?

602
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,719
Mom will think I'm lazy and like to sleep in.

603
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,440
It affects my image.

604
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,679
Do you worry about your image
in front of your mom?

605
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,800
It's different.

606
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,559
What's the difference? We are all family.

607
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:13,840
Come on, have a seat.

608
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,239
I've made you coffee.

609
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,159
No, I must do it tomorrow.

610
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,039
You have to study so late every day.

611
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,360
And you've studied till 2 AM yesterday.

612
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,559
If you still get up to make breakfast,

613
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:26,639
then you will be an iron man.

614
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,776
Xiaoning.

615
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,519
You only slept for four hours yesterday?

616
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:35,199
Mom, I'm used to it.

617
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,320
Well…

618
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,239
You didn't sleep well. Don't drink coffee.

619
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,519
It's bad for the heart. Drink milk.

620
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:43,320
We're already used to it.

621
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,280
Yes, if I don't drink coffee,

622
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,719
I would feel sleepy at work in the morning.

623
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,719
Xiaoning, listen.

624
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:57,000
You need to prepare for the exam
and have to work.

625
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,400
Don't worry about the household chores.

626
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,039
Why bother making breakfast?

627
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,239
Don't treat me as a patient.

628
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,440
Look, I'm perfectly fine.

629
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,280
Instead,

630
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,440
you two should take care of your health.

631
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,719
Don't think it doesn't matter.

632
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,199
That's how sickness starts,

633
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,679
little by little.

634
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,679
Okay.

635
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:23,000
Okay, there's still time before you go to work.

636
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,159
Eat something first,
then go back to sleep more.

637
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:27,440
It'd be the best.

638
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,576
Let's eat.

639
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,239
It's the end of the year, don't delay anymore.

640
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,199
Pretending like nothing happened?

641
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,119
Ms. Rao, I'm the creditor,
and you're the debtor.

642
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,039
If this was in the past,

643
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,760
you would have to be my slave.

644
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,440
Mr. Zhao, you really

645
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,280
look like a slave owner.

646
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,159
Besides, did I ever say
I won't pay you back the money?

647
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,280
I'll give it to you
once my Q4 performance bonus is issued.

648
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,239
I'm surprised you don't save any money.

649
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:07,199
As a creditor, I think you are too nosy.

650
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,079
What does it have to do with you?

651
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,159
What if there's an emergency at home

652
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,280
and you need money, what would you do?

653
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,440
That's easy.

654
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,960
Use credit cards for small expenses.
Take out loans for large amounts.

655
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,119
At the very least, I can use
my car and my handbags.

656
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,320
for mortgage.

657
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,719
Besides, I've worked in the bank
for so many years.

658
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:23,079
I have a stable income and a financial mindset.

659
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:25,360
I couldn't possibly run out of money.

660
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,679
Alright, pay me back the money.

661
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,800
Haven't I told you

662
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,008
I'll give it to you
once my Q4 performance bonus is issued?

663
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:32,119
As a bank employee,

664
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,400
you must know this money of mine

665
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,719
can earn interest for each day
if it's in the bank, right?

666
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,320
Mr. Zhao, you've been
talking to me for ages here

667
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,440
just for that bit of interest?

668
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,360
Easy. I'll give you an extra 1%

669
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,519
at the fixed deposit rate of our bank.

670
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,648
That's not enough.

671
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,880
- 1.5%.
- Deal.

672
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,039
Since the day you got drunk.

673
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,800
Slave owner.

674
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,119
So be it.

675
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,112
Espresso.

676
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,119
Mr. Zhao, you have suddenly had hands.

677
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,280
Don't you ask Tu to make you coffee anymore?

678
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,639
How dare I ask her to do it.

679
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,760
See, she's been studying so hard lately.

680
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,639
If she fails the exam

681
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,024
because

682
00:40:17,024 --> 00:40:19,760
I asked her to make coffee and wasted her time,

683
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,920
I would feel guilty for half a year.

684
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,320
You jinx.

685
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,639
She hasn't even taken the exam yet,
and you're cursing her to fail.

686
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:25,840
That's not what I meant.

687
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,119
She's been so concentrating on
preparing for the exam,

688
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,199
and there are only
two days left until the exam.

689
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,519
If she fails,

690
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,519
she will surely feel upset about it, right?

691
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:37,199
Mr. Zhao, you have many concerns.

692
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,000
You have to collect the debts
and concern about Tu.

693
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,016
What a busy guy.

694
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,440
Tu, have you caught a cold?

695
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,280
A little bit, Zhao.

696
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,719
I have loquat syrup here. I'll get it for you.

697
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:59,280
No need, I'm fine.

698
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,239
Tu, are you okay?

699
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,760
I've taken medicine.
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Ji.

700
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,816
Are you sure?

701
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,880
Yes, I'm really okay.

702
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,400
Sorry, Tu.

703
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,960
I-I forgot where I've put it.

704
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,880
I'll order a takeout for you.

705
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,784
Where is my phone?

706
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,920
[Sweetness is made up of many everyday moments]

707
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,719
Xiaoning.

708
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,784
Wake up.

709
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,519
What's wrong? Did I wake you up?

710
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:23,280
It's late now, go to sleep.

711
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,144
I'll carry you there.

712
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,584
Good night.

713
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,008
Good night.

714
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,008
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

715
00:44:08,008 --> 00:44:11,108
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

716
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:16,268
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

717
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:20,452
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

718
00:44:20,452 --> 00:44:23,940
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

719
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,852
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

720
00:44:28,516 --> 00:44:32,164
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

721
00:44:32,164 --> 00:44:39,044
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

722
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:43,268
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

723
00:44:43,268 --> 00:44:48,004
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

724
00:44:48,004 --> 00:44:51,140
♫ To you and no one else ♫

725
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,972
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

726
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:58,148
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

727
00:44:58,148 --> 00:45:01,324
♫ No one knows ♫

728
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:04,484
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

729
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:07,852
♫ I hope you know ♫

730
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:15,908
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

731
00:45:15,908 --> 00:45:21,348
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

732
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:28,100
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

733
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,356
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

734
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:37,508
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

735
00:45:37,508 --> 00:45:40,452
♫ To you and no one else ♫

736
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:45,124
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

737
00:45:45,124 --> 00:45:47,556
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

738
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:50,764
♫ No one knows ♫

739
00:45:51,336 --> 00:45:53,540
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

740
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,708
♫ I hope you know ♫
