Don't. Don't say that.

Working under Jiang is tolerable.

113
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,879

114
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,000
if anyone from Division One has been
called in for a talk by the Bank President.

115

But as you wish, everyone's here.

116

Ms. Rao, you're sometimes overly concerned.

117
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:28,000
The President is discussing the candidates
for the Division One manager.

118

What's that got to do with Division Two?

119

124

no wonder Division One's
performance is so lame.

Exactly.

183
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,519
Yuheng.

184
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,799
Regarding the August

185
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,759
audit and supervision work
for all branches in Nanhu Province,

186
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,399
today, we need to make a summary together.

187
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,360
We're just missing you.

188
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Okay, I'll head over now.

189
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,400
Alright.

190
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,039
Sorry, I'm a bit busy today.

191
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,039
It might have to wait after work.

192
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,240
Busy?

193
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,840
Busy trying to become a manager
in Division One?

194
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,440
Have you heard that Ji Yuheng
from the Compliance Department

195
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,799
has been transferred to
the Development Department Division One?

196
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,879
Really?

197
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,519
It's not yet decided, right?

198
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,000
But, you know, I really envy
the Development Department

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,679
for having such a handsome leader.

200
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,600
This must really increase
the motivation to work.

201
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,320
Indeed.

202
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,519
I heard he's still single.

203
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,679
- Really?
- Let's go, let's go.

204
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,879
Are you done? Let's go.

205
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,720
Everyone has the right to pursue love.

206
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,200
But to exchange a career for love

207
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,279
and have an office romance,

208
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,399
I think it's better

209
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,752
to nip it in the bud.

210
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:47,960
When you are free,

211
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,639
stop bingeing on that trope
where the overbearing CEO falls for some girl.

212
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,159
Women

213
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,360
should have a solid career in their hands.

214
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
That's the most important thing.

215
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
What if the CEO is also lovesick

216
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,559
and resigns for love?

217
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,679
Then you can ask

218
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,200
Liu Xiaoli Liu from Division Two

219
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
to see just how low the odds are.

220
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,960
So why was only Liu Xiaoli transferred?

221
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,639
One is a newcomer just entering the workforce,

222
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,960
and the other is Mr. Xing's right-hand

223
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,080
the cornerstone of Division Two.

224
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,320
Who leaves and who stays is clear to all.

225
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,000
But Liu Xiaoli's husband
has also received punishment,

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,432
symbolically.

227
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,200
Let's go home together in the evening.

228
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,720
What do you feel like eating?
I'll make it for you

229
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,120
Right, what did you want
to ask me earlier today?

230
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,519
we can chat on the way.

231
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,720
No need, I'm going to eat at my parents' place.

232
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,039
The round eggplant tends to be firmer,

233
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,000
while the long eggplant
is softer and more watery.

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,759
This is string eggplant which is also juicy.

235
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,960
This is graffiti eggplant.

236
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,399
Stop messing around.

237
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,399
Doesn't Ji know how to cook?

238
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,559
And it's not far.

239
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,000
She can come back whenever she wants.

240
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,639
There's no need for our girl to learn this.

241
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,639
It has nothing to do with whether Ji can cook.

242
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,279
I'm talking about our daughter.

243
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,320
She can choose not to do it,

244
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
but she can't not know how.

245
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,080
She is married now.

246
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,519
It's different from before.

247
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,600
After getting married,

248
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
a woman needs to be independent.

249
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,799
Not just financially,

250
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,480
but also in daily life, okay?

251
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,639
She needs to have the confidence

252
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,639
and courage to live on
no matter who she leaves.

253
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,600
And it includes

254
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,559
her parents, husband, all of them.

255
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,720
When she is on her own,

256
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,272
she won't go hungry.

257
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:39,399
Dad.

258
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,279
How do you know Ji Yuheng can cook?

259
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,159
Don't all boys know how to cook these days?

260
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,399
So you were guessing?

261
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,616
He can, right?

262
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm back.

263
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:02,720
It smells so good.

264
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
It really smells good.

265
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,039
Welcome back.

266
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,679
Ji is here.

267
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,480
After I make a cold mixed eggplant dish,

268
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,799
we can start the meal.

269
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,039
Xiaoning loves cold mixed eggplant the most.

270
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,759
What are you doing here?

271
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,072
Who let you in?

272
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,159
I knew something was up.

273
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,320
Look,

274
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,720
the two did not come back together.

275
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,120
Ji even made a call saying he would come.

276
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,840
What's up?

277
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,360
It's normal for couples to argue.

278
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,000
What do you mean 'normal'?

279
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,039
Let me tell you.

280
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,320
Xiaoning is not a meddlesome person.

281
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,799
I must ask her later.

282
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,519
You're worrying about nothing.

283
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,320
Don't meddle with their affairs.

284
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,360
Let them handle it themselves.

285
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,919
You are just avoiding the problem.

286
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,200
Let me tell you,

287
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,240
in marriage, it's all about…

288
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,159
Scooch.

289
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,000
In marriage, small things
reflect bigger issues.

290
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,240
If you don't solve the small problems,

291
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,679
with time, they become major problems.

292
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,279
Didn't you say you wanted
to have dinner at your parents' house?

293
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,399
So I came.

294
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,519
I said I'd go back to my parents' house.

295
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,360
Aren't your parents also my parents now?

296
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,759
What's going on today?

297
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,120
You said this morning that you
wanted to ask me something.

298
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,279
What was it?

299
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,039
It's not very convenient
when my parents are around.

300
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,064
Let's talk about it when we get back.

301
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,320
Sorry to keep you waiting.

302
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,480
- Thank you, Ji.
- Come here.

303
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,279
Cold mixed eggplant.

304
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,360
This is such a feast.

305
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, let's dig in.

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,039
Come on, Ji.

307
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,080
You've worked the hardest. Come on.

308
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,120
I'll serve you first.

309
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,200
Okay, thank you, Dad.

310
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,480
Have some fish.

311
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,879
I don't want fish.

312
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:50,440
There are too many bones. I prefer meat.

313
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,639
The fish is fresh and good for your brain.

314
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,639
But you prefer meat.

315
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,679
Picking bones is too much trouble.

316
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,840
I don't like it.

317
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,960
But living is always troublesome in some way.

318
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,679
Compared to other major life events,

319
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,080
eating is already the simplest thing.

320
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,519
If there are bones, just pick them out.

321
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,919
If there's trouble, solve it.

322
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,279
Right, Ji?

323
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,039
If you're not even willing to do this,

324
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,759
how will you cope with the days ahead?

325
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:39,120
You have an attitude.

326
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,440
What exactly is the matter?

327
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Let's talk after dinner.

328
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:53,159
Alright.

329
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,759
Cut out these little antics

330
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,679
right under our watch.

331
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,159
What's going on?

332
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,639
Nothing.

333
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,879
Did anything happen?

334
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,048
Nothing, right?

335
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,919
Mom, you like fish soup.

336
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,000
I'll serve you some.

337
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,200
Dad, Mom.

338
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,240
Actually today,

339
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,960
I received a new job offer

340
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,048
to transfer…

341
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,559
Did you burn your hand?

342
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,759
Stop it.

343
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,000
It's been out of the pot for quite a while now.

344
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,440
It can't be hot enough to burn her.

345
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,519
Ji, keep going.

346
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,584
- Actually, the offer is to transfer…
- Dad.

347
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,759
You know, Uncle Liu

348
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,039
just told me he needed to see you.

349
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,288
It just occurred to me.

350
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,840
Liu doesn't usually seek me out.

351
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,159
If he's looking for me, there must be…

352
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,360
something… something important.

353
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,759
I… I have to make a trip there.

354
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,360
Dad, are you going alone?

355
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,480
Come with me.

356
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,600
Why should I go with you?

357
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I'm discussing something with Ji.

358
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,919
You can talk about it later.
Liu's family has gotten a dog.

359
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,879
- It's… it's too fierce.
- When did they get a dog?

360
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:00,559
Let's go, go, go.

361
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,919
- We were talking about something.
- They just got it, a really big dog.

362
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,359
Aren't you going to find Liu?

363
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,680
Why would I do that?

364
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,240
All he does is brag about his grandson.

365
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,360
It bugs me.

366
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,319
Look at you, do you even look like a father?

367
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,880
Besides,

368
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,480
what can you, a grown man, find out anyway?

369
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,960
If there's something to hear,

370
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,279
I should do it.

371
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,920
Hey.

372
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,319
Just say what you want to say.

373
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,079
What were you about to tell them just now?

374
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,680
Is it about you planning to transfer
to Development Department Division One

375
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,839
and become my immediate superior?

376
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,240
You already know?

377
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,519
It's all over the Star City branch.

378
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,519
How could I not know?

379
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,559
My mom used to be an accountant.

380
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,440
She's quite sensitive
to these rules and regulations.

381
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,480
If you talk about this with them,

382
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,079
do you think they won't worry?

383
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,359
But it doesn't matter
whether they worry or not.

384
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:05,759
After all, our relationship is bound to end.

385
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,839
They'll find out about it sooner or later.

386
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,264
What do you mean
our relationship is bound to end?

387
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:12,720
Are you thinking of

388
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,519
breaking up?

389
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,720
While our relationship hasn't gone too deep,

390
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,008
let's part on good terms.

391
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Why?

392
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,720
Why?

393
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,000
You don't need me to explain to you

394
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,079
Dairui's attitude toward office romance.

395
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,920
If you quietly parachute over here

396
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,640
and our relationship gets discovered,

397
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,039
it's a choice between one or the other.

398
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,160
Who do you think will be the one to leave?

399
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,440
You are the manager
personally selected by the Bank President.

400
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,200
As for me, I'm just a temp

401
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,480
who doesn't need any reasons to be fired.

402
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,079
That's something you can
figure out with your toes.

403
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,759
When the time comes, I'll be the one leaving.

404
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,000
Rather than living every day in fear

405
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,079
and not knowing when this bomb will explode,

406
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,519
it would be better
to end this relationship myself.

407
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,039
So this is what you've been worried about.

408
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,079
Even if you didn't ask me today,

409
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,759
I would still tell you about this.

410
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,440
Moreover, this is an invitation
given to me by the Bank President.

411
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,799
I haven't made a final decision yet.

412
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,880
The whole matter is still undecided.

413
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,519
But Tu Xiaoning,

414
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:37,519
you are choosing to break up with me

415
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,640
because of an undecided issue.

416
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,200
Is this your attitude towards our relationship?

417
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,559
So hasty?

418
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,728
I…

419
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:53,599
What's the matter?

420
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,799
Is something stuck?

421
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,200
Don't move.

422
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,759
- Keys, keys, quickly.
- What's wrong?

423
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:01,400
I don't know what's going on. Hurry up.

424
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,839
Does it hurt like this?

425
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,799
- What's wrong?
- Seems like a fishbone is stuck.

426
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,839
Drinking some vinegar should help.

427
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,960
There is still half a steamed
bun left from breakfast.

428
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,400
It may cause damage to the esophagus.

429
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,759
I'll take Xiaoning to the hospital.

430
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't worry. Let's go.

431
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,144
Alright. Go. Quickly.

432
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,768
It hurts.

433
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Nurse, may I ask what this is?

434
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,240
A laryngoscopy

435
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,039
to clearly see the condition of the esophagus.

436
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,519
Such a long tube for the laryngoscopy.

437
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,160
Will it be very painful?

438
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,672
Anesthetics will be applied.

439
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,640
The one next door is an external injury.

440
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,920
Her condition is different.

441
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,240
It's my first time seeing a family member
more nervous than the patient.

442
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,640
Don't worry, it's nothing serious.

443
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,079
Thank you.

444
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,279
Tu Xiaoning, right?

445
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,488
Come over here.

446
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:01,832
[Outpatient Building]

447
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,599
Alright, the fishbone has been removed.

448
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,840
Thank you.

449
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,319
The doctor said

450
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,359
the puncture wasn't deep.

451
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,864
It'll be better in a couple of days

452
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,160
Okay, don't cry anymore.

453
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,799
Who's crying?

454
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,400
This is just a physiological reaction.

455
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,640
I got poked in the throat.

456
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,920
It really is physiological.

457
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,000
It'll be fine in a moment.

458
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,440
Your husband really cares about you.

459
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:39,480
Let's go.

460
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,928
Thank you.

461
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,599
Here, have some water first.

462
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,136
Thanks.

463
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,559
With our relationship,

464
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,640
you don't need to be formal.

465
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,088
You…

466
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,600
You go first.

467
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,279
As to the matter of being transferred
to the Development Department Division One,

468
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,759
I think I need to explain.

469
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,200
The Bank President had his reasons
for sending me over.

470
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Xing from Division Two

471
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,319
took on a big project a few days ago

472
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,759
and is currently in the limelight.

473
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,359
The head office intends

474
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,599
to merge the two departments

475
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,880
and put him in charge.

476
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,759
Meanwhile, the problem with Division One
is that there's no leader.

477
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,759
Rao Jing and Zhao Fanggang
just had an internal conflict,

478
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,240
and there are constant resignations.

479
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,720
You could say it's a thorny mess.

480
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,759
At this time,

481
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:47,359
I have no better candidate than you.

482
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,920
Just one year.

483
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,039
The head office has given us one year
to reorganize Division One.

484
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,240
Once the time is up,

485
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
I will not trouble you anymore.

486
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,799
As for the Compliance Department,

487
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,039
you don't need to worry.

488
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,960
I will give them a heads-up

489
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,624
to not make things difficult for you.

490
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,799
But sir,

491
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,680
I still have a question.

492
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,839
Please.

493
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:12,599
Why are you so insistent
on keeping Division One?

494
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,839
Within the clients of Division One,

495
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,680
there are many small and micro enterprises.

496
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,400
Once it is merged with Division Two,

497
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,839
this part of the business
will be significantly reduced.

498
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,759
But it is precisely these small businesses

499
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:25,680
that can solve many employment
issues for ordinary people.

500
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,279
So,

501
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,200
I want to do my best to keep it.

502
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,839
I understand.

503
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,039
I'll give it some good thought after I go back

504
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,640
and respond to you as soon as possible.

505
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,720
So it's not that easy

506
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,599
to keep Division One.

507
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,240
The conditions set by the head office

508
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,559
stipulate a performance increase of 50%.

509
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,640
That is an impossible task to complete.

510
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,880
It's clearly a promised failure.

511
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,319
But you still want to go

512
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,319
since you did not directly refuse, right?

513
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,839
Actually, I am hesitant

514
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,920
for two reasons.

515
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,200
The first is that the Bank President
has done me a big favor.

516
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,279
After I graduated from university,

517
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,599
I wanted to study abroad.

518
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,400
But only those who have published
papers in core journals

519
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,519
could apply for a
government-funded scholarship.

520
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:24,400
After my paper was published at that time,

521
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,279
without my knowledge,

522
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,640
my identity as the first author
was taken by the associate professor.

523
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,240
The president took the risk of offending others

524
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,200
and fought for my cause.

525
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,000
He also personally wrote to the journal

526
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,519
to help me get back the authorship

527
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,720
and helped me to apply for the scholarship.

528
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,839
So, you are doing this to repay the favor.

529
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:51,039
And what's the second reason?

530
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,032
The second reason

531
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,936
is my mother's illness.

532
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,920
I need money.

533
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,960
What happened to your mom?

534
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:11,519
My mom has developed metastases
in two additional sites.

535
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,200
The previous medication was used for too long

536
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,279
and resistance has developed.

537
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,240
Now we can only use the latest foreign drugs.

538
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,440
And those targeted medications
are completely out-of-pocket.

539
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,880
The expenses will be substantial over a year.

540
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,079
Therefore, for me, Division One

541
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,000
is a place of high risk

542
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,119
and high returns.

543
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,880
I want to go for it.

544
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,720
These two reasons

545
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,799
