[Episode 27]

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,760
There's something I haven't told you.

33
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,832
I'm pregnant.

34
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:48,680
I tested with a pregnancy test stick,

35
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,480
and I went to the hospital for a blood test.

36
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,159
The reason I didn't tell you

37
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,040
is because I thought if we have this child,

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,760
our relationship will inevitably move forward.

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,879
But deep down, I don't want to use this child

40
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,000
to tie down our feelings.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,799
And I don't want to use the child
to tie you down either.

42
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,888
You know?

43
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,280
I didn't know how to tell you,

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,360
but what you did today made me feel

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,120
especially secure, so…

46
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,639
I think you would be
a partner worthy of my trust.

47
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,439
So if possible,

48
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,919
shall we take a step forward and try?

49
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,120
These are all my bank cards.

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,400
There are some funds in current deposit.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,919
Take them out and keep them.

52
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,680
The large-denomination deposits and financial
management receipts are all at my home.

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,919
I'll change them all into your name later.

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,719
And that apartment of mine…

55
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,319
Next week, take a leave of absence,

56
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,520
and let's go through the procedure
to add your name.

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,080
We'll notarize it and divide
the property rights equally.

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,639
If, I mean if,

59
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,159
someday I did anything to let you down,

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,576
the property rights will be all yours,
and I'll leave with nothing.

64
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,520
These sound like all your possessions.

65
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,719
You've given them to me. Are you sure?

66
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,864
No regrets?

67
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:09,039
I am, and no regrets.

I definitely

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,600
will work hard to be a good father.

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,439
And I will try even harder
to be a good husband.

76
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,759
I love you not because of the child,

77
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,896
but because of you.

78
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,680

You can't do anything to betray me.

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,560
If you do betray me,

86
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,759
all your possessions will be mine.

87
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,184
Can't sleep, huh?

88
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:04,759
I'm thinking, since Jing
and Zhao are public now,

89
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,600
will the two of them…

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,240
Zhao Fanggang has already decided to resign.

91
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,879
There's been a rumor
going around the office recently

92
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,040
that both Mr. Xing and Yao Jia
are going to be punished.

93
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,680
If our relationship is discovered,

94
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,120
will we both be punished as well?

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,399
Actually, whenever it comes to punishment,

96
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,040
it's certainly due to serious
violations of the rules.

97
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,360
Issues of conduct are actually just the fuse.

98
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:40,199
Over the years, the two of them have been
colluding internally and externally,

99
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,319
offering low interest rates and reaching out
to customers for bribery.

100
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,040
Such behavior is intolerable in the company.

101
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,240
But our situation is completely
different in nature from theirs.

102
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,199
That's true, I've been scared silly.

103
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,120
Now the relationship between Zhao
and Jing has been exposed,

104
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,144
as a leader, you can't escape blame either.

105
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:10,279
If our relationship is discovered at this time,

106
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,800
they will think there is a problem
with the conduct of Division One,

107
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,839
ignoring the company's rules and regulations.

108
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,879
It will lead to a lot of rumors

109
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,800
and unfavorable public opinion,

110
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,519
which will affect your promotion.

111
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,519
Even keeping your current position
will be difficult, right?

112
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:33,199
So, hiding and covering up
these problems is futile.

113
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,920
We have to solve them fundamentally.

114
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,519
Tomorrow, I will go see the Bank President

115
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,639
to follow up on the progress of my promotion.

116
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,800
If I manage to get transferred,

117
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,360
not only for us,

118
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,720
it might also help Rao Jing and Zhao Fanggang.

119
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,680
Indeed, if you are going to work in new fields,

120
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,800
you're going to need some help.

121
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,319
Between the two of them,

122
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
one coming over would be beneficial to you.

123
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,079
But, no matter what,

124
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,399
let's hope everything goes as we wish

125
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,800
and we can also help Jing and Zhao.

126
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Yes. Let's not think too much about it for now.

127
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Hello, your takeaway is here.

128
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,399

You're welcome.

Why hasn't the takeaway arrived yet?

131
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,439
Have you heard? Zhao Fanggang
from Division One is also resigning.

132
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,480
One pair after another
of these lovebirds is being exposed.

133
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,240
The company will reiterate its policy on family
members avoiding conflicts of interest.

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,960
That's right.

135
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,080
The takeaway is here, let's go.

136
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,320
How are you doing?

137
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,240
I'm doing alright.

138
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,600
Just feeling a bit anxious now.

139
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,080
I've been working for Dairui for four years.

140
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,000
If the two of us were actually discovered

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,840
and one of us must leave,

142
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,960
no matter who goes,

143
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,879
I would find it hard to part.

144
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,320
I also know that we'll never find

145
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
a job more suitable

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,120
than our current one.

147
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,679
It's just a bit worrisome

148
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,000
I used to always console you.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Now even I, a mere receptionist,

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,200
can feel the cold atmosphere of this building.

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,879
I can only pass all my good luck to you,

152
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,464
praying that you won't be discovered.

153
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:31,519
What's for lunch?

154
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,519
Shall we make do with something?

155
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,799
I have to take a rain check.

156
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,840
I have a lunch date with my dad
at the restaurant nearby.

157
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,679
Go ahead.

158
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,240
I'll treat you to something tasty another day.

Alright, alright, don't be anxious.

165

Let's meet in the afternoon and talk, alright?

166
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,879
Dad, is there anything else you want to eat?

167
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,279
Order whatever you'd like to eat.

168
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll just have a little bite.

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,819

and the region's only pure slab building.

174
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,679
These points must be emphatically highlighted.

Send me the project proposal
once it's been polished.

176

180
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,679
I never realized how hard you work before.

181
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,960
I've saved up some money recently.

182
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,840
How about I treat you to this meal?

183
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,320
You can enjoy the feeling

184
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,840
of being treated to a meal
with your daughter's wages.

185
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,759
That's so thoughtful.

186
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,279
Alright, past fifty and I finally get to eat
a meal my daughter treats me to.

187
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,840
But let's agree in advance.

188
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,399
This meal shouldn't exceed 300 yuan.

189
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,159
Otherwise, my salary won't be
enough for my expenses.

190
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,000
You called me here today,
and I wanted to ask you

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,448
why have you stopped using
the supplementary card I gave you lately.

192
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:29,679
Is something wrong?

193
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,000
No, it's just that recently,

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,799
I've been trying to support
myself with my own salary.

195
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:41,120
How did you come up with this sudden idea?

196
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Dad, it's not like you don't know.

197
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,039
Before, I would just buy whatever I wanted.

198
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,200
I didn't look at the price
and bought things as I wished.

199
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,440
But recently, I've realized from Qi Yu

200
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,279
that making money seems quite difficult.

201
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,679
Isn't that also true for you?

202
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,559
I used to think you made money very easily.

203
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,519
But I've just realized

204
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,120
that it seems like you also don't get
to sleep at night because of work.

205

You don't even have time
to take a sip of water during a call.

Recently, by using my own salary.

207
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,000
I've started to slowly
grasp the concept of money.

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,360
I know how much money
a certain amount of labor can make,

209
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,519
and how much money can be spent

210
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,519
within a certain amount of salary.

211
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,879
Let me tell you, I insisted that you work

212
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,720
so that you would understand
what money is all about.

213
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,519
You need to have a concept of it.

214
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,600
After all, in your generation,

215
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,720
it's harder to preserve
wealth than to create it.

216
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,159
Alright, Dad has seen your efforts.

217
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,600

of money is enough.

00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,359
It's chilly today.

351
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,960
Have a cup of hot tea to ward off the chill.

352
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,000
I've decided that tomorrow,
I will apply for a job transfer.

353
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,359
If no other branch will take me in,

354
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,448
I'll just resign.

355
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:21,839
Actually, there's no need.
If someone has to go, it should be me.

356
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,880
We both signed a bet agreement.

357
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,960
As long as you sign the contract with Weiji,

358
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,680
the goal of doubling the performance
of Division One will be achieved.

359
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,680
As for me, I haven't managed
to save 50 million yet.

360
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm willing to accept the bet
and concede defeat. I should leave.

361
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,759
I am aware of your work ability.

362
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,519
But given the current situation,

363
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,599
let's analyze it objectively.

364
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,920
If you are the one who leaves Division One

365
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,200
and Dairui,

366
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,559
it will be difficult to find a job
that you are particularly satisfied with.

367
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,839
Besides, this job is what you love the most.

368
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,559
So you can't give up.

369
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,200
The one who should leave is still me.

370
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,759
I understand what you're saying.

371
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,599
Jing has also told me these things.

372
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,279
But an agreement is an agreement.

373
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,799
You can't be the one leaving

374
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,839
just because I can't find

375
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,920
a better job if I leave.

376
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,079
Moreover, let's analyze it objectively.

377
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,960
In our family, you earn
several times more than I do.

378
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,519
It doesn't make sense to let

379
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,200
the one who earns more leave.

380
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,759
I'm a pragmatist.
Who would have a problem with money?

381
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,880
So, my leaving is the best choice

382
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,680
for me, for you,

383
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
and for our family.

384
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,200
There's still no final decision
on this matter now.

385
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,240
Let me handle it, okay?

386
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,359
Is there still room for discussion
regarding this agreement?

387
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:05,812
Time flies, and eight months
have passed so quickly.

There's nothing to hide.

422
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,680
I used to always feel

that our relationship was special,

424
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,400
and I felt bittersweet and a bit guilty.

425
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,759
I thought that one day,

426
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:51,079
when we could share it openly,

427
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,240
this kind of guilt would be gone,

428
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,200

449
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,559
yet he openly backed you up. That's so rare.

He posted it last night.

462
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,200
It explains that the two of you were together
before he came to Division One.

463
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,799
Besides, he came to Division One

464
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,039
in a time of crisis,
upon the request of the Bank President.

465

And this shows that those rumors

about you seducing him for a promotion

467
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,759
or being unscrupulous just to get
a permanent position, are all groundless talks.

accept my resignation letter.

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,400
I've reported my handover to the back.

491
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,759
Tomorrow I will officially leave Division One.

492
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,559
I'm clearly the one who should be leaving.

493
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,359
Why did you take it upon yourself?

494
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,599
Or did you never take

495
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,079
our agreement seriously?

496
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,759
Have you been playing me from the start?

497
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,880
Don't get angry yet.

498
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,240
Actually, it was because I needed
to compete with Division Two

499
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,640
that our relationship was exposed.

500
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,519
Also, it's because I came to Division One

501
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,216
that you've been on tenterhooks every day,

502
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:11,720
worried that our relationship will be exposed.

503
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,559
The whole thing started because of me.

504
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,079
So of course, I'll take responsibility.

505
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:18,160
So, you had planned it all from the beginning.

506
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,200
You only signed the bet agreement

507
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,279
so I wouldn't overthink it.

508
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,519
There's another reason.

509
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,640
I wanted you to be able
to showcase your talents.

510
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,319
I don't have any talents.

511
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:34,160
I am just a minor business manager.

512
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,680
But you're different.
You were sent by the Bank President.

513
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,319
If you leave, he will surely be angry.

514
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:43,008
You know

515
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:46,759
the financial family recusal policy, right?

516
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:50,519
The purpose is to prevent
the abuse of power for personal gain.

517
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:53,200
You and Tu aren't married.

518
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,160
So strictly speaking, it isn't a violation.

519
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,960
But when you mix personal feelings with work,

520
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,920
even if not against the rules,
it's still not clear-cut.

521
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,720
Tu has advanced so quickly,

522
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,200
and it coincided
with the incident in Division Two.

523
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,240
There are rumors saying you've used

524
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
your authority to favor Tu.

525
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,519
You said it yourself, they're just rumors.

526
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,599
I, Ji Yuheng, have never

527
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,200
abused my authority even once.

528
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,519
Besides the per capita allocation
of government deposits,

529
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,799
Tu Xiaoning has never

530
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:26,599
received any special treatment from me.

531
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:31,519
Her promotions and clients
were all on her own merit.

532
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,279
I understand what you've said.

533
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,119
But Tu, she really must go.

534
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,680
No, Tu Xiaoning cannot leave.

535
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,799
This is not merely a workplace.

536
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,920
For her, it's a career
she's fully committed to.

537
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,319
I'm the one who should leave.

538
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,680
Sir, I will send you
the transfer application later.

539
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,839
Thank you for your trust
and care for me all along.

540
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,319
I said to my teacher

541
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,720
that you were very capable.

542
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,759
If you did leave,

543
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,839
it is certainly a loss to Division One.

544
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,759
So my teacher thought about it

545
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,359
and felt that what I said made sense.

546
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:20,400
So he approved my transfer
application last night.

547
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,720
The Bank President isn't so easily deceived.

548
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,152
Did he really approve it?

549
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,519
Where are you going?

550
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:34,039
I haven't heard about any openings in our city.

551
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,720
Could it be a demotion?

552
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,880
It's the branch in Nan'an County.
I will continue as manager.

553
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,400
Nan'an County, it's more than a two-hour drive.

554
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,559
Yes.

555
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,640
That's far.

556
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,440
Is this a punishment?

557
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,839
Of course not.

558
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,559
Mainly it's because the Nan'an County branch

559
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,720
has accumulated quite
a lot of non-performing loans,

560
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,839
which have been weighing down
the branch's performance for years.

561
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,440
Last year, they were
at the bottom of the whole province.

562
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,960
Additionally, the account managers
can't get performance commissions

563
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,519
so they lack the motivation to work.

564
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,320
This has become a vicious cycle.

565
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,960
So the leaders probably want me to go there

566
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,400
and deal with this issue.

567
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,440
Moreover, it's a critical moment now.

568
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,760
Moving me a bit farther away

569
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,880
is also a form of protection for me.

570
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,760
For me, it's an opportunity to gain
experience at the grassroots level.

571
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,039
It's a good thing for me.

572
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,199
What, do you not want me to go?

573
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:41,599
Yes, going to the grassroots can indeed
accumulate some experience.

574
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,119
Staying away a bit at this time

575
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:46,360
can also help avoid the limelight.

576
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,239
The Bank President was kind enough to do this.

577
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,039
But if it weren't for these issues,

578
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:59,599
you could have gone to a better place.

579
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,000
I will certainly work hard there.

580
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,719
This is just a transition.

581
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,760
I will strive to be transferred
back as soon as possible.

582
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,800
It's so far.

583
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,776
Don't overthink it.

584
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,144
[Manager Ji Yuheng]

585
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,840
You've worked hard.

586
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,039
I guess you will soon welcome a better partner.

587
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,176
I'm leaving first.

588
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,159
I heard you went to HR this afternoon
to hand in your resignation.

589
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,320
There's a new guy in HR.

590
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,719
He doesn't know the situation.

591
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,239
He asked me if you were the only person I
believed in within the Development Department.

592
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:48,199
He asked me if you left,

593
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,599
would I also quit.

594
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,360
You definitely wouldn't tell him that.

595
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,880
You understand me the best.

596
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,960
How can I show my loyalty
to you at such a time?

597
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,639
I want everyone to know

598
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:01,519
that my leaving is because of Ms. Rao.

599
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,592
Well done.

600
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,440
You must be quite reluctant, right?

601
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,119
What do you think, will we come back?

602
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,519
Your wife is here.

603
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,239
My fiancée is also here.

604
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:52,456
We will come.

605
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,320
We're brothers in adversity.

606
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,519
By the way, Zhao, you resigned
without a new job lined up.

607
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:06,920
Any prospects for a new job?

608
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,400
No.

609
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,440
A friend of mine has a financial company.

610
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,760
They're looking to hire
a short-term client manager.

611
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,519
They require over five years
of work experience.

612
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,960
The salary is also quite good.

613
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,719
I will send you his business card in a while.

614
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:22,760
If needed, you could use it as a transition.

615
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,199
Okay, thank you.

616
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm leaving now.

617
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,184
Don't miss me too much.

618
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,159
Boss, if there's a chance in the future,

619
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,079
call me anytime.
I'm still willing to work with you.

620
00:39:03,872 --> 00:39:07,519
Anyway, the issue with Xiaoning
has finally come to an end.

621
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,519
She no longer has to live in fear.

622
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,840
She can now date openly and legitimately.

623
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,239
Ji is indeed reliable.

624
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,199
But I don't know what this Ji Yuheng

625
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,840
is still dragging his feet about.

626
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,960
If it were me, I would immediately take
Xiaoning to get the marriage certificate.

627
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,159
Stepping firmly into the hall
of marriage amidst such storms,

628
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,336
how meaningful would that be?

629
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,360
Weiyi, didn't you say we should
find time to watch the sunrise together?

630
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,519
I've checked, Nanshan is the best place
to watch the sunrise.

631
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,584
What do you think?

632
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,000
I think Nanshan gets quite crowded.

633
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,199
I want to go to Baisha Beach.

634
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,119
Why get up so early?

635
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,559
Isn't it just 5:30?

636
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:06,440
Don't you have to leave at six?

637
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,280
I'd like to pack some things
for you to take with you.

638
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,960
This is it.

639
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,119
You've brought everything,
even a water cup and wet wipes.

640
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,504
Why are there socks as well?

641
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,960
I figured the round trip
to your place would take four hours.

642
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,920
If you have to entertain clients at night,

643
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,519
and you might drink some alcohol
and won't be able to rush back.

644
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,519
I've brought you shirts and socks

645
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,559
just in case of emergency.

646
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,519
I also put a little blanket in the car for you.

647
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:37,679
If you're tired, you can
take a short nap in the car.

648
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:41,719
Miss Tu is so considerate, thank you.

649
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,039
However, you can rest assured.

650
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,519
I wouldn't stay out all night
unless it's absolutely necessary.

651
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,239
Impressive, you've passed the assessment.

652
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,679
How long do you have to stay there?

653
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:57,079
When your leaders talked to you,

654
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,719
did they say anything or reveal anything?

655
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,039
It's really hard to say.

656
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:03,320
After dealing with all the issues there,

657
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,440
I'll have to wait for a position
in the city before I can come over.

658
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,960
It's all hard to say

659
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,920
Take it slow, no rush.

660
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,400
I forgot to tell you yesterday

661
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,639
that two new people are joining our department.

662
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:20,559
You and Zhao have left, right?

663
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:23,000
Today two people are coming to report for duty.

664
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,639
The storm hasn't passed yet.

665
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:31,960
To put it bluntly, by going there,
I can still find some peace.

666
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,320
There could be rumors and gossip
about you here at any time,

667
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,079
some idle talk and such.

668
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,840
If you do hear them, don't take them to heart.

669
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,639
At most, it's just some idle chatter over here.

670
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,119
Compared to those bad debts
you have in Nan'an County,

671
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:47,880
it's nothing.

672
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,320
No hurry, deal with it slowly.

673
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,400
This is how life is. You can't
always be on the high ground.

674
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,679
It's all ups and downs.

675
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,880
Although we have difficulties now,

676
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,960
take it slow, and things will surely
get better and better later on.

677
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,072
I'll remember that.

678
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,719
Where is yours?

679
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:10,360
It should be by the head of the bed.

680
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:15,624
I'll put it on for you.

681
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,199
Xiaoning, once this period is over,

682
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,519
let's go on a vacation together.

683
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,880
What? Do you want to take
annual leave just after starting work?

684
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,144
You just started at the new branch.

685
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:34,960
Alright, then wait
until after this busy period,

686
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,039
I'll talk to Jing about it.

687
00:42:56,372 --> 00:43:01,160
[Early Morning The Scent of Coffee and You]

688
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,559
Come, the coffee is ready.

689
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,280
I added a sugar cube, give it a try.

690
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,240

00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:35,428
♫ To you and no one else ♫

702
00:44:35,428 --> 00:44:40,260
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

703
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,436
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

704
00:44:42,436 --> 00:44:45,612
♫ No one knows ♫

705
00:44:46,504 --> 00:44:48,772
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

706
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:52,140
♫ I hope you know ♫

707
00:44:53,604 --> 00:45:00,196
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

708
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:05,636
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

709
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:12,388
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

710
00:45:12,388 --> 00:45:16,644
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

711
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:21,796
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

712
00:45:21,796 --> 00:45:24,740
♫ To you and no one else ♫

713
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:29,412
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

714
00:45:29,412 --> 00:45:31,844
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

715
00:45:31,844 --> 00:45:35,052
♫ No one knows ♫

716
00:45:35,624 --> 00:45:37,828
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

717
00:45:37,828 --> 00:45:41,996
♫ I hope you know ♫
