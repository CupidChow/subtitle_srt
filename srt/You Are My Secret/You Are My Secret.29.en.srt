00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,120
I can consult him about a house loan.

179
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,519
Okay, that area
is under his jurisdiction anyway.

180
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,960
He can certainly tell you
how to get the best deal.

181

my favorite milk tea near your office.

By the way, your dad has retired.

about renting a place nearby

I'm sorry, uncle.

My dad has a very busy schedule,
and he's in a meeting right now.

201

I'm afraid he couldn't make it today.

He's got you a family suite
at one of his hotels.

You can stay there

It's convenient.

No need, we've already booked a place.

You must be hungry from the trip.

Shall we have something to eat first?

Waiter, please serve the dishes.

We're ordinary.

It's rare that you and uncle come here.

Of course you should have some delicious food.

Uncle, I heard from Qi Yu
that you love seafood.

228

It seems to be real estate and investment.
What's the matter, dad?

the building where she worked.

for Weiyi's family? Huh?

Do you know what you are doing?
Are you going to be matrilocal?

What? What if your son really marries her,

247
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,960
he'd move his luggage over
and live at her place.

248

Yet her dad doesn't show up for meals.

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,039
The fragrance of the flower
and the aftertaste are quite good.

357
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,599
Honey-scented lily of the valley.
No wonder it sells so well.

358
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,359
What's wrong? What are you hiding?

359
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,920
The love letter you wrote to another girl.

360
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,039
Of course not.

361
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,559
I won't take anyone's love letters but yours.

362
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,079
Mr. Ji, we aren't in the same department,

363
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,720
and you are so wary of me now.

364
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,400
You weren't like this before.

365
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,720
You are breaking my heart.

366
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,400
Tell me, how much more
do you need for meeting your KPI?

367
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,720
I've got plenty of clients for you
if you need them.

368
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,519
Then I want the biggest one.

369
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,759
You and Rao Jing are aiming high now.

370
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,880
Then why not take the biggest one?

371
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,968
What are you drinking?

372
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,359
It's for my beauty. Men should
stay out of women's matters.

373
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,000
Accountant Zhou, this is Vice President Chen,

374
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,568
he's specifically in charge
at our provincial bank

375
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:24,279
for the approval
of large and medium-sized company loan.

376
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,559
I heard yesterday
that Youpin is about to apply for a loan.

377
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,920
Today, he's put aside many important clients

378
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,640
and said to visit Youpin today.

379
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,359
Thank you, thank you.

380
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,920
And thank you, Ms. Rao.

381
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,960
I knew that the headquarters of Youpin
have settled in Ji'an.

382
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,519
This is my first visit here.

383
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,200
To a company with quality and strength,

384
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,559
the district government will definitely
do everything possible to support it.

385
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,440
Then thank you very much.

386
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,960
Mr. Fu Junior wants to do business innovation.

387
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,440
Your strong support is essential for this.

388
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,279
Alright, then I'll head over there.

389
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,359
Well then, Accountant Zhou.

390
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:03,160
Before we came,
we contacted the finance department.

391
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,640
Tu and I would like to go
and check out the financial statement.

392
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,200
So, please take Vice President Chen there.

393
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,359
- Okay.
- Alright.

394
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,559
- Then, Vice President Chen, you go up first.
- Okay.

395
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,400
- Alright, please
- See you later.

396
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,759
Dairui has always adhered to

397
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,960
the principle of growing
and progressing together with companies.

398
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,559
The cooperation with Youpin will be the best.

399
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,720
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

400
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Then, I will take you over there for a tour.

401
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,240
Okay.

402
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,799
Jing, let me tell you.

403
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,000
Ever since Ji stopped working alongside me,

404
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,488
he has been trying different tactics
to gather information from me every day.

405
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,599
Really?

406
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:39,599
I should have chosen a husband
with a different job.

407
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,160
Let me tell you.
It's too late to change a job now.

408
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,079
But I think there's still time
to change your husband.

409
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,400
I don't want to.

410
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,119
Let me tell you, my husband is different now.

411
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,960
He just can't keep his mouth shut.

412
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,039
Do you know what he talked to me about
in his dream last night?

413
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,960
He talked to me about pig feed in his dream.

414
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,920
I asked him, "What's this pig feed about?"

415
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,160
He talked to me and said,

416
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,119
"I just recently serviced a client
dealing with pig feed."

417
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,359
And then he told me everything

418
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,759
about what their bank is currently offering,

419
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,519
including discounting, factoring,

420
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,519
and personal business loans.

421
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,279
He even wanted
to partner up with me in his dream.

422
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,359
Zhao is better. Mr. Ji won't do so.

423
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,680
What's good about that? He's utterly guileless.

424
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,440
Jing, I forgot to tell you.

425
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,720
I just found out

426
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,200
that they deal with tea here,

427
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,400
but there are a lot of coffee cups and beans

428
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,039
that seem to have been bought from abroad.

429
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,799
I wonder, maybe they want
to get into coffee drinks in the future.

430
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,680
Actually, I just asked
Accountant Zhou the same question.

431
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,920
He told me it was simply because

432
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,680
his boss liked coffee.

433
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,400
So he got a lot of coffee equipment

434
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,519
from all over the world.

435
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,359
I thought he's going into the coffee business

436
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,559
and wondered if he needs another loan.

437
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,000
Looking at the new equipment just now,

438
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,880
I guess there's a new product coming out.

439
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,160
Impressive. The information we gathered before

440
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,160
is almost identical to what you found out.

441
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,680
What? Don't you call me Mr. Ji now?

442
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,872
Mr. Ji.

443
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,519
Mr. Fu Junior is really capable indeed.

444
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,880
He has increased the production line
to expand the operation.

445
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,759
I think, in the future,

446
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,559
the demand and volume of loans
should not be small.

447
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,359
This is not like your pig feed.

448
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,640
Don't talk in your sleep when you dream.

449
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,160
You don't know.
I was just creating a diversion,

450
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,640
and selling the dummy.

451
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,240
I wonder if all of you returnees are deviant,

452
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,039
refusing to do what your family does.

453
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,720
Sounds like the client you met today
was a returnee too.

454
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,920
I'm talking about life
and you're discussing clients.

455
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,359
What do you mean?

456
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,759
Your client today is a returnee too?

457
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,759
He's young, enterprising,

458
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,519
and having his own ideas

459
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,079
on business management and development.

460
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,720
Looks like he took over the family business.
How big is it?

461
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,519
That big? You don't want to say a word to me?

462
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:39,000
One deal covers a year?

463
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,168
It's a secret.

464
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,104
Stingy.

465
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,839
Mr. Fu Junior has quite
a wide range of hobbies.

466
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,839
He surprisingly enjoys coffee so much.

467
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,519
Jing, did you notice

468
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,119
there are many introductions
to various brands of fast-moving consumer goods

469
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:09,960
on that shelf in his office?

470
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,200
I've noticed it.

471
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,839
I saw two biographies of the fortunes

472
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,424
of fast-moving coffee on the table.

473
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,440
Well, maybe Mr. Fu Junior

474
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,599
is trying to move in the direction

475
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,119
of fast moving consumer tea like coffee.

476
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,440
If their company is going
to develop in this direction.

477
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,200
They should have been more explicit

478
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,720
in the loan proposal they sent to our bank.

479
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,119
But they didn't.

480
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:36,559
And Accountant Zhou didn't mention it

481
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,440
when we were there yesterday.

482
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,839
There seems to be some internal conflicts.

483
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:44,200
Maybe it's because of these internal conflicts.

484
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,920
If we were right,

485
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,279
they're probably lending
much more than this amount.

486
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,039
[Product technical specifications]
Come on, take a look.

487
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,599
I asked Zhou to do some research.

488
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,720
Their latest production line machine

489
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,799
is for fast moving consumer beverages.

490
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,359
So they are going to do
the fast moving consumer beverages.

491
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,279
That's right.

492
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,599
I called their vice president yesterday.

493
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,920
They plan to set up some stores.

494
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,359
I guess they want to set up
some stores like milk tea stores,

495
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,440
which targets young people.

496
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,319
Some chain brand
of fast moving consumer beverages.

497
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:21,216
Then you can estimate

498
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,240
the amount of their loan.

499
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,000
50 million?

500
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,440
Considering their investment proposal
and the assessment report,

501
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,536
around 100 million.

502
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,504
Tired, right?

503
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:55,160
What are you doing here?

504
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Waiting for you. Let's take a walk.

505
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,720
How is it? Tired?

506
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,279
I'm fine. But you look a bit tired.

507
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:20,480
What's wrong? Not having
a smooth talk with the client?

508
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,039
According to the financing costs
expected by the client,

509
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,359
we have come up with many proposals,

510
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,720
but the interest rate just won't go down.

511
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,200
What's the lowest interest rate
your branch can offer now?

512
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,319
Us? Well…

513
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,400
Bank President Ji, you are getting
more and more out of line now.

514
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,680
Waiting under the street light,
sighing and acting miserable,

515
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,680
and here you are playing the tricks with me.

516
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,240
You're cheating now.

517
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,039
So tell me, are you falling for it?

518
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,880
Anyway, we're almost done with this client.

519
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,680
It doesn't matter if I tell you.

520
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,279
Five-year interest rate at 4.8%.

521
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,680
Five-year interest rate at 4.8%?

522
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,279
The collateral is the workshop?

523
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,359
And a real estate owned by the legal person.

524
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,599
What's the final loan?

525
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,319
100 million.

526
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:20,279
No, about 80 million.

527
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,336
About 80 million?

528
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:24,640
About 80 million?

529
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,799
Why does it sound like

530
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,039
a client worth 100 million?

Does client accept that?

534
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,880
With such a low interest rate,
can you accept it?

Have you figured out anything?

What do you mean? What have I figured out?

549
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,359
I didn't see anything.

550
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,480
What can I see
when you're covering it up tightly?

After my brother-in-law
left the management team,

554
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,759
how many in the finance department left?

555
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,279
Not a single old employee was left.

556
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,519
Mr. Fu, about your idea of entering
the fast moving consumer goods sector,

557
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,960
it's indeed nice.

558
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,759
But it needs ample financial support.

The finance team leaving at this point

560
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,759
is clearly wanting to give you a hard time.

How's the loan deal going?

562
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,279
We've been getting a lot of proposals

Accountant Zhou and I think
there are two banks that are quite good.

566
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:04,920
Yes. This one has proposed
the idea of using the letter of credit,

567
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,279
with a better cost-performance ratio.

568
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:09,359
The other one has offered a longer loan period,

569
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,312

that our relationship
has become increasingly burdensome?

Because that's not my house,

We had an expensive meal,

611
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:32,800
and my parents said
our expenditure level is high.

612
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,920
I can just bear with it.

613

What did your parents say?

617
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,440
Said something about me?

618
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,920
- They said I spend money recklessly, right?
- No.

619
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,639
They said we're not on the same level, okay?

620
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,519
So they're still not happy with me.

621

I sincerely invited them for a meal,

622
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,280
and even used my credit card.

You keep saying it's for me,

00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,840
If I want a future with you,

and I can't spend any money.

637
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,760
Or it'll make you think you despise yourself?

638
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:37,056
To put it simply, you just want me
to live by your standards, right?

639
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:38,079
That's not what I mean.

640
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,519
Then what do you mean?

641
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,360
Qi Yu, don't you think you're being selfish?

642
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,639
We used to have fun.

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,039

he took me to watch fish,

and we've seen
the most romantic things in the world.

646
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,119
Why do we have to be worried

647
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,960
about money, house

648
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,239
and stuff like that?

649
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,679
Why?

650
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,519
Okay, calm down.

651
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:35,440
Aren't you ashamed?

652
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,440
Do you know how long it's been
since I've had one of these?

653
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,559
I think about saving money every day

654
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:43,679
and how to make a good life.

655
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,199
But in the end,

656
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,519
my dad doesn't approve of us
and his parents are against us too.

657
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:51,440
Then why are we still trying to make it work?

658
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:55,519
If you're upset, it's okay to cry.

659
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,760
Will you feel better after crying?

660
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,400
Shall I give Qi Yu a call?

661
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,360
No. I don't want to see him right now.

662
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,079
He would bring those things up again
when we meet. It annoys me.

663

Do you know what he told me today?

664
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:16,400
He said if he lived in my house,

665
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,159
he would feel uncomfortable
and despise himself.

666
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,519
But what about me?

667
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,039
Do I have to compromise my living standards

668
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,719
for his pride?

669
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,440
He didn't even think about me.

670
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,559
Right?

671
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,960
To be honest,

672
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,199
he wouldn't have come back
if he hadn't really thought about you.

673
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,559
He wanted to buy the house
because he wanted to marry you.

674
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,280
Actually, I don't think
he's doing it wrong, but…

675
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,800
A-Am I wrong then?

676
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,800
You're not wrong.

677
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,800
I don't think this is the life I want at all.

678
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,559
Think about it, I don't lack anything.

I have a big house to live in
and money to spend.

and toil away saving money

Now I feel like

I've been an idiot

689
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,800
for being so hard on myself for him.

690

From now on, I have to be who I really am.

As long as you're happy.

692
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:54,760
Last time we broke up, I thought
our problem was the long distance.

693
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,639
I thought the problem would be solved
when I came back.

694
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,000
But this time, I've realized

695
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,239
maintaining a long-term relationship
can't just rely on romance.

696
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,679
We have to consider the reality, right?

697
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,239
I need to have a stable and decent job.

698
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:15,159
I need to have a house, a car,
and a stable income.

699
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,000
Especially when it comes to getting married.

700
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,400
I was quite happy.

701
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,239
I don't know why I'm so anxious now.

702
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,039
Being so anxious, you know?

703
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:32,400
I just want to get these conditions
settled down sooner,

704
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,679
so we can live a stable life in the future.

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,320
But Weiyi doesn't need it.

706
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,239
She's well-qualified
and comes from a wealth family.

707
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:46,880
She doesn't have to think about the reality.

708
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,960
She saves money

709
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,360
just for me.

710
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:04,200
But why would she sacrifice herself for me?

711
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,280
Everyone ends up upset.

712
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,039
Weiyi is upset, my parents are upset,

713
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:15,800
and Weiyi's dad is not satisfied with me.

714
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,760
I work hard every day.

715
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,000
I work so hard every day. What do I want?

716
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,039
Do you think I am wrong?

717
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,679
Have you discussed these things
you just said with Ling Weiyi?

718
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,264
Definitely not, right?

719
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,639
I think what you need is communication.

720
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:44,199
You can never find a solution
without discussing this kind of thing.

721
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:48,639
Solution? You tell me.

722
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,800
There's no solution.

723
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,159
I can't be wealthy overnight,

724
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,360
nor can I ask her to compromise.

725
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,639
What's that term again?

726
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,488
Downward compatibility, right?

727
00:40:59,488 --> 00:41:01,199
Actually, I think

728
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,400
sometimes parents' worries make sense.

729
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,719
They really make sense. Neither of us is wrong.

730
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,944
We…

731
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,480
Come on.

732
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:10,440
[Hints About Proposal]

733
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,559
It happened a long time ago.

734
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:30,119
Why isn't he making any action at all?

735
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,440
Does he think since we're living together,

736
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,800
then he can skip the proposal?

737
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,968
Dinner is ready.

738
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:45,160
What are you looking for?

739
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,760
Notebook. It's often helpful
to flip through it.

740
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,199
Tu, you are diligent.

741
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:58,880
Over time, we've become experienced.

742
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,360
So we can bluff our way through
with some clever tricks.

743
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:06,519
But the necessary procedures and milestones

744
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,920
cannot be missed.

745
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:12,800
Do you agree, Bank President Ji?

746
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,039
Of course.

747
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,239
Why suddenly talk about this? Let's eat.

748
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,440
Let's eat.

749
00:43:40,804 --> 00:43:43,752
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

750
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:46,852
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

751
00:43:46,852 --> 00:43:52,012
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

752
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:56,196
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

753
00:43:56,196 --> 00:43:59,684
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

754
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:03,596
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

755
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,908
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

756
00:44:07,908 --> 00:44:14,788
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

757
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:19,012
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

758
00:44:19,012 --> 00:44:23,748
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

759
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:26,884
♫ To you and no one else ♫

760
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:31,716
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

761
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:33,892
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

762
00:44:33,892 --> 00:44:37,068
♫ No one knows ♫

763
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,228
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

764
00:44:40,228 --> 00:44:43,596
♫ I hope you know ♫

765
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:51,652
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

766
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:57,092
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

767
00:44:57,092 --> 00:45:03,844
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

768
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:08,100
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

769
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:13,252
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

770
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,196
♫ To you and no one else ♫

771
00:45:16,196 --> 00:45:20,868
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

772
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:23,300
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

773
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,508
♫ No one knows ♫

774
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,284
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

775
00:45:29,284 --> 00:45:33,452
♫ I hope you know ♫
