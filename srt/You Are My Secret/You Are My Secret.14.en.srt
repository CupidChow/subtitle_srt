32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,680
You need to improve your performance

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,439
in the shortest possible time,

34
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,760
to prove that you deserve this position.

35
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,000
It's just about developing clients.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,359
You are right.

37
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,920
Xiaoning, you need to hurry up.

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,959
There is a way to go

39
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,680
from customer development to making loans.

40
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:56,320
Mr. Zhao.

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,359
What's wrong?

42
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,560
You could just give
a few of your clients to Tu.

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Then her performance can be improved.

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,319
Why do you get me involved?

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,120
You're her mentor,
why don't you give her some clients?

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,520
Don't you know me?

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,159
My clients are the big ones,

48
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,120
not quite suitable for Tu now.

49
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,360
Unlike you, Mr. Zhao,

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,439
your clients are not that big.

51
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,240
So just giving her some would be enough.

52
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,439
Besides, you are always being

53
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,439
chivalrous in the office,

54
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,759
always asking us to respect you.

55
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,000
Now, you are backing out,

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
retreating, and quitting?

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,439
It's not like you, Mr. Zhao.

58
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:45,824
Tu.

59
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:48,360
I have already prepared it for you.

60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,280
See, I told you.

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,520
These are the information

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,400
I've checked before.

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,800
The financing proposals
are around five million. Give it a try.

64
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,840
I don't think it's appropriate.

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,599
What's wrong with that?

66
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,719
Hurry up and thank Zhao.

67
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,759
Thanks, Zhao.

68
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,840
I actually contacted a company recently,

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,879
it's a shipyard.

70
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,439
But I don't know much yet.

71
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,680
Listen.

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,120
As long as they have decent qualifications,

73
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,599
you can just try.

74
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,439
Right, obtaining clients
is like collecting debts.

75
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,039
You can't expect them to take the initiative.

76
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,024
We have to take the initiative ourselves.

77
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:26,048
Okay.

78
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:28,136
Please check.

79

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,240
It's still money after all.

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,936
Why are you looking at me?

83
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,180
I haven't formally congratulated you yet.

84
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,360
Congratulations on passing
the written exam, Tu.

85
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,199
Thank you.

Thank you for your encouragement.

- Okay.
- Thank you.

102
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,920
By the way, did you buy one for Mr. Ji?

103
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,680
There's still one cup of flat white left.

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,319
Okay.

105
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,439
My senior doesn't drink flat whites.

106
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,480

Give it to me, it's okay.

You're welcome.

114
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,519
Someone as capable and nice as Mr. Ji,

115
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,879
I wonder
who will be lucky enough to win his heart.

116
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,480
Being beautiful and excellent
must be just the basic requirements.

117
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,040
I am the one who is lucky enough.

118
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Do you really only like drinking Americano?

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,839
Of course.

120
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:52,120
Then why did you drink
the flat white I bought today?

121
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,120
I didn't want to waste it.

122
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,040
Really?

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,759

Are you confident?

132
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,120
Confidence isn't counted as performance.

133
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,319
I should make more calls
and pull in some clients.

134
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,720
Need my help?

135
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,560
No. Absolutely not.

We two have an agreement,

137

and we are competitors. I won't give in.

138
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,759
Don't give me any privilege either.

139
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,639
Rest assured. I will become regular
with my own capabilities.

Drink it while it's warm.

If I gave the proposal to him,

329
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,039
I think Mr. Yang would
just flip through it casually,

330

without leaving any impression.

331
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:37,519
Exactly. They've received so many proposals
but still don't make a decision.

332

What they want is
to use the battle among the banks,

333

and get the best proposal.

You bought it for me?

362
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,519
Okay, thank you, mom.

363
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,559
Try it on.

364
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,839
No, I'll try it on myself
when I get back to room later.

365
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:34,160
Put it on and let me take a look.

366
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,360
Okay.

367
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:51,839
Oh my, it's oversized.

368
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,920
It's okay.

369
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,880
In-law had reminded me it might be too big.

370
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,920
I thought…

371
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,759
I thought since you've grown
so much taller after starting college.

372
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,440
I should get you a size larger.

373
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,920
I didn't expect it to be oversized.

374
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,519
You've said

375
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,799
that you haven't bought me
clothes since high school.

376
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,359
This one is okay.

377
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,960
I'll go change it for you tomorrow.
Take it off.

378
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,599
No, no need.

379
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:30,759
Change one for you,
so you could wear it in the future.

380
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
If you go out by yourself,
I won't feel at ease.

381
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,032
Let's not change it.

382
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,400
Alright, I'll go freshen up.

383
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,984
Thank you, Mom.

Hello, Mr. Ji.

386
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,799
Why? Sounds like you're still busy with work.

387
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,400
I'm revising the loan proposal.

388
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
What about you? What are you doing?

389
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,248
I've just taken a bath.

390
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,680
Too bad I don't have the chance to see you.

391
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,119
It would be great
if you made a video call to me.

392
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:23,559
Sounds like Rao Jing isn't there.

393
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,839
She went out.

394
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,559
The night view of the Xihai is very beautiful.

395
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,680
And there are many bars too.

396
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,696
Then do you want to make a video call with me?

397
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,352
Wait.

398
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:13,716
Why are you laughing?

399
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:15,400
Why are you laughing?

400
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,279
Because you are sloppily dressed.

401
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,400
How's the work going?

402
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,359
Pretty smooth, I went
to their workshop this afternoon.

403
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,799
And the loan plan is also well-prepared.

404
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:30,400
I work hard to meet Mr. Yang soon.

405
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,279
Sounds like things are going pretty smoothly.

406
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,016
What are you doing?

408
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,960
Then go ahead and change, I won't look.

00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,040

Mr. Liu, please let me meet with Mr. Yang.

If he says no to my plan after we meet,

434
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,440
I will never bother him again.

Whether Mr. Yang wants to meet you or not,
I really have no say.

436
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,039
I am sorry.

437
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,000

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,880
That is Mr. Yang's car.

453
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,680
Mr. Yang gets off work at this time every day.

00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,872
Thank you.

00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Take it easy. Every Account Manager

456
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,039

457
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,279
Mr. Liu took pity on me

458
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,160
and told me secretly

459
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,200
that Tang Yuhui has been
in contact with Mr. Yang recently.

460
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,279
I think the contract
will be signed in a few days.

461
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:24,279
I heard that Mr. Yang's adopted son, Yang Jie,

462
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,160
who once was a friend
when Tang Yuhui studied abroad.

463
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,359
When I worked in the lobby, I knew

464
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,160
resources are more important than hard work.

465
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,160
I lost once and I didn't expect to lose again.

466
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,432
But losing to fate doesn't count as a loss.

467
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:43,559
You weren't born into a family

468
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,160
that could just casually take out

469
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,039
ten million to cover losses,

470
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,000
nor did you have the chance to study abroad

471
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,079
to meet someone's adopted son.

472
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,640
It's a random act of God,

473
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640

you'll find that we actually
have quite a lot in common.

I have the resources
and you have the experience.

As long as you are willing to take me,

509
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,559

514
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,584
I know.

515
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,240
At first, I thought you came
to the Development Department Division One

516
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,640
for Ji Yuheng.

517
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,559
But I didn't expect that I underestimated you.

518
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,839
Having ambition is not a bad thing at all.

519
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,160
But remember,

520
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,319
not everyone can be used
by you as a stepping stone.

521
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,799
And I'm buying you a drink today.

522

526

and found my first client,

527
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,799
but it turned out to be
a fruitless effort after all.

528
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,720
Just a client?

529
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,359
Well, I'll ask my dad
to lend you some tens of millions,

530
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,799
and let him rope in some of his friends too.

531
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,960
It could be over a hundred million.

532
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
Then I'll be vice bank president

533
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,519
and could be invincible in Dairui.

534
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,279
If my relationship with Ji Yuheng
gets revealed,

535
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:57,160
they would have to give us
red envelopes to celebrate.

536
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,519
Of course.

537
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:01,440
I'll call my dad as soon as I hang up.

538
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Forget it. Don't do something stupid.

539
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,119
I'm just having a little self-doubt.

540
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,440
Don't worry, it's nothing.

541
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,920
Weiyi, how about this one?

542
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,599
It looks more solemn for meeting your dad.

543
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:19,279
It's too old-fashioned.
Looks like something my uncle would wear.

544
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,599
That blue one from earlier was better.

545
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,240
Alright, you guys go ahead.

546
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,079
I'm tired. I have to go back to sleep.

547
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:27,119
Xiaoning, don't. Don't mind him.

548
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,680
We can chat. Don't mind him.

549
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,920
Let's meet after I get back.
I'm hanging up now.

550
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,519
Ji Yuheng, I miss you so much.

551
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,724
Xiaoning.

552
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:15,824
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

553
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:20,808
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

554
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:24,960
♫ My fast heartbeat ♫

555
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,840
♫ Hide in a few seconds ♫

556
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,576
Why are you here?

557
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,216
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

558
00:34:37,216 --> 00:34:40,832
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

559
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:45,128
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

560
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,760
It's okay. I'm here now.

561
00:34:55,923 --> 00:35:00,328
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

562
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,840
You must not have had food
to your liking these past few days.

563
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,239
See what I brought you.

564
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,840
Egg-yolk puffs, and lots of snacks.

565
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,960
And these. The seaweed snacks
from the shop downstairs.

566
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,119
It's all your past favorites.

567
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,320
Stop tidying up.

568
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,808
Come and sit.

569
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,800
You must be tired from coming over so late.

570
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
I'm not tired.

571
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,719
If I hadn't come,

572
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,679
I would never have known
you were crying secretly all by yourself.

573
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,880
I wasn't crying.

574
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,199
It's tears of joy upon seeing you.

575
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,880
Then let me rephrase that.

576
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,920
After we finished the video call,

577
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,800
I suddenly missed you so much
and wanted to see you soon.

578
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,280
And tomorrow is the weekend.

579
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,280
So I came right after work today.

580
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,400
But what about mom?

581
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,159
It's only been three days not going downstairs,

582
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:23,680
he's acting like it's been a long lost reunion.

583
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,704
You are getting better.

584
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,320
In-law, your community is really lively.

585
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,639
Once I get better, I'll come to have fun too.

586
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:38,719
Okay.

587
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,199
You mean the spinning top?

588
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,360
Alright, I'll get one for you online later.

589
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,719
Get one that glows in the dark.

590
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,800
Just kidding.
I don't have the energy to spin it.

591
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,719
Where's my water? Did I forget to take it?

592
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,079
Have a sip of yours.

593
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,239
In-law, I'm so grateful you welcome me here.

594
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,559
What did you say?

595
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,800
With you staying over,
Ji will have time to visit Xiaoning.

596
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,280
And we can sit here and have a chat.

597
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,039
I am so happy about it.

598
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,000
That's true.

599
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,840
From now on,

600
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,840
don't call me in-law.

601
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,199
I'm just a few years older than you.

602
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,892
If you don't mind,

603
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:21,559
can I call you my sis?

604
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:24,800
Of course, it's fine, my sis.

605
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,568
What's wrong?

606
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,840
You tell me.

607
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:35,639
- Come back tomorrow.
- Come back tomorrow.

608
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,768
Bye.

609
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,239
When I asked you to dance, you said no.

610
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,239
Then I had to dance with someone else.

611
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,800
It's just dancing.

612
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,440
Who said I don't dance.

613
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,559
Let's go, sis. Let's go dance.

614
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,239
Don't you dance with your husband?

615
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,440
He danced so well just now.

616
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,480
I don't want him. Let's go.

617
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,800
I-I'll take a photo for you two.

618
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,639
Look at my mom!

619
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:23,320
There is no one who won't be led astray by her.

620
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,400
Your mom is really amazing,
with such a strong sense of rhythm.

621
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,199
Actually, your parents can take care of my mom
so that the two of us could reunite.

622
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,440
I'm very thankful.

623
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,639
My mom has always said
that she wanted a sister.

624
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,199
She must be happy now

625
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,360
to have someone to talk to.

626
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,840
Mom went to my house, where is Nemo?

627
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,440
It went along too.

628
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,599
Let's bring it back when we return.

629
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,144
You must be exhausted, right?

630
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,239
You cried because Tang Yuhui is about

631
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,360
to sign with Mr. Yang, right?

632
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You know it?

633
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:11,679
It's not just because of that.

634
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:14,519
I really want to work hard,

635
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,960
but Mr. Yang doesn't see me.

636
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,320
I can't accept it.

637
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,159
Yet I have nothing to do.

638
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,960
So I feel so frustrated,

639
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,632

641
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,199
Actually, I have a way
to put you in touch with Mr. Yang.

642
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,920
No need. Haven't we agreed

643
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,519
not to bring personal relationships into work?

644
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:42,599
Besides, you are our boss.

645
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,320
Even if you don't use your current position
to contact him for me,

646
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,760
it wouldn't be fair to others.

647
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,239
Rest assured. I won't give up easily.

00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,840
The loan application hasn't
been submitted yet, has it?

Without violating your principles,

00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:04,599
be sure to tell me
if there's anything I can help with.

652

Even if it's beating me up
to relieve your stress.

You're not a punching bag,
how could I beat you up?

654
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,920
Are those pecs just for show? Give it a try.

It doesn't matter. Let me tell you, Tu.

686

If you rely solely on brute force in marketing,

This rod is so heavy.

704
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:57,679
The wind and waves are too strong
for sea fishing, and the water is deep.

705
