Empty-hook fishing technique? No bait then?

131
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,720
No need, but this is indeed very difficult.

132
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,519
It requires precise control
of the casting angle and force,

133
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,959
as well as very high demands
on the rod's stiffness and length.

134
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,560
Since you mentioned it, there must be
some quick way to master it.

135
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,639
Actually, the most important thing
is the upward-facing hook.

136
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,319
If you get the hook right,
you're halfway to success.

137

I know there's a place
that specializes in fishing gear nearby.

138

No, if you want to hit the target every time,

139
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,519
you must do it ourselves.

a lot of materials over there.

Actually, the fishing circle is quite small.

146

Since Mr. Yang is so obsessed with fishing,

147
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,960
if someone tells him

148
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,759
that a challenger has come to this island,

149
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,879

can you succeed.

here who can fish with an empty hook.

154

All of them have many years of experience.

155
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,200

Tu, what are you looking at so early
in the morning that makes you so happy?

186

I'm here to look at the sea.

How about you? What are you going to do?

188

We're going to sign a contract.

Xiaoning, are you
dressed like this to go fishing?

190
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,000
Right, the contract can't be signed anyway.

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,840
Then I consider it as a tour.

192
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,080

193
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,399

is here.

203

Hello Mr. Yang, I am Tu Xiaoning from Dairui.

204
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,759
Pleased to meet you.

205
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,519
So you are Tu Xiaoning?

206
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,440
You know each other? That's great.

207
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,000
It's rare to meet someone who shares hobbies.

208
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,879
Well, you two could exchange ideas.

209
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,552
I'll get busy.

210
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,640
Okay.

211
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,200
There are few young people
who know the empty-hook fishing technique.

212
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,320
This requires many years of experience.

213
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,519
Experience is one thing.
It's all about the right solution.

214
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,240
The empty-hook fishing technique
is mainly aimed at yellow croakers.

215
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,960
They have a severe case of compulsion.

216
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,399
They must take out anything
that's in their nest.

217
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,000
Using live bait can actually agitate them.

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,600
It's better to use an empty hook,
to apply the right solution.

219
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,759
The upward-facing hook I designed

220
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:35,639
is extremely sensitive and never misses.

221
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,960
Good, it's very important
to apply the right solution.

222
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,240
Just as you know how to cater to preferences
and win over customers.

223

Mr. Yang, as you know.

I just want a chance to see you.

227
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,600
Only after meeting will you know

228
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,600
whether the proposal I have designed
for your company caters to your needs.

229
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,200
Okay, then I'll hear your proposal.

230
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,799
Let's see if you are well-prepared.

When I arranged to meet him last night,

235
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,399
he said he might not have time today.

Why didn't you say so earlier?

[Loan scheme]
Your interest rate is higher than any other bank's.

244
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,600
What makes you think I'd like your proposal?

245
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,000
Although the interest rate is higher,

246
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,120
the financing proposal has a long
loan period and a large amount,

247
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,440
with less pressure on short-term repayment.

248
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,840
It may be more in line with
your long-term plan for your business.

249
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,039
Really?

250
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,480
I have been to your factory

251
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,240
and understand your development strategy.

252
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,720
In the next three to five years,
you will surely expand your business

253
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,080
and seize the golden period
of market development.

254
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,600
In this case, you need
a working capital as a guarantee.

255
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,759
My proposal fits that perfectly.

256
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:32,240
The period is three years, after which
it can be refinanced automatically.

257
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,360
That is, to roll over the loan
without repaying the principal.

258
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,600
You don't have to bear the pressure
of finding the money to refinance,

259
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,080
nor will you need to worry
about the continuity of funds.

260
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,519
On the surface, the annual
interest rates of other banks

261
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,120
do seem a bit more cost-effective.

262
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,279
But in reality,

263
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,279
how much pressure you'd face
with each year's repayment,

264
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,519
and how high the implicit interest rate is,

265
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,279
as the boss, you must have
a clear idea in your mind.

266
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,919
They told me yesterday

267

I've seen many who are impatient

It's rare to see someone as persistent as you.

To be honest,

the delicacies of Xihai Town.

354
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,839
I heard you ordered a lot just now.

355
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,079
Yesterday I ordered two dishes,

356
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,799
and you wanted to cancel one of them.

357
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,160
What's wrong with you today?
Suddenly being so generous?

358
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,519
Yesterday we split the bill,
and today you're paying the bill.

359
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm paying the bill?
When did I say that I would pay?

360
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,720
You're the local, so you should pay the bill.

361
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,119
Just because I'm the local?

362
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,000
As a local, treating a friend
is a matter of courtesy.

363
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,880
But I can choose not to.

364
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,759
And we are not friends. I'm not treating you.

365
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,240
You spend money

366
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,039
to buy bags worth tens of thousands
and drink wine worth thousands

367
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,079
without even blinking an eye.

368
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,359
Can't you be generous

369
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,599
to treat your colleague
who always takes care of you?

370
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,319
What's it to you how I spend my money?

371
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,440
Besides, when do you take care of me?

372
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,039
I'm taking care of you now.

373
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,920
If I hadn't seen you all alone,

374
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,960
I wouldn't be here eating with you.

375
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,880
I'm all alone?

376
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,319
Let me tell you. I earn my own money
and spend it by myself.

377
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,599
I can feed myself.

378
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,400
I have many clients and pretty boys to meet.

379
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,472
I'm living carefree.

380
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,839
Yes, you are.

381
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:05,079
Then who got drunk
and passed out in the bar late at night,

382
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,440
crying and shouting not to go home?

383
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,480
Because you have no family, right?

384
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,359
You know I'm always talking mean.

385
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,039
Don't take my nonsense seriously.

386
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:21,352
Rao Jing.

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,079
Boss, pack it up for me. I'll come back for it.

388
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,000
This place is usually filled with locals.

389
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,039
I'm sure we won't run into Jing and the others.

390
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,000
Okay, don't be mad. It was my fault.

391
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,359
I apologize to you, I'm sorry.

392
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,400
Well, I'll treat you to a meal.

393
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,079
Order whatever you want.

394
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,599
But let me tell you.

395
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,480
You only get this one chance to spend my money.

396
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,720
Now or never.

397
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Then I want to eat
the expensive yellow croaker.

398
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,599
That ruthless? Fine.

399
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,519
What's wrong? Don't you like it here?

400
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,128
What's the matter?

401
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,912
It looks like it's Rao Jing.

402
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,359
Hold on.

403
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,240
Why are Zhao and the others here? Run!

404
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,759
I think I just saw Tu with a man.

405
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,960
And that man seems to be Mr. Ji.

406
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
Got dizzy before even drinking?

407
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,559
[Danger. Don't get into water.]

408
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:33,160
I wanted to treat you
to a grand and authentic meal,

409
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,519
didn't expect
that we'd have to do it ourselves.

410
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,079
Catch it fresh,

411
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,640
and start a fire later.

412
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,319
This makes the real authentic meal.

413
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,079
Are you the partner they talk about online

414
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,160
who's with stable emotions?

415
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,279
You could provide emotional value
anytime, anywhere.

416
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,240
Why do I remember when you were in school,

417
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,759
you were always comforting others?

418
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,720
Were we close back in school?

419
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,240
Seemed like we hardly spoke.

420
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,920
Back in school, you had a loud voice.

421
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,400
I could hear you every time I walked by.

422
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,400
And you didn't seem
to have anything on your mind.

423
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,359
Right. Back then I was cheerful every day.

424
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,920
The only thing that bothers me

425
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,519
is to think about how to ask
my mom for pocket money.

426
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,240
I was full of passion and positive energy,

427
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,519
shining and warming others.

428
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,240
You were always shining and warming others.

429
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,160
Then why did you always feel like
no one liked you before?

430
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,720
That's true. Since you mention it,

431
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,319
maybe someone really did like me,
but I just didn't know it.

432
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:38,279
Back then, I was nice and cute,

433
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,079
kind of being sparkling.

434
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,359
It's just that I'm not like someone like you

435
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,440
who just stands out in a crowd.

436
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,119
I might need someone to find out

437
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,680
and dig deep to find out my strengths.

438
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,359
Looks like I'm very lucky then

439
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,559
to have dug up a treasure.

440
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,640
What do you like about me?

441
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,079
Does there have to be a reason?

442
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,519
Of course. Just like a seashell,

443
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:04,640
you find it and think it's beautiful,

444
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,279
so you're willing to work hard
to dig it up and then take it home.

445
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:15,440
Smart, hard-working, motivated.

446
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,160
These are all your strengths.

447
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,440
But that's not why I like you.

448
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,880
I wouldn't like anyone else
with these strengths.

449
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,200
I like you simply because you are you.

450
00:25:28,448 --> 00:25:29,519
But…

451
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,240
No buts, actually, you mean

452
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,440
a lot more to me than you think.

453
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:40,799
Don't make it that deep,

454
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,400
which makes my liking for you seem superficial.

455
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,319
Tell me, how superficial is it?

456
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,720
I just think you're handsome.

457
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,519
Didn't hear you. Louder, please.

458
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,000
I just think you're handsome,
perfectly my cup of tea.

459
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,039
I heard about this before.

460
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:10,359
Who told you? When did you find out?

461
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,392
It's a secret.

462
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,839
Who said it? Who told you?

463
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,079
Can you tell me?

464
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,519
Who told you?

465
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,640
It'll be ready very soon.

466
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,920
I want to eat something spicy.

467
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,944
Okay.

468
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:36,160
Your phone is ringing.

469
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,000
It's mom's call.

470
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,680
Hello, Mom.

471
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,039
Mom, how have you been?

472
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,440
Xiaoning, all's well.

473
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,200
Your parents cook delicious food
for me every day.

474
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,416
And they just made me drink
another two bowls of pigeon soup.

475
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,048
Talk to your mom.

476
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:03,136
Xiaoning.

477
00:27:03,136 --> 00:27:04,920
Mom, what's wrong?

478
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,680
Other kids go on business trips,

479
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,440
and their parents would make many calls a day.

480
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,680
Look at you, not even a single call to me.

481
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,119
If I'll make you many calls,

482
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,400
don't you still have to do the work yourself?

483
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,960
As long as you're safe.

484
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,640
Besides, Ji is with you.

485
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,880
Cherish your world for two.

486
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,000
Right, go back early and rest up.

487
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,279
Rest assured, all's well. Bye.

488
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,359
Bye.

489
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,400
Okay, don't worry.

490
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,784
Eat more.

491
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,800
This place is really beautiful.

492
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,152
Do you always come back?

493
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,920
It's the first time coming back
since my parents passed away.

494
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,400
Then you don't have any family here anymore?

495
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,759
Xihai Town is too quiet.

496
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,119
When it gets to eight or nine o'clock
in the evening,

497
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,759
there's hardly anyone on the streets.

498
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,440
Although my name is Rao Jing,

499
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,920
I prefer hustle and bustle.

500
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,039
Staying in Xihai Town makes me nervous.

501
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,680
I feel more at ease in the big city.

502
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,559
You don't prefer hustle and bustle,

503
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,480
but you are afraid of being alone.

504
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,920
Perhaps. I sometimes quite envy you.

505
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,359
Your life is real and lively.

506
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,359
At work, you are scheming.

507
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,799
But it doesn't hinder
your naivety in life at all.

508
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,039
You are so simple.

509
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,240
You'd take advantage whenever you want.

510
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,440
And you don't feel embarrassed at all.

511
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,519
- Are you complimenting me or putting me down?
- Putting you down.

512
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,992
Okay. I'm just an ordinary person,

513
00:28:56,992 --> 00:29:00,599
living a plain and ordinary life.

514
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,799
I flatter others for some money,

515
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,279
scheme for a bit of vested interest

516
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,920
worry about daily necessities,

517
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,519
and for parents, for wife and daughters…

518
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,519
I don't have a wife yet.

519
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,480
Anyway, I carry the burden for the family.

520
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,184
Carrying the burden for the family.

521
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,279
Since my parents passed away,

522
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,448
I've told myself to be free from burdens.

523
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,519
Don't trouble myself
to establish any social relationships.

524
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,359
If I could let go of everything,

525
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,400
there would be no burden.

526
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,119
But sometimes I wonder

527
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,759
if everything and everyone in my life

528
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,792
lost their weight,

529
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,880
what would be the meaning of my life then?

00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:57,988
♫ To you and no one else ♫

708
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:02,820
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

709
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,996
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

710
00:45:04,996 --> 00:45:08,172
♫ No one knows ♫

711
00:45:09,064 --> 00:45:11,332
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

712
00:45:11,332 --> 00:45:14,700
♫ I hope you know ♫

713
00:45:16,164 --> 00:45:22,756
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

714
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:28,196
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

715
00:45:28,196 --> 00:45:34,948
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

716
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:39,204
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

717
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:44,356
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

718
00:45:44,356 --> 00:45:47,300
♫ To you and no one else ♫

719
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,972
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

720
00:45:51,972 --> 00:45:54,404
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

721
00:45:54,404 --> 00:45:57,612
♫ No one knows ♫

722
00:45:58,184 --> 00:46:00,388
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

723
00:46:00,388 --> 00:46:04,556
♫ I hope you know ♫
