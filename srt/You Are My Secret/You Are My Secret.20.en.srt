Really? Did the doctor really say that?

34
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:39,424
Really.

35
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:42,079
[Hospitalization Expense List]
The doctor said there's a significant improvement.

36
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,000
You can be discharged.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,079
We will help you
with the discharge procedures later.

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,799
Then we'll go home.

39
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,840
It's so good to go home.

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,959
Well, then please

41
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,840
help me tidy up the old house.

42
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,799
What's the matter, Mom? Do you dislike me?

43
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,120
Don't you want to live with me?

00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,400
What are you talking about?

Why not?

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,080
You don't want to live with us.

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,520
That means you must hate someone.

54
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,879
If it's not me, then it must be him.

55
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,319
Anyway, we won't force you.

56
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,120

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,800
Ji. How are you?

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,864
Pretty good.

72
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:10,719
- Pretty good.
- Give it to me.

73
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,800
I made you mushroom soup.

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,599
I wanted to make chicken soup.

75
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,080
I've bought the chicken,
but she wouldn't let me cook it.

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,488
She's taking the immunocomplex,

77
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:22,112
can't supplement estrogen,
yet you still make chicken soup.

78
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:24,199
You are messing around.

79
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:28,520
Drinking chicken soup
to supplement estrogen is wrong.

80
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,759
Moreover, it's called immunohistochemistry,

81
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,919
not called immunocomplex.

82
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,048
Did you understand that?

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,280
You come to bring me food every now and then.

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,719
My stomach is truly enjoying the good life.

85
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,240
It's so happy.

We do not just bring you food,

88
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,240
I even brought you something good.

89
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,919
This is the new Shasanguo game I bought.
Take a look.

90
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,120
Sanguosha.

91
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,039
Sanguosha.

92
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,560
Today it would be called Sanguosha,
no matter what.

93
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,080
Actually, I kind of envy the relationship
you have with your parents.

94
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,280
My mom and I…

95
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,399
Actually, before the two of us got along,

96
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,279
the relationship between my mom and I
was even worse than now.

97
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,720
I have studied abroad for three years before.

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,560
I didn't come back to Star City
until last year because she got sick.

99
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,720
My mom always felt like
she didn't really know me.

100
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,319
So did I.

101
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,560
I don't know how to get close to her.

102
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,800
There's still time.

103
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,639
After your mom is discharged,

104
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,079
you could spend more time with her.

105
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,279
She is getting better every day.

106
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,399
It's the chance Heaven gave you.

107
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,759
You have to seize this chance,

108
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,199
don't leave any regrets for yourself.

109
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,568
Understood.

110
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,984
Mr. Ji, that's impressive.

111
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:11,959
Zhouyang Hotel is a tough nut to crack.

112
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,680
Mr. Jiang was always
concerned about this before he left.

113
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,000
I can't believe you could secure the contract

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,236
in less than a month.

115
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:18,592
Luck plays a part in it.

116
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:21,319
It is mainly due to a collective effort.

117
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,439
Senior, you're modest.

118
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,000
Everyone knows
how tough that boss is to deal with.

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,360
And you could handle it so quickly.

120
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,720
That's certainly a personal achievement.

121
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,279
Tang, we are working at a bank,

122
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,839
we shouldn't talk about clients.

123
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:35,399
Especially don't label them.

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,639
We're just saying casually.

125
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,439
You are right.
I'll pay more attention next time.

126
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,399
Mr. Ji, after closing such a big deal,

127
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,839
should we have a celebration dinner tonight?

128
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,759
Better to do it tonight.

129
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,399
I have to take my mom back home
to visit my dad's grave tomorrow.

130
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,519
And I need to go prepare for it tonight.

131
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,759
Well, once the contract is officially signed,

132
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,040
I'll arrange the celebration dinner.

133
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,199
Great, deal. Then I'll go back to work.

134
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,519
- Alright.
- Get back to work.

135
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,560
Senior.

136
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,519
Tang, I have mentioned it…

137
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,439
Mr. Ji, sorry I forgot it.

138
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,464
I will be careful next time.

139
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,319
What's wrong?

140
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,279
We visited your mom at the hospital last time.

141
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,600
But I asked the hospital,

142
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,360
they said that caregivers will take care
of two patients at the same time now.

143
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,759
It might not be enough care for your mom.

144
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,800
Well, I have a friend

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,959
who just happens to run a nursing hospital.

146
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,728
Let's hire a caregiver for her.

147
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:51,488
I can ask for a discount.

148
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:53,439
The price is much cheaper than the hospital's.

149
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,959
Thank you.

150
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,236
My mom is very satisfied
with the current caregiver.

151
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:59,600
She doesn't need it. Thank you.

152
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,800
Well, starting from today,

153
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,279
I can go to the hospital to chat
with your mom after work every day.

154
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,759
I wanted to go directly,

155
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,759
but I was afraid you'd think

156
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,079
I was deliberately approaching your mom.

157
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,160
I just think that your mom is getting old

158
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,360
and quite lonely,

159
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,959
yet you're busy with work.
I can go talk to her for you.

160
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,279
Thank you.

161
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,360
There's no need for that.

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,240
Why?

163
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,639
I think I get along well with your mom.

164
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,160
And as a mom,

165
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,040
if she sees a suitable person
appearing around her child,

166
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,319
she would feel relieved.

167
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,519
I've already said what needed to be said.

168
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,632
No need.

169
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,279
And now it's working hours,
please go back to your work.

170
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,519
You know I like you.

171
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,079
I'm not supposed to talk about this at work,

172
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,560
but to avoid trouble,

173
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,360
I think I should still make things clear.

174
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,079
I like someone else.

175
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,160
We have no chance.

176
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,279
Who is it?

177
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:20,959
Mr. Ji, I've brought you
the file you requested.

178
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,960
Heard it?

179
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,039
You were very determined. Good.

180
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,288
Give it back to me.

181
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,159

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,279
Mom, over the years,
we have slowly drifted apart.

362
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:45,119
It's because I didn't give you the chance.

363
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,559
I'm sorry, Mom.

364
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:54,079
You've been lonely all these years too.

365
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:06,720
I've tried hard to be your support.

366
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,160
Let's get back the time we've lost together.

367
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,960
We certainly will, Mom.

368
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,336
We certainly will.

369
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,008
We certainly will.

370
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,200
Xiaoning, let me tell you.

371
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,440
These melon seeds taste especially good.

372
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,119
You're up. Did you sleep well?

373
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,720
Yes.

374
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,752
Why did you get up so early?

375
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:04,920
Xiaoning said
she didn't dream at all last night.

376
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,519
She slept deeply, so woke up early.

377
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,519
There's breakfast on the table. Go eat.

378
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:17,279
Have you eaten?

379
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,464
We've all eaten.

380
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,319
Mom, did you sleep well last night?

381
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,519
I slept quite well.

382
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,680
I happen to have time today.

383
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,400
How about we accompany you for a walk in town?

384
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,240
Don't stay with me.

385
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,000
You should take Xiaoning out for a good stroll.

386
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,440
I want to go to visit your dad's grave later.

387
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,759
It's rare for me to come back,

388
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,200
I want to chat with your dad more.

389
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,319
Let him take you for a good tour.

390
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,256
Okay.

391
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,200
You're in a good mood today.

392
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,960
What's up? Did you win the lottery?

393
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,640
Didn't you hear me talking with mom last night?

394
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,319
I didn't hear anything.
I slept very deeply last night,

395
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,720
so I didn't hear anything at all.

396
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,839
Really? When I went back to my room last night,

397
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,440
I thought I saw someone rushing onto the bed?

398
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,359
If it wasn't you, is it a ghost?

399
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:46,279
Don't try to scare me.

400
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,480
I'm not the kind of person
who eavesdrops on others.

401
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Mom said last night
that she's feeling a lot better.

402
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,640
This time when we go back,
let's get her discharged.

403
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,720
We can bring her home.

404
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,079
Really?

405
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,480
No wonder today,

406
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,920
she wanted to have a private chat
with dad. Good news.

407
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,640
Do you want to know
what really happened to my dad?

408
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,720
I do. But it's okay if you don't tell me.

409
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,559
I know it's a scar on your heart.

410
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:26,496
I'll be here when you're ready to tell me.

411
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:28,200
No bother.

412
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,519
As long as you want to hear, I can tell you.

413
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,536
Let's go.

414
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,920
My dad also used to work at the bank back then.

415
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,680
But later, he got involved
in an illegal loan case.

416
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,680
At that time, the entire bank's lending process

417
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,920
was very irregular.

418
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,119
His old neighbor operated a small factory,

419
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,720
and later, to raise money,

420
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,759
they took out a large loan from my dad's bank

421
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,880
through a dual contract.

422
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,799
Then later this factory

423
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,559
went bankrupt due to poor management.

424
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,519
And the person in charge
took the money and fled.

425
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,880
My dad wanted to collect the money.

426
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,720
But unexpectedly, that person's parents
threatened him with death

427
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,440
and even claimed that my dad received
a huge kickback from this.

428
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:19,640
They used sleeping pills to fight my dad.

429
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,920
But they replaced
the sleeping pills with vitamins,

430
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,599
so they were completely unharmed.

431
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,599
Yet, they stayed in the hospital
pretending to be sick,

432
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:31,559
and claiming that my dad was the one
who started this whole thing.

433
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,839
At that time, the incident
was known to everyone.

434
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,079
My dad couldn't clear his name,

435
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:40,880
and became the topic of neighborhood gossip.

436
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,440
Heng, terrible.

437
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,160
It's your dad. He's covered in blood.

438
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,079
Hurry back and take a look.

439
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,799
I don't remember how far I ran that day,

440
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,200
nor do I remember how long I ran.

441
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,519
When I ran to the hospital that day,
I can only remember

442
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,759
how hard my mom cried and shouted.

443
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,079
My dad was a man
with a strong sense of self-respect.

444
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,799
He was desperate to prove his innocence.

445
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,056
So, one spring evening,

446
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:17,371
he chose to jump off the building.

447
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,000
He chose to commit suicide
to erase his grievances.

448
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:30,319
But after he died, my mom had collapsed.

449
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,519
For a very long period of time,

450
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,119
my mom was on the verge of collapse,

451
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:39,079
simply unable to live a normal life.

452
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,759
So, when we met on the rooftop,

453
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,240
it was during that period?

454
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,256
Yes.

455
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:53,832
I felt like the whole school
was talking about me.

456
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,920
I should say they were looking down on me.

457
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,640
So during that time,
I often went to the rooftop alone.

458
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,240
doing nothing, just sitting there
and looking into the distance.

459
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,960
I did not know how I should
proceed with my future.

460
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:14,640
Watching the sunset on the rooftop,

461
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,000
I felt just like the day
when my dad committed suicide.

462
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,240
In fact, I really want this to be a dream.

463
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,200
I wish when I returned home after school,

464
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,319
my dad and mom could greet me
with smiles and laughter.

465
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,319
And you ended up being misunderstood by me.

466
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,480
I thought you were going
to jump off the building.

467
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,599
To be honest,
I did have that thought at the time.

468
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,640
But when I thought
of how devastated my mom was,

469
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,759
I knew I couldn't do so.

470
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,039
So those days when I wanted to die but couldn't

471
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,559
were the darkest moment of my life.

472
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,880
So you did save me.

473
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,519
And you brought a hope into my life.

474
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,000
So our fate began from that time.

475
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,480
And thanks to you.

476
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,440
You were the only one
who cared about me at that time.

477
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,760
So many years have passed.

478
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,000
I really should say thank you.

479
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,440
What for? I should do so.

480
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,920
And I'm not at a loss either.

481
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,360
After all, you've given yourself
to me now, haven't you?

482
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,400
Later on I made up my mind

483
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,159
working in the Internal Control
Compliance Department.

484
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,599
It's partly because of my dad.

485
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,559
I hope to work even harder,

486
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,747
to make the process of the whole industry

487
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:00,599
more standardized and transparent.

488
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,000
Even if I can only make a small contribution,

489
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,280
it might have prevented a family tragedy.

490
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,400
So since high school,

491
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,440
you had already made this decision?

492
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,199
But I feel it's such a pity

493
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,199
that Dad didn't get to see me
enter the banking system,

494
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,920
nor did he see me move
from internal control to the business.

495
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,280
And he never got to see
his daughter-in-law with his own eyes.

496
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,880
This is really adorable.

497
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,360
Yes, we should put it in the room.

498
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,960
It is quite adorable.

499
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,559
I have a place I can take you to.

500
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,599
- Okay.
- Let's go.

501
00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:52,576
[Clay sculpture shop]

502
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:54,504
[Wings]

503
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,480
Try tapping it a bit.

504
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,559
So you really do know how to do it.

505
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:12,679
I thought you were just saying.

506
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,559
I used to do this a lot in junior high school.

507
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,079
It was tiring to study at that time.

508
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,840
So I used this to relieve stress.

509
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,320
But I pretty much stopped doing it
when I got to college.

510
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,719
So that dream girl doll was
made by him personally.

511
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,856
Nice.

512
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,639
Actually, our town

513
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:45,119
is famous for its handicrafts.

514
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,199
Glass, clay modeling, rattan weaving.

515
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:50,199
The owner of this shop is my aunt.

516
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:53,039
My mom used to bring me here when I was little.

517
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,960
Then why did you go work at a bank?

518
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,440
Isn't it a waste of such good craftsmanship?

519
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,679
If you get the cultivation,

520
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:01,679
you might become an artist.

521
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,239
What are you saying?

522
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,519
So what have you decided to make?

523
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,880
I've decided to make a big family portrait.

524
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,648
Featuring my dad, my mom, your dad, your mom,

525
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:12,832
and the two of us.

526
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,880
Not one less.

527
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
Humans aren't easy to make.

528
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,039
And you have to make six at once.

529
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,119
If you can do it, why can't I?

530
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,119
I can do it. Don't mind me.

531
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,599
You'll do yours, and I'll do mine.

532
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,880
Don't disturb me.

533
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,896
Then I'll leave you to it.

534
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:30,920
Go away.

535
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,400
How's it going?

536
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,520
It's done. Take a look.

537
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
Not bad.

538
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,400
Of course.

539
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:02,639
Thank you, Auntie.

540
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,920
You're welcome.

541
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,760
Take it home and set it up
somewhere you can't reach it.

542
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,400
Avoid direct sunlight.

543
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,639
Okay.

544
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:13,199
From now on, this is also your hometown.

545
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,320
When you have the time, come back
with your mother-in-law and stroll around.

546
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,119
Over the years, the young people
have all left one by one,

547
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:22,368
leaving only us old folks here.

548
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:23,559
Right, auntie.

549
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,559
Where do the brothers who make glass go?

550
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:27,400
They really soared last year,

551
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,719
so they started a company in the city,

552
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,336
specializing in home decor
floor-to-ceiling glass.

553
00:38:30,336 --> 00:38:31,639
I heard from their parents

554
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:35,079
that the two brothers plan to double
the size of their company this year,

555
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,440
to expand their business.

556
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,400
Expand their business?

557
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,119
Auntie, could you give me their phone number?

558
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,440
He needs money to expand their business.

559
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,400
If he needs to take out a loan,
he can come to me.

560
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,079
You really know how to seize the opportunity.

561
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,280
It's professional sensitivity.

562
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,936
It's okay.

563
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:54,039
We're folks from the same town.

564
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,520
I'll send you the number later.

565
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,639
Thank you, auntie.

566
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,000
You are really polite.

567
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,056
Paying money.

568
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,719
I don't want money.

569
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,639
It's rare that Heng comes back.

570
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:08,320
I can't take his money.

571
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,239
Heng, bring your mom back
more often in the future,

572
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:14,599
giving us more chance to chat.

573
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,039
Alright, no problem.

574
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:18,400
Then thank you, auntie.

575
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,384
- Not at all.
- Okay.

576
00:39:20,384 --> 00:39:23,760
Well then, we're leaving. Goodbye, auntie.

577
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,768
Goodbye, auntie.

578
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,760
Xiaoning is skillful with her hands.
It's so pretty.

579
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,079
Mom, you don't know

580
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:48,880
Xiaoning is not only skillful with her hands,
but also very clever.

581
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,920
When we were making this,

582
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,079
she was still thinking to develop a client.

583
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:56,039
Don't make fun of me in front of mom.

584
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:02,199
No worries. I'm just sitting here,

585
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,360
watching the sunset,
feeling the evening breeze,

586
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:11,039
and listening to you guys
chatting and joking, I'm so happy.

587
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,640
Mom, when we have time,
let's go on a road trip up north

588
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,400
to the great prairie. You'll definitely like it

589
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,480
Sounds good.

590
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,119
Once I am getting better,

591
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:29,199
let's invite your dad and mom.

592
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,599
Our whole family will go on a road trip.

593
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,360
Maybe I should learn to drive.

594
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,639
Can I still learn at my age now?

595
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,679
Of course, you can, mom.

596
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:48,480
Then I'll accompany you
in practicing driving, mom.

597
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:51,599
Okay.

598
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,039
By the way, mom. Yuheng has
to go on a business trip tomorrow,

599
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:57,239
lasting for two to three days,
to sign a contract.

600
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,760
When he comes back,

601
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,320
we will help you discharge from the hospital.

602
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,639
You can go home then.

603
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,639
Great!

604
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,079
[A Person's Memory]

605
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,360
What about yours? Let me see.

606
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,232
It's a pity for you to be
in the banking industry.

607
00:41:47,232 --> 00:41:48,239
If you get the cultivation,

608
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,760
you might become an artist.

609
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,808
See how's my work.

610
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,440
Beautiful.

611
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:03,400
This red umbrella.

612
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,800
Puling? Isn't this from my dad's company?

613
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,920
I remember you have one too.

614
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:15,239
Maybe this one is that one.

615
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,559
Isn't this just a giveaway umbrella?

616
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,880
Why do you like it so much?

617
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,960
This is the umbrella the first time
when I picked you up from work.

618
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,064
Don't you remember it?

619
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,360
I do, of course.

620
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,560
♫ I remember it as if it was yesterday ♫

621
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,888
♫ We used to share many memories ♫

622
00:42:41,888 --> 00:42:45,440
♫ But I've already locked them away ♫

623
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,872
♫ Placed in a corner ♫

624
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:52,768
♫ They're waiting to be found again ♫

625
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:56,800
♫ Those cherished quiet moments ♫

626
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,352
♫ Are hidden in the dark ♫

627
00:43:00,352 --> 00:43:06,976
♫ Light them up again and again,
and never let go ♫

628
00:43:06,976 --> 00:43:10,912
♫ The silent, everlasting promise ♫

629
00:43:10,912 --> 00:43:15,968
♫ Are secretly hidden within my heart ♫

630
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:23,968
♫ Because of you, I have become who I am ♫

631
00:43:32,388 --> 00:43:35,336
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

632
00:43:35,336 --> 00:43:38,436
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

633
00:43:38,436 --> 00:43:43,596
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

634
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:47,780
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

635
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,268
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

636
00:43:51,268 --> 00:43:55,180
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

637
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:59,492
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

638
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:06,372
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

639
00:44:06,372 --> 00:44:10,596
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

640
00:44:10,596 --> 00:44:15,332
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

641
00:44:15,332 --> 00:44:18,468
♫ To you and no one else ♫

642
00:44:18,468 --> 00:44:23,300
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

643
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,476
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

644
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:28,652
♫ No one knows ♫

645
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:31,812
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

646
00:44:31,812 --> 00:44:35,180
♫ I hope you know ♫

647
00:44:36,644 --> 00:44:43,236
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

648
00:44:43,236 --> 00:44:48,676
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

649
00:44:48,676 --> 00:44:55,428
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

650
00:44:55,428 --> 00:44:59,684
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

651
00:44:59,684 --> 00:45:04,836
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

652
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:07,780
♫ To you and no one else ♫

653
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,452

♫ No one knows ♫

656
00:45:18,664 --> 00:45:20,868
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

657
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:25,036
♫ I hope you know ♫
