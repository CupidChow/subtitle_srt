531
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,920
She's different now.

532
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,680
She's become prettier than before.

533
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,920
It's the look in her eyes.

534
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,759
Today, I've come here on a mission.

535
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:58,799
You know there's been some misunderstanding
between me and Xiaoning.

536
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,799
So I want to formally apologize
to her here at this place.

537
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,839
I want to pursue her again.

538
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,680
Rest assured. Let's proceed
as we previously planned.

539
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,712
There definitely won't be a problem.

540
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,880
I'm going.

541
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,759
What is Lu Sijing going to do?

542
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,952
Haven't they broken up for a long time?

543
00:33:21,952 --> 00:33:23,039
What is he doing?

544
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,160
This is…

545
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,796
Ji Yuheng? What is he doing here?

546
00:33:29,796 --> 00:33:31,872
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

547
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:35,359
♫ I hope you know ♫

548
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:38,000
Xiaoning, long time no see.

549
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,584
Long time no see.

550
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,799
What are you going to do?

551
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,119
I'm here to apologize.

552
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,200
A year ago on my birthday,

553
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,559
you said you would propose to me
at my birthday party,

554
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,079
but you broke your promise,

555
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:58,119
which is making me very embarrassed.

556
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,680
What are you doing today?

557
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,039
Wanting to make me even more embarrassed?

558
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,280
Xiaoning, I know that some things
might be too late to say now.

559
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
But I must tell you.

560
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,519
A year ago, you were so excited

561
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:21,760
about our marriage and our future,

562
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,639
but I chose to escape.

563
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,719
At that time, I thought

564
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,719
that getting married and having children
wasn't the best life choice.

565
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,079
But it took me a year to realize

566
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:43,159
that love can't be measured by value.

567
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,559
So I wanted to formally apologize to you today

568
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,800
in front of everyone.

569
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,159
Xiaoning, I'm sorry, please forgive me.

570
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:01,199
Forgive him, forgive him!

571
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,880
Don't push Xiaoning like this.

572
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,599
She knows what she wants to do.

573
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,696
What are you guys doing?

574
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:08,800
Exactly. I still remember the day
Lu Sijing broke his promise.

575
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,679
How can she just forgive him that easily?

576
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:15,480
Take back the flowers, take them back.

577
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,920
Xiaoning, I know you're still mad at me.

578
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,559
Give me another chance
and let me make it up to you, okay?

579
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:28,679
You don't need to make it up to me.
And you don't owe me anything.

580
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,800
I can't live without you.

581
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,880
You can live without me.

582
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,920
From the moment you decided to walk away

583
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,000
without saying a word to me,

584
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,519
you knew in your heart

585
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,880
that you could live well without me.

586
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,639
We broke up.

587
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,480
Take back the flowers, I won't accept them.

588
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,760
What are you doing?

589
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,840
He is still confessing.

590
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,159
You don't like my flowers
or you don't like me anymore?

591
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,519
W-What's going on?

592
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,800
What's going on?

593
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,519
Does Ji Yuheng like Tu Xiaoning?

594
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:02,079
I think he's helping her out.

595
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,960
Ji Yuheng, right?

596
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,088
What do you want to do?

597
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,840
You said you liked it,

598
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,904
so I've brought it to you.

599
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:24,360
Isn't it our flower?

600
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,472
Just listen.

601
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,320
It's beautiful, I like it.

602
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,280
What do you want to do?

603
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,280
This is between me and Xiaoning.

604
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,159
What does it have to do with you?

605
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:51,239
Don't forget
it's an old classmate's pre-wedding party.

606
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,320
If this gets embarrassing,

607
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,679
it's not just about the two of you.

608
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,199
I already have a flower in my hand
and I can't accept your flowers.

609
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,159
Lu Sijing, don't think

610
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,920
I'm turning you down today
because I'm mad at you.

611
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,440
I've thought it through.

612
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,199
I just want to see a better self

613
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,679
and a better life in the future.

614
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,320
Today is an old classmate's pre-wedding party.

615
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,388
We are grown-ups.

616
00:38:32,388 --> 00:38:34,604
Don't make it embarrassing.

617
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,008
Okay.

618
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,800
T-Thank you.

619
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,039
Thank you for helping me out.

620
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,320
You're welcome.

621
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Looks like your last relationship
took a toll on you.

622
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,039
Not really. I used to think so.

623
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,840
I thought I would be mad at him

624
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,159
and hate him when I saw him.

625
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,400
But actually, none of that happened.

626
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,760
I used to wonder if I still loved him.

627
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,920
But when I asked myself the question,

628
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,679
I knew the answer the moment I hesitated.

629
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:09,119
In fact, what I've been mad about

630
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,880
is that he left without saying a word

631
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,400
and that I got abandoned.

632
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,360
Sorry for saying so much.

633
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:30,079
So you went on the matchmaking to get over
this relationship as soon as possible?

634
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,639
I went on the matchmaking

635
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:37,360
because I wanted to find a better man
than him as soon as possible.

636
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,712
But I've realized that what I want

637
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:42,599
is only a promising future

638
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,679
with a successful career, a stable job,

639
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,880
and a happy family.

640
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,000
So do you have any plans?

641
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,519
I'll continue with the matchmaking.

642
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,760
Perhaps…

643
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,239
you just want to have a stable marriage,

644
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,880
would you…

645
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,119
would you marry me?
