Ms. Geng, thank you.

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
You can rest in the VIP room.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,016
No need.

39
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,920
I would like to go to the restroom
to touch up my makeup.

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,159
Ok, I will accompany you then.

41
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,480
No need, I can manage by myself.

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,592
Give me the bag.

43
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:58,752
Okay, got it.

44
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,920
Please wrap this up for the lady.

- Okay.
- Thank you.

Hello, what can I do to help you?

00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,079
What is the meaning behind this?

48
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,039
This is the souvenir for our press conference.

The first birthday grabbing ritual?

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
Alright, then I will pay first.

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,944
Alright.

00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:24,448

Hello, I am the Account Manager of Dairui Bank.

64
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,280
How about I check the card for you?

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,360
Thank you.

66
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360

67
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,080
Your card has expired.

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,439
The average credit card
lasts three to five years.

69
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,800
You should contact the Account Manager
to get a new one reissued,

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,439
then activate it and you can use it.

71
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,680
However, you can't use it today.

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,800
Thank you.

73
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,719
Then sorry, I can't pay today.

74
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,960
It's okay.

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,960
How about you use mine?

76
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,199
Use mine. You can just
transfer the money to me later.

77
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,240
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

78
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,520

You're welcome. You are very pretty.

85
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,199
Made a wasted trip. We've waited nearly
two hours and Mr. Xia didn't even show up.

86
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,680
I just found out

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,919
Xing from the Division Two
has blocked him at the hotel.

88
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,199
Mr. Xia didn't want to see anyone,

89
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,840
but Xing disguised himself as a hotel waiter,

90
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,439
even got a staff card, quite professional.

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,400
He waited for him right at his room door.

92
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,400
What a dirty trick.

93
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,759
Marketing is all about performance.

94
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,639
For a project as big as Weiji Company's,

95
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,000
it's normal for Mr. Xing to use some tricks.

96
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,439
But you get the information pretty fast.

97
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:21,240
The people in the Division Two
are quite loose-lipped.

98
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,800
After all, I've worked
at Dairui for so many years.

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,600
It's normal to have one or two close friends.

100
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
But rest assured.

101
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,896
Though I'm quite talkative,

102
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:31,199
when it comes to the real thing,
I'm very tight-lipped.

103
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,800
They couldn't get a hint
of any moves on our side.

104
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,959
What's this? What's poking me in the butt?

105
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,600
Your special someone?

106
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,040
What do you mean?

107
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,120
Mind your own business.

108
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,879
I have no business.

109
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,480
You like Rao Jing,
do you really think I can't tell?

110
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,360
I like her? How is it possible?

111
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,240
I didn't ask you.

112
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,519
I was talking about the truth.

113
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,000
What truth?

114
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,160
She might not be into me.

115
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,720
So happy?

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,959
Has she really been made regular by Mr. Ji?

117
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,439
But Tang doesn't look like

118
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,000
she'd use that ponytail holder in Mr. Ji's car.

119
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Whose ponytail holder was left in Mr. Ji's car?

120
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,319
Was it that special, mysterious someone?

121
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,480
She's been made regular?

122
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,279
What are you talking about? Get back to work.

123
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,519
Maybe you saw it wrong.

124
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,959
How could there be a ponytail holder?

125
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,400
It might be for something else.

126
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,256

128
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,628
Shiba Inu? I remember someone wearing it.

wear a ponytail holder with a Shiba Inu on it?

132
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,439
I think so. I don't remember.

133
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,959

quite popular. Many people have it.

Yes, it's quite popular.

between those two, isn't there?

was that photographer hired by you?

142
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:56,879
Yes.

143
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,079
No wonder your face was shot so small,

144
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,639
and my face was shot so big, like a pancake.

145
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,728

146
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,040
I think it looks quite nice.

at first glance,

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,800
it kind of looks like a wedding photo.

152

It doesn't look like one at all.

153

It's miles off.

154

Your ponytail holder can be found everywhere.

156

Just insist and deny it.

00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,039
At least let me know what's going on.

176
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,080
I can't believe he returned
the leather shoes I bought him.

177
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,919
Those were the onboarding gift I chose for him.

178

And then?

179
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,320
He said it was because the money
I bought his shoes was my dad's.

180
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,399
He didn't want to spend my dad's money.

181
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,879
I grew up with everything

182
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,240
with my dad's money.

183
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,440
He meant I'm living off my parents, right?

184
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,279
He definitely didn't mean that.

185
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,200
That's exactly what he meant.

186
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,840
Now he's become a policeman,

187
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,399
with a strong sense of justice.
So he's minding my business now.

188
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,039
Do you think it's appropriate to say that?

189
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,928
Why not?

190
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,519
You know best what kind of person he is.

191
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,159
And I know best what kind of person you are.

192
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,799
You're just speaking out of anger right now.

193
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,399
Anyway, he took it upon himself
to return the shoes I bought him,

194
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,720
which is his fault.

195
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,279
If he did it wrong, you can tell him off,

196
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,759
or even have an argument with him.

197
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,039
Anyway, call him to come now.

198
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,840
I won't help you carry all your bags
onto the car for you.

199
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,240
Alright. I'll call him.

200
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,488
Weiyi. The weather is nice today.

201
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:06,060
Let's go out for a walk.

202
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,639
I'll see how you'll talk your way out of this.

203
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,000
I played basketball with Ji the other day,

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and mentioned taking a loan
for the house purchase.

205
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,960
Who's getting a loan?

206
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,840
We have to have a home
when we get married, right?

207
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,679
Given my current income,

208
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,120
making a down payment is difficult,
not to mention paying in full.

209
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,360
Then take your time. No one is rushing you.

210
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,279
Yes, no one is rushing me.

211
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,960
But now that I'm with you,

212
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,559
I should support both of our lives.

213
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,600
I have to take good care of you.

214
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,759
Because I know the standards of Ling Weiyi

215
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,799
is here, perhaps even higher.

216
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,840
I still can't reach there.

217
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,080
But I'm sure I can make it in the future.

218
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,159
I don't want you

219
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:06,559
to lower your standard of living
just because you're with me.

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,240
And about those shoes today,

221
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,440
can I not be happy
when my girlfriend gives me a gift?

222
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,639
I'm so happy, really.

223
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,559
But I don't want
to take your and your dad's money for granted.

224
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,519
But those were the onboarding gift I gave you.

225
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,600
There's a good chance
this is the only job of your life.

226
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,440
This is memorable, okay?

227
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,879
Can't you just accept the gift first

228
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,840
and stick to your principles next time?

229
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,720
Don't worry. I've thought it all through.

230
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,960
Excluding the daily living expenses,

231
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,559
I'll save the rest of the money,

232
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,440
and soon I could buy those shoes back.

233
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,600
I'll show you what I look like

234
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,519
when I wear them together with the uniform.

235
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,304
Don't be angry.

236
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Why are the dark circles so big?

237
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,639
You've been staying up late again?

238
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,240
It's okay. I just started work,

239
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,600
so there's a lot to learn. Don't worry.

240
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,200
Then it's settled.

241
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,759
You'll buy those shoes back soon.

242
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,896
Sure.

243
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,559
Don't be angry.

244
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,120
Let's go. This is more like it.

245
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,152
Hurry up and buy them.

246
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,296
Finally, it's done.

247
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,919
As a working person,

248
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,559
I wonder when I could make a fortune.

249
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:09,288
[Division One Chief Account Manager]
[Rao Jing]

250
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,240
One, two.

251
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,000
Let me think. Think about it.

252
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,208
Who is it?

253
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,879
Hello.

254
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,279
What takes you so long to pick up a call?

255
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,960
Are you afraid I'll keep pestering you?

256
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,600
Who is it? Stingy man?

257
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,440
Did you drink wine?

258
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,720
Yes.

259
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,000
I picked up your staff card.

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,960
Nothing else. I just wanted to let you know.

261
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,039
In case you'd be anxious
if you couldn't find it. I'm hanging up.

262
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,759
It's fine. Keep it.

263
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,039
Keep it forever. I'm home now.

264
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,080
Are you okay? Are you home now?

265
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,176
Where are you?

266
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,960
Hello.

267
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,000
Leave a pair of size 42 men's shoes
at the door.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,039
Don't forget to leave them there.

269
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,080
And then, after you wake up tomorrow morning,

270
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,200
change the code of the digital lock

271
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,159
at my place.

272
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,840
Okay. Change the code.

273
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,559
You do have a strong sense of security.

274
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:06,440
Of course.

275
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,840
A beauty living alone.

276
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,159
Do you know? Once the elevator
in my building broke,

277
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,240
so I took the stairs.

278
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Do you know what I saw in the stairwell?

279
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,960
What?

280
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,080
A big sign with a topless woman on it.

281
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,200
How scary and obscene.

282
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,120
And then?

283
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,216
Then,

284
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
the next day I wiped it off.

285
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,679
But still, my home got burglarized.

286
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Fortunately, I was working overnight
at the company that day.

287
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,443
Or else,

288
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:57,600
what if that burglar covets my beauty?

289
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,840
At least you are fine. What a luck.

290
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,240
Luck my foot.

291
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,144
Stingy man.

292
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,440
Why do I tell you all this?

293
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,799
What's there to say about all this?

294
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,256
I'm telling you this
because you're interesting.

295
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,376
Don't laugh.

296
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,320
No. You're not interesting.

297
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,440
You're interesting only with me.

298
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,559
What? Don't do this trick to me.

299
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,799
I won't fall for it.

300
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,919
Do two people really have to be together?

301
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:12,519
Being together just
adds up to a lot of questions,

302
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:18,279
responsibilities, and burdens. All a hassle.

303
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:21,680
If things don't go well,
you might even break up.

304
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,559
After breaking up, you can't even be friends.

305
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,160
It'd be boring then.

306
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,079
Forget it if you don't think it through.

307
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm going home. You go to sleep.

308
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,839
You'll lock the door

309
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,039
from the inside later.

310
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,079
I'll leave after you knock on the door.

311
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,799
You care so much about me,

312
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,640
then why are you still leaving?

313
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,752
Think it through?

314
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,456

322
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,759
Seems like they've made up.

00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,039
Qi Yu returned Ling Weiyi's shoes.

324
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,799
Actually, I think it's a good thing.

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,680
You know, two people together
should always progress together.

326
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,279
You can't always live a life
like you're playing house.

327
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,336
Right?

328
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:12,039
The Weiji matter isn't going smoothly?

329
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,496
You caught me.

330
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,144
A bit.

331
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,960
If no one can make a breakthrough
on the proposal,

332
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,680
then no one can truly impress Mr. Xia.

333
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,200
But you know,

334
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,640
in fact, the marketing proposals
given by each bank are quite similar.

335
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,400
We've been stretched to the limit.

336
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,960
It's a deadlock.
Someone should come to break it.

00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,799
I've spent the afternoon thinking a lot,

338
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,319
but I still can't find a better way
to break the deadlock.

339
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,000
If I really can't secure Weiji,

340
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,599
then the competition for Bank President
for Jian branch is in jeopardy.

341
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,400
For the next few years, I could only remain

342
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,559
as the department manager.

343
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,240
Besides,

344
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,240
I do not want Xing Zhen
to be the Bank President.

345
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,799

I'm sorry, Mr. Ji.

00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,920
Give it to me, it's okay.

00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,319
Senior, that one is a flat white.

359
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,440
It's quite tasty.

360
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,279
During this period of time
when senior's mom is ill,

361
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,608
you have worked hard, Tu Xiaoning.

362
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:06,880
I've underestimated you.

363
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,839
The force is just right.
It can't be any stronger.

364
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,759
Right, Zhao Fanggang
just messaged me a moment ago.

365
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,960
He said the proposals
from Shentong and Guangming banks

366
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,160
have been clearly rejected.

367
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,039
Mr. Xia didn't show up in person,

368
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,759
just had finance sent the confirmation message.

369
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,640
Two less banks, that's good.

370
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,759
Mr. Ji, you're one step closer to success.

371
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,992
Then according to your theory,

372
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,359
I don't even need to prepare,
just relying on luck.

373
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,640
If I'm lucky, I might just
make it to the last round.

374
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,000
Some things are just like that.

375
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,359
This is called the law of attraction.

376
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,319
As long as you adjust your mood every day

377
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,640
and maintain in good shape,

378
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,519
good things will come to you.

379
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,480
For example?

380
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,160
For example, I see you need
to adjust your mood now,

381
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,160
so I come over to comfort you
to make you happy.

382
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,039
Does it count?

383
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,640
Of course.

384
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,000
Come on, let me massage you.

385
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,319
Relax.

386
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,880
Actually, in terms of adjusting your mood,

387
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,440
I can be considered your mentor.

388
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,079
What did you just say?

389
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,104
Mentor.

390
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,559
I've thought of an entry point.

391
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,799
Yes, Miss Fang.

392
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,319
Come on. I am in a good mood today.

393
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,640
Who hasn't had breakfast? Share some.

394
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,680
- Good morning, Jing.
- Thank you, Jing.

395
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Morning.

396
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,160
You sobered up pretty quickly.

397
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,680
Not like others,

398
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,920
who can't even
walk in a straight line after drinking.

399
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,839
Seems like you don't remember
anything from last night.

400
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,788
Last night?

401
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:21,472
What happened last night I should remember?

402
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:24,160
Let me think.

403
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,279
Right, I asked you
to remind me to change my code.

404
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,200
I've changed it when I left this morning.

405
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,256
Rao!

406
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,680
This is that client profile.

407
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,960
- Take a look.
- You scared me.

408
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,599
You really should go to the hospital

409
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,759
to check on your habit
of blacking out after drinking.

410
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,872
Who drinks if they don't want to black out?

411
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,359
Right, Miss Fang.
You can come directly to the branch to find me.

412
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,319
You have my business card, right?

413
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,079
Okay, then I'll wait for you.

414
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,160
Alright, bye.

415
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:18,888

you entered already exists]

00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:24,736
Jing.

418
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:27,359
I marketed a client named Fang Xiaoyun.

419
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,240
[Inactivated Corporate Client List]
But this Miss Fang is in the system,

420
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
listed under Yao Jia of the Division Two.

421
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,480
It's been two years, and even
the admission hasn't been done.

422
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,519
There's also no corporate information.

423
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,920
So what should I do?

424
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,359
As usual, you need to fill out
an account transfer application.

425
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,839
Then transfer the profile from Yao Jia

426
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,896
over.

427
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,920
Hello, Yao Jia.
This is Tu Xiaoning from Division One.

428
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,680
I marketed a client today named Fang Xiaoyun.

429
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,319
[Fang Xiaoyun Inactivated]
I found that you opened an account for her

430
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,880
two years ago, but it has never been activated.

431
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,720
Could you make the account transfer today?

432
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,160
Transferring my client in the system?
You're snatching my client openly.

433
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,559
I can't make a decision.
Let the leader make the call.

434
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,759
It's been two years…

435
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,079
Openly snatching a client.

436
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,839
Others might think
the Division One is all bandits.

437
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,640
Aren't you ashamed if this gets out?

438
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
A client who hasn't been
activated for two years,

439
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,400
why couldn't I contact her?

440
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,279
Didn't you just hear Rao Jing?

441
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,656
Tu Xiaoning.

442
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:28,759
Do you really think it doesn't matter

443
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,000
if the dirty things you've done get out?

444
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,039
If the bank finds out, do you think
they would tolerate you?

445
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,079
What dirty things have I done?

446
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,759
I play by the rules.
Why wouldn't they tolerate me?

447
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,440
You play by the rules?

448
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,279
Tang, you're talking mean.
It's not even your client.

449
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,000
Feeling bad doesn't
justify lashing out at others.

450
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,319
Wait. It's early in the morning,

451
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:00,920
why are you getting mad?

452
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,240
As long as the Bank President finds out,

453
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,119
he will surely dismiss her to save senior.

454
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,960
How dare you to hook up

455
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,200
to the department manager!

456
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,319
Yuheng, take a seat.

457
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,880
I've been thinking about
the Weiji matter again.

458
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,359
Originally, Weiji company's
business footprint was in the United States.

459
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,720
The domestic resort project

460
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,039
actually just started three years ago,

461
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,759
but the development
is far less than the United States.

462
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,000
So I think for Mr. Xia,

463
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,359
compared to how much capital can be raised,

464
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,519
it would be more important

465
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,799
to have a financial expert

466
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,599
who understands the domestic market environment

467
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,519
to help him plan how to spend the money.

468
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,640
Do you have any suitable candidate?

469
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,599
My university mentor, Jia Ziqing.

470
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,839
[Jia Ziqing]
Mr. Jia is a leading economist in the country.

471
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,960
If we could invite Mr. Jia

472
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,720
to make a financial proposal
for Weiji company's resort project,

473
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,319
I think Mr. Xia might be interested.

474
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,920
It's a good idea.

475
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,680
But regarding your mentor…

476
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,119
I'll go to Jinghai over the weekend
to invite him in person.

477
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,128
We need to act quickly.

478
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,480
We can't let Weiji slip away.

479
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,799
Understood.

480
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,640
I'm really pissed off.

481
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,039
Why would I be mad at Tu Xiaoning?

482
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,039
I should impress my senior instead,

483
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,279
to make him see my value.

484
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,319
Hello, Mr. Jia? It's Yuhui.

485
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,440
I'm doing quite well.

486
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,480
It's just the usual work at the bank.

487
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,160
It's all no trouble for you.

488
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,359
Yes, I have something I'd like to ask you.

489
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,839
Are you available this Saturday?

490
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,976
I will visit you in Jinghai.

491
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:11,519
Okay, see you then.

492
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,480
What's the matter?

493
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,008
Mr. Xing came over with Yao Jia,

494
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:34,440
to argue with you
about account transfer from Yao Jia.

495
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:38,376
Let's go.

496
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,200
The tea here is still the best.

497
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,079
No wonder the leaders
like to come here for tea.

498
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,480
Where did you buy it?

499
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,960
Mr. Xing, this is the tea bag from our company.

500
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:13,200
Mr. Ji, I know your department
is performing very well right now.

501
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,880
But I wonder
if the Development Department Division One

502
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,240
might go too far.

503
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,519
This morning, Tu wanted

504
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,799
to transfer our Yao Jia's client account.

505
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,000
Is this a bit inappropriate?

506
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,119
I didn't know it.

507
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,200
Tu, how did you acquire this client?

508
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,960
It was Mr. Liu from Longhu Glass,
whom I've marketed to before.

509
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,720
He's also worked with Miss Fang.

510
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,960
He is an upstream client of Miss Fang.

511
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,160
Later, Miss Fang found out

512
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,839
that the deposit proposal
I had designed for Mr. Liu was quite good,

513
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,240
she was very interested,
so she arranged to talk with me about it.

514
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,599
Then, we signed
a letter of intent to cooperate.

515
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,240
Can you have some shame?

516
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,880
Making client poaching sound so nice.

517
00:31:58,304 --> 00:32:01,984
Actually, this client

518
00:32:01,984 --> 00:32:04,640
belongs to Yao Jia.

519
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,799
You accessed the client information

520
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,480
without giving advance notice.

521
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,720
This is against the rules.

522
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,480
Mr. Ji, striving for performance is fine.

523
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,200
But anyway,

524
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,160
should you leave some opportunities
for other departments?

525
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:25,640
I really can't understand you, Mr. Xing.

526
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,599
According to the rules of our bank,

527
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,160
if a client has not been
activated within a year,

528
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,400
then he should be called a new client

529
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,799
in the credit system.

530
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,359
Tu got the business herself.

531
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,839
How did it become poaching your clients?

532
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,960
And you've taken the trouble to come
to Development Department Division One.

533
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:47,920
Is that how you do business?

534
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,680
Well, since you mentioned it,

535
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,279
let's not have infighting among us.

536
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,279
Tu, make a phone call to that client.

537
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,359
While we are all here,
let the client choose for herself.

538
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,584
If the client

539
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,920
wants that Mr. Yao from Division Two
to take over her request,

540
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,240
then we will give this client back to her.

541
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,360
Okay.

542
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,759
Fine, just transfer it.

543
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:27,599
I give it to you. Such a small account client,
Division Two doesn't want it.

544
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,680
Mr. Xing.

545
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,319
You can't dig out any further

546
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,519
with this kind of client for two years.

547
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,359
Why would you keep her then?

548
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,119
Since they want her,

549
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,480
just give her to them generously.

550
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,920
Let's see what they can do

551
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,680
with such a client.

552
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,440
Go back. Go back.

553
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,920
Go back to work.

554
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,880
Okay, Mr. Xing. I'll get busy.

555
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,280
Mr. Xing, is there anything else?

556
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,360
Mr. Ji, there's a conflict
among our subordinates,

557
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,760
don't let it affect our friendship.

558
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,519
Bro, look.

559
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:33,719
I have now given you the client.

560
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,559
And I've given you face.

561
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,440
Now you tell me.

562
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,519
How are you getting on with Weiji?

563
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,592
Weiji Company?

564
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,719
To be honest,

565
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,559
I haven't met this Mr. Xia yet.

566
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,280
Actually, just like you said.

567
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,960
Weiji Company is nothing more than a client.

568
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,840
It's not like we can't do this job

569
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,760
if we don't sign this contract, right?

570
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,800
Let me tell you. Both of us should be relaxed.

571
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,719
Don't put too much pressure on yourself,
do you agree?

572
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:17,239
So you are coming not only
for the account transfer,

573
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,520
but also asking me to give up on Weiji.

574
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,239
Not really.

575
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:24,639
Okay, I'll think it over.

576
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,679
If Mr. Jia agrees

577
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,559
to be the financial consultant
for Weiji Company,

578
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:32,480
then Weiji will surely cooperate with us.

579
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,519
I agree with you on this point.

580
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,840
It seems that we

581
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,400
still have a connection.

582
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,519
Anything else?

583
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,199
I have an appointment with Mr. Jia
to visit him at school this Saturday.

584
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:47,559
If you're going this weekend,
let's go together.

585
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,639
You and I are in the same department.

586
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:55,440
It would be weird
to go on the same day yet split up.

587
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,639
Okay, I will arrange the tickets.

588
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,644
I'll send you the booking information later.

589
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:02,656
Senior.

590
00:36:02,656 --> 00:36:08,159
Do you think
there are too many people in our department?

591
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,880
The quality of a department lies in
its excellence, not in its numbers.

592
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,079
I understand you. You like challenges,

593
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,039
but things must be done openly and honestly.

594
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,360
Tang, if you understand me, you should know

595
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,320
what I hate the most is tattling.

596
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,679
We have clear rules and regulations.

597
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:29,760
We do things by the rules.

598
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,360
No, that's not what I mean.

599
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,679
I mean, like some people, Tu Xiaoning.

600
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,079
She made others mad
because she poached clients from others

601
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,760
for a mere one million in deposits.

602
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,552
It's really disgraceful.

603
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:45,199
Hello, Miss. Ji.

604
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,159
Tang, if you are in bad mood,

605
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,320
you can vent it out.

606
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,599
But this morning, in the office,

607
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,280
you've already picked on Tu.

608
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,400
Now we are off work.

609
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,880
And you still tattled Tu to Mr. Ji.

610
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,360
I do think this is inappropriate.

611
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,000
Jing, I didn't tattle her.

612
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,800
I was just telling the truth.

613
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,880
Well, things like poaching clients

614
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,199
simply do not exist,

615
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,280
so we don't need to talk about it.

616
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,679
For a mere one million in deposits?

617
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,880
Striving wholeheartedly
to bring in deposits for the bank

618
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,639
is one of our most important jobs.

619
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,559
And for so many years, Xu Li, Mr. Zhao and I

620
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,840
have been bringing in deposits and taking out loans
for banks to accumulate resources.

621
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,392
Right, Mr. Zhao?

622
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,880
Well, if Tu didn't contact this client,

623
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,599
and Yao Jia left it inactivated
for several years,

624
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,039
then this client would be lost.

625
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,800
Alright.
If there's nothing else, let's call it a day.

626
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,920
We don't get paid for working overtime
in the underground garage.

627
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,488
Then I'm leaving.

628
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,544
Then I'm leaving too.

629
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,880
Do you know how to fix electric meters?

630
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,559
I'm asking if you can fix electric meters.

631
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,119
The electric meter is broken?

632
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,000
It's broken, keeps tripping recently.

633
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,760
Then I tried fixing it myself, but failed.

634
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,000
If you are available this weekend,

635
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,128
come and help me fix it.

636
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:39,320
Why come to me but not an electrician?

637
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,344
Any problem?

638
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,824
Alright, I just don't want you to waste money.

639
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:51,880
See you on the weekend.

640
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:59,800
Mr. Xing didn't make things difficult for you
over the account transfer matter again

641
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
and cause you trouble, right?

642
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,392
No.

643
00:39:03,392 --> 00:39:04,480
That's good then.

644
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,639
Actually, he's well aware
of the rights and wrongs.

645
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,000
In the future, you still need
to fight for what you should at work.

646
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,519
Otherwise, all your efforts
will end up benefiting others.

647
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,079
Yao Jia wasn't cooperative

648
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:18,360
because she saw the hope of doing business.

649
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,000
If you let this kind of thing happen once,

650
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,784
from then on, they'll take advantage
of you again and again.

651
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,159
Right. I've booked a business trip

652
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:30,000
to Jinghai after work on Friday.

653
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,760
With Tang Yuhui.

654
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,280
Mr. Jia is also her mentor.
She contacted him first,

655
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,360
so going together would be more appropriate.

656
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,760
I didn't say anything.

657
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,039
Ji, you are being very cautious now.

658
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But don't worry,
I've also booked a ticket for you.

659
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,960
What do you mean? Do I have to go too?

660
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,039
Wouldn't it be weird if the three of us go?

661
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:03,320
And Tang Yuhui is quite smart.

662
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,000
What if we get discovered?

663
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,440
Anyway, it's the weekend.

664
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,880
I'll show you around in Jinghai
when I'm done my work.

665
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,079
Actually, it's fine. I won't overthink it.

666
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,599
Alright, rest assured.

667
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,880
I've already arranged everything.

668
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,280
Just think of it as a short trip.
To get relaxed, okay?

669
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,559
Okay.

670
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,840
Let's go.

671
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,936
Can you still run?

672
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:33,224
This way, please. Welcome aboard.

673
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,239
Hello, do you need me to place your bag?

674
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,639
Yes.

675
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,792
Alright.

676
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:46,079
[Mr. Ji, you're being quite bold now.]

677
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,119
Mr. Ji, you're being quite bold now.

678
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,519
How dare you to buy tickets
for the same flight!

679
00:40:54,976 --> 00:40:57,064
Isn't it okay?

680
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,760
Aren't you afraid
of being discovered by Tang Yuhui?

681
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,199
It's okay. I want
to show you around my university.

682
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:27,800
Senior, when you went to discuss
the Zhouyang contract last time,

683
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,119
did you meet the old classmates from Jinghai?

684
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,800
Not really. I was a bit rushed last time.

685
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,599
Then, when we have free time these two days,

686
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,000
I'd like to meet the classmates.

687
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,599
Tomorrow is the weekend.
You can arrange your time freely.

688
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,559
If they are okay with it,

689
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:23,039
I can be the financial consultant
for this financing project.

690
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:25,320
That would be great.

691
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,880
Mr. Jia, thank you for helping us.

692
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,960
Mr. Jia, when you go to Star City,

693
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,039
senior and I will definitely take you around.

694
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:35,360
Okay, then I can count on you.

695
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,119
Are you guys going to get married soon?

696
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,480
Mr. Jia, don't make fun of me.

697
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,199
Why are you still so gossipy?

698
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,880
Back when we were in the school,

699
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,239
there were rumors about me and senior.

700
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,440
It was you who spread them then, wasn't it?

701
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,719
Mr. Jia, Tang and I
are just ordinary colleagues.

702
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,599
Yes, he is right.

703
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,519
We are now just ordinary colleagues.

704
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:04,960
He's shy.
Mr. Jia, please don't make fun of him.

705
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,864
I understand, Ji. About this,

706
00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:11,480
it's better for a man to take the initiative.

707
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,920
When you make a move,
be steady, ruthless, and accurate.

708
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,599
Otherwise, a good girl
can easily be taken by someone else.

709
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,199
- Wait.
- It's already this late.

710
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,559
As your mentor,

711
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,960
I should take you out for a meal.

712
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,800
But today is Saturday,
my grandson has early education class.

713
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,440
I have to pick him up.

714
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,440
We'll have to gather
wait until I get to Star City again.

715
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,800
Okay, Mr. Jia. You go ahead.

716
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,400
We'll wait for you in Star City.

717
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,840
- Okay.
- Bye.

718
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,864
See you.

719
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Today's not the best time.

720
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,519
When Mr. Jia goes to Star City,

721
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,000
I'll explain to him what's going on between us.

722
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,719
In fact, I think some of
what Mr. Jia said is quite right.

723
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,639
You must know
your future marriage partner thoroughly.

724
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,960
This is where we first met.

725
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,840
At that time, a large parcel fell from above.

726
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,912
Do you still remember it?

727
00:44:31,524 --> 00:44:36,599
[The Girl Climbing the Wall at Dawn]

728
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,760
Hurry up!

729
00:44:40,836 --> 00:44:44,492
[On Duty]

730
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,440
Xiaoning, he seems to be a student leader.

731
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,760
I saw it.

732
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,840
You need to hurry up.

733
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,039
Being ten minutes late
counts as skipping class.

734
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:05,160
Thank you.

735
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,312
This is my favorite egg-yolk puff.

736
00:45:09,312 --> 00:45:11,559
Take it as a thank-you gift. Thank you.

♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

738
00:45:31,272 --> 00:45:34,372
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

739
00:45:34,372 --> 00:45:39,532
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

740

♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

745
00:46:02,308 --> 00:46:06,532
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

746
00:46:06,532 --> 00:46:11,268
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

747
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,404
♫ To you and no one else ♫

748
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:19,236
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

750
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:24,588
♫ No one knows ♫

751
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,748
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

752
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:31,116
♫ I hope you know ♫

753
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:39,172
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

754
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:44,612
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

755
00:46:44,612 --> 00:46:51,364
