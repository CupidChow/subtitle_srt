[Episode 7]

32
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,799
Poor thing, you really have a hard life.

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,959
Little cutie, what are you going to do?

34
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,319
What's wrong, Dad?

35
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,840
Look how pitiful it is.

36
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,959
It used to be bullied
by the other fish in the big tank.

37
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,439
I had no choice but to move it
to this smaller tank.

38
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,719
But your mom always finds it troublesome.

39
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,439
She remembers to feed the fish
in the big tank but never feeds this one.

40
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,744
Look, it gets hungry every couple of days.

41
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:17,520
It's listless.

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
Your mom says she wants to give it away.

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,800
But I can't bear to, what should I do?

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,599
Xiaoning, please take it with you.

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,400
You're the most caring, aren't you?

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,560
I believe you will take good care of it.

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
Please take it with you.

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,120
I can visit it at your place
whenever I miss it.

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,159
Okay, I'll take it home later.

50
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,120
Really?

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,080
I will give you a bag of fish food, okay?

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,719
Take it now.

53
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,599
Dad, what's the rush?

54
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,400
I'll definitely take it with me.

55
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,199
If you're late, your mom
will have given it away.

56
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,560
Quick, take it now.

57
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,000
- Go.
- I haven't eaten yet.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,056
Go.

59
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,240
What? Why did you move the fish?

60
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,560
I was just about to feed the fish.

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,280
What fish? It's been given away.

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,319
Feed what? Feed…

63
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,960
I just bought the fish food, what do you mean?

64
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,759
You're really pitiable.

65
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,080
Xiaoning, I would like
to have a good talk with you

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,136
if you're willing.

67
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,080
What couple doesn't argue?

68
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,439
The young couple has a conflict,
a disagreement.

69
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,039
Isn't that normal?

70
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,039
If you two have decided to live together,

71
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,120
just give it your all and live well.

72
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,816
Give it to me.

73
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,439
Take it home.

74
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,439
We'll talk after we get home.

75
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,520
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

76
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,919
Look, actually, Ji is a pretty good kid.

77
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,439
He was worried Xiaoning
wouldn't sleep well last night.

78
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,600
He came over in the middle
of the night to bring things.

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,319
And he was worried about Xiaoning's mood.

80
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,519
He called and asked all sorts of questions.

81
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:28,079
As parents, sometimes we have to
give a gentle push.

82
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,160
Just like us back then.

83
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,800
If someone had lent us a hand back then,

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,879
we would have taken fewer detours.

85
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,959
Look at you, hogging all the nice words.

86
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,319
Don't I wish them well?

87
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,360
I think that if the two of them have issues,

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,040
that needs to be expressed.

89
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,160
Relying merely on currying favor
or putting on a peaceful facade

90
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,360
will definitely not be enough.

91
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,439
The matter has been broken down and dissected.

92
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,720
We need to clarify the issue.

93
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,600
What's that?

94
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,392
Dad, I want to have a private chat
with Xiaoning

95
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:00,544
to clarify the contradictions.

96
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:02,879
Could you help me?

97
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,279
You two have started private conversations.

98
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,959
Forming small cliques within the family, huh?

99
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,800
Last night, you and your daughter

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
talked until midnight, so enthusiastically.

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
You didn't include me.

102
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,759
Alright, don't be so jealous.

103
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's go tidy up our daughter's room together.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,079
I guess

105
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,839
she probably won't come back to stay tonight.

106
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,560
You'll handle the feeding from now on.

107
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,680
I'll clean the tank and change the water.

108
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,759
The fish is mine. I can do all of this myself.

109
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,040
Since it's kept in our home,

110
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,199
it becomes our shared fish.

111
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,920
Just now, while carrying the fish tank,

112
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,040
you said you had something to tell me.
Go ahead.

113
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,519
I know you hold some dissatisfaction with me
regarding Zhao Fanggang's issue.

114
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,120
I want to explain it.

115
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,199
Regarding the blind date loan, although
Zhao Fanggang had no decision-making power,

116
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,560
he bears responsibility for lack of oversight.

117
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,519
The impact of the client
carrying a knife was significant.

118
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,040
Mr. Xing finally caught our mistake.

119
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,040
The Bank President also needs
to give an explanation to all levels.

120
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,399
Zhao Fanggang's issue
must be dealt with seriously.

121
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,680
Otherwise, it would be indefensible.

122
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,959
How do you plan to handle it?

123
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,639
Either transfer him out or demote him.

124
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,079
Sir, you warned me last time.

125
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,079
Mr. Xing from Division Two has always wanted
to catch our Division One's weaknesses.

126
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,600
You asked me to go to Development Department
Division One.

127
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,040
Isn't it to turn the situation around and save
Development Department Division One?

128
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,279
Handling him is to preserve Division One.

129
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,560
Xing

130
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,600
might have reported you to the higher-ups.

131
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,480
If that's the case, the situation might become
even more difficult to manage.

132
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,639
If you want to keep
Development Department Division One

133
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,759
and want it to have a better development,

134
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,800
relying only on myself is far from enough.

135
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,399
I need him, and he has the capability.

136
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,079
Sir, I do have an idea.
Why don't you listen to it?

137
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,120
Go ahead.

138
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,519
Perhaps we can administer a small punishment
as a warning to others.

139
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,759
Give him a department-wide notice of criticism

140
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,360
and take away a few of his clients.

141
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,759
Everyone in banking knows

142
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,839
the importance of major loan accounts
to an Account Manager.

143
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,360
Maybe this way can satisfy the public.

144
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,680
Deduct 30% of the bonus this month

145
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,839
and transfer five clients.

146
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,560
Additionally, the matter
of Li Xiang clocking in.

147
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,360
I was not intentionally making
things difficult for him.

148
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,160
Every time I come early in the morning.

149
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,576
When I come, no one is around.

150
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:45,632
If this continues,

151
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,759
I don't even know how
to continue working with Dairui.

152
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
Please don't be angry. I do understand
your dissatisfaction.

153
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,680
On behalf of Mr. Li,
I offer my apologies to you.

154
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,392
You came by car early today, right?

155
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,639
Yes.

156
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,360
In that case, tomorrow I will have Mr. Li

157
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,639
send you a co-branded gas card from our bank

158
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,959
as a token of apology.

159
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,128
- Okay.
- Take care.

160
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,000
So, that client was very angry
and wanted to file a complaint against him.

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,639
Account Managers in charge of loans
are rarely complained about.

162
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,600
If it really happens,

163
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,279
he may be facing a transfer.

164
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,639
You can say these things to me

165
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,680
and also say it to everyone else.

166
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,000
You are just like this.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,399
I know, indiscreet.

168
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,120
Since you've told me,

169
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,399
does it mean…?

170
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,240
I will definitely work hard
to change these bad habits.

171
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,559
Effort is something you tell yourself.

172
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,879
I only look at the results.

173
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,720
What are you laughing at?
Aren't these your own words?

174
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:58,120
I will do what I say.

175
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,320
But I hope you do the same.

176
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,879
I do the same, what's with me?

177
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,639
I hope you won't give up
on this relationship easily.

178
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,360
My mom told me

179
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,360
every relationship had a period of time
that required mutual adjustment.

180
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,159
Although we haven't registered our marriage,

181
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,416
we are still in this relationship.

182
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,600
It's normal for some contradictions to arise.

183
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,919
I'm not the kind of person
who gives up when facing difficulties.

184
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,920
Rest assured.

185
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,919
Now that it has come to our home,

186
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,152
should we give it a name?

187
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:43,208
Sure.

188
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,720
Let's call it Xiaobai.

189
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,159
Xiaobai?

190
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,320
Does it not sound good?

191
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,080
What if it turns out to be a little girl?

192
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,240
How about Nemo?

193
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,519
Alright, I'll go with your suggestion.

194
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,519
You've named it.

195
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:06,279
So you'll be in charge of changing the water
and cleaning the tank from now on.

196
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,552
No problem.

[Dairui Bank]
Besides following up with the high-quality clients,

198
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,200
for the next three months,
I hope our main focus at work

199
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
will still be on marketing to new clients.

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,519
The list of recommended clients

201
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,960
has already been sent to everyone's work email
before the meeting.

202
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,176
You're not feeling well?

203
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,552
Mr. Zhao.

204
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:52,000
Are you talking to me?

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,024
Marketing to new clients.

206
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,559
Clocking in at 8:30 in the morning
made me a bit nervous.

207
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,840
I didn't get good rest last night.

208
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,600
But you're right to remind me.

209
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,960
It seems I have caught a cold.

210
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,120
I'll have to take some medicine later.

211
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,759
If I don't get enough sleep,

212
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,832
I just can't bring myself
to do anything energetically.

213
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,544
Each team should promptly familiarize
themselves with the client information.

214
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:17,632
If the clients you're handling

215
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:20,879
have a new loan request, remember to follow up.

216
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,240
You can come to my office
if you have any questions or ideas.

Mr. Fang, please hear me out.

219
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,559
The loans we offer at Dairui

220
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,720
are already much lower than our competitors'.

221
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,039
Hello? Mr. Fang? Hello?

222
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,792
Mr. Zhao.

223
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,919
Any instructions?

224
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,120
You take charge of the Chenyue Group's project.

225
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
They currently have a loan requirement.

226
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,360
Several other banks are also competing for it.

227
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,200
But I believe they will be more interested

228
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,228
in the terms offered by Dairui.

229
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,120
A big group, a good opportunity.

230
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,456
Can't do it.

231
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,039
Mr. Ji, about the Chenyue project,

232
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,159
it seems Jing has been following up
on it all along.

233
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,320
But I'm not very clear
about the specific progress.

234
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Mr. Ji, just a sincere reminder.

235
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,159
Development Department Division One is not
the Internal Control Compliance Department

236
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,240
and you're not here to inspect the work.

237
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,720
Relax your brow a bit and loosen up
when getting along with others, okay?

238
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,919
Indeed, it's time to change the approach.

239
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,679
Zhao, coffee.

240
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,776
Thank you.

241
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,664
Tasty.

242
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,639
Tu, your skill has reached a new level.

243
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,600
If one day you are also targeted
by that person with the last name Ji,

244
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,120
you could just start your own coffee shop

245
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,879
and get Jing to approve a loan for you.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,120
Zhao, do you plan to keep at odds with Mr. Ji?

247
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,039
It's not that I want to keep at odds with him.

248
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,679
He's the one who tripped me up first.

249
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,799
You'd better not side with him.

250
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,600
I'm not siding with anyone.

251
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,600
What I mean to say is
that one's work is their own.

252
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,799
What if…?

253
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,200
There's no such thing as what if.

254
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,080
I haven't been late, left early,
or gone missing.

255
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,799
At most, I've just refused unsuitable work.

256
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:30,320
Could he fire me just for that?

257
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,120
Do you think I'm a fool?

258
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,320
I see through Ji Yuheng.
He targets me in every way.

259
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,120
How could he kindly entrust
Chenyue's project to me?

260
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
Who knows where he's dug a hole
waiting for me to jump in?

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,919
Then he'll frame me with a charge

262
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,159
and it would seem only natural to send me away.

263
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,799
Now, the more I do, the more mistakes I make.

264
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,399
It's best not to do anything at all.

265
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,080
I don't think he's targeting you.

266
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,639
He's not as bad as you say.

267
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,039
He's just very direct
in the way he does things.

268
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,176
He doesn't consider others' feelings much
when he speaks.

269
00:14:58,176 --> 00:14:59,200
He doesn't speak nicely.

270
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,216
But he is a good person, absolutely.

271
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,840
You say you're not siding with him.

272
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,200
Tu, it seems like

273
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,559
you know our Mr. Ji very well.

274
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,120
I'm just guessing.

275
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,039
We all work in the same department.

276
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,399
Creating a toxic atmosphere
doesn't benefit him, right?

277
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,360
Haven't you been in touch
with Chenyue? You do it.

278
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,159
What I do or don't do,

279
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,440
do I need you to arrange it for me?

280
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,120
Jing, if you're going to do it,
can you take me with you?

281
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,559
I'm willing to do anything.

282
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,679
I just want to learn more about the business.

283
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,799
The exam is coming up soon.

284
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,600
If I don't pass this time, I'll have
no hope of becoming permanent.

285
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,600
You want to make a leap in such a short time?

286
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,799
Let me tell you, don't be in a hurry to achieve
success. You need to be steady and sure-footed.

287
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,159
Otherwise, you can only learn
through making mistakes in the future.

288
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,399
If you are sarcastic towards me,
just be sarcastic.

289
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,879
Why demotivate Tu's enthusiasm?

290
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,639
Is there something wrong
with wanting to learn from you?

00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,360
I'm just telling her the plain truth.

292
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,320
There are no shortcuts in the workplace.

293
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,639
Don't try to run before you've learned to walk.

294
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,639
What if you fall on your face, right?

295
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,759
Let me tell you one more thing.

296
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,080
As long as you are capable enough,

297
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,320
no one can push you out, got it?

298
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,792
That's hard to say. Even the upright fear
the plots of the petty.

299
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:14,960
According to what you're saying,

300
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,440
it seems rather simple
how bad that petty person is.

301
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,840
It should be easy
to catch his weak spots, right?

303

Rao Jing, do you actually wish
to see me eliminated by Ji Yuheng?

304
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,759
It would be great for me to leave
a vulnerability for you to exploit.

as the sly bird that catches the worm.

That's quite a wishful thinking.

307
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,639
Is it even necessary to reveal such thoughts?

Doesn't look the same as before.

351
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,039
Try this, just grilled.

352
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,672
Everyone, eat while it's hot.

353
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,240
These chili peppers aren't bad, pretty sweet.

354
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,319
They have a sort
of beautifying and nourishing flavor.

355
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,799
When we went to the supermarket
to buy groceries,

356
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,464
Qi Yu said you loved grilled chili peppers.
We chose them one by one.

357
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,799
I also like supermarkets.

358
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,799
Why didn't you push it over to me?

359
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:09,568
Everyone's here.

360
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:12,000
- Let's all toast together to Qi Yu.
- Okay.

361
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He was supposed to be the main character today.

362
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,119
But he ended up being busy until now.

363
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,319
You've worked hard.

364
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,759
I'm really sorry.

365
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,559
I am currently driving for the boss.

366
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,119
On call 24 hours, can't drink alcohol.

367
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,559
I'll just have water instead of alcohol then.
You guys enjoy your drinks.

368
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
What are you doing here if you can't drink?

369
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,319
Come on, let's drink.

370
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,640
What about you and Ji Yuheng?

371
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,079
Any developments between you two
after the pre-wedding party last time?

372
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,319
I can feel it. He likes you.

373
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,039
It's just old classmates meeting up.
There's not much interaction.

374
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,559
Could you tell them for me?

375
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,664
Okay, do you remember?

376
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:04,640
Back in school, you loved
watching us play basketball.

377
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,319
It was the same bunch of guys.

378
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,400
Being able to gather together
after all these years.

379
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,519
Each one's basketball skills have gotten worse.

380
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,559
But their mouths have gotten sharper.

381
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:21,720
Be careful.

382
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,920
Okay.

383
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,599
Come join us, Lu.

384
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,240
Just like before,
have Xiaoning buy water for us.

385
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,279
Xiaoning is buying water for Lu,
and you want to mooch too.

386
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,920
You guys have fun, I'm leaving first.

387
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,968
Xiaoning.

388
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,928
I'm sorry.

389
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:46,319
Last year, on your birthday,
I was supposed to come back and propose.

390
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,960
But at that time, I was focused
on improving myself, continuing my studies.

391
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:54,400
But I've never let go of our relationship.

392
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,119
And I've never done anything to wrong you.

393
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,440
You don't need to explain these to me.

394
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,079
Nor is there anything to apologize to me for.

395
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,720
I know I've hurt you.

396
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,359
I also know we can't go back to the past.

397
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,880
But Xiaoning, have you ever thought about it?

398
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,599
The feelings between us
have truly existed for so many years.

399
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,759
I believe you haven't completely let go either.

400
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,720
Otherwise, someone with conditions
as good as Ji Yuheng's who likes you,

401
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,759
how could you not accept him?

402
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,839
That's my business,
it has nothing to do with you.

403
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:29,440
Fine, let's not talk about him.

404
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,960
If this relationship wasn't supposed
to be kept secret,

405
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,799
why would I waste my precious time here
nagging at you?

406
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,960
Let's talk about what's between us.

407
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,079
There's even less need
to talk about our matters.

408
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,096
There's nothing good to talk about.

409
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,359
It seems the wound on your arm
is almost healed.

410
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,200
The injury wasn't very serious
in the first place.

411
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,920
Now it's almost healed.

412
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,319
Isn't your Development Department
Division One a bit unsettled?

413
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,160
I heard you and Zhao Fanggang
had a quarrel in the office.

414
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,359
But the matter has already been resolved.

415
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:19,920
This time there were indeed some issues
in my management.

416
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,519
I assure you that similar situations
will not occur again.

417
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,079
The problems with Division One
have been longstanding.

418
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,599
Having you take over was putting you
in a tough spot to begin with.

419
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,559
But I still want to remind you.

420
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:37,160
Division One isn't the same
as the Internal Control Compliance Department.

421
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,400
What's needed is teamwork.

422
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,680
Only when people are united
can the team be led better.

423
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,560
I understand your meaning.

424
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,519
Someone has said
something similar to me before.

425
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,920
With age comes the love to ramble a bit,
don't find it annoying.

426
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,960
Of course not.

427
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,480
Qi Yu, do you have the nerve
to call yourself a driver?

428
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,000
You wrecked my car, it's quite funny.

429
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,112
Have some water first.

430
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,119
Lost, I'm not playing anymore.

431
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,519
I'm going back, I'm leaving now.

432
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,680
Slow down.

433
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Xiaoning.

434
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,079
I'm coming.

435
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,400
Help me watch over it.

436
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,680
Xiaoning.

437
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,319
Are you okay?

438
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,096
Weiyi drank too much.
You guys continue playing.

439
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:57,200
I'll take her home first.

440
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
- I'll take her home.
- I want to go home.

441
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,720
I'm driving, haven't had a drink.

442
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,519
Alright, hand her bag over to me.

443
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,920
Okay, go home.

444
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,176
Hello, Mr. President.

445
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:15,976
Right now? It's not far from here.

446
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,319
Okay, I'll be there right away.

447
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,799
You go ahead, I'll take her.

448
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:22,920
Weiyi likes to sleep on her back.

449
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,960
If she vomits, it's easy to choke.

450
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,039
Also, give her a cup of honey water
before she goes to sleep.

451
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,279
Don't worry.

452
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,799
She is fine after drinking too much
when you're not around.

453
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,888
It's okay.

454
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,240
- Shall I take you?
- Gone home.

455
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,240
Go.

456
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,000
Slow down, go.

457
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,319
Alright, help me keep an eye on things.

458
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,799
Wait a moment, your phone, Xiaoning.

459
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,720
Give it to me, rest assured.

460
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,960
Okay, send a message when you get home.

461
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,720
Sir, I'll wait with you a little longer.

462
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,960
It will probably take some time
for Qi to come over.

463
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,640
No need, we don't do this after working hours.

464
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,079
Today I invited you out as a fishing buddy.

465
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,960
If you do this, how can I dare
to invite you again next time?

466
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,920
Okay, I'll head back first.

467
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,104
Hurry back.

468
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,960
I'm leaving, Sir.

469
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,119
- Drive slowly on the road.
- Okay.

470
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,359
I'm going first, Sir.

471
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,256
I'm going home.

472
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,572
Go home.

473
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Hello.

474
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,880
Hello, Xiaoning, are you about to finish?

475
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,599
I'll go to pick you up now.

476
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,960
No need, I can go back by myself.

477
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,839
It's so late already. It's convenient
for me to go and pick you up.

478
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,079
Really no need, you are not presentable now.

479
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,000
Ling Weiyi drank too much.
I'll take her home first.

480
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,136
I won't talk anymore.

481
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,640
Not presentable.

482
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:59,200
[Dad]

483
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,519
Hello, Dad, it's me.

484
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,440
Do you know where Ling Weiyi's home address is?

485
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,519
I'm going to pick up Xiaoning.
Could you please send it to me?

486
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,176
The car has arrived.

487
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:12,440
It's here, the car is here, let's go.

488
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Come on.

489
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,759
Come on, mind your head.

490
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,816
Slow down.

491
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:23,039
Thank you for hailing a cab for us.

492
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,944
We can go back by ourselves,
no need for you to take us.

493
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,119
It's too late now.

494
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,480
It's not safe for the two
of you girls, let's go.

495
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,920
- I'm telling you.
- Oh my god.

496
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,599
Star City just has no principles at all,
not like me.

497
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,960
- Just send us here.
- I'm different.

498
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Thank you for taking us back.

499
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,720
- Thanks.
- You can go back now.

500
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,440
She's already drunk to this state.

501
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,592
Maybe I should stay…?

502
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,480
Sorry, are you okay?

503
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,680
You can take off your coat.

504
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,000
I'll wash it and return it to you.

505
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,599
If you bring it over, that's fine.

506
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:09,039
I'll send it to you via local express.

507
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,144
Then there's no need.

508
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,960
You go. I'm afraid she might
vomit on you again.

509
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,784
- Okay then, be careful.
- Alright.

510
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:20,000
- Watch out she might vomit on you.
- Okay.

511
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,759
- Be careful.
- Slow down.

512
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,079
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

513
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,839
I knew you did it on purpose.

514
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,200
All I did was vomit trash onto trash.

515
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,920
Come on, drink some more with me.

516
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,720
So this is the reason
for not being presentable.

517
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,400
Xiaoning, I won't leave for now.

518
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,759
If you need anything, just call me.

519
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,599
Being swept out of the house like this now,

520
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,079
it's too embarrassing to be seen like this.

521
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,400
A colleague from Dairui now shows up.

522
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,519
I'm even more unpresentable.

523
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,839
Weiyi, I am right at your doorstep.

524
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,240
Call me if you need anything.

525
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,319
Let's drink.

526
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,759
Still drinking? Drink less.

527
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,039
Drink a little bit?

528
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,319
Come on, have a drink with me.

529
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,359
He said we could

530
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,079
make video calls for over an hour every day.

531
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,920
You were there at that time, back me up.

532
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,319
And the result?
It turned out just as I predicted.

533
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:16,880
The long-distance relationship
is really just an illusion.

534
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,519
That's better than
a transnational relationship.

535
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,440
At least, the two of you
had an amicable breakup.

536
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,559
As for me, I was dumped.

537
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:31,119
Yeah, it seems you were more miserable.

538
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,759
No, my situation is worse than yours.

539
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,720
Look at Lu Sijing.

540
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,799
Just like the big moon in tonight's night sky,

541
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,680
he's clearly a scumbag.

542
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,400
Leaving you with no illusions
so that you can give up hope.

543
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,279
But Qi Yu, both before and after the breakup,

544
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:01,599
acts all pitiful,

545
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,920
which makes me feel…

546
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,599
I thought I had already healed
my wounds properly

547
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:15,960
and was ready to re-enter the dating scene.

548
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,440
He suddenly came back into my life.
Is he playing with me?

549
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,839
Alright, stop thinking about these things.

550
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,720
What's wrong?

551
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,304
Stop drinking.

552
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:45,319
What's the matter? Why are you crying?

553
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,599
Alright, stop crying.

554
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,880
Don't cry…

555
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,240
With all my money, I'm still not happy.

556
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,799
Who in the world is really happy after all?

557
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,240
Don't cry, you will be happy.

558
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,119
Men? The world is never short of men.

559
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:13,160
Don't be sad because of them.

560
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,279
When will I ever be able to forget him?

561
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,559
Every time he shows up lately,

562
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:27,799
I remember the way we first met.

563
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,200
You're Miss Ling, the one who placed the order,

564
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,640
searching all over for a layup coach?

565
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,000
Interesting.

566
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,680
It's the first time I see a photo
cheating people in the opposite direction.

567
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,160
You are Mr. Fu?

568
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,519
Fu Lei is my roommate.

569
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,240
He's busy today, so he asked me to teach you.

570
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,599
Don't worry, I am
a sports specialist student of our college.

571
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:55,359
My name is Qi Yu.
I've got your PE elective covered.

572
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,544
You try one first, let me see.

573
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:00,200
Okay, I'll try one.

574
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,376
Okay.

575
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,784
How is it?

576
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,519
Your three steps are quite random.

577
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,839
If I could do it,
why would I need you? You try.

578
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,400
Three-step layup? That's just one…

579
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,799
Aren't you doing the same thing as me?

580
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,079
Wait, hold on, you've brainwashed me.

581
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,799
This is too devilish.
I'll do a proper one for you.

582
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,000
How about it? Simple, right?

583
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,559
Qi Yu.

584
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,400
His three steps, you know,

585
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,759
each one stepped right into my heart.

586
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:07,960
Your love story is a bit like an idol drama

587
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
right from the beginning.

588
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,519
You didn't place a sparring session order.

589
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,639
That was a love order, a torment-love order.

590
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,440
Teach me, will you?

591
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,280
How can I be like you towards Lu Sijing

592
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,559
so that when I see Qi Yu,
I can also pretend he doesn't exist?

593
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,920
Teach me, will you?

594
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,920
One day, when you no longer love Qi Yu,
you won't feel painful anymore.

595
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,519
Then you can pretend he doesn't exist.

596
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,559
Maybe I also have to wait
for someone like Ji Yuheng.

597
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:49,000
No, it doesn't matter
whether you wait for that person or not.

598
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,880
It mainly depends on you.

599
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,920
You're upset now because you still
have Qi Yu in your heart.

600
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,199
Right, you've made up with Ji Yuheng,
haven't you?

601
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,920
I'd like to share something with you.

602
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,199
My mom said

603
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,920
marriage was about putting
two completely different people

604
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,719
together in a house.
Then they adapt to each other.

605
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:22,719
We're heading towards marriage.

606
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,599
I've decided to get to know him
all over again, to understand him.

607
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,079
Try to get through
this adjustment period a bit quicker.

608
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,920
That doesn't sound quite right.

609
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,280
Since the relationship is aimed at marriage,

610
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,400
you have to be in love.

611
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,039
You have to be head over heels,
love him, you must love him.

612
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,239
Love really is something
you can't seek but only encounter.

613
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,679
Should we just start our lives together first?

614
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,520
What if, as we live on,

615
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,280
love will arrive?

616
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,480
I'm waiting for you downstairs.

617
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,880
They probably won't run into each other, right?

618
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,519
After all, it's been a whole night.

619
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,639
He must have left a long time ago.

620
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,568
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

621
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:01,668
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

622
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:06,828
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

623
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:10,944
♫ My fast heartbeat ♫

624
00:37:10,944 --> 00:37:14,208
♫ Hide in a few seconds ♫

625
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:19,304
♫ When I close my eyes ♫

626
00:37:20,164 --> 00:37:23,428
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

627
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:26,916
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

628
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:30,828
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

629
00:37:31,492 --> 00:37:35,140
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

630
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:42,020
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

631
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,244
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

632
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:50,980
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

633
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,116
♫ To you and no one else ♫

634
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:58,948
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

635
00:37:58,948 --> 00:38:01,124
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

636
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:04,300
♫ No one knows ♫

637
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,624
It's almost finished.

638
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,079
You didn't really wait outside all night

639
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:25,119
without getting any sleep, did you?

640
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:28,199
Originally, I did want to go up.

641
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,960
But I saw that there was someone
standing guard below

642
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,119
and there was someone coming down from above.

643
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,400
Speaking of which, I really am unpresentable.

644
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,000
So, I could only wait below.

645
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,519
You mean Lu Sijing, right?

646
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,000
He was just worried that I wouldn't
be able to take Ling Weiyi home.

647
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,199
So he insisted on following.

648
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,599
But we quickly sent him on his way.

649
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,119
Ling Weiyi even threw up all over him.

650
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:53,360
But honestly,

651
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,280
if there's a situation
like this again next time,

652
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,800
you should let me pick you up.

653
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,360
Even if I don't show my face,

654
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,679
just think of it
as if you booked a private car.

655
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,039
Are you sleepy?

656
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,840
Should I drive?

657
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,599
It's okay, it's fine.

658
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,440
Keep me company and chat.

659
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,599
You can talk to me about the people
in the Development Department Division One.

660
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:22,159
You used to be the lobby manager.

661
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,920
You've met a lot of people and are certainly
better at judging them than I am.

662
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,199
You're trying to gather information
from me, aren't you?

663
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,599
Just say something
that won't breach your solidarity.

664
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,760
Let me know a little at least.

665
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,440
In the Development Department Division One,

666
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,519
Jing and Zhao must have the most clients.

667
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,800
But their styles are completely different.

668
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,159
Jing is decisive and efficient
in handling matters.

669
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:53,519
Courageous, competitive,
and highly experienced.

670
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,360
Anything she says she can do,
she will definitely succeed.

671
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,239
We have launched
a comprehensive payroll card service

672
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,320
for individual clients
enjoying pay-disbursing services.

673
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,119
I know your hospital has a lot of cooperation
with hospitals from other places.

674
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,599
So, in addition to providing basic services,

675
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,840
we can also offer everyone the enjoyment

676
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,440
of up to 12 inter-regional deposit
and withdrawal concession services per year.

677
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,800
We also provide a fast track
for personal loans to everyone.

678
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,760
Mr. Liu, I believe

679
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,320
that after you review these materials,

680
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,559
you will definitely choose our bank.

681
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,920
Because of her professionalism,

682
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,320
the precise market judgment she makes,
and her keen insight,

683
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,400
she can provide professional advice to clients

684
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,079
and also give them a strong sense of security.

685
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:36,760
But bank employees
influencing clients' thoughts

686
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,679
actually carries a great risk.

687
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:41,840
Jing, however, does not have
a single bad debt in her hands.

688
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,760
Please, go on.

689
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,519
Zhao, on the other hand,
is completely different.

690
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:55,000
Zhao is the type who can blend in with clients.

691
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,599
He makes clients trust him a lot.

692
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,719
Good news, the loan can be approved next week.

693
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,079
Bro, this loan wasn't easy to apply for.

694
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,199
Be frugal with it.

695
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,679
Don't waste that money treating me to a meal.

696
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,920
Okay, we'll get in touch tonight.

697
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,760
I have a call coming in right now.

698
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,039
Okay. Bye.

699
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,760
Ms. Li, how could I forget it?
It's Qi's birthday.

700
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,672
Okay, tell me. Just give your instructions.

701
00:41:24,672 --> 00:41:25,679
Having heard you say all this,

702
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,079
I feel like this person
lacks a sense of propriety.

703
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,440
What do you mean
by "lacks a sense of propriety"?

704
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,039
Mr. Ji, that's him making friends.

705
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,840
It's not like he's doing anything underhanded.

706
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,119
If he were to profit from it somehow,

707
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,000
wouldn't you be able to find out
with certainty through an audit?

708
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,760
You have a point there, making friends.

709
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,880
No problem at all.

711
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,599
Hello, may I ask if you have
any hangover medicine?

712
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,280
No. The pharmacy next door has it.

713
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,400
But they don't open until 8 a.m. tomorrow.

714
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,932
Eight o'clock, thank you.
