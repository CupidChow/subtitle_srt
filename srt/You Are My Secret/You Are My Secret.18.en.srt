He used to work at the Da Jiang Brewery.

Later, he also worked at the August Brewery.

I wonder if it's the problem
of the light or the electrical box.

I really have fallen for her.

45

It flickered again. I wonder if it's the problem
of the electrical box or the light.

46

You got to find a technician to fix it.

56
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,800
Actually, I should have learned more
about the shipyard beforehand.

57

It has nothing to do with you.

Moreover, you have never
had contact with Mr. Yang.

I have had contact him more than once,

61
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,520
yet, I didn't notice anything unusual.

62
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,800
It's still my own fault,

But it's the truth

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,319
that my capabilities are inferior over hers.

76

179
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,480
You'd better go have fun with them.

180
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,879
Being top in performance is an acknowledgment
of your work. You should go.

181
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,360
But I don't want to see you like this.

182
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,000
It's just one failure.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,720
Don't deny yourself so easily.

184
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,344
More than once. It has happened many times.

185
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,080
But it's okay.

186
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,120
Ling Weiyi and I will go shopping,

187
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,799
spend some money and buy some fun.

188
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,399
After all, I have your card.

189
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,080
Spend it freely. You don't need to inform me.

190
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,519
Don't come back too late, and be safe.

191
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,080
Don't worry. We are going
to sweep dad's grave tomorrow.

192
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,639
You should go home early too.

193
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,840
Go home early.

194
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,000
Hurry up and go.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,144
Bye.

196
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,039
- Let's go.
- Why don't you buy it?

197
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,960
- Don't buy it.
- A pair of shoes won't make you happy for a month,

198
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,159
but can make you happy for a week, right?

199
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,200
Three pairs can keep you happy for twenty days.

200
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,639
Spend less money.

201
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,519
I have to remind you.

202
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,759
Now you are with Qi Yu,
you should be more frugal.

203
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,879
You have to appropriately

204
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,279
consider the feelings
of us ordinary folks, right?

205
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,919
I have.

206
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,519
When I'm with him,
I always secretly pay the bill.

207
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:30,600
[Qi Yu]

208
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,360
Hold on. Hello.

209
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,240
Aquarium? What's up?

210
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
I want to have dinner with Xiaoning.

211
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,320
Why don't you come over?

212
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Okay then, wait for me.

213
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,248
I'll be right there.

214
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,840
He suddenly asked me to go to the aquarium.

215
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,159
Then you just eat by yourself.

216
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,279
I'll treat you to something tasty another day.

217
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,399
Okay, let me know when you get there.

218
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,039
Be safe on your way back, bye.

219
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,200
Weiyi, my exam results are out.

220
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,288
Passed?

221
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,879
You passed, Qi Yu? Really?

222
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,960
That's great, Qi Yu. I'm so happy for you.

223
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,360
I must give you a gift.

224
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,840
What should I give? Let me think.

225
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,712
How about I give you a motorbike, or a watch?

226
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:40,759
Or I could give you

227
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,368
the Chamberlain's favored basketball?

228
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:43,519
None.

229
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,672
Then what do you want?

230
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,936
Weiyi.

231
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,960
Sunrise, starry sky, and sunset.

232
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,919
I like whatever you like.

233
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,039
I want to watch them with you for a lifetime.

234
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,200
After I settle into my job,
let's go watch the sunrise together.

235
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,879
You're not trying to propose to me, are you?

236
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,072
I might not agree. It depends on my mood.

237
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,639
Thank you for bringing me here.

238
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,080
Today is a big day for you.

239
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,799
Let's take a photo here. Come on.

240
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,279
Record this moment. Yay!

241
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,848
You are up?

242
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,120
Where are you going to early in the morning?

243
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,360
I'm going for a run.

244
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,679
Police fitness tests have gotten
a lot tougher these years.

245
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,879
I need to train harder.

246
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,679
You sit every day at work.

247
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,559
Do you want to do exercise together?

248
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,624
No way.

249
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:13,679
Well, I'm heading out. You sleep a bit longer.

250
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,399
I'm hungry. Could you make breakfast for me?

251
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,639
Alright, stop it.

252
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,120
When I get back, I'll bring you breakfast.

253
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,200
Alright then.

254
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,232
I'm leaving.

255
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,112
Fruit.

256
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,080
You're awake?

257
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,399
Perfect. Help me think
if I've forgotten anything.

258
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,272
I've prepared wine, fruit, pastries, and…

259
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,360
I forgot to buy flowers.

260
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,039
Don't worry.
I already bought the flowers last night.

261
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,919
They're in the trunk.

262
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,120
No, Mom said Dad likes sunflowers.

263
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,919
I need to go buy sunflowers.

264
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,799
I bought the sunflowers. Don't worry.

265
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,880
Really?

266
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,080
Why are you so nice?

267
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,440
Otherwise, I'd go back on my word.

268
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,600
I have promised Mom.

269
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,440
Why am I so nice?

270
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,879
Even though I'm so nice,

271
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,120
you still keep your worries from me.

272
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,320
Don't move. I want to hug you for a while.

273
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,960
To be honest, the shipyard matter

274
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,480
and Tang Yuhui getting promoted
to Account Manager before me,

275
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,120
are quite a blow to me.

276
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,168
I might need some time

277
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:59,840
to recover.

278
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,960
I don't know why.

279
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,360
These things make me feel
particularly insecure right now.

280
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,080
I've been constantly surrounded
by negative emotions.

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,279
But I believe I will get better.

282
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,519
D-Don't you look down on me

283
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,519
or laugh at me.

284
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,600
Give me a hug.

285
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,440
Why would I laugh at you?

286
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,639
I just want to help you.

287
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,360
But I just don't know how.

288
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,639
I want to help you find

289
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,720
that fearless Tu Xiaoning.

290
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,759
Instead of who you are now.

291
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,824
I know.

292
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,360
It's dad's call.

293
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,559
Okay, I'll pack up the stuff.

294
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:07,272
Hello, Dad.

295
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,680
[Emergency Room]
Dad, Mom.

296
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,359
You are here.

297
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,160
What happened?

298
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,680
They are resuscitating inside.

299
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,240
Last night, the in-law
went to sleep earlier than usual.

300
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,960
We just assumed she wanted
to get up early this morning

301
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,720
and wait for you guys to pick her up.

302
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,839
We thought you were going to sweep the tomb,
so we didn't take it seriously.

303
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,319
But in the morning,

304
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,599
she had passed out.

305
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,359
It's all my fault
for not taking good care of her.

306
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,200
I should have been more careful.

307
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,559
Mom, don't say so.

308
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,720
You brought her here in time.

309
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,920
[During the Operation]

310
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,839
Doctor, how is my mom doing?

311
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,839
Come to my office.
I'll tell you in detail. Let's go.

312
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,000
Okay, I'll go.

313
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,640
Your mom's cancer cells
have spread significantly.

314
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,440
Based on the current symptoms,

315
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,559
they have already started
to metastasize to the brain.

316
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,680
The details will have to be confirmed
after we get the test results.

317
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,400
Get mentally prepared.

318
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,400
She might not hold on for much longer.

319
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,599
Doctor, then

320
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,359
how much longer can she hold on?

321
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,079
Optimistically, a month or two.

322
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,744
A month or two?

323
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,759
Can we switch
to a different chemotherapy drug then?

324
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,519
It's not going to be good
to try chemoradiation now.

325
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,240
Besides, her body can't take it.

326
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,784
Dr. Zhao.

327
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,640
Please.

328
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,920
Please try your best.

329
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,171
No matter how much money I spend,
no matter what I do,

330
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:19,240
I will cooperate with you.

331
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,344
We'll do our best.

332
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,119
Xiaoning, take this.

333
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,000
These are the medicines Mom usually takes.

334
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,624
You go to the hospital tomorrow
and ask the doctor

335
00:19:46,624 --> 00:19:49,880
which ones Mom can stop taking
and which ones she can continue.

336
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,039
Aren't you going?

337
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,599
I have a business trip to Jinghai tomorrow

338
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,039
to discuss the loan for Zhouyang Hotel.

339
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,799
I've already contacted
the finance manager at their headquarters.

340
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,759
Zhouyang?
Wasn't it assigned to the Division Two?

341
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes, but the Division Two
couldn't reach an agreement.

342
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,079
I happen to have some connections.

343
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:23,519
Taking down Zhouyang is not that easy.

344
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,720
Many banks are competing for it now.

345
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,599
If you dive right in,

346
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,400
you'll definitely be tied up for a long time.

347
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,359
Mom will be transferred
out of the ICU tomorrow,

348
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,559
and you're definitely the person
she wants to see the most.

349
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,359
I think it's best
if you spend more time with her.

350
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,839
I went to the hospital today.

351
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,519
The doctor told me
there's a special medicine abroad,

352
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,576
which might be effective.

353
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,880
But the cost of treatment
for a year is 800,000 yuan.

354
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,359
So I need to make money faster.

355
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,319
Can you come back before dinner?

356
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,559
I have a dinner tonight
and won't be back until after midnight.

357
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,632
Unlocked.

358
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,712
Locked.

359
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,039
No problem.

360
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,119
Just have Rao Jing
take charge of the coordination.

361
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,152
Okay.

362
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:18,112
Mom has been missing you,

363
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:20,492
always talking about you.

364
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,519
Drink less coffee.

365
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:26,920
You're already on your fourth cup today.

366
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,000
Don't worry. It's just for a boost.

367
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,080
I promise, this is the last cup.

368
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,160
You've lost a lot of weight
these past few days.

369
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,799
And your dark circles are quite prominent.

370
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,599
You can't keep overexerting yourself like this.

371
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,720
It's not good for your health.

372
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:44,200
Come in.

373
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,720
Mr. Ji. Xiaoning.

374
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,952
What's wrong?

375
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,599
Senior, I heard your mom is sick.

376
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,079
Which hospital is she at?

377
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,279
Let me see if any of my friends can help

378
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,720
and take good care of her.

379
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,279
No need. I've already arranged everything.

380
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:10,319
Then I'll bring some gifts over.

381
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,920
I appreciate your kindness.

382
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,640
My mom's condition hasn't been great lately.

383
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,200
The doctor said she needs rest.

384
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,319
Also, regarding those clients
you're following up with,

385
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,839
I hope you to make some progress
in the next week's meeting.

386
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,880
Mr. Ji, I'm leaving then.

387
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,079
The project will be
officially approved next week.

388
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,519
Okay.

389
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,240
Then I'm leaving.

390
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,328
Okay.

391
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,359
Xiaoning, I'll give you
the information of some clients later,

392
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,400
please prepare the materials for the meeting.

393
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,032
By the way, give it to me
before you go to bed tonight.

394
00:26:04,032 --> 00:26:05,760
I'll do it?

395
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,039
Why?

396
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,160
Don't you do it for Jing?

397
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,880
She's a manager, and now I am too.

398
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,200
As an assistant, shouldn't you do such work?

399
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,839
Not all managers are the same.

400
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,039
Jing is my mentor.

401
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,200
It's my job to do this for her.

402
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,839
But I have no obligation to do this for you.

403
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,200
But didn't you just hear what my senior said?

404
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,160
He said I need to focus on the key projects.

405
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,000
I heard it. Keep it up!

406
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,119
Well done.

407
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,039
For someone like her, don't respect her at all.

408
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,160
Tomorrow, I'll have the property management
deactivate her card,

409
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,599
making her more than an hour late.

410
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,279
Don't do something stupid.
I can handle it myself.

411
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,759
I just can't stand the way she acts.

412
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:07,279
Actually, she's quite impressive.

413
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,480
She gets tens of millions of deposits loans

414
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,200
that easily.

415
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,952
But me,

416
00:27:13,952 --> 00:27:17,000
I couldn't even see
the problems with a shipyard owner.

417
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,039
Instead, I thought it would surely work.

418
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,720
If someone tries to fool you,

419
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,519
of course, you can't tell
where the problem lies.

420
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,000
Besides, it's all in the past now.

421
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,400
Stop complaining yourself.

422
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:38,000
I know. I just feel a bit lost.

423
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,519
Back when I was in the lobby,

424
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,240
the work was trivial, the salary low,

425
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,519
and there were
unreasonable customers every day.

426
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,880
Sometimes what makes sense
just doesn't make sense.

427
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,279
Then I went to the Development Department,

428
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,400
I was anxious about becoming a regular,
and my performance.

429
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,039
My tasks were piling up.

430
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:00,359
Many colleagues are the same as me.

431
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,079
They are too anxious,
leading to insomnia and hair loss.

432
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,319
And they also think

433
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,759
the effort put into work
is disproportionate to what is received.

434
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,279
Actually, that's just how banks are.

435
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,519
A bank is like a besieged city.

436
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,000
People outside think it's glamorous,

437
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,920
but in reality, only those inside
know how tough it is.

438
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,240
I've been in this besieged city for four years,

439
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,400
haven't seen a bit of hope.

440
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,200
And I don't know where to go next.

441
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,880
Indeed.

442
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,920
But you have encountered Ji Yuheng.

443
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,839
There is always a hope.

444
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:41,559
Energy is always conserved.

445
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,720
Yes. He's been quite busy lately.

446
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,799
He's busy making money
to get Mom that special medicine.

447
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,640
But I asked the doctor.

448
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,559
He said that even using that medicine

449
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,799
might not have a great effect.

450
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,240
Does he know about this?

451
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,279
He's been taking care of Mom for so long,
how could he not know?

452
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,680
But sometimes people are like that.

453
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,720
When he can't do anything about something,

454
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,079
he just wants to avoid it.

455
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:12,200
All I can do now is to help him
take good care of Mom.

456
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,279
I can't do anything else.

457
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,519
You need to eat well every day.

458
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,799
I've noticed you've lost weight.

459
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,960
I'll order your favorite takeout

460
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,400
to you at the hospital.

461
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,464
Okay.

462
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,039
I'm sorry, my apologies for being careless.

463
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,440
It's okay.

464
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,292
Ms. Cai, you've taken care of me all day.

465
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:46,359
Go take a rest.

466
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,976
Ms. Cai, go have a rest. I'll handle it here.

467
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,160
Okay.

468
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,200
You've worked hard.

469
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,039
It's fine.

470
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,559
Mom, I'm here.

471
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,279
How is it? Did it hurt?

472
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,240
What a good daughter-in-law.
She's even closer than a daughter.

473
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:08,416
Are you hungry?

474
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:09,960
The fish soup my mother made today

475
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,359
has been kept warm in the hospital cafeteria.

476
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,960
I'll get it for you.

477
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,200
No.

478
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,359
Xiaoning, I have a caretaker here.

479
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:25,839
And your mom often comes to see me.

480
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,920
You don't need to worry.

481
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,519
Especially tell Yuheng not to worry.

482
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,119
He can't stop worrying.

483
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,279
Your son thinks about you every day.

484
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,359
But he has had too many things
to do at the bank recently,

485
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:43,079
so he can't get away.

486
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,960
Don't be mad at him.

487
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,319
No. It's good that he's busy.

488
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:58,640
Besides, I don't want him to see me like this.

489
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,759
I'm afraid he'll feel even worse than I do.

490
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,440
Mom, I'll take a call.

491
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,559
Okay, go ahead.

492
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,839
Cover yourself well with the sheet.

493
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,519
Hello, Zhao, what's up?

494
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,960
There is a client from the industrial zone.
You've contacted them before.

495
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,200
They have a good impression of you,

496
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,304
and agree to let you take over.

497
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,079
Thank you, Zhao.

498
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:42,559
Why don't you sound interested?

499
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,088
No.

500
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:46,176
That's good.

501
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,240
I'll send you the information.
Review them promptly.

502
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,528
Once you've gone through them, I'll help you
schedule a meeting with the client.

503
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,680
Okay.

504
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,960
Bye.

505
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,016
Bye.

506
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,920
Don't follow up on this project anymore.

507
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,680
Mr. Yang has been in prison before.
He has a criminal record.

508
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,039
So there have always been rumors
that Mr. Yang doesn't take loans.

509
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,528
It doesn't mean he's unwilling to take loans,

510
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:12,240
but he can't.

511
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
As an Account Manager,

512
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,200
if you lack even this level
of professional sensitivity,

513
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,440
then you might not be suitable for this job.

514
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,712
So hurry and look for other projects.
Don't lose heart.

515
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,464
Unlocked.

516
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:32,839
Why haven't you gone to sleep yet?

517
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:36,039
I was just checking some materials
while waiting for you.

518
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,880
Go to sleep early.

519
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,680
I want to chat with you.

520
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,440
I'm a bit tired now. Let's talk another day.

521
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,640
No, I've been waiting for you till now.

522
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,760
Let's talk now.

523
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,799
You let go of me.

524
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,720
Stop moving. Let me hug you for a while.

525
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,960
Why not take it? Do you have a new client?

526
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,400
No, I don't have much experience.

527
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,360
Let's just forget it for now.

528
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,360
Experience can be accumulated over time.

529
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,519
If there's anything you're unsure about,

530
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,559
Jing and I can help you.

531
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,719
I know, Zhao.

532
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,039
Someone in my family is sick,

533
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:50,079
I need to take care of her.

534
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,719
I can't manage both sides.

535
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,079
So let's just forget about it.

536
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,239
Thank you, Zhao.

537
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,760
I'll make a phone call.

538
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,239
What's wrong?

539
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,840
Tu needs more clients
to become a regular employee.

540
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,008
And I happen to have one here.

541
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,360
She refused it?

542
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,320
She said someone in her family is sick,

543
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,960
and she needs to take care of her.

544
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,239
I can understand.

545
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,880
Tu is capable and can endure hardship.

546
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,559
I think this is a chance.

547
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,400
I'll talk to her about it later.

548
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,039
I heard from Tang that it seems
someone in your family is also hospitalized.

549
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:48,639
It's my mom,
and the situation isn't very optimistic.

550
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,776
It's fine. Just go.

551
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,360
There's a discount. Buy one get one free.

552
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,568
I picked it randomly.

553
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,199
Mr. Zhao, could you talk to me face to face?

554
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,039
Okay.

555
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,679
This is totally to my taste.

556
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,872
For free?

557
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,096
- Don't want it?
- Take it away.

558
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:25,199
Give it a try.

559
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,679
- I'm scared.
- Why?

560
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:29,360
I'm afraid you'll add interest on me.

561
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,760
You and Tu really are close.

562
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,960
I offered a client to Tu, but she refused it.

563
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,079
I offered you coffee, but you refused it.

564
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,880
My kindness went in vain.

565
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,992
You offered her a client?

566
00:36:38,816 --> 00:36:40,639
What's wrong?

567
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,239
We all started at the bottom, right?

568
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,960
Tu has worked in the lobby for three years
without being made a regular.

569
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,280
Heaven does not always reward the diligent.

570
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,519
Then she came to the Development Department,
thinking to start over.

571
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,519
But she would never think
to run into her old rival.

572
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,199
And she hasn't been made a regular till now.

573
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,119
This is a time
when she is having doubts about her career

574
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,199
and about herself.

575
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,519
You're giving her a client now,

576
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,400
but does she have the confidence to accept it?

577
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,239
You're really just hitting her morale.

578
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,119
I thought you'd been ignoring your apprentice.

579
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:12,760
So it turns out you are cold
on the outside but warm on the inside.

580
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,000
You're just now realizing it?
I'm being so considerate.

581
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,400
Then when will you be warm to me?

582
00:37:19,264 --> 00:37:21,384
What did you say?

583
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,280
I said when you will be warm to me.

584
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,639
Do you want to play with fire?

585
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,000
Anything else?

586
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,039
I'm here to discuss something with you.

587
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,719
Mr. Ji's mom fell ill.

588
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,960
I'm thinking of calling on
everyone to pay a visit.

589
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,320
I know about this. I've heard it.

590
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,719
Then you'd organize it.

591
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,599
Mr. Zhao, you always have charisma.

592
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,360
Everyone responds to your call in office.

593
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,840
Is it necessary to consult me
about such a small matter?

594
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,360
Bro, why do you always

595
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,880
report to Jing?

596
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,688
Mr. Zhao.

597
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,960
What are you thinking?

598
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,760
Nothing.

599
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,639
I'm taking this coffee.

600
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,760
Consider this as my fee
for answering your questions. Thanks.

601
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:22,719
Where are you going?

602
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,744

Why is it you again?

606
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,840
I've told you

607
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,880
that you can't enter after visiting hours.

608
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,320
Go back. Come earlier next time.

609
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,639
I'll just stand here for a while.

610
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,552
Did you drink?

611
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:57,960
Are you here to make trouble?

612
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,639
I'll just stand for a while
and then I'll leave.

613
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,719
Mom, it's been almost ten years.

614
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,440
We finally have a complete family again.

615
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,440
Is Heaven going to take it back again?

616
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,639
Please give me more time.

Haven't you gone to sleep yet?

621
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,440
You drank again?

622
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,760
The financial representative of Zhouyang
is coming to Star City for inspection.

623
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,599
They're hard to arrange a meeting with,
so I must attend this dinner.

624
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,239
Mom misses you
and she hasn't seen you for a week.

625
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:04,599
But she's been holding back from saying it.

626
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,559
I don't want to talk about this right now.

627
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:11,199
Why can't you go and see her?

628
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,719
You have to face it eventually, don't you?

629
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,960
So you think I'm afraid to face it?

630
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:22,320
Mom hasn't been lucid lately.

631
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,360
Even if I went, so what?

632
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,840
I might as well earn more money

633
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,199
to keep affording
that special medication for her.

634
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:31,400
What she needs now is not
just the medicine, but you.

635
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,416
Could you spend some time with her

636
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:35,199
in the few months that she has,

637
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,599
without leaving any regrets for yourself?

638
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,960
Tu Xiaoning, what do you mean?

639
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
I won't let her life be ceased
in just a few months.

640
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,880
I will keep her.

641
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,719
Ji Yuheng, you're avoiding it.

642
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,920
You're afraid to face Mom's illness.

643
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,960
You're afraid to face the worst.

644
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,592
So you are using going out to earn money
for medicine as an excuse every day,

645
00:40:54,592 --> 00:40:55,719
but don't go to see her.

646
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,920
In fact, you're just
making excuses for yourself.

647
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,800
Yes, I am avoiding it.

648
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,000
What about you?

649
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,519
Why didn't you take the client
Zhao Fanggang introduced to you?

650
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,360
After the shipyard project failed,
you lost confidence in yourself

651
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,119
and you are doubting
your own capabilities, right?

652
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:15,360
Better take care of your own matters first.

653
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,800
So it's okay to remain an assistant?

654
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,880
It's also okay if the assessment
for permanent position fails?

655
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,064
That's okay.
