00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,840
I wish you happiness both morning and evening.

178
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,559
What happiness in the morning
and evening? No happiness at noon?

179
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,039
Happy every day.

180
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,168
Happy every day.

181
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,679
Dad, what are you looking at to be so happy?

182
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,480
I just love to see them,
mother and daughter, sitting there.

183
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,208
It makes me happy just watching.

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,919
In the future,
after you are married for a while,

185
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,840
you will just know it naturally.

186
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,600
Nothing beats the family staying together
safe and sound.

187
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,440
- Yes.
- That's what happiness truly is.

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,519
After you two get married, get along well.

189
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,679
Do you know how to cherish your wife?

190
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,000
First of all, you must be attentive.

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,184
You have to remember
what Xiaoning likes and dislikes.

192
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,024
Secondly, you must put your heart into it.

193
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:34,320
Yes.

194
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,519
Women,

195
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,648
whether young or old, just love romance.

196
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:40,799
Romance?

197
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,799
Daily necessities are the foundation.

198
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,120
Romance, you must tighten this string.

199
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,519
Most importantly, a woman can skip a meal.

200
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,279
But if you miss a surprise
that should have happened,

201
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,368
you're done for.

202
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:56,776
Got it.

203
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,960
Ji is both careful and patient.

204
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,960
You have good taste in choosing a husband.

205
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,639
Not inferior to me.

206
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,679
You've only met him twice

207
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,159
and you praise him to the skies.

208
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,919
What's the matter?
What about your previous picky standards?

209
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,720
He is so measured in his actions.
Shouldn't he be praised?

210
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,639
Are you familiar with him?

211
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,960
How do you know he is measured?

212
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,240
Anyway, I just know it.

213
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,200
Thank you, Ji Yuheng.

214
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,408
What are you thanking me for?

215
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,519
Thanks for your cooperation
in handling the relatives and parents.

216
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,600
If it weren't for your cooperation today

217
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,759
and I suddenly told them I was getting married,

218
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,000
I guess their blood pressure
and heart rate would have risen.

219
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,399
Since it's a real marriage,

220
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,679
the proper rituals need to be followed.

221
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,039
If there's anything you didn't think of
or do in the future,

222
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,159
I will think of it all for you.

223
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,184
Okay.

224
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,320
What are you laughing at?

225
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,360
Nothing, I just suddenly feel

226
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,000
like there's a sense
of being about to be married.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,720
Isn't it the feeling of life after marriage?

228
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,000
How do we arrange for tonight then?

229
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,399
My parents think we're already married.

230
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,112
I'm all ears for you.

231
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,320
I just feel that the role change
is happening too quickly.

232
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,240
I'm not ready yet, so…

233
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,919
I especially understand.
No one can change that quickly.

234
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,840
How about I go home today?

235
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,879
After you go back, spend some time
with Uncle and Auntie.

236
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,559
Okay.

237
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,696
Spend some time with Dad and Mom.

238
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,200
Once you get used to the new role,
we can make long-term plans.

239
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,360
Alright, drive carefully on the way.

240
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,320
Let me know once you get home.

241
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,039
Okay, I'll watch you go back.

242
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,519
- Bye.
- Bye.

243
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,519
Come on, pick a piece.

244
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,879
Come with me to meet a client tonight.

245
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Meet a client?

246
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,240
It's not convenient for you?

247
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,360
No.

248
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,320
When you worked in the lobby,

249
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,120
your work was carried out within eight hours.

250
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,720
But working in the Development Department,

251
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,800
what you do outside of those eight hours
is what's most important.

252
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,824
Working in the Development Department,

253
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:36,639
you won't enjoy your twilight years
like working in the lobby.

254
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,080
So you need to have the courage
to blaze a trail and forge ahead.

255
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,879
These clothes are not your shortcut.

256
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,480
They are merely your battle attire
for the battlefield.

257
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,720
But whether you go
to battle or not is up to you.

258
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,039
Of course, I have to go to battle.

259
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,320
Jing, are we going to drink tonight?

260
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,840
- Can you drink?
- Yes.

261
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,360
Very good. Remember to let your hair down.

262
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,720
It matches this dress better.

263
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,279
Okay.

264
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,399
Let's have dinner together after work.

265
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,512
I don't have time tonight.

266
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,200
Director Yao.

267
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,320
Mr. Ji, come on in.

268
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
- After you.
- Let's go.

269
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,296
Ms. Rao, you'll go to a dinner party?

270
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:41,280
Yes.

271
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,399
Good.

272
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,159
You refused my dinner invitation

273
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,360
just to attend a dinner party?

274
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,960
No wonder your Development Department
is always full of vitality.

275
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,960
Mr. Yao.

276
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,960
A worker's life after work
doesn't always belong to themselves.

277
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,240
Achieved through real effort
and concrete actions.

278
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,559
So, I hope you

279
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,400
would not believe those rumors.

280
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I also hope that the Compliance Department

281
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,519
would go easy on our Development Department.

282
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,279
Whether these rumors are true or not, our
Compliance Department will judge for ourselves.

283
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,000
But if there are any actions
on the fringe of the boundaries…

284
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,960
They may seem not illegal,
but it doesn't mean they conform to the rules.

285
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,680
Please remember this, Ms. Rao.

286
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,240
Mr. Ji, are you warning me?

287
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,319
A warm reminder.

288
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,400
I will bear it in mind.

289
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,776
See you later.

290
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,839
Did I just offend him somewhere? He's acting
like he's swallowed gunpowder.

291
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:05,480
[Notes on toasts at workplace dinners]

292
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,160
Mr. Ji, how come you haven't left yet?

293
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,264
It is after working hours now.

294
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,740
You don't need to call me Mr. Ji.

295
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:24,759
Where are you eating tonight?

296
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,519
Nanzhi Restaurant.
Jing will be coming over in a bit.

297
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,880
You'll drive there? Aren't you going to drink?

298
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,240
Jing said to call a designated driver.

299
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,352
If you don't want to go,

300
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:38,000
tell me, I'll help you.

301
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
I want to go. I'm different now.

302
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,519
Back when I was in the lobby,

303
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,799
by being observant, enthusiastic,
and approachable, I could solve problems.

304
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,279
Now I have to go to the battlefield.

305
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
You seem quite calm.

306
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,400
What's the use of struggling?

307
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,599
Struggling is just internal friction.
Better to get on with it.

308
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,559
If all else fails, I can play the deserter.

309
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,519
Why were you like that to Jing just now?

310
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,160
Because she ruined our first dinner.

311
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,480
You're not someone who mixes up
public and private matters.

312
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,240
Since when do you know me so well?

313
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,960
I've seen you at work.

314
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:27,039
Rao Jing likes to overstep boundaries
in her actions.

315
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,200
I was just offering some advice.

316
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,672
As long as it's not because of me.

317
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,400
Take it, I'm leaving.

318
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
- Be careful.
- Don't worry, no problem.

319
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,960
Mr. Qian, this red wine
is from the northern part of Portugal.

320
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,920
The vintage is quite right. Here's to you.

321
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,480
I hope you will give Dairui a chance

322
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,799
to work with you
to explore the southern market.

323
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,279
Not many people know about this winery.

324
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,496
It seems you've done your homework.

325
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:04,079
Rao Jing,

326
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,839
the person you taught is indeed teachable.

327
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,920
Mr. Qian, the newcomer

328
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,160
has to learn a lot, memorize and recite more.

329
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,960
Unlike you, who deals with banks a lot.

330
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,640
You've almost become a semi-professional.

331
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,040
In the future, you'll have to give Tu
more guidance.

332
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,119
- Here.
- Here, come on.

333
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,000
Qian Dong, 43 years old, took over
the family mining business.

334
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,440
In just six years,

335
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,240
he tripled the business volume
of the family's mining operations.

336
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,480
He has high standards for his everyday life

337
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,839
and has a very good relationship with his wife.

338
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,160
His son is studying abroad.

339
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,559
He likes to drink niche Portuguese red wine.

340
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,559
Since they need to expand
into the southern market,

341
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,640
many banks want to take over his loan business.

342
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,200
Tu, you like red wine.

343
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,680
We can communicate more in the future.

344
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Who knows, we might even become friends.

345
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,960
That would be my honor.

346
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,920
But to be honest,
I don't really understand red wine.

347
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,519
When I was advising a previous client

348
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,720
on loan counseling,

349
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,519
that client shared with me.

350
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:07,000
Just like you,

351
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,400
he also likes red wine from northern Portugal,

352
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,039
especially Porto.

353
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,720
He just returned from the UK
and is also planning to invest in minerals.

354
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,240
Perhaps you two know each other.

355
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,799
Is this person named Qian Junsheng?

356
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,664
Right, I said you might know each other.

357
00:21:21,664 --> 00:21:24,279
Tu, we cannot disclose client information.

358
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,319
Did he get a loan from Dairui?

359
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,519
Mr. Qian, I am really sorry.

360
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,519
Tu is new and doesn't know the rules.

361
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,599
She doesn't know
what your relationship is with him.

362
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,720
A newcomer, I understand.

363
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,279
So she needs to be taught well.

364
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,279
Mr. Qian, rest assured, I will definitely
teach her well from now on.

365
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,680
Today was Tu's fault.

366
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,519
How about this? Let me toast
three glasses to you

367
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,799
to apologize on her behalf.

368
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,559
Open that up, there's another set
of materials inside.

369
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,319
The loan interest rates are much of a muchness.

370
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,920
[Entrepreneur Personal Profile Qian Dong]
So think about it carefully.

371
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,519
What is the reason that would make
Mr. Qian choose Dairui exclusively?

372
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:13,856
After looking through the materials,
extract the key points.

373
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:14,960
Think of a way later.

374
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,440
How to convey these messages
to Mr. Qian at the dinner table.

375
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,896
Okay.

376
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,359
What stage has this matter progressed to?

377
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,160
As long as there is the exclusivity agreement,

378
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,519
Dairui cannot possibly collaborate
with the person you're concerned about.

379
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:39,240
Besides, your contracts
with other projects at Weixi Bank

380
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,640
have not yet expired.

381
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,360
I believe Weixi Bank would not possibly,
because of someone else,

382
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,759
give up such a big client, right?

383
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:49,920
So, as long as there is no support
from these two banks,

384
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,599
even if some people are very capable,

385
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:55,279
they won't be able to make any waves.

386
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,759
Jing, drink less, I'll drink.

387
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,880
Bring me the contract, so I can have a look.

388
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,400
Do you have a girlfriend now?

389
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,119
I know you very well.

390
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,240
You never look at your phone
when you're outside.

391
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Between us master and disciple,
let's not keep secrets, you hear me?

392
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Indeed, nothing can escape your eyes.

393
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,400
I do have a girlfriend now.

394
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,000
When did this happen?

395
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,279
All these years, I've never seen
any girl by your side.

396
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:46,039
It's a recent thing.

397
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,440
When there's a chance,
I'll bring her to visit you.

398
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,592
Okay.

399
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,119
Sir, you invited me for tea today.

400
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,119
Is there something on your mind?

401
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,359
Perhaps you already know

402
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,000
there have been many issues
in the Development Department lately.

403
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,160
Division One led by Jiang
encountered some problems.

404
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,839
Xing from Division Two is too ambitious.

405
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,119
He's always thinking about merging
the two divisions.

406
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,960
But I know his capabilities.

407
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,680
If he does that, the Development Department
will be thrown into chaos.

408
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,079
Division One and Division Two

409
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,400
handle most of the loan business in the bank.

410
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,416
Indeed, it can't be a mess.

411
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,504
Exactly.

412
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,200
Let's not talk about this anymore.

413
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,759
It's not easy to invite you out
for a cup of tea.

414
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,912
How has your mother been feeling lately?

415
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:48,720
She's fine.

416
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,839
When she heard you got a girlfriend,
she must be over the moon.

417
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,519
I told her about it right away.

418
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,520
Naturally.

419
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,559
Jing, are you okay?

420
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,640
Did I cause trouble? Making you drink so much.

421
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:13,960
No worries, you did great.

422
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,119
Mr. Qian is usually very stubborn.

423
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,359
I've tried many ways but can't deal with him.

424
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:21,200
Later, I heard that his father's youngest son
came back from abroad.

425
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,200
He is making some loans to some small banks,

426
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,119
wanting to engage
in some mining-related activities.

427
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,559
I knew this must be his breakthrough point.

428
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,200
But at the same time,
this is also his sore spot,

429
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,839
definitely not something
that can be trod on casually.

430
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:34,640
So, if you had been the one to bring this up,

431
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,240
he would think you were threatening him.

432
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,119
It would backfire, right?

433
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,920
Otherwise, what do you think

434
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,160
that we could come out to have this meal today?

435
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,240
Why do you think
I asked you to dress so nicely?

436
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,640
To trade on your looks?

437
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,799
I just wanted you to play the role
of an inexperienced youngster at work

438
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:50,039
and inadvertently pass on
this piece of information to him.

439
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,480
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

440
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,359
He won't think that we are in cahoots, right?

441
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:57,888
Some people, when they are well-versed
in certain matters,

442
00:25:57,888 --> 00:25:58,960
tend to become complacent.

443
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,359
He thinks he's fully familiar
with our sales tricks.

444
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,839
You're overdressed today on purpose

445
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,119
and pretending to be new
to the drinking culture at the table,

446
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,880
making him think you're a workplace rookie.

447
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,319
That way, whatever you do

448
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,319
and whatever clients you pull in
will all seem reasonable.

449
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,680
I should have been the one
to drink those three glasses earlier.

450
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,279
Blocking drinks for you
is not to be taken as a precedent.

451
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:24,519
You'll have to meet clients
on your own eventually, right?

452
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,119
Jing, you don't need to block drinks
for me, I can drink.

453
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,279
- Really?
- Really.

454
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,400
Okay, let's see how much you can drink.

455
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Jing.

456
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,160
You're so great!

457
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,599
You were great today too.

458
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,799
You really can drink a lot.

459
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,920
How are you so good at this?

460
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,079
Why aren't there any rideshare drivers
taking orders?

461
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,880
Wait a bit longer, just a bit longer.

462
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,720
Why are there no rideshare drivers around here?

463
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,640
Jing.

464
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,680
Mr. Ji, what are you doing here?

465
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,000
I just happen to be passing by for work.

466
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:04,704
Did you drink?

467
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:06,824
Had a bit.

468
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,168
It's not a good time to call for a rideshare.

469
00:27:11,168 --> 00:27:13,160
I'll give you a ride.

470
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,304
The car's here.

471
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,456
The car, it's here.

472
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:16,480
- That works.
- The car's here.

473
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,640
Please help me up.

474
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
No need, I can do it myself.

475
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,080
I can do it myself.

476
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,672
Well, I…

477
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:25,960
Take the passenger seat.

478
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,976
Okay.

479
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,960
Ms. Rao, this colleague seems to have
an average tolerance for alcohol.

480
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,319
You've had quite a bit, huh?

481
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,119
You are talking about Tu?

482
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,880
She indeed didn't drink a little tonight.

483
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,960
Didn't drink a little,
it seems the rumors are quite true.

484
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,200
I don't know what rumors you have heard.

485
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,799
But I know

486
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:56,384
there are indeed some rumors
about me out there.

487
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,400
But these are all my personal actions.

488
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,519
I do not wish for our
Development Department Division One

489
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,759
to take the rap for me.

490
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,400
But I want to tell you

491
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,680
some people and some things

492
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,200
require the sedimentation of time
to be understood.

493
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,920
I have my principles when doing things.

494
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,640
I hope so.

495
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,319
Some people, you know them for a long time,

496
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:23,920
yet you don't know them at all.

497
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,400
There are some people whom you feel
familiar with right after meeting.

498
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,640
Who are you talking about?

499
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,480
My boyfriend, perhaps.

500
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,359
Yes, I should call him that way.

501
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,032
Xiaoning.

502
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,440
- We're home?
- We're home.

503
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,680
Come on, put on a coat.

504
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,776
Be careful, the bag.

505
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,799
Come on, careful, watch your step.

506
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,519
Slow down, be careful.

507
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,759
Hang in there, we're almost home.

508
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:26,856
Are the keys in the bag?

509
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,312
I don't know.

510
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,160
How come you didn't bring the keys
when leaving home?

511
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,680
Dad, Mom.

512
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,559
Ji.

513
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,400
Hello, Mom, aren't you and Dad at home?

514
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,000
We've come to the countryside, to your elder
maternal aunt's place. What happened?

515
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,799
You won't be coming back tonight?

516
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,319
Tonight your great-uncle will drive us back.

517
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,400
Is there a problem?

518
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,400
I'm taking Xiaoning home.
She didn't bring her keys.

519
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,799
Didn't bring the keys?
Then just stay at your place.

520
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,720
You're married now,
it's time to have your own home.

521
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,000
Is Xiaoning too shy to mention it to us?

522
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,016
We are not that conservative.

523
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:23,040
After we go back,

524
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,400
we will deliver her luggage to you.

525
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,000
Okay, take care on your way back.

526
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,039
We'll head back first.

You proposed to Xiaoning.

our biggest criteria for choice.

If she chooses you,

our whole family will definitely
accept it wholeheartedly.

674
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,119
But if she rejects you,

675
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,639
don't think you can win her over
in a roundabout way.

676
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,400
We will definitely not force her

677
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,800
to do anything she doesn't like.

678
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,960

00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,868
♫ No one knows ♫

706
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,644
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

707
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:54,812
♫ I hope you know ♫
