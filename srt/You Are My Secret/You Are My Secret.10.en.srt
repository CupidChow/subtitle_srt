00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:32,840
[Li Xiang]

182
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,440
Hello, Li Xiang.

183
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Where are you now?

184
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,712
We are heading to Mr. Ji's house right now

185
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:40,720
to celebrate his birthday.

186
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,799
Listen, this is a good opportunity
to become close to Mr. Ji.

187
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,000
Once I arrive, let's share our location.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,320
Just send me the address. I can find it.

189
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Have you arrived already?

190
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,679
Not yet, about ten minutes away.

191
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,840
Okay, see you later.

192
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:03,500
[Timer]

193
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,320
Ms. Rao, you're late.

194
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,344
Give me a hand.

195
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,279
- No.
- Okay.

196
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,784
Give me a hand.

197
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:23,960
You can make the call

198
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,440
while carrying some stuff.

199
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,120
Look, right ahead, there.

200
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,720
Let's hurry up.

201
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,399
Why are you in such a hurry?

202
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,279
Are you guys tired?

203
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,960
Not really.

204
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,720
Good news. We've arrived.

205
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,600
You look tired. Let's take a break.

206
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,279
Let me tell you about this wall.

207
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,879
Many retired men and women live
in this community.

208
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,679
Look, they built this wall by their own hands.

209
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,559
Each brick is eco-friendly,
providing insulation and heat resistance.

210
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,799
- And--
- Mr. Ji.

211
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,072
You don't have to tell us.

212
00:12:07,072 --> 00:12:08,120
Why?

213
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,600
I'm about to talk about these bricks.

214
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
Take a look.

215
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,279
No rush. Wait for them.

216
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,888
No need to wait. Go ahead.

217
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:15,000
It's okay.

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,444
It's close to your workplace. Quite nice.

219
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:19,204
[Timer]

220
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:21,879

221
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,008

225
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,639
Mr. Ji, this is a fingerprint lock.

226
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,784
My hand is a bit moist.

227
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,576
Unlocked.

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,320
Please come in.

229
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,840
Mr. Ji, where is the bathroom?

230
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,440
- It's right over there.
- Okay.

231
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,448
I'll use it.

232
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,320
Hold on. I'll get your shoes.

233
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,440
I'm in the room. Cover for me later.

234
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:43,904
Mr. Ji.

235
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:44,960
Yes?

236
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,600
I found something.

237
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,960
What is it, Zhao?

238
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,720
You have a girlfriend?

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,440
Why?

240
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,200
I just found a hair in the bathroom.

241
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,960
The length and color show it's not yours.

242
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,720
It's about the same color as Tu's hair.

243
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,799
Tu? What are you talking about?

244
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,480
You're in a relationship.

245
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,440
Mr. Zhao, why are you so gossipy?

246
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,240
Do you think
Mr. Ji is an unpopular bachelor like you?

247
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,759
Isn't it normal for him to have a girlfriend?

248
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,960
Am I unpopular?

249
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,000
Before Mr. Ji came,

250
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,000
Xu Li, Li Xiang, and I

251
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,519
were the face of the company, right?

252
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,400
Sure, that's why Division One almost collapsed.

253
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,559
What?

254
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,720
What? Don't tell me
he's the face of the company.

255
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,919
Mr. Ji, I'm sorry.

256
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,159
We came without telling you in advance.

257
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,559
We must have disturbed your private moment.

258
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,399
Why not call your girlfriend over?
Let's celebrate your birthday together.

259
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,679
Well, she and I…

260
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,320
We're in a special relationship.

261
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,376
What?

262
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:15,400
Well…

263
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,320
Okay, got it.

264
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,200
Mr. Ji, the company is strict
with personal issues.

265
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,392
Be careful.

266
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,280
How come Tu hasn't arrived yet? Is she lost?

267
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,519
Yes, indeed.

268
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,799
I called her many times at the supermarket.

269
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,440
She hasn't come yet.

270
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,799
I can't believe you. I'm going to call her.

271
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,639
- Well.
- You call her.

272
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,399
Mr. Zhao, you're so busy.

273
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,240
You take care of everything, huh?

274
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,559
She hasn't come. I have to call her.

275
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,879
[Zhao Fanggang]

276
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,336
Play music to liven up the atmosphere.

277
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:51,360
How about this?

278
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,759
Let's eat on the terrace later.

279
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,399
It has enough space.

280
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,416
Let's take things up there.

281
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,600
- Sure.
- Okay.

282
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,624
Is there a terrace?

283
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,279
Zhao Fanggang, open that bottle of red wine.

284
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,799
Let it breathe. I'll drink it later.

285
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,559
Am I your servant?

286
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,679
Turn left up there.

287
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,559
Zhao, I'll be there soon.

288
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,919
In around ten minutes.

289
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,159
Mr. Ji, let me help.

290
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,544
Okay, I'll go change my clothes.

291
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:21,679
- Alright.
- You go first.

292
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,720
Won't you help me?

293
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,200
You are ungrateful.

294
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,624
Where's she?

295
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,160
Come out. They've all gone up already.

296
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,160
My legs are numb.

297
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,319
I'll massage them.

298
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,880
No need. It hurts if you touch my legs.

299
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,744
Come on.

300
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,816
Mr. Ji, I've been looking for you.

301
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,872
What's the matter?

302
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,359
Tu will arrive in ten minutes.

303
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,359
We'll go down to wait for her.

304
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:01,720
We welcome Tu Xiaoning with open arms.

305
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,119
Okay, you get changed.

306
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:23,440
Why did you come back?

307
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,240
You guys do it. I'll go down
with Mr. Ji to wait for Tu.

308
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,960
Mr. Ji, is there anyone else
in your home besides us?

309
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,759
Of course not.

310
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,000
I just saw a figure.

311
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,559
It just darted over. Let me take a look.

312
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,432
There's nobody else. Don't be silly.

313
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:11,519
It's weird.

314
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,200
I have poor eyesight in my thirties?

315
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,240
Mr. Ji.

316
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,480
Zhao, sorry, I'm late.

317
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,488
Never mind. Come in.

318
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,319
We're going to eat hot pot, right?

319
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,720
I can help.

320
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,599
Zhao, let me help you.

321
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,200
You don't have to. Almost done.

322
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,519
The three of us can do it.

323
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,319
You can help Mr. Ji.

324
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,080
Okay.

325
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,200
Help me cut this.

326
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,279
Give it to me.

327
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,160
Need help?

328
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,680
Roll up my sleeves.

329
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,200
- Okay.
- My hands are all full of dressing.

330
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,160
Okay, this one.

331
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:15,759
Mr. Ji.

332
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,720
I've got the ingredients ready.

333
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,240
If it's not enough, I'll get more.

334
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,400
Good.

335
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,799
Let's start eating.

336
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,559
Alright.

337
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,000
You give it to me.

338
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,720
Mr. Ji, try this.

339
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,319
- I can do it myself.
- Let me get you vegetable.

340
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,279
Mr. Ji, I'm going to toast to you.

341
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:36,079
- Sit down.
- Alright.

342
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,640
Since you joined the company,

343
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,119
- Division One's performance has got better.
- Yes.

344
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,519
I was mistaken before.

345
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,200
I hope you can forgive me.

346
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,559
Come on, it's all in the past.
Don't take it to heart.

347
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,000
Li Xiang, you're too punctilious.

348
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,920
Be closer to Mr. Ji.

349
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,640
Mr. Ji, here's a toast to you.

350
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,688
You drink alone.

351
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,960
I…

352
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Come on.

353
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,240
Look, once two people get familiar
with each other,

354
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,599
they can joke around.

355
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,000
How about we toast to Mr. Ji together?

356
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,839
Don't be too punctilious.

357
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,839
Mr. Ji, here's to you.

358
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,039
I wish you success.

359
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,799
Mr. Ji.

360
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,759
Led by Mr. Ji,

361
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,000
Division One is getting better.

362
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,400
- Yes.
- Exactly.

363
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,000
Mr. Ji, I'll express my blessings by drinking.

364
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,680
Mr. Ji, may you be prosperous.

365
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,799
Thanks.

366
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,440
Tu, it's your turn.

367
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,160
Mr. Ji, happy birthday.

368
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,519
Thank you for your care and tolerance.

369
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,839
Thank you for your simple blessing.

370
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,136
We have a long way to go,
fighting side by side.

371
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:53,200
Come on.

372
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,240
Come on.

373
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,384
Cheers.

374
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,160
Drink up! Mr. Ji, you don't have to.

375
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,192
You drink slowly.

376
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,240
Division One is like a family.

377
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,079
Earn money together.

378
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,319
Carry the burden together.

379
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,240
Let's not be single.

380
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,640
You're trying to trick us
into getting you a girlfriend.

381
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,000
So what? I'm not getting any younger.

382
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,920
I want to get married.

383
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,279
I can't be as crazy as you.

384
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,640
You're always dating.

385
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,400
We're a family.

386
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,880
We don't pay lip service.

387
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,720
- Yes.
- Right?

388
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,119
Tu.

389
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,880
You broke up with the one
who sent you flowers, right?

390
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,680
- It's not like.
- How about this?

391
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,559
I will get you a new boyfriend.

392
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,400
No, I don't want to be
in a relationship right now.

393
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,079
Got a new admirer?

394
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,039
No, I just want to focus on my exams.

395
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,559
Work matters.

396
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,880
I'm telling you--

397
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,240
Talking too much means harassment.

398
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,680
I think Tu is doing the right thing.

399
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:03,936
I hear

400
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,319
Mr. Ji has applied
to increase the department's staff.

401
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,799
There will be a newcomer next week.

402
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,720
Tu, you've got to work harder.

403
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,640
Don't let the latecomers get ahead of you.

404
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:23,119
What are you talking about? Why so serious?

405
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,759
We're talking about what game we can play.

406
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:27,160
That's right, video game.

407
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,000
Board games and Sanguosha.

408
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,079
Yes.

409
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,200
I can't offer these games.

410
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,960
Truth or Dare?

411
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,040
Yes.

412
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,920
Checkers? I have checkers.

413
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,440
- That is good.
- Yeah.

414
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,279
- Okay, I'll get it.
- No, let me do it. Where is it?

415
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,744
The room in front of the staircase.

416
00:23:43,744 --> 00:23:44,800
- Got it.
- Need to look for it.

417
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,888
Got it.

418
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:47,944
Hurry up.

419
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:03,319
I'm eating too hastily.

420
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,920
We lost a small client.

421
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,119
It's not your fault.

422
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,039
Mr. Ji, if so…

423
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,359
- Good.
- I'll eat more.

424
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,759
What's that?

425
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,784
What's it?

426
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Checkers?

427
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
I didn't open it to check.

428
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,680
I took the wrong stuff.

429
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,279
That's alright. Let's take a look.

430
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,672
This doll is so cute.

431
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:33,680
Yes.

432
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,319
- A little doll.
- It's pretty.

433
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:37,512
[Ji Yuheng]
It's pretty.

434
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,720
You're an affectionate man.

435
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,839
Your smile is as radiant as sunshine to me.

436
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,464
I hope we have many more stories
to unfold in the future.

437
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:48,559
Good.

438
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,160
Come on, let's toast to this desirable girl.

439
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,039
- Come on.
- To her.

440
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,039
- To the desirable girl.
- Come on.

441
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,640
Did you date anyone when you were in college?

442
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,808
No.

443
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,319
Was there someone you liked?

444
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,880
You didn't like anyone?

445
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,512
There was someone I liked.

446
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,279
Mr. Ji is so romantic.

447
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,576
You've kept that doll for so many years.

448
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,720
Unbelievable.

449
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,880
I remember something.

450
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,640
You just said it during the dinner.

451
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,839
She's Mr. Ji's desirable girl.

452
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,920
I'm telling you.

453
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,799
Men can't forget the woman they desire to get.

454
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,176
But they will once they succeed.

455
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:43,400
Rogue.

456
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,599
One size does not fit all.

457
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,680
According to Mr. Ji's personality,
if he gets together with his desirable girl,

458
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,880
he will get more romantic.

459
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Ling Weiyi is looking for me.
I'll be back later.

460
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,319
- You're right, Zhao.
- Feels like…

461
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,240
Hello, it's the location I sent you.

462
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,208
Walk in and you'll see me.

463
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,880
Ms. Rao.

464
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,920
The same man as last time?

465
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,039
Which one?

466
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,224
The one at the matchmaking event.

467
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,519
It's just a friend of mine.

468
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,920
A friend? You don't want
to take responsibility after dating?

469
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,400
You're such a bad woman.

470
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,200
Mr. Zhao, you're standing up for men.

471
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
But I have a question.

472
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,640
Are you jealous of them

473
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,720
or me?

474
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,008
Alright, Zhao, Jing won this time.

475
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:36,279
Fight again another day.

476
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,408
- Sure.
- Jing.

477
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,279
You're here.

478
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,880
They are my colleagues.

479
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,000
We have to go.

480
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,519
I just drank. You drive later.

481
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,519
- Okay.
- Okay.

482
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,039
He's just average-looking.

483
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,319
He's quite handsome.

484
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,344
He looks better than the last one.

485
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,359
Hello? Okay, I'll be there.

486
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,400
My designated driver is here.
Who's coming with me?

487
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
I'll give you guys a lift.

488
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,559
- We'll take a taxi.
- What about Tu?

489
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,799
My ride is here. Let's go.

490
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,599
- Okay.
- Let's go.

491
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,888
Hey, Ling Weiyi, where are you?

492
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,720
I knew about his desirable girl before.

493
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,960
I have an ex too.

494
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,039
I'm not the kind of person
with double standards.

495
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,000
I can have exes

496
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,680
and he can have a desirable girl.

497
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,240
But that's not the same, right?

498
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,519
It's a desirable girl.

499
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,519
It's an obsession with unattainable love.

500
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,400
We've been together for months.

501
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,359
He still keeps a gift for his desirable girl.

502
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,400
How important that girl is to him.

503
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,520
She's special.

504
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,200
You're getting jealous

505
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,079
and anxious.

506
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,240
Looks like you love Ji Yuheng very much.

507
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,839
There is something wrong with you.

508
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,279
What's wrong with me?

509
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,720
You've been on your phone

510
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,519
without listening to me.

511
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,519
Who are you texting to with smiles?

512
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:04,640
Something's going on and you don't tell me.

513
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,079
Tell me. Who is it?

514
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,839
Who else could it be?

515
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,359
Qi Yu? Have you two made up?

516
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,599
When did this happen?

517
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,200
Just a couple of days ago.

518
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,136
Done.

519
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,160
Thanks. You don't have to come, actually.

520
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,079
I can call a service worker over.

521
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,519
I know, but I'm glad to help.

522
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,559
The service worker might not come on time.

523
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,720
Besides, I'm worried about you.

524
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,960
I mean, it's unsafe for a girl at night.

525
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,880
How about I treat you to a meal?

526
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,519
No need.

527
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,079
I mean, I don't like to owe others favors.

528
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,319
You know it.

529
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:08,359
I know, I'm all sweaty.

530
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:11,160
I want to take a shower
before the dormitory lights out.

531
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,359
If you're feeling sticky,

532
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,359
you can take a shower on the first floor.
I live on the second floor.

533
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:22,216
Take a shower here?

534
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,960
No, that's inappropriate.

535
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,279
Alright, I have to go.

536
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,720
Qi Yu

537
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,599
Lock the door before you go to bed.

538
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,512
I take the trash out for you.

539
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,296
Okay.

540
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,079
Hello, is this the security department?

541
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,640
Yes, it is.

542
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,024
I am Ling Weiyi from the front desk.

543
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,048
Are our building

544
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:14,000
and Dairui's dormitory in the same place?

545
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,640
Yes.

546
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,799
Can you send me the exact location?

547
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,559
You're the girl behind the front desk.

548
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,319
What are you doing here?

549
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,680
I'm looking for Qi Yu. Does he live here?

550
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,039
He's taking a shower. Come in.

551
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,079
Ma, have you eaten yet?

552
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,680
Weiyi, what brings you here?

553
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,000
You left your ID card at my place.

554
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I've brought it to you.

555
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,720
You could've just called me to get it back.

556
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,960
It's unsafe to walk alone at night.

557
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,119
Make yourself comfortable.

558
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
Have some water.

559
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,480
No, thanks, so this is where you live.

560
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,440
This is my dorm.

561
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,000
It's a small dorm.

562
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,079
But it's quite cozy.

563
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,200
Look at this cabinet.

564
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,279
I bought it from a roommate
who went back to his hometown.

565
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,839
Guess how old it is? It's ten years old.

566
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,839
It's still durable.

567
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,240
And this little bedside lamp.

568
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,799
It doesn't strain my eyes
when I play on the phone at night.

569
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,839
Oh, and this small desk.

570
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,079
It's stable when I eat on the bed.

571
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,640
It's not a good place to live in.

572
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,440
I have another apartment near your workplace.

573
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,519
Why not stay at my place?

574
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,640
It'll be more convenient
for you to commute daily.

575
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,880
No need.

576
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,759
I live here and work at the bank temporarily.

577
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,880
What? What do you mean?

578
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,400
Actually, before I returned to Star City,

579
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,640
I planned to take the civil service exam again.

580
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,200
I work at the bank
to maintain a living for now.

581
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,640
The Bank President knows my plan.

582
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,000
He thinks I'm pretty good in all aspects.

583
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,640
He advised me to be a police officer.

584
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,240
I'm preparing for the exam.

585
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,799
I hear it's hard
to pass the civil service exam.

586
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:08,079
Why must you make yourself so tired?

587
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,200
I'm not tired at all.

588
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,039
I gave him a sand painting
when we started dating.

589
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,400
It was the first gift I gave him.

590
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,799
Qi Yu is usually careless.

591
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,119
And he's lived in his hometown for a long time.

592
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,240
I thought he had lost it a long time ago.

593
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,359
Unexpectedly, he's always kept it with him.

594
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,920
Just think about it.

595
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,559
Actually, he has a car, a house,
and a stable job back home.

596
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,359
He could have lived comfortably.

597
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,559
But now he's come here for me.

598
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,440
When I went to see his living place,

599
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,759
actually, I felt quite sad.

600
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,839
But he looked very positive.

601
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:55,079
I can tell he's serious in this relationship.

602
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:57,599
He has really given a lot.

603
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,400
Yes, Lu Sijing has told me
many times about him,

604
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,799
saying Qi Yu is his role model.

605
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,000
But to be honest,

606
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,519
the two of them aren't the same kind of person.

607
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,592
They're different.

608
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:08,744
How so?

609
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,079
Qi Yu puts your needs first.

610
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:15,960
Your needs are always the most important.

611
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,039
Honestly, not everyone can do this.

612
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,679
He's a good man.

613
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,119
I'm a good girl, alright?

614
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:24,599
Of course.

615
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,559
Lu Sijing can't compare to Qi Yu.

616
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,199
They are different in their bones.

617
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,599
You have gotten over Lu Sijing.

618
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,519
But I just had a tiff

619
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:37,159
with Qi Yu.

620
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,840
I don't have to break up with him.

621
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,440
That is true. You deserve the best.

622
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,760
Anyway, I wish the two of you be happy forever.

623
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,960
All is well.

624
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,880
I can't promise to be happy forever.

625
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,000
But I sincerely hope we're happy

626
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,280
in love.

627
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,920
Just like we were at college.

628
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,304
Unlocked.

629
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,760
I'm back.

630
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,920
You're back so soon.

631
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,440
I planned to pick you up after I finished this.

632
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,880
Why did Ling Weiyi see you?

633
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,800
She's gotten back together with Qi Yu.

634
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,719
Really? That's good news.

635
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,519
I've only met Qi Yu a few times,

636
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,199
but I think he's a good man.

637
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,840
What's wrong?
Do you have something on your mind?

638
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,320
Ji Yuheng, I want to ask you a question.

639
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,376
Sure, go ahead.

640
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,639
You didn't tell me about your birthday.

641
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,800
Is it because there's someone else
you'd rather spend it with?

642
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,760
What are you still thinking about that?

643
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,599
Actually, besides my mom and human resources,

644
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:53,960
very few people know about my birthday.

645
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,119
And I'm not used to celebrating it.

646
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,440
In the past, I could celebrate it

647
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,519
with my parents.

648
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,679
But after my mom got sick,
I seldom celebrated it.

649
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,760
If it matters to you,

650
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,824
we can celebrate my birthday
together every year.

651
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,719
Okay?

652
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:17,239
I've never asked him about his birthday.

653
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,239
I thought we were close enough.

654
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:22,440
It seems there's still a distance between us.

655
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,552
What are you thinking about?

656
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,679
I'm thinking about the exams
at the end of the month.

657
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,800
I should go and review.

658
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,880
I learned of your birthday on short notice.
I didn't have time to prepare a gift.

659
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,800
Is there any birthday gift you want?

660
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,639
Can I let you know later?

661
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,039
I need to think about it.

662
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,224
Okay.

663
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,239
So much has happened between us.

664
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,800
You still can't get over your desirable girl?

665
00:37:09,124 --> 00:37:12,644
♫ Refresh my memory ♫

666
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:16,128
♫ I finally met you ♫

667
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:18,208
♫ We used to share so many ♫

668
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:22,816
♫ Unforgettable memories ♫

669
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:26,752
♫ I've been expecting to see you again ♫

670
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:30,304
♫ I even feel happy when waiting for you ♫

671
00:37:30,304 --> 00:37:32,448
♫ I've never forgotten ♫

672
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:36,648
♫ About you ♫

673
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:40,928
♫ As time goes by ♫

674
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:44,480
♫ I start to realize ♫

675
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,272
♫ How much I miss you ♫

676
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:51,424
♫ I remember it as if it was yesterday ♫

677
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:54,624
♫ We used to share many memories ♫

678
00:37:54,624 --> 00:37:58,528
♫ But I've already locked them away ♫

679
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:00,384
♫ Placed in a corner ♫

680
00:38:00,384 --> 00:38:05,120
♫ They're waiting to be found again ♫

681
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,472
♫ Those cherished quiet moments ♫

682
00:38:09,472 --> 00:38:13,800
♫ Are hidden in the dark ♫

683
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,079
You have already given me the gift

684
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,208
I want the most.

685
00:38:19,968 --> 00:38:23,680
♫ The silent, everlasting promise ♫

686
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,352
♫ Are secretly hidden within my heart ♫

687
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:36,832
♫ Because of you, I have become who I am ♫

688
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,360
This way. It's a new environment for you.

689
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,440
You need to adapt to it.

690
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,400
Both Division One
and Division Two are on this floor.

691
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:58,000
This is the office of Division One.

692
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,960
Attention, guys.

693
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,239
Wait a moment.

694
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,960
There's a new personnel change.

695
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,016
I'm going to announce it.

696
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,159
This is Tang Yuhui.

697
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,760
She's our new colleague,

698
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,280
officially joining Division One.

699
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,159
Tang, please introduce yourself to everyone.

700
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:22,119
Alright. Hello, everyone,
my name is Tang Yuhui.

701
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,039
I was the lobby manager.

702
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:26,760
I'm honored to be part of Division One.

703
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,960
I hope my work will strengthen our department.

704
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,639
It's nearing the end of the year.

705
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,519
The deposit targets set for our department

706
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,840
still have a certain shortfall.

707
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,236
Let's all work hard together,

708
00:39:39,236 --> 00:39:41,599
striving for a good year.

709
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,679
Go ahead with your work.

710
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,880
That's all.

711
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,048
Yuheng.

712
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,512
You forgot this.

713
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,120
Come to my office.

714
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,864
I'll be there soon.

715
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:13,039
Zhao, I found something.

716
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,400
What is it?

717
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,880
Tang Yuhui was at the academy with Mr. Ji.

718
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,800
I've noticed that she keeps staring at Mr. Ji.

719
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,760
From my experience,
there's a thing between them.

720
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,360
What is it?

721
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,000
I hear Tang Yuhui's dad is the CEO

722
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,519
of the city's largest port-listed company.

723
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:33,920
He has business dealings with Dairui.

724
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:37,159
That's strange.

725
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,119
Tang Yuhui is well-educated

726
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,159
and well-connected.

727
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,920
And she is pretty.

728
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,679
She can work in any department at Dairui.

729
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,639
Why did she have to join Division One
instead of Division Two?

730
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,760
Do you mean Division Two is better
than Division One?

731
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,824
I didn't mean that.

732
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,079
Tang, with your capabilities and resources,

733
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:01,679
you can join a better department.

734
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:03,760
Why did you come to Division One?

735
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,239
I believe the Development Department
has prospects for growth.

736
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,760
And if the headquarters establishes branches,

737
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,320
they will choose people
from Division One or Division Two.

738
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,039
I want to give it a try.

739
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,136
You're far-sighted.

740
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,000
I don't care if you see Division One
as a stepping stone or not.

741
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,039
As long as you are here, you need to work hard.

742
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:25,119
Okay.

743
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,400
They were at the academy.

744
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,760
So, is she Mr. Ji's desirable girl?

745
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,000
That doll.

746
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,079
Yes, Tang Yuhui chases after Mr. Ji for…

747
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:44,320
Her hairstyle is exactly like that doll's.

748
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,880
Dairui does not allow office romances.

749
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,280
Mr. Ji knows that.

750
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,159
Sometimes,

751
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:54,519
rules may give way to interests.

752
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:00,760
I thought I would teach her.

753
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,704
Xu Li, do you have a mirror?

754
00:42:04,704 --> 00:42:05,728
No, I don't.

755
00:42:05,728 --> 00:42:06,816
I'll give you one.

756
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:07,960
That's great.

757
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,599
Look how thick your skin is in the mirror.

758
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:14,360
Don't flatter yourself.

759
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,760
Good point.

760
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,320
Are you a rapper?

761
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,464
Sure.

762
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,079
Yuheng, can I learn from Ms. Rao?

763
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,360
When I was the lobby manager,
I heard her performance was the best.

764
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,960
Rao Jing is teaching Tu Xiaoning.

765
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,039
You can learn from Mr. Xu.

766
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,320
But Xiaoning hasn't been a regular worker
after three years in the lobby.

767
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,880
She probably has no chance to be regular.

768
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,119
Besides, Mr. Xu seems softhearted.

769
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,400
Why not transfer her?
It'll make her job easier.

770
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,800
Tu Xiaoning has her advantages.

771
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,679
Whether one can get a permanent job
depends on a comprehensive evaluation.

772
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:56,920
If you don't want to work with Mr. Xu,

773
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,320
Mr. Zhao has a slot for mentoring a newcomer.

774
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
I will follow Mr. Xu.

775
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,519
I believe
you'll make the best arrangement for me.

776
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,920
If there's nothing else, get back to work.

777
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,008
Okay.

778
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,519
Yuheng, I joined the Development Department

779
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:29,559
not only for the prospects for development.

780
00:43:53,824 --> 00:43:57,480
[A Desirable Girl?]

781
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,280
It's a girl.

782
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
The girl you like?

783
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,536
Her birthday is coming up soon.

784
00:44:13,536 --> 00:44:20,096
♫ Life is not always smooth sailing ♫

785
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:22,816
♫ Say something to myself ♫

786
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:26,660
♫ I know you've tried your best ♫

787
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,672
♫ Don't be afraid ♫

788
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,656
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

789
00:44:39,656 --> 00:44:42,756
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

790
00:44:42,756 --> 00:44:47,916
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

791
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:52,100
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

792
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,588
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

793
00:44:55,588 --> 00:44:59,500
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

794
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:03,812
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

795
00:45:03,812 --> 00:45:10,692
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

796
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:14,916
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

797
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:19,652
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

798
00:45:19,652 --> 00:45:22,788
♫ To you and no one else ♫

799
00:45:22,788 --> 00:45:27,620
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

800
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,796
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

801
00:45:29,796 --> 00:45:32,972
♫ No one knows ♫

802
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,132
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

803
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:39,500
♫ I hope you know ♫

804
00:45:40,964 --> 00:45:47,556
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

805
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:52,996
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

806
00:45:52,996 --> 00:45:59,748
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

807
00:45:59,748 --> 00:46:04,004
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

808
00:46:04,004 --> 00:46:09,156
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

809
00:46:09,156 --> 00:46:12,100
♫ To you and no one else ♫

810
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,772
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

811
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:19,204
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

812
00:46:19,204 --> 00:46:22,412
♫ No one knows ♫

813
00:46:22,984 --> 00:46:25,188
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

814
00:46:25,188 --> 00:46:29,356
♫ I hope you know ♫
