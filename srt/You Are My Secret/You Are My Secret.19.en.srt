[Episode 19]

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,719
Why did you refuse the client
Zhao Fanggang referred to you?

33
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,640
The shipyard project fell through,
so you lost faith in yourself

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,319
and doubted your abilities?

35
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,519
Mind your own business.

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,439
So it's okay to be an assistant?

37
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,439
Do you not care if you fail the evaluation
to become permanent?

38
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,504
I don't care.

39
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,359
It's the way I am.

40
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,040
I don't have your sensitivity.

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,280
I think there's a problem with every client.

42
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,359
But I don't know where the problem lies.

43
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,719
What can I do about it?

44
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,159
This is how you see yourself?

45
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,280
Tu Xiaoning, you weren't like this before.
You've changed.

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,879
I've changed. People change.

47
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,304
Just look at you now.

48
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:15,392
You are

49
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:18,360
no longer the guy I knew at first.

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,319
Ji Yuheng, you're running from your problems.

51
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,400
You're afraid to confront your mom's illness.

52
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
You're afraid to face the worst outcome,

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,344
using earning money
to buy medicine as a pretext,

54
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:22,400
hiding yourself from others.

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,719
Actually, you're making excuses for yourself.

56
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,840
Ji Yuheng, right?

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,680
I've heard some things about you.

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
I occasionally heard a little about you.

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,120
Not too much.

60
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,039
But I want to tell you

61
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,479
to look forward.

62
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,599
If you keep looking back,
you'll have to face losses.

63
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,240
But if you look forward,

64
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,919
you'll see something different.

65
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,960
What about you?

66
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,439
Why did you refuse the client
Zhao Fanggang referred to you?

67
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,120
The shipyard project fell through,

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,360
so you lost faith in yourself

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,120
and doubted your abilities?

70
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,000
Am I avoiding something?

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,360
What if I'm bad at my job?

72
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,279
It's the weekend today.
Aren't you going to go to the hospital?

73
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,800
I have an appointment with a client today.

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,959
I'll go there after I'm done.

75
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:39,920
I was sorry about yesterday.

76
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,160
The hospital doesn't allow visits
after 4:00 P.M.

77
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,439
If you want to go, hurry up.

00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,560
How are you feeling today?

81
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,560
Has the madam next to you been discharged.?

82
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,439
She died last night.

83
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,079
It was so sudden.

84
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,759
She seemed good just the other day.

85
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,600
She greeted me every time I came.

86
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,519
I'm done. Let's head back.

87
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,640
Don't be too sad.

88
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,639
I didn't even see her one last time.

89
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,000
Mom, I asked the doctor.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,240
The doctor said you've made a good recovery.

91
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,160
You're feeling better, right?

92
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,279
I'm not afraid of death.

Don't worry.

You want to be discharged from the hospital?

103
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,519
Look, I've felt better these days.

104
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,439
With the aid of a caregiver, I can still walk.

105
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,879
I'm afraid that I can't go home

Mom just said she wants

we will further improve the hardware

125
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,519
The rating can definitely exceed five stars.

126

Plus, with our unique geographic advantage
in Star City,

127
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,279
the returns will be healthy.

128
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,039
I understand all that you've said.

129
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,000
I've reported to headquarters.

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,360
Dairui has the sincerity

131
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,320
of cooperation with Zhouyang.

132
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,000
Mr. Chen, what kind of tea would you like?

133
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,720
Mom just said she wants
to be discharged and go home.

134

in the hospital.

136
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,200
Actually, we were more inclined
to cooperate with Xinfa in the beginning.

137
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,080
Xinfa offers better terms
in terms of payment cycles

138
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,200
and repayment deadlines.

139
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,759
But you've made the long trip
to our headquarters

140
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,960
and met with the direct supervisor.

141
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,159
Very impressive.

142
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,759
As you just mentioned,

143
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,080
After Zhouyang upgrades its rating,

144
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,039
its pressure on revenue isn't that big.

145
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,840
For Zhouyang, the loan deadline

146
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,759
is not the most crucial issue.

147
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,200
Dairui hopes

148
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
to improve Zhouyang's financing
in the supply chain.

149
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,120
I've gotten something.

150
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,799
Zhouyang is expanding its scale
in six cities at the same time.

151
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,519
It will put big pressure

152
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,960
on upstream suppliers.

153
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,159
Dairui can provide loans to upstream suppliers

154
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,759
according to specific needs.

155
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,399
ensuring that associated enterprises
in the supply chain

156
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,919
can supply goods and operate stably.

157
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,840
I believe that it is crucial for Zhouyang.

158
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,424
Very impressive.

159
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:04,519
You flatter me.

we'll sign at Jinghai headquarters.

162

My relative is also hospitalized.

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,279
Isn't this Mr. Ji's mom's ward?

176
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,360
Yes, I came to visit her.

177

Had I known earlier, I would have asked you.

178
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,440
We've been searching for a while.

179
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,120
Jing got information
from the hospital's client,

180
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,000
so we found out Mr. Ji's mom was here.

181
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,799
I just found out as well.

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,799
isn't one of the indicators
for becoming a permanent employee, right?

184
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,679
Mrs. Ji is inside. Go on in.

185
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,279
Mrs. Ji, my colleagues have come to see you.

186
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,039
This is Mr. Ji's mom.

187
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,559
Hello, Mrs. Ji.

188
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,896
You're all so busy with work,
but you've made time to visit me.

189
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:39,360
Thank you for coming.

190
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,960
Not at all. Mr. Ji hid this from us.

191
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,440
If he had told us earlier,

192
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,600
we would have come to see you sooner.

193
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
These flowers are for you.

194
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,544
Give them to me.

195
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:52,720
Mrs. Ji has hired a caregiver.

196
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,519
She will come to take care of it, right?

197
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,879
- Okay.
- Put it here.

198
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,200
Put these things there.

199
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,328
Yeah.

200
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:12,360
Xiaoning, introduce them to me, please.

201
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,399
Okay, they are all from Division One.

202
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,608
This is Ms. Rao.

203
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:17,664
Rao Jing.

204
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:18,752
Mr. Zhao.

205
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:19,919
Zhao Fanggang.

206
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,519
- Miss Tang.
- Hello, Mrs. Ji.

207
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,679
Mr. Li and Mr. Xu.

208
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,919
Jr. Yao and senior Yao.

209
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,559
They're so young as managers.
What about you, Xiaoning?

210
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,320
I'm an assistant and not staffed yet.

211
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,320
So all of you are Xiaoning's superiors.

212
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,720
Please take good care of her at work.

213
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,840
This kid

214
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,664
is kind-hearted and hardworking,

215
00:14:49,664 --> 00:14:51,204
- Also--
- Thank you.

216
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:53,519
Thank you, Mrs. Ji.

217
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,720
I've only come to see Mrs. Ji
two or three times.

218
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,039
Mrs. Ji treats me like family.

219
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,879
Mrs. Ji is really nice.

220
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,639
Would you like an apple? I'll peel one for you.

221
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,759
Mrs. Ji, Mr. Ji and I were in college together.

222
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,039
You can call me Yuhui.

223
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,879
Hello, Yuhui.

224
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,720
You just focus on recuperating.

225
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,840
If you need anything, just let me know.

226
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,159
I've known Mr. Ji for many years.

227
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,120
Both of us get well along

228
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,000
either at work or in life.

229
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,440
I am good at taking care of people.

230
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,279
How could I bother you?

231
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,679
I have a caregiver. And Xiao--

232
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,440
Heng has been looking after me.

233
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
I'm good.

234
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,320
Mrs. Ji, please don't see us as a stranger.

235
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,528
Our department is just like family.

236
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:00,776
[Tu Xiaoning]
Yeah.

237
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,840
Am I right? Won't you also say something?

238
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,039
We are a family. Our department is a family.

239
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,360
Instead of making empty promises,

240
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,440
I prefer to do practical things.

241
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,944
What can I do for you?

242
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:19,960
No need.

243
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,559
Feel free to let me know.

244
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,679
Xiaoning, is there anything I can do?

245
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,759
Jing, how about you help me…

246
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,720
Help Mrs. Ji get some hot water.

247
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,120
Sure, no problem.

248
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,000
Mr. Zhao, please.

249
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,080
- Okay.
- I'll go get the water.

250
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,879
Xiaoning, let me peel the apple.

251
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,840
I used to take care of my mom
when she was sick.

252
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm experienced.

253
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,879
Thank you.

254
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,879
You're welcome.

255
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,639
Mrs. Ji, I'll go and help Jing.

256
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,600
She's a good daughter-in-law.

257
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,240
Look at the madam from bed No. 16.

258
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,159
She's closer to her daughter-in-law.

259
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:06,279
That girl comes here every day,
and even the in-laws come often.

260
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,960
And she keeps making delicious dishes.

261
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,248
Yes, it's the same today.

262
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:10,640
As soon as visitation opened, she came in.

263
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
She doesn't even do personal matters
on the weekend.

264
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,839
I hear that the couple works at the bank.

265
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,880
They are both very busy.

266
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,920
I happen to be passing by.

267
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,648
It's hard to call a taxi. I'll give you a ride.

268
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:31,799
Okay, this one.

269
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,440
Wait a moment.

270
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Why?

271
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,960
I just saw Tu with a man.

272
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,440
That man seems to be Mr. Ji.

273
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,759
Isn't it a bit surprising?

274
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,960
It so happens
I'm traveling to Jinghai on business.

275
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,880
I'm here
to see how the shipyard project is going

276
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,240
Jing.

277
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,279
Don't. It's hot.

278
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,160
Let me help.

279
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,039
Xiaoning, I have underestimated you.

280
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,144
What's wrong?

281
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:09,519
Nothing.

282
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,519
I thought you were not a social person.

283
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:16,759
Unexpectedly, you play the family card
with Mr. Ji's mom.

284
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,119
Mr. Ji is taking care of his mom by himself.

285
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,264
It's too hard for him. I just want to help.

286
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,608
You're not playing the family card?

287
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:26,668
Really?

288
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,160
I didn't expect Mr. Ji's mom to be so ill.

289
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
No wonder he's looked so haggard recently.

290
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,400
Yes, he has to work hard
to earn money, manage the department,

291
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,960
and take care of his mom.

292
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,279
It's really quite tough.

293
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,599
In every aspect,

294
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,039
Mr. Ji is a perfect man.

295
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,839
But his sick mom is a burden on him.

296
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,960
If he finds a woman to marry,

297
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,519
the woman will have to share the burden

298
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,656
with him.

299
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,119
Since they're a family,
the family can't be a burden.

300
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,759
That won't be an issue.

301
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,839
Even though the process is quite tough,

302
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:14,799
there's one more family to rely on.

303
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,904
It's quite happy.

304
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,599
Perhaps, but I believe in the backpack theory.

305
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:26,160
I think interpersonal relationships
are hindrances and burdens.

306
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,640
What I pursue is to travel light,
without burdens.

307
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,200
Jing, after throwing away all the burdens,

308
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,680
can you really be happy?

309
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,599
Tu, what are you talking about?

310
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,600
Mrs. Ji is looking for you

311
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,559
What are you looking at? Anything on my face?

312
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm wondering if you are a burden.

313
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,319
I have saved my mobile number.

314
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,559
And I've friended you on WeChat

315
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,720
If there's anything, just contact me.

316
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,079
Yuheng and I are close.

317
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,160
I'm glad to do anything for you.

318
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,559
Yuheng is so lucky
to have such good colleagues.

319
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,720
I am really happy for him.

320
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,599
Why don't we leave?

321
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,799
Mrs. Ji is sick and needs rest.

322
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,000
We have bothered her for a while.

323
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,319
Mrs. Ji, rest well.

324
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,839
We'll come to see you again.

325
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,559
That's very kind of you. Thank you.

326
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,216
Mrs. Ji, take care.

327
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:42,272
We're leaving.

328
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,440
- Thank you.
- Alright.

329
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,519
We're leaving.

330
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,839
You rest well.

331
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,960
Take care, Mrs. Ji.

332
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,119
Mrs. Ji, keep in touch.

333
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,680
Tu, aren't you leaving?

334
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,319
Tu's family member is sick
and staying in this hospital.

335
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,680
Where is she going?

336
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,119
Let's go.

337
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,519
- Your bag.
- Bye, let's go.

338
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,160
Take it with you.

339
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,279
Mrs. Ji, rest well.

340
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,000
Mom, I was so scared just now.

341
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,759
I didn't expect you to react so quickly.

342
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,720
And you played very well.

343
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,519
I'm afraid they will discover my relationship
with Yuheng.

344
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:29,920
Xiaoning, your relationship
can't be made public.

345
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,440
I feel bad for you.

346
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,359
Don't. Are you talking about Tang Yuhui?

347
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,680
She is quite outstanding, but I'm not worried.

348
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,008
I believe in Yuheng

349
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:45,720
He can handle this relationship very well.

350
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,880
That's good.

351
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:54,200
All these years, Yuheng has only liked you.

352
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,599
It takes a while to discover something.

353
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,208
Is that so?

354
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,079
You've been in a bad mood recently.

355
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,079
Did you have a fight with Yuheng?

356
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,000
No, we didn't.

357
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,599
You must have problems at work.

358
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,640
Don't be like Yuheng,

359
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,359
keeping everything to yourself.

360
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,799
I remember when his dad passed away

361
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,000
and he failed his college entrance exam,

362
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,319
he was down for quite a while.

363
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,000
I really wanted to comfort him.

364
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,920
But he wouldn't say anything.

365
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,319
And then what happened?

366
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:56,680
Later on, somehow he picked himself up again.

367
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,079
He was in school again.

368
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,039
I don't know who influenced him

369
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,720
or if he figured it out himself.

370
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,000
I want to tell you

371
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
that in one's lifetime,

372
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,119
there will always be ups and downs.

373
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,160
No matter how hard it gets,

374
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:27,759
you will get through it if you persevere.

375
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,119
[Impatient]
Zhao, are you not going to see Mr. Li?

376
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,440
- No, I'm not.
- Okay.

377
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
- You're not going?
- I'm not.

378
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,640
- You go ahead.
- We're leaving.

379
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,799
- Alright, bye.
- Take care.

380
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,359
- I'll get the car.
- Jing.

381
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,039
- Be safe.
- Okay, bye.

382
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,792
The weather's nice, isn't it?

383
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,440
It's still early.
Let's spend the weekend together

384
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,279
Do you have plans?

385
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,352
No, I don't.

386
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,119
But why do I have to spend the weekend
with you?

387
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,200
What's wrong with you?

388
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,256
Here's the thing.

389
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,559
We had a good time
spending the New Year together.

390
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,559
So we might have a good time too
spending a weekend together.

391
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,960
It's better than being alone, right?

392
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,160
Mr. Zhao, are you asking me out right now?

393
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,784
Sort of.

394
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:42,680
Look, we are colleagues as well as competitors.

395
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,920
It's not appropriate to meet
over the weekend, right?

396
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,720
Just don't consider us colleagues.

397
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,288
I think we might be quite a good match.

398
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:06,839
Getting together is not bad for us.

399
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,200
Are you proposing that we're together?

400
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,200
Are you thinking about that?

401
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,880
About what?

402
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,696
A marriage of convenience with me?

403
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:26,816
You…

404
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,559
Oh, no.

405
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:32,320
Look at your face.

406
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,440
The taxi has arrived.

407
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,759
Not gonna happen. I'm leaving.

408
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,559
See you.

409
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,920
I must be crazy.

410
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,160
How could I fancy her?

411
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,160
What's wrong with you?

412
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,896
Sorry about that.

413
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,559
You keep running. I'll take a call.

414
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,759
Okay.

415
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,000
Mind your pace.

416
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,359
Hello, dad, why didn't you message me back?

417
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:21,680
Nothing. Just checking in on you.

418
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,960
Anyway,

419
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,720
while you're busy at work,
take good care of your health.

420
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,359
Oh, here's one more thing.

421
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,680
Qi Yu passed the police exam.

422
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,599
I always knew he would pass.

423
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,200
Alright, I have to go. Bye.

424
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,024
I'm coming.

425
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:51,559
Let's go.

426
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,608
Slow down.

[Transfer 50,000 yuan]

428
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,248
You've transferred money to me?

429
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,079
I saw your repayment reminder.

430
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,920
We're not short of money, why owe it?

431
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,559
I'll repay it as planned. You don't have to.

432
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,240
I help you as your girlfriend.

433
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,279
I don't want you to work too hard

434
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,240
and bear unnecessary stress.

435
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,759
What's wrong? Upset?

436
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,359
No, I want to repay the money myself.

437
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,319
Fine, I just don't want you to work so hard.

438
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:42,376
So don't get me wrong.

00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,319
How about we eat Wagyu beef tonight?

440
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,920
A friend of mine opened a Wagyu restaurant.

441
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,496
There's a discount today.

442
00:27:50,496 --> 00:27:52,319
I planned to order a few dishes

443
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,759
and cook for you at home.

444
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,680
No. You've been tired from running.

445
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,160
I can't let you cook for me.

446
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,720
Listen, people need to make a reservation

447
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,440
a week in advance.

448
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,119
I need to send a message to my friend.

449
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,000
Okay, if you like it, let's just eat.

450
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,079
He picked himself up and was in school again.

451
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:27,640
I don't know who influenced him

452
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,160
or if he figured it out himself.

453
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,440
Could it be the girl he's been thinking about?

454
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,800
Xiaoning, let's go.

455
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,200
The visiting hours are over.
You can't go in now.

I just got back from Zhouyang.

457
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,400
Traffic was jammed
because of an accident on the road.

If you can't make it,
don't agree to mom's request.

459

She has been waiting for you.

460

I'm sorry.

I saw it.

463

Hello, Dr. Zhou.

467
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,640
Your mom's test report is out.

468
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,240
We've had a consultation with department heads

469
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,928
and reviewed your mom's health indicators.

470
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,759
So, what are the results?

471
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,680
Can she use that special medication?

472
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,039
We unanimously agree

473
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
that given your mom's current condition,

474
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,440
it's worth trying the medication.

475
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,279
That's great.

476
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,352
When can my mom start using this medication?

477
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:05,359
Next week is possible.

478
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,599
However, I still need to remind you

479
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,240
that you pay for this expensive medication.

480
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,680
Besides, it's hard to say

481
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,799
how it will work.

482
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:18,720
So you need to think about it.

483
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,759
Of course, we'll use it.

484
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,759
We will use this medication.

485
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:25,599
Dr. Zhou, please arrange it
as soon as possible.

486
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,759
- Thank you.
- Alright.

487
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,839
Your hair is so long.
Doesn't it block your view?

488
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,768
A little.

489
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,200
Are you going to see your mom like this?

490
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,920
Aren't you embarrassed?

491
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,200
I have no time to take care of my hair.

492
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,176
How is it?

493
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,039
Looks good. That's it.

You cut it outside when you have the time.

496
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,200
I saw her son.

497
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,759
He cried
and regretted not seeing his mom one last time.

498
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,799
Mom looked so sad.

499
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,720
I was sad too.

500
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:50,119
I know you're working very hard
to earn money for mom's treatment.

501
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,720
But I'm afraid

502
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,359
you will regret not spending enough time

503
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,240
with mom when mom is alive.

504
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,440
So I want to discuss something with you.

505
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,240
How about we sell the house?

506
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,000
Then we will have the money for treatment.

507
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,279
And you'll have more time to be with mom.

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,416
What do you think?

509
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,464
I'm sorry.

510
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,920
I've let you down.

511
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,319
I have been avoiding problems.

512
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,640
Mom really needs emotional support right now.

513
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,039
She feels afraid the most.

514
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,400
We should give her enough sense of security.

515
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,319
You can give her moral support.

516
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:57,279
Besides, things change.

517
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,640
When dad passed away, you were alone.

518
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,680
Now, you have me.

519
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,400
Whatever happens, I'll be there for you.

520
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,000
I'll be with you. I won't let you feel lonely.

521
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,119
We don't need to sell the house.

522
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,599
You don't need to worry about the money.

523
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,519
Just leave it all to me.

524
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,319

00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,544
No problem.

542
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,599
Tu, you look busy.

543
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,416
Ms. Rao.

544
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,239
Xiaoning.

545
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,400
It seems you have lost interest
in marketing clients.

546
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,440
Did you know that something would happen?

547
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,320
Jing, what do you mean?

548
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,840
Never mind, anyway.

549
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,400
The point is,

550
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,744
do your job step by step. Got it?

551
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,440
Yes.

552
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,528
Good.

553
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,239
I've been pondering
since I got back from the hospital.

554
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,400
Are Mr. Ji and Tang together?

555
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,559
In the hospital,

556
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,440
Tang was so nick to Mr. Ji's mom.

557
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,119
She tucked her in and peeled fruit for her.

558
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:41,216
Mr. Zhao.

559
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:45,000
You called me out just to say that?

560
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,440
Well, can't you have a little imagination?

561
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,039
I've been thinking about it.

562
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,159
Our company's rule is somewhat inhumane.

563
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,519
Look, Liu Xiaoli from Division Two

564
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,320
has been transferred away
for almost half a year.

565
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,719
That's true. The rule is a bit inhumane.

566
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,079
Did you refuse me because of that?

567
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,199
Don't worry about it.

568
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,679
I have looked into this.

569
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:14,719
Our company doesn't explicitly forbid couples
from holding the same position.

570
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,960
Liu Xiaoli was transferred
after getting married.

571
00:37:22,368 --> 00:37:24,159
Go on.

572
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,519
Besides, if the two of us decide
to be together,

573
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,039
we will see how we get along first.

574
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:34,840
No need to think too much.

575
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,880
Let's see what's happening.

576
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:48,280
Mr. Zhao, you've actually looked into it?

577
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,440
Yes, I have.

578
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,880
So you mean

579
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,960
we're getting serious in a relationship?

580
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,360
I'm over 30, not as young as your exes.

581
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,599
I'm serious about a relationship.

582
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,599
I know

583
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,800
starting a relationship will add weight
to your backpack.

584
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,239
And it will also make you feel constrained.

585
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:20,119
But at the same time,
you will not feel lonely, right?

586
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:22,159
We must bravely open it

587
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:25,239
and accept the beauty of this world.

588
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,239
Mr. Zhao, how can you ensure

589
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:36,599
that the things in my backpack

590
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,960
won't be taken away in the end?

591
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,840
This amulet will keep Mrs. Ji safe and sound.

592
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,912
Thank you.

593
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,920
Yes, Ji Yuheng hasn't given up.

594
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,119
Mom hasn't given up either, so I can't give up.

595
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,760
I must have confidence

596
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,000
so that when I am with her in the hospital,

597
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,360
I can give my mom a lot of moral support.

598
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,199
How time flies.

599
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:34,039
Suddenly, we're heading into our thirties.

600
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,679
I still feel like we're children.

601
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:41,159
How did we come to experience all this?

602
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,639
Never mind. How are things going
with your clients?

603
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:50,639
Zhao referred me to several clients
from the industrial park.

604
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,519
I'm dealing with them.

605
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:55,440
I was a bit eager for quick success before.

606
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,239
Then I began to doubt myself.

607
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:58,599
Now I've figured it out.

608
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,679
Take it slow. No rush.

609
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,920
What's there to be afraid of?

610
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,440
No matter what, my dad's got your back.

611
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,559
I can't always rely on your dad, can I?

612
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:09,079
If I'm staffed,

613
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,719
will I still bother your dad?

614
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,519
Why not?

615
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,960
After all, the banking business

616
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,840
is just about lending
and attracting deposits, right?

617
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,679
So why can't my dad do business

618
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:20,320
with your bank?

619
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,519
No need.

620
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,440
Don't you have any confidence in me?

621
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,960
I believe in you. You can do it.

622
00:40:26,848 --> 00:40:28,936
Let's go.

623
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
The results are good.

624
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,800
Really?

625
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,119
After your mom takes the medicine,
the metastasized lesions have shrunk.

626
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,519
It seems her illness is well controlled.

627
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,519
So, does it mean
if my mom continues the medication,

628
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:00,119
her health will keep improving?

629
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,880
That's hard to say.

630
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,400
Inevitably, any medication

631
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,599
could lead to drug resistance issues.

632
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,320
But don't worry.

633
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,440
Your mom's current condition is good.

634
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,320
In that case,

635
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,119
she can be discharged to recuperate at home.

636
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,304
Thank you very much.

637
00:41:37,124 --> 00:41:40,840
[She is the Dazzling Light]

638
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,519
Guys, gather up.

639
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,159
Today, we have the PE midterm exam.
Class one goes first.

640
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:49,288
Good, hurry up.

641
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,960
It's okay. I can do it by myself.

642
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,152
He seems to be alone.

643
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,559
Who's working with Ji Yuheng?

644
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:13,952
Help him press his ankles down.

645
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:15,104
I don't want to.

646
00:42:15,104 --> 00:42:16,199
Neither do I.

647
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,360
His dad betrayed his friend.

648
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,039
Who dares to deal with him?

649
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,280
Exactly.

650
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,440
What happened to his dad?

651
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,800
His dad is in trouble.

652
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,360
Does anyone want to?

653
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,400
Sir, can I?

654
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,559
Okay, come on.

655
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,599
Guys, get ready.

656
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:47,760
