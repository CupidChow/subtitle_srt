[Episode 8]

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,239
Well done, Sis.
Renji Hospital is a major institution.

33
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,640
Previously, the payroll distribution
was always handled by Xinfa Bank.

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,079
She's managed to snatch it, sis. Impressive!

35
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,519
Let me tell you, the clients
that can be taken over

36
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,599
don't belong to them from the beginning.

37
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,400
And the clients that end up in my hands,

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
will not be let go again.

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,680
Dominant.

40
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,728
Congratulations, Jing.

41
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,680
Congratulations, Ms. Rao!

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,719
People do have all kinds of
different situations.

43
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,080
Your year-end bonus is probably
more than all of ours combined, right?

44
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,680
I'm in a bad spot, being targeted by the boss.

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
I still have a non-performing loan
that hasn't been dealt with.

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,439
I was hoping for a salary raise
at the end of the year

47
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,520
to have a bit more pocket money.

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
Tu, it's not happening.

49
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,120
Speaking of your non-performing loan,
how's it going?

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,639
Waiting to deal with the collateral.

51
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,080
Didn't they add a third-party
corporate guarantee?

52
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,800
They are not in a hurry to sell the collateral.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,520
Commercial buildings in a remote suburb.

54
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,319
Who would bid for them? Who would?

55
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,560
A failure to auction once means
the collateral's value will be discounted.

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,840
Thirty million in non-performing loans,
it's over, it's done.

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,120
I just hope now for a kind person
to come and save me.

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,719
Bless me, bless me.

59
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,719
Ms. Rao. Mr. Zhao.

60
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,224
I need your help to have a meal with me.

61
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,280
No problem.

62
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,639
I'm sorry, Mr. Ji, I need to…

63
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,800
Tu, join us tonight as well.

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Drive us back after it's over.

65
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,960
- Okay.
- Thanks.

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,112
Not going?

67
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,719
Mr. Ji is being too stingy, right?

68
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,520
After all, we are
entertaining clients at a meal.

69
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,039
If he didn't choose an elegant
Western restaurant,

70
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,800
he should have at least found
a private restaurant with good quality, right?

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,319
Mr. Zhao, you're always frugal,

72
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,960
but how come when others invite you to eat,

73
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
you suddenly become generous?

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
No matter who is being invited,

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,439
clients need to feel valued.

76
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,439
Is this place presentable enough?

77
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,840
I think it's okay.

78
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,199
I'm sure Mr. Ji had his reasons to choose here.

79
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,919
The reason is that he comes from
Internal Control and Compliance Dept.

80
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,240
He has a high and mighty attitude.

81
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,800
But I'll take the opportunity to learn

82
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,319
how he, a complete novice in business,
is going to talk about business.

83
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,719
Isn't that Mr. Jiang from the tech park?

84
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,599
Doesn't he always avoid social engagements?

85
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,759
So, you should really learn from this today.

86
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,439
Junior brother Ji.

87
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,680
The restaurant you've chosen is really nice.

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,519
The environment is generous and simple.

89
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,639
The dishes are affordable and delicious.

90
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,560
Your down-to-earth
and unpretentious work attitude

91
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,759
is worth learning from for everyone.

92
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,800
- I'm glad you like it.
- I do.

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Mr. Jiang, let me introduce myself again.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,959
I'm Rao Jing, Senior Account Manager.

95
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,800
Let me offer another toast to you.

96
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,160
A strong general has no weak soldiers.

97
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,319
Let me pour you another glass.

98
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,279
Mr. Jiang, let me introduce myself again.

99
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,600
I am Zhao Fanggang,
Senior Account Manager at Dairui.

100
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
I'll toast to you first,
and then to our Mr. Ji.

101
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,639
Thank you, Mr. Ji, for inviting us

102
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,639
so that we have the honor
to witness Mr. Jiang's grace.

103
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,959
I'll drink up. Feel free to do as you please

104
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,960
I'm flattered.

105
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,560
Tu.

106
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,720
Senior brother, your drinking capacity
is still as good as ever.

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,879
Tu is our assistant on the business side.

108
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,160
She's driving today, so we won't let her drink.

109
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,800
Put it down, put it down.

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,639
Actually, we don't promote
drinking at the table.

111
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,120
Those who can drink
can have a couple of drinks.

112
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,560
For those who can't drink,
there's juice available.

113
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,800
Then I'll toast to you
with tea instead of liquor.

114
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,439
I'm very honored to meet you.

115
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,800
I too will use tea
instead of wine for toasting.

116
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,399
Come, senior brother, try these dishes.

117
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:42,160
No matter how busy work is,
health is still the most important.

118
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,639
Yes, indeed.

119
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,399
I heard that you're not only
in charge of planning now,

120
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,544
but also the heavy responsibility
of attracting investment for the entire park

121
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:50,439
is all on you now.

122
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,959
Zhao told you, didn't he?

123
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,639
Yes.

124
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,959
To be honest, I get a headache
just thinking about it.

125
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,959
You're worried about those
large manufacturing companies

126
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,600
not finding a suitable office location, right?

127
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,240
You're quite well-informed
to know about this matter.

128
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,944
To tell you the truth,

129
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:08,160
our Mr. Zhao

130
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,959
does have very suitable
commercial office buildings

131
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,680
that we can offer to you for free use.

132
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,920
Junior brother, this is surely a losing deal.

133
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,160
Not only that,

134
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,360
we can also solve the problem of settlement

135
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,600
for the entire park's small businesses.

136
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,279
Provided that I let Dairui handle

137
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,360
the park enterprises' loan business, right?

138
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,920
That's right.

139
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,079
Not to hide from you,
given the scale of our park,

140
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,279
this is a big piece of cake.

141
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,000
And during this time,

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,160
several banks have already contacted me.

143
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,800
However, I believe you are also aware

144
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,560
that big companies
look at the macro perspective,

145
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,519
while small businesses need services
that are practical and have strong operability.

146
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,319
If speaking from the overall hard power,

147
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,199
Dairui may not match other big banks,

148
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,920
but when it comes
to actual practical operations,

149
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,079
we have an absolute advantage.

150
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,879
That's right, Mr. Jiang. Mr. Ji is correct.

151
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,440
Moreover, previously we provided similar
financial services for the investment

152
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,399
promotion office of Tong County.

153
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,399
Therefore, we have already

154
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,800
summarized a very efficient set of processes.

155
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,000
If our cooperation goes smoothly,

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,519
in the future, when investment promotion
and industrial settlement begins,

157
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,759
we can continue to solve problems
for other small enterprises.

158
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,680
It's a triple win, Mr. Jiang, cheers.

159
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,720
Wait a moment.

160
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,839
I didn't expect you young people
to see things so clearly

161
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,560
and have such a long-term vision.

162
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,600
Good, come to my company another day,
and we'll talk in detail.

163
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,639
Senior, I look forward to working with you.

164
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,784
- Come on.
- Come on.

165
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,600
Happy cooperation.

166
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,040
Actually, ordinarily, I don't drink much.

167
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,120
But I'm so happy talking with you today.

168
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,360
Here, Mr. Jiang. Finish your glass,

169
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,600
and I'll drink up.

170
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,639
I'll drink first as a sign of respect.

171
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,160
I'll drink this glass
with you, Mr. Jiang, please.

172
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,879
Our Mr. Zhao can also
hold his liquor quite well.

173
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,840
Come on, Mr. Zhao, come on.

174
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,639
Mr. Jiang, it seems your phone is ringing.

175
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,728

Okay, let me see you off.

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
I suddenly remembered

195
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,120
that there was still something
that hadn't been confirmed.

does it also come with conditions?

199
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:39,600
Yes, the loan quota must meet our requirements.

200
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,039
If we calculate based on the standards
for unsold auction items,

00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,159
Senior, I think it's more
cost-effective to buy them.

202

Ji Yuheng, you're slier than
when you were in school.

203

After all calculations,
you're the one profiting.

You know the standards for loan quotas

You should take him home first.

A slap followed by a date,
a sugar-coated cannonball.

242
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,799
You talk about 'irreconcilable
differences" every day,

243
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,279

pretty well at the wine table.

Now, you can't figure out even this bit.

If he can make peace with me,
I'll write my name backward.

Here we go again.

gossiping about him to me,

262

Do I need you to fend for me?

267

And even if we are fighting,

273

an internal matter for our department.

all alone and pitiable,

Who sent it?

Although you are in different departments,

358
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,960
showing off affection
should be done in moderation.

359
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,440
Otherwise, it's easy to arouse jealousy.

Was that bouquet sent by Ji Yuheng?

Ji Yuheng's negligible shortcomings

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,160
are nothing at all.

Yes. I just learned it.

That's not difficult.

403

to recommend our bank's investment
services and credit cards to the doctors.

I see you've made some
progress in business recently.

00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:45,680
Our school is quite big.

530
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,680
It is indeed easy to get lost
the first time you come.

531
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,400
Classmate, why didn't your
girlfriend come to pick you up?

532
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,160
She's not my girlfriend.

533
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,279
Oh, she's your crush,
and you're here to confess.

534
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:02,240
It's her birthday today.

535
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,279
The girls' dormitory is right there. Good luck.

536
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,680
Xiaoning, happy birthday.

537
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:24,160
I don't know what color of roses you like.

538
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,119
[Xiaoning, happy birthday]
So I have prepared a bit of each.

539
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:30,680
Do you… Do you see any you like?

540
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
I like this one.

541
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,720
I'll remember it. Xiaoning, I…

542
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,440
Xiaoning, I like you.

543
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,519
I want to buy all the blue roses
in the world for you.

544
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,599
I hope you can give me this chance.

545
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,720
Say yes to him, say yes to him.

546
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:09,920
Say yes, say yes.

547
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:18,279
Hug him. Hug him.

548
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,359
Kiss.

549
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:39,519
Kiss him. Kiss him.

550
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,519
What's wrong with me today?

551
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,039
I should have clearly said
that I thought it was from him.

552
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:21,800
Then it wouldn't have been so awkward.

553
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,119
I need to clarify matters
regarding Lu Sijing as soon as possible.

554
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,000
I cannot let this kind of thing happen again.

555
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,232
Tu, why did you throw away the flowers?

556
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,400
Did you have a quarrel?

557
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,880
No.

558
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,199
Did he bully you?

559
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,280
Tell me, and I'll teach him a lesson.

560
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,360
No.

561
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,280
What are you talking about?

562
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,719
Just chatting.

563
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,000
We're not talking about you, Mr. Ji.

564
00:34:55,488 --> 00:34:57,576
Come to the conference room.

565
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:18,119
No need for further introduction, right?

566
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,719
Mr. Shen, the guarantor
of your non-performing loan.

567
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,440
Mr. Shen, I've heard so much about you.

568
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,400
I've tried to make several
appointments with you to no avail.

569
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,639
Today, I finally get to meet you.

570
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,039
You don't need to beat around the bush with me.

571
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:36,880
Mr. Ji, let's get straight to the point.

572
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,048
Okay.

573
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,880
Since your account manager has arrived,

574
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,719
I'll get straight to the point as well.

575
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,400
The court auction
of the collateral is imminent.

576
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,719
We've called you here this time

577
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:52,400
hoping that you could do us a favor

578
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,559
to prevent this collateral
from being auctioned off.

579
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,679
What do you mean?

580
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,119
You don't have to do anything.

581
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,800
Just participate in the auction this time.

582
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,239
Mr. Ji, Manager Zhao, are you here
to help me solve a problem

583
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,559
or create one?

584
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,440
Mr. Shen, please calm down.

585
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,039
We are afraid you might litigate.

586
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,400
Just look at how many cases have been judged

587
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,320
and in the end, the guarantor
still has to pay in full.

588
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,039
Like Mr. Ji said,

589
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:23,559
if you participate in the auction,
you will lose less.

590
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:26,599
Besides, litigating is time-consuming
and troublesome.

591
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,920
Right now, we are grasshoppers
on the same rope.

592
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,360
Mr. Shen, since you've come to Dairui today,

593
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,639
it shows that you have trust in us.

594
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,360
We hope you can trust us

595
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,320
and let us work together to solve this problem.

596
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,840
Then tell me specifically
how I need to cooperate.

597
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,519
Mr. Shen, if you have any doubts on your side,

598
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,039
feel free to call me; I'm available 24/7.

599
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,072
Please hurry.

600
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:16,096
Thank you.

601
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:18,248
Thank you.

602
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,496
Bye.

603
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,360
Why help me?

604
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,280
It's not just about helping you.
It's more for the department.

605
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,440
Please make extra effort
with Mr. Shen to follow up.

606
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,079
Rest assured.

607
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,119
I will make sure to coordinate properly
with both Mr. Shen and Mr. Jiang.

608
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,864
Mr. Ji.

609
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:58,248
Thank you.

610
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,872
Go back to work.

611
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,960
When did I become so coy and cheesy?

612
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,519
Actually, our Mr. Ji is
really not a bad person.

613
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,679
There might indeed be a tiny bit of room
for improvement in his character,

614
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,800
but after all, he has been abroad alone

615
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,000
studying for so long,

616
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,320
so it's quite normal that he isn't
good at expressing his feelings.

617
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,760
This time, he gave Zhao a helping hand.

618
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,280
It fully demonstrated Mr. Ji's
responsibility and commitment.

619
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,960
Listen to this, just listen.

620
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,360
This underlying tone of pride and arrogance.

621
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,639
You're quite comfortable

622
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,880
with the role reservist wife.

623
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,400
Can you endure another year
before becoming Mrs. Ji officially?

624
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,159
It's not up to me.

625
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:58,360
We had agreed
before starting this relationship.

626
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,519
We also set our own KPI.

627
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:03,000
Whoever doesn't meet them, leaves.

628
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:06,559
I must say, you two are truly
career-oriented individuals.

629
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:08,616
KPI, wow.

630
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,280
Well, how have you met
these key performance indicators?

631
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,440
To become official, I even
turned Lu Sijing into a client.

632
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,800
I'm working from daybreak to dusk

633
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,239
and preparing for exams at night
when I get back home.

634
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,239
But you made time to accompany me for a facial.

635
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,440
I knew it, it must be true love between us.

636
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,239
Of course, you've sought me out
three times this week.

637
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,079
Come on, what's the matter?

638
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,159
Taking shelter.

639
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,519
What happened?

640
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:40,880
I'm hiding from Qi Yu.

641
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,239
You don't know

642
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:46,880
how many foolish things he's done
recently to chase after me.

643
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,936
Tell me about it.

644
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,559
Didn't I post on Moments on Wednesday

645
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,880
saying that I didn't get the concert tickets?

646
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,159
He rode the bus three times

647
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:58,920
to the outskirts of the city
to buy me a scalped ticket,

648
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,199
which turned out to be fake at first glance,
but that's not the worst part.

649
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,159
The worst part was,
I left a pair of shoes at the door.

650
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,719
Obviously, I didn't want them anymore.

651
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,880
He, however, went out to buy some glue,

652
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,679
stuck them back, and brought them to me.

653
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,840
Isn't that irritating?

654
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,400
It sounds quite touching.

655
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,928
Qi Yu's love for you

656
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:20,079
is that kind of simple,
unadorned, profound love.

657
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,960
Belated affection is worthless;
I don't care for it at all.

658
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,199
Where are you now?
I've just finished working overtime.

659
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,599
I'll come and pick you up now.

660
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,679
- Isn't that too much trouble?
- Not at all.

661
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,679
I'll come to get you; let's go home together.

662
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,880
Alright, I'm at the spa.

663
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,944
Okay, see you in a bit.

664
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,464
So comfortable.

665
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:10,719
Watching other people
in love is more interesting.

666
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,079
You haven't seen each other
for just a short time. Seriously?

667
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,320
Your eyes are sparkling so fiercely.

668
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,400
They're almost bursting with sparks.

669
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,679
Stop sparkling so fiercely.

670
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,080
Shut up.

671
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,760
Are you tired?

672
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,440
How can she be tired
after lying there for two hours?

673
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,288
Mr. Ji.

674
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,968
What are you doing here?

675
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,320
Mr. Ji, you've put away the document
I gave you just now, right?

676
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
Sorry about that.

677
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,440
I'll be sure to pay more attention next time
and not bring the document home.

678
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,519
Well, we both have things to do.
I'll take my leave first.

679
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,519
Xiaoning, wait a moment.

680
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,760
Sijing has something important to tell you.

681
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,440
I really have things to do.
Let's talk another day.

682
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,536

00:44:16,644 --> 00:44:20,292
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

704
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:27,172
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

705
00:44:27,172 --> 00:44:31,396
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

706
00:44:31,396 --> 00:44:36,132
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

707
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:39,268
♫ To you and no one else ♫

708
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:44,100
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

709
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,276
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

710
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:49,452
♫ No one knows ♫

711
00:44:50,344 --> 00:44:52,612
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

712
00:44:52,612 --> 00:44:55,980
♫ I hope you know ♫

713
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:04,036
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

714
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:09,476
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

715
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:16,228
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

716
00:45:16,228 --> 00:45:20,484
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

717
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:25,636
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

718
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:28,580
♫ To you and no one else ♫

719
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:33,252
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

720
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:35,684
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

721
00:45:35,684 --> 00:45:38,892
♫ No one knows ♫

722
00:45:39,464 --> 00:45:41,668
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

723
00:45:41,668 --> 00:45:45,836
♫ I hope you know ♫
