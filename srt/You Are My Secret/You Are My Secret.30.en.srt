You're back.

34
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,079
Why haven't you gone to sleep yet?

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,359
Locked.

36
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,159
Feeling a bit troubled.

37
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,159
I just took Weiyi home.

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,840
How is Qi Yu doing?

39
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,864
Not good.

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,519
Ling Weiyi had been crying.

41
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,120
I didn't know how to comfort her.

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,519
They've been in a relationship
for so many years.

43
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,840
From college till now.

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,359
But no matter what,

45
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,528
I know they both loved each other.

46
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:11,560
Yes.

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,400
I've never thought
there would be such a result.

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,039
Love relationship
is about taking care of the present.

49
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,800
So everything will be
very simple and beautiful.

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
But when it comes to marriage,

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,840
there's a lot to think about.

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,080
So they are facing these real problems now.

53
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,240
Seeing the two of them like this

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,960
makes me feel so lucky.

55
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,599
Thank you, Ji.

56
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,319
Thank you for choosing me.

57
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,599
And I want to thank myself

58
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,520
for saying yes back then.

59
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,120
Thanks mostly to you.

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,759
Tu, there's a message from Mr. Fu Junior.

61
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,080
We have to meet tomorrow.

62
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,919
We're going to have to work overtime
tonight to refine the proposal.

63
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,919
See you at the bank.

64
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,088
Alright.

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,400
I've made some proposals. Let's check them out.

66
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,199
Ling Weiyi can't go to bed,
and wants me to go keep her company.

67
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,080
Perfect, I need to go out as well.

68
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,120
Qi Yu wants to have another drink with me.

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,280
What a coincidence.

70
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,439
- Let me take you first.
- No need.

71
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,400
I can call a designated driver or take a taxi.

72
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,319
Alright, it's so late. Let's take taxis.

73
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,719
Okay, let's go.

74
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,736
Let's go.

75
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,360
It's so late now, and he's not going home.

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,400
In the middle of the night, is Zhao going out?

77
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,400
He said he left
some important documents at the bank,

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,240
had to rush back to get them.

79
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,159
Bank President Ji is also out of the home?

80
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,288
Right.

81
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:21,120
Looks like our opponent tomorrow
is quite apparent.

82
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,399
These two men are childish and hypocritical.

83
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,240
We are just competing for the same client.

84
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,079
What's there to hide?

85
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,040
Exactly. But when we left,

86
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,319
we didn't tell them the truth, right?

87
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,640
No.

88
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,839
When Zhao Fanggang left,
I was still pretending to sleep at home.

89
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,279
So he must think I'm at home right now.

90
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,360
You are hypocritical too.

91
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,439
The business world is like a battlefield.

92
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:53,399
Deception happens everywhere.

93
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,920
Work on the proposal now. Hurry.

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,560
Jing, be careful. Zhao might play the fool.

95
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
That guy?

96
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,160
He doesn't know any trick.

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,240
But you should be careful
of your Bank President Ji.

98
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,639
He is truly crafty and cunning.

99
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,040
But he said he went out for drinks
with my bestie's boyfriend.

100
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,319
And I knew it right away.

101
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,199
Zhao Fanggang can't pull any tricks.

102
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,560
I think it's about done.

103
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,079
Come on, take a look.

104
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,399
So sleepy. I don't even remember
how many cups of coffee I've had today.

105
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,800
I heard Mr. Fu Junior

106
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,519
is comparing two banks now.

107
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,319
It might be an internal struggle at Dairui.

108
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,360
I don't think so.
Ms. Rao was asleep when I left.

109
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,519
Logically, meeting such a big client,

110
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,319
she definitely wouldn't be sleeping soundly.

111
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,600
If you are that curious,

112
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,199
just make a phone call and you'll know.

113
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,040
How can that be? She's pregnant now.

114
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,639
It's not easy to get a sound sleep.

115
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,639
I don't want it.

116
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,959
After all, I don't want my wife

117
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,399
to interact with Mr. Fu Junior too much.

118
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,680
Why?

119
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,600
I heard that when Mr. Fu Junior was abroad,

120
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
he was an excellent playboy.

121
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
He changed his girlfriends like a flash.

122
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
And they are all in different types.

123
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,040
What does it call in the TV drama?

124
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,879
A flippant libertine. Right.

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,560
You're still so gossipy.

126
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,000
We just need to do our own job well.

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,639
Don't comment too much
on the client's emotional preferences.

128
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,464
Okay.

when he left after me?

00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,600
No, I must meet Mr. Fu Junior before him.

132

Hello, Xiaoning.

133
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,839
I just scratched my car
when I made a wrong turn.

134
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,639
I thought I saw your car
and you were nearby, right?

135
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,199
Can you come over and help me?

136
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,240
Is it serious? Where exactly are you now?

137
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,439
I'm right at the main entrance
of the Aijin Garden District.

138
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,920
Okay, I'm coming over now.

139

- Wait for me.
- Okay.

140
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,720
Sorry, I'll come over in a bit.

141
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,680
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

142
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,120
I wonder if there was a car scrape around here.

143
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,240
- Car scrape?
- Yes.

144
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,079
No. Was it in this district?

145
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,480
Yes, it was that white car.

146
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,160
I really didn't see it.

147
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
Okay, then I'll go take a look.

- Alright, no problem.
- Thanks.

Hello, Mr. Fu.

154
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:02,320
I am Tu Xiaoning, the Account Manager
from Star City branch of Dairui Bank.

155
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,039
Hello. Accountant Zhou, how do I
reduce the print size on this printer?

156
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,200
I can't figure it out.

157
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,320
Let me see.

158
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,840
There's something wrong
with the printer's programming.

159
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,320
I'll have the administration
get a maintenance guy to check it out.

160
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,879
No need. Let me see.

161
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,039
It seems there's an issue
with the reduction printing command.

162
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,088
Just a little adjustment will do.

163
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Mr. Fu, how small do you want
the business license reduced to?

164
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,080
Just fit on a blank sheet of paper.

165
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,399
Thank you.

166
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,799
It seems that you are very proactive

167
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,159
in solving problems.

168
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,960
Not at all. Practice makes perfect.

169
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,200
We often help clients
reduce the size of their business licenses.

170
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,399
So I am familiar with doing it.

171
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,392
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

172
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
When I visited you last time,

173
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,039
I noticed that you are
quite interested in coffee.

174
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,919
This is from a new hand-drip coffee shop
next to our company.

175
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,080
Please have a taste.

176
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,720
Thank you, Ms. Tu.
You have good observational skills.

177
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,519
I've checked your proposal.

178
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,799
It's a good idea to use the
letter of credit instead of loans.

179
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,639
But as far as I know, the letter of credit
doesn't seem to be that convenient.

180
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,559
Upon expiration, I have to deal with
bill of exchange or payments on behalf.

181
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,000
Ms. Tu, what do you think of it?

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,759
I propose the letter of credit
because of the cost.

183
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,639
Youpin Tea is a major taxpayer in Star City.

184
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,039
You have sufficient tax bills.

185
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,919
So if you go for the letter of credit,

186
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:17,600
your cost will be much less
than taking out a loan.

187
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,519
As for the inconvenience you mentioned,

188
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,200
our bank has also upgraded
the letter of credit process.

189
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,399
It can be processed fast now,
you can rest assured about this.

190
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,759
If I'm correct,

191
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,519
I think you want to make
fast moving consumer beverages.

192
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,519
Then the offline costs will be plenty.

193
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,399
If you are willing to collaborate with us,

194
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,000
I can apply for a waiver
of your commission and acceptance fee.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,519
That will save you some more money.

196
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,120
You're quite adept at
playing to people's emotions.

197
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,080
No, this is not about
playing to people's emotions.

198
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,799
I prefer to consider things
from the client's perspective.

199
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,639
Bank President Ji,
are you here to talk business?

200
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,960
The client you mentioned before…

201
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,240
Didn't you say there was a car scrape?

202
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,200
Shouldn't you wait for me at the entrance?

203
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,559
I've checked on it.

204
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,759
It's nothing serious.
Work is still the priority.

205
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,279
So I went upstairs for work.

206
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,679
Sorry to make you worry.

207
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,279
It's nothing serious.

208
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,888
But on the client matter,
you are always saying I'm lacking integrity.

209
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:27,000
What about you?

210
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,960
I was out of options.

211
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,759
For clients like Mr. Fu Junior,

212
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,720
I'm sure a lot of people
deliver their proposals.

213
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,360
It's all about who meets him first
and leaves a lasting impression

214
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,159
No matter how great the following people say,
it's ineffective and lacks novelty.

215
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,159
After all, these proposals
are all quite similar, aren't they?

216
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,240
You sound straightforward.

217
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,279
Where's Zhao? Why isn't he here?

218
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,960
How dare he to let you
handle the business alone.

219
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,440
Rao Jing isn't here too.

220
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,960
Jing is sick.

221
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,080
She worked overtime last night,
so needs to go to the hospital today.

222
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,679
Zhao has to accompany his wife
who worked overtime last night

223
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,519
and today is feeling unwell to the hospital.

224
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,399
Alright. I'll be leaving then.

225
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,600
Just a friendly reminder.

226
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,240
Mr. Fu Junior seems to have
a business meeting in the afternoon.

227
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,080
I wonder if there is time for you today.

228
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,440
Anyway, good luck.

229
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,960
Today is the first time to meet Mr. Fu Junior.

230
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,440
Nothing is settled yet.
Don't get that excited too soon.

231
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,488
Annoying.

232
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,759
Since Mr. Fu Junior wants
to collaborate with us,

233
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:52,360
you go ahead and finish up that process.

234
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,600
I've just come out of the hospital.
There's nothing serious.

235
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,800
I'll be at the bank shortly.

236
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,240
We got all these. Don't you do the checkup?

237
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,519
I'm fine, why waste the money?

238
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,360
Okay, Rao Jing. You are fooling me around.

239
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,399
I'm not.

240
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,279
But rest assured,
your Bank President Ji has been fooled.

241
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,399
So you two are the same.

242
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,200
He won't blame you.

243
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,440
This trick won't work every time.

244
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,120
This is the first big client

245
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,120
that Ji gave me after I entered Ji'an Branch.

246
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,176
I won't give up.

247
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,799
Honey, let me ask you.

248
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,519
Between me and Ji Yuheng, who is your boss?

249
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,200
In life, it's definitely you.

250
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,672
But at work, it has to be Mr. Ji.

251
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:37,720
Let me ask you again.

252
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,679
- We work hard in order to live better, right?
- Yes.

253
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,519
Is it to give me and the child a better life?

254
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,039
Yes, what do you want to say?

255
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,200
Look, my rank is higher than yours.

256
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,639
If I take on this project,

257
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,519
my commission and performance bonus
will be higher than yours.

258
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,600
This is very beneficial for our family.

259
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,000
Honey, Mr. Ji has already

260
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,080
promised me the position
of Development Department Manager here in Ji'an.

261
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,559
As soon as I secure the project,
I will get promotion immediately.

262
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,559
I'll get paid just as much as you
and a rank higher.

263
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,639
Sounds like I'm still getting the better deal.

264
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,519
Ms. Rao, despite being clever,
you still missed a step.

265
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,279
But it's okay, don't be angry.

266
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,360
We're all doing it for the family, after all

267
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,320
Let me go.

268
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,120
Honey, whatever you want to eat,
I'll take you there.

269
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,559
Honey, please don't be angry.

270
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,519
Getting angry will affect your pregnancy.

271
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:31,600
You two haven't seen
each other in a while, right?

272
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,000
Planning to keep dragging it out?

273
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:40,519
I'd already spent
the few thousand yuan we saved.

274
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,360
How are we supposed to meet?

275
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,639
Besides, he hasn't contacted me.

276
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,440
If you want him to apologize,

277
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,799
I can go find him.

278
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,759
Forget it. This is different from before.

279
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,519
I have a feeling even if we meet and make up,

280
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,720
we're not going to solve the problem.

281
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,919
We would have reached
this point sooner or later.

282
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,759
I just don't figure it out.

283
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:09,279
Usually, having no money is a problem.

284
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,440
While, having too much money
becomes a problem to me.

285
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,759
Luxury cars, a big house in the city center,

286
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,879
and credit cards with unlimited credit.

287
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,200
I have all these.

288
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,159
I don't see any problem.

289
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,399
Ordinary people struggle hard all their lives.

290
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,840
Isn't it just to live a life like this?

291
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
I am living it now.

292
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,559
And I still have to reflect and change myself?

293
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:34,000

to work hard to get closer to his comfort zone.

298
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,240
But it seems that I cannot

live frugally, save money,

You two fundamentally
have different ideas about money,

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,480
Tu Xiaoning?
You were in Class 12 at Xincai High School?

354
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,519
Yes.

355
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,000
It really is you, Tu Xiaoning.

356
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,400
It's me. Don't you remember?

357
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,839
Back in high school,
when evening self-study ended,

358
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,792
you fell into a drain while riding a bike.

359
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:46,880
Yu Hui?

360
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,519
Yes, that's me.

361
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,079
- Please, take a seat.
- Thank you.

362
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,128
Well,

363
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,680
go get the good tea from my car trunk.

364
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,880
I want to catch up with my old classmate.
Get the best one.

365
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,920
Thank you.

366
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,359
It's fine. You work at a bank now?

367
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,920
Yes, as an Account Manager.

368
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,160
What a coincidence that I ended up
marketing to you, Mr. Yu.

369
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,759
Don't make fun of me.

370
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,279
Back then, I had poor grades
and lower education.

371
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,720
So I just started a small company
and worked for myself.

372
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,519
I thought to consult the bank
about taking out a small loan.

373
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,000
Now that you're here, I won't ask anyone else.

374
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,400
I'll come to you.

375
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,576
I was too naughty and bullied you back then.

376
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:30,519
I apologize to you.

377
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,480
So many years have passed.

378
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,720
Let's not bring it up anymore.

379
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,680
We were so young and ignorant back then.

380
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,359
Besides, it's my fault.

381
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,440
I was wrong to throw a basketball at you.

382
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,079
I apologize to you.

383
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,000
Thinking back to myself back then,

384
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,200
I really was such a rat and foolish.

385
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,400
How can I bully a girl at school?

386
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,160
I was just a rat.

387
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,400
Not that serious.

388
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,720
When I used to bully you back in the day,

389
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,079
Ji Yuheng stood up for you

390
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,359
and stopped me

391
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,599
from making a bigger mistake.

392
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,119
By the way, did you two hit on later?

393
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:14,359
Who? What?

394
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,880
Nothing. Seeing you again

395
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,920
reminds me of another old classmate.

396
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,599
A decade has passed.

397
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,720
Let me tell you, I'm someone
who really loves lively gatherings.

398
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,079
I've always wanted to organize a gathering

399
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,240
to call over all our classmates
who are still in Star City,

400
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,200
to eat, drink, and chat.

401
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,119
- Right, let's add each other on WeChat.
- Okay.

402
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:37,440
When I make a gathering, you have to show up.

403
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,519
I'll scan your code.

404
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,559
Okay, here.

405
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,759
Tingting.

406
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,319
I've secured the client.

407
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:48,000
Coincidentally, he is my high school classmate.

408
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,240
I've already talked to him.

409
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,559
He'll go through the process with you

410
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,519
and contact you in a couple of days.

411
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,759
Thank you, Tu.

412
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,839
I'll split the bonus with you when it's issued.

413
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,359
Alright, then I'll accept it.

414
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,400
Tu, Tu.

415
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,920
Mr. Fu from Youpin has arrived.
He's been waiting for you a long time.

416
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,400
- Mr. Fu Junior?
- Right.

417
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
- He came over personally?
- Yes, hurry up.

418
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,544
Okay, okay.

419
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:10,664
Cheer up.

420
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:13,799
Ms. Tu.

421
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Fu.

422
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,920
I had something to do,

423
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,279
so I was out. Sorry to keep you waiting.

424
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,759
No problem, Ms. Tu.
It was me who came on short notice.

425
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,920
I've reviewed your specific financing proposal.

426
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,240
I think it's better to discuss
some of the details in person.

427
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,799
And I happened to be doing business nearby,
so I came over.

428
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,079
Thank you, Ms. Tu.

429
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,039
You revised your proposal so fast
after our last meeting.

430
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,440
I hope we have a pleasant cooperation.

431
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,176
Pleasant cooperation.

432
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,519
Then let's go through it one by one.

433
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:44,584
Okay.

434
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,359
Ms. Tu, why don't you sit here?

435
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,119
It'll be more convenient.

436
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,160
Okay. Please take a look.

437
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,448
This one.

438
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,759
Last time, we only mentioned
fast moving consumer beverages.

439
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,759
However, I can only
add the specific internal project

440
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,160
and proposal scale of the company

441
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,359
after you send me
some more detailed information.

442
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,640
So, for this one, let's talk…

443
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,759
Let's talk after you send me the materials.

444
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,000
What's wrong? Why are you so nervous? Relax.

445
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,839
Nothing.

446
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,856
Let's continue.

447
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,640
Miss Tu, are you a local?

448
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,839
Mr. Fu, you can just call me Tu.

449
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,160
I am a local.

450
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,359
I heard you came back
from studying abroad to get your PhD.

451
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,880
After studying for a PhD for two years,

452
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,319
I didn't want to come back
to take over the family business,

453
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,359
in order to avoid it for a while longer,
so I had to continue my studies.

454
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,799
Are you thinking

455
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,400
that in the end, I still came back
to take over the family business?

456
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,440
I had no choice. Even wealthy people
can't have everything go their way.

457
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,359
That's true.

458
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:13,920
I wonder if Weiyi is feeling better now.

459
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,039
What are you thinking?

460
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,128
Nothing.

461
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,920
The elevator is here. Take care.

462
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,759
Ms. Tu, no need to see me out.

463
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,759
We'll meet again soon.

464
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,768
Take care.

465
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:38,119
What are you looking at?

466
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:40,079
Tu, this is for you.

467
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,920
- For me?
- Open it and see.

468
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,039
Yes, it's for you.

469
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,640
Mr. Fu Junior left it
in the conference room earlier,

470
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,039
so I brought it out for you.

471
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,799
He must think
that you've been working so hard recently.

472
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,240
[Fu Yijun]
A small token, Ms. Tu, please accept it.

473
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,680
This set isn't cheap.

474
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,599
Tu, well…

475
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,000
Hello.

476
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,319
Hello, Mr. Fu.

477
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,000
How is it? Do you like the gift?

478
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,599
Sorry, this gift is a bit too expensive.

479
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,880
I can't accept it.

480
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
Well, if you are okay…

481
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,039
Shall I deliver it to you now?
Or shall I send it to you by courier?

482
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,720
If you really want to thank me,

483
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:21,960
then treat me to a meal.

484
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,279
Better to meet today, how about tonight?

485
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,160
Okay, which restaurant would you like?

486
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,799
There's a decent Japanese restaurant
near your bank.

487
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,319
Okay, then let's meet at Juchuan at 7 PM.

488
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,119
Okay, see you tonight.

489
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,216
Bye.

490
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,936
Just give it back to him later. Dismissed.

491
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,776
Be careful.

492
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,216
Thank you. You're throwing up like this
and still accompany me for the social event.

493
00:25:57,216 --> 00:26:00,000
What are you talking about?
At work, I am your superior.

494
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,279
It's my job.

495
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,000
And, I am your mentor.

496
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,599
What if that…

497
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,960
Mr. Fu Junior really has any thoughts

498
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,039
about you,

499
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,079
can I just put yourself in danger?

500
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,279
Thank you, mentor.

501
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,344
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

502
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,839
Come in.

503
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,920
Jing, be careful.

504
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,096
- Hello.
- Mr. Fu.

505
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:29,279
Let me introduce you.

506
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,000
This is Ms. Rao
from Development Department Division One.

507
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,079
Hello, Ms. Rao.

508
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,880
Hi, Mr. Fu.

509
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,759
You didn't notify me in advance today,

510
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,960
so I booked this private room,
it might not accommodate three people.

511
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,960
- Then we…
- I think…

512
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,880
Perfect. I've booked a room for four.

513
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,904
Let's have a meal together.

514
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,160
How are you?

515
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,224
I'm sorry.

516
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,839
If you are not feeling well,
you could go back first.

517
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Fu.

518
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,440
I didn't expect to be so embarrassed.

519
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,680
It's okay, Jing.
If you're not feeling well, then go back first.

520
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Mr. Fu is not that narrow-minded
and he will understand.

521
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,960
I'm here.

522
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,279
I won't let Tu drink too much. Rest assured.

523
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,319
That's fine.

524
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,599
Then Xiaoning, talk to Mr. Fu.

525
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,759
I'm truly sorry, Mr. Fu.

526
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,240
I'll definitely invite you to dinner next time.

527
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,400
I can understand.

528
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,640
I'm truly sorry, then I'll be leaving.

529
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,559
- I'll see you out.
- No need, you sit.

530
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,000
Alright then, be safe.

531
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,400
Okay, I'm leaving.

532
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,079
Don't be reserved. Let's talk while we eat.

533
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,224
Okay, let's eat.

534
00:28:00,256 --> 00:28:02,680
Try this.

535
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Thank you.

536
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,680
I've heard about
the proposal from Ji'an branch.

537
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,640
But I did not expect
the branch bank president to be so young.

538
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,039
I've been abroad for so long,
so I don't really have a concept of these.

539
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,680
However, many talents have emerged
in China in recent years.

540
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,000
I really didn't expect

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,680
that you still remember
the proposal from Ji'an branch.

542
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:28,480
In terms of hardware,

543
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,160
the conditions offered by Dairui should be

544
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,960
the best among all banks in the Star City.

545
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,400
Our branch

546
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,920
has offered the best fit for you.

547
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,680
Playing tricks again?

548
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,272
Sorry.

549
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,528
Sorry.

550
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,160
Too much wasabi. Sorry.

551
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:17,640
- Here you are.
- Sorry.

552
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,752
This flavor suits you.

553
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:28,559
It seems that Bank President Ji,
you know your colleagues quite well.

554
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,759
Understanding people and delegating effectively,
no wonder your business is doing so well.

555
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:35,200
Actually, I don't understand many people.

556
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,599
But Xiaoning is indeed one of them.

557
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,640
Understand? But you still don't know

558
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,680
what tricks Ms. Tu has in the proposal.

559
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,519
Because it's unnecessary.

560
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,640
The conditions given by Dairui
are the best in the Star City.

561
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
But under the same conditions,

562
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,039
the proposal made by Ji'an branch
is the best of all Dairui.

563
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,640
What are the conditions offered by you?

564
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,839
Mr. Fu has seen the proposal,
so he must be aware of it.

565
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,839
Their conditions are indeed better than yours.

566
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,359
But in my opinion, cooperation between banks
and companies is like doing business.

567
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,119
It depends on fate and bond.

568
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,319
Both are indispensable.

569
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,799
Mr. Fu, you are right. I toast this to you.

570
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,519
No matter what kind of business,

571
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,559
long-term cooperation is based on
the exchange of interests and mutual trust.

572
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,160
Only through give-and-take
can we achieve a win-win situation.

573
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,248
Right, Xiaoning?

574
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,568
Let's do it together.

575
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,000
It's against the rules of the bank.

576
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,519
Thank you for your kindness,
but I really can't accept it.

577
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,519
I'll return it to you, Mr. Fu.

578
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:14,160
It's okay. There will be more opportunities.

579
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,839
Okay, Bank President Ji.
I'll take my leave first.

580
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:19,016
Looking forward to cooperation.

581
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:31,496
Then…

582
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,079
Do you have to work overtime this late?

583
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,359
Go home.
You'll take your car, and I'll take mine.

584
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,576
Don't follow me.

585
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:02,400
Bank President Ji.

586
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,160
You're poaching a client openly in front of me.

587
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,168
That's too much.

588
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,000
I just happened to run into him today

589
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,599
and had a casual chat with him.

590
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,480
Besides, if I was not there,

591
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,720
and Rao Jing left early
because she wasn't feeling well,

592
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,160
then you'll be alone, Mr. Fu Junior will surely

593
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,519
stare at you all the time.

594
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,000
He's just my client.

595
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,079
Sending you luxury gifts,
and booking a private room for two.

596
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,000
Seems like this Mr. Fu Junior
doesn't just want to be your client.

597
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,599
Tu.

598
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,839
Are you jealous?

599
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,559
Yes, but I care more about your safety.

600
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:41,279
Don't use jealousy as a cover.

601
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,400
Don't think

602
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,759
that makes me let my guard down on you.

603
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,359
You don't need to let your guard down on me.

604
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,160
But you can't let your guard down on others.

605
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,200
When a bank gives out a loan,
it has its own bottom line.

606
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,519
We need to have risk control measures
for our clients.

607
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,039
At the same time,
we should try to keep the initiative.

608
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,359
Once there's some vague concessions
in the early stages,

609
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,680
the other side will increase
the control of the situation.

610
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,400
Then it will be too difficult for you
to take a strong stance later.

611
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,359
Mr. Ji, you are correct.

612
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,080
Losing one or two clients

613
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,920
will not make Dairui go bankrupt.

614
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,400
But for me, an Account Manager,

615
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,279
it means a lot.

616
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,640
Every client

617
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,519
has been won over through
my patient communication

618
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,039
and my efforts.

619
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,784
I don't allow anyone to poach them.

620
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:36,440
But you are mine.

621
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,039
I can't allow anyone to poach you.

622
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,200
Don't worry.

623
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,880
I'm not that foolish

624
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,200
and ignorant.

625
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,880
I won't put my feelings on the line.

626
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,720
And I won't give up any client

627
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,200
based on some wild speculation.

628
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm a sensible adult.

629
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,799
I know to be alert.

630
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,960
Otherwise, I wouldn't let Jing go with me.

631
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,799
You should be at ease.

632
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:10,632
Alright.

633
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Did you talk to Rao Jing
about the annual leave?

634
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,199
Whenever you have time, I'll make the plan.

635
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,719
Around the Mid-Autumn Festival.

636
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,768
Okay.

637
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,800
Who told you

638
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,559
we're having a meal today?

639
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,519
No answer. Okay.

640
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:44,840
Then what is your proposal?

641
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,440
We are at the same bank.

642
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,360
There shouldn't be much difference.

643
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:00,936
Choose one to answer. Hurry up.

644
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,400
Li Xiang.

645
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,400
The enemy is within the department. Nasty.

646
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,400
Mr. Ji, would it be convenient
to bring the ring tomorrow

647
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,719
and the doll you mentioned with it?

648
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,239
We'll make some special arrangements.

649
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:38,280
Okay.

650
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,840
Tu, you are so lucky.

651
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,320
It goes up a notch.

652
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,880
Yuan, don't talk nonsenses.

653
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,280
Tu has already
returned the gift from yesterday.

654
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,079
We do not allow accepting gifts from clients.

655
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,800
Then who sent this?

656
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,119
That must be from her boyfriend.

657
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,840
Li Xiang, should I hold this thing

658
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,679
and act so surprised,

659
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:41,400
so that you can take a picture
and take some credit for it?

660
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,560
No problem.

661
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,976
Mr. Ji sold me out?

662
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,719
Then, I…

663
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,360
Do you really want to take that photo?

664
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,199
Be careful, I might tell Jing
you're betraying us.

665
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:57,199
I am not…

666
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,079
Tu, don't tell Jing.

667
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:01,360
- She'd scold me.
- I know.

668
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,199
When it comes to principles,
I am always with the Division One.

669
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,840
I swear I will never betray.

670
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,400
Okay, I got it.

671
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,519
But if you ever betray, do it for me.

672
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,159
Alright, what are you looking at? Dismissed.

673
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,039
Is this the strange competitive spirit of men?

674
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,159
Do you like it?

675
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,328
Childish.

676
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,960
Hey, Xiaoning, are you available?

677
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,440
Do you want to have lunch with me at noon?

678
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,960
Since I'm making fast progress
with Mr. Fu Junior,

679
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,800
so I have to visit
Mr. Fu Junior's company this afternoon

680
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,519
to discuss some business with him.

681
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,519
So I can't have lunch with you.

682
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,888
Let's have a dinner together tonight.

683
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:27,000
Come in.

684
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,159
It's time for ordering lunch.
Let's order together.

685
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,199
How's Mr. Fu Junior going this morning?

686
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,320
I've contacted them this morning.

687
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,440
He is still interested in our interest rates.

688
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,512
I'll continue
to keep an eye on it this afternoon.

689
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,936
You have a good rest this afternoon,
I'll go there.

690
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:54,152
I won't have lunch either.

691
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,880
You still need to have lunch.

692
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,920
You have lost weight recently.

693
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,039
Accountant Zhou, I'll be there in ten minutes.

694
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,119
Okay, then drive carefully.

695
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,719
I'll pick you up at the entrance.

696
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,760
You'll accompany me
throughout the site visit today, right?

697
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,719
Yes.

698
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,960
Okay, see you later.

699
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,176
Okay, see you later.

700
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,960
[Tea Ceremony]
Ms. Tu, this is the revised contract.

701
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,000
Thank you.

702
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,719
If there are no other things, Mr. Fu Junior,

703
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,360
I'll go back to sort things out
and prepare the formal contract.

704
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,679
How about I come to you
for signing the contract tomorrow?

705
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,840
Accountant Zhou, the water is gone.

706
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,000
- Okay.
- Thank you.

707
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,864
Take a look.

708
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,312
[Employment Contract]

709
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,744
[Party A shall pay Party B a salary
of 1 million yuan per year on a regular basis.]

710
00:40:19,744 --> 00:40:21,440
To be honest,

711
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,760
it's not easy for someone
who likes coffee to run a tea factory.

712
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,599
I'm sure you've heard about it.

713
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,024
Before I returned to the country,

714
00:40:29,024 --> 00:40:30,800
Youpin Tea has always been
under the control of my brother-in-law.

715
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,079
Until recently,

716
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,159
it was handed over back to me
under my father's directive.

717
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,840
My brother-in-law took many
of his own people when he left,

718
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,519
including old accountants.

719
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,400
But Youpin Tea needs money
to expand the business.

720
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,000
Even more, it needs
someone to manage the money.

721
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,400
I need someone I can trust

722
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,519
to support the finance department
together with Accountant Zhou.

723
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:01,599
Xiaoning, I think you are very suitable.

724
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,639
I have seen

725
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:09,320
the conditions offered by you
are really generous.

726
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:12,639
But for me, my current job

727
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,559
is not just about making money,
but I truly enjoy it.

728
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:19,360
So I'm sorry. I have no intention of resigning.

729
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,840
Xiaoning, you are smart.

730
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,920
You should know

731
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,000
why I chose you

732
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,320
over a better proposal.

733
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,840
Giving you gifts, inviting you to dinner,

734
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,639
and insisting on calling you over here
to amend a few simple words.

735
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,119
You're still playing dumb even
after I've done all these?

736
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,159
Then I have no choice but to make it clear.

[Daily Life of Mr. And Mrs. Smith]

738
00:42:07,332 --> 00:42:08,704
The veil is also needed.

739
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:11,519
Just a simple style that girls like.

740
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,679
Right, with a sense of formality.

741
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,584
I'll update you on the other details
of the proposal. Okay.

742
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,519
Don't you look!

743
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:02,159
What are you doing, Ji Yuheng?
Taking advantage of me?

744
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:07,039
Taking advantage of you? What have I done?

745
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,800
Of course, I'm talking about the work.

746
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,519
In life, it's me taking advantage of you.

747
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,920
Then, in life, we are so close to each other.

748
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,559
Suffering a little loss can be a blessing.

749
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:20,840
Then I wish you happy.

750
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,159
Then should I wish you a long life?

751
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:28,672
I've seen it.

752
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:33,519
You've seen it? Ji Yuheng, you've seen it all.
