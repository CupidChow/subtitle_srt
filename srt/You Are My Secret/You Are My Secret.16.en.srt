[Waiting for you here]

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
Good morning, what a coincidence.

34
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,192
Is it?

35
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,159
Isn't this the way to breakfast?

36
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,424
Mr. Zhao,

37
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:09,719
what are you wearing today?

38
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,840
You look like a master of ceremonies.

39
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,719
You're not waiting for me, are you?

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,560
Do you really hope I'm waiting for you?

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,439
I have another appointment when I go back.

42
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,759
But if you need company,

43
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:34,319
for the sake of our many years as colleagues,
I'll keep you company.

44
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,960
Wearing a suit, tying a tie.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,800
Going to the beach to help grandma pick clams?

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,240
Can't you say something nice?

47
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,464
Mr. Ji.

48
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,712
Mr. Ji.

49
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,848
Mr. Ji.

50
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,240
Isn't it a bit surprising?

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,360
It just so happens
I'm on a business trip to Jinghai.

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,520
I took the opportunity to check on how
the shipyard negotiations are going.

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,280
Why is it just the two of you?
Where are Tu and Tang?

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,400
I didn't expect you

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,240
to be so concerned about our shipyard's loan.

56
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,319
Tu has almost finished
negotiating that project.

57
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,000
And we are ready to go back
and proceed with the process.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,080
Tang went back earlier.

59
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,159
Today, she has already checked in with Xu Li.

60
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,840
So it seems the efficiency is quite high.

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Tu and Tang did pretty well this time.

62
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,879
Mr. Ji, did you just arrive today?

63
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,439
Yes.

64
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,560
Yesterday, Mr. Zhao seemed to have seen you.

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,168
Missed me that much?

66
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,960
Drank too much, it was a mistake,
and I missed you.

67
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,120
Let's go, time for breakfast.

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,360
You two go ahead, I'll go back and call Tu.

69
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,519
When I left this morning,

70
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,639
I didn't even know if Tu was in the room.

71
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,680
Ji Yuheng, this beast.

72
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,079
Tu.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,199
Jing.

74
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,439
You're here.

75
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm here.

76
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,080
What time is it? Is it time to check out?

77
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,120
I overslept.

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,279
It's fine, just get up and pack up
since you're awake.

79
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,360
Mr. Ji is here.

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Mr. Ji is here?

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,160
He said he stopped by
on his way back to the city.

82
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,319
He will return with us to Star City today.

83
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,920
Now that you're awake,
get up and start packing.

84
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,584
Let's have breakfast together.

85
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:20,680
Okay.

86
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,728
I'll wait for you at the place
where we'll have breakfast.

87
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,192
Hurry up.

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,800
Do you want some, Xiaoning?

89
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,920
- I won't eat, Jing.
- Okay.

90
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,519
Can you stop drinking beer?

91
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,439
Now when I see people drinking beer,

92
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,279
when I smell that scent, I just…

93
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,079
Don't vomit here, it's so disgusting.

94
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,199
I'll go buy some bottles of water.

95
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,560
- I'll go with you.
- You can't leave.

96
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,399
I… Take your hand off first.

97
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,519
I've never gotten seasick before.

98
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,959
It must be the after-effects
of drinking with you that day.

99
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,000
You have to take care of me.

100
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,879
Why should I take care of you?

101
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,000
Because I am your creditor.

102
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,079
Okay, I'll take care of you.

103
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,519
Here, let me fan you.

104
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,576
Does it feel good?

105
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,720
A bit better now.

106
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,839
Feeling a bit better? Then enjoy it.

107
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,639
After all, it's a service
that costs 2,000 an hour.

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,639
Why do you have to charge?

109
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,079
No need for money, just give me
a few state-owned enterprise clients.

110
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,839
Are you still human?

111
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm quite good as a person.

112
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,839
Hurry up and give it to him.
You hurry and take it.

113
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,319
Jing, here's one for you.

114
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,480
I'll give a bottle to Mr. Ji.

115
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,720
Okay, you go and give him a bottle.

116
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,399
Drink up, come on.

117
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,079
Drink water.

118
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,168
Thanks.

119
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,360
Why do you look pale? Are you running a fever?

120
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,160
No, I'm just exceptionally seasick today.

121
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:45,832
♫ The wind blew across the crowded street ♫

122
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,160
Why, aren't you afraid of them seeing?

123
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,639
You are my superior.

124
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,560
It's normal to take care of my superior
who's not feeling well.

125
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,360
I wonder if it's because I was tired yesterday.

126
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,240
You still have the nerve to say that.

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,720
I covered it with a lot of foundation.

128
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,079
Go back quickly.

129
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,136
Drink some water.

130
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,120
Is Mr. Ji okay?

131
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,439
He's a bit seasick.

132
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,440
Do you never get seasick?

133
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,919
- I'm a bit seasick today.
- 517.

134
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,440
Jing, Zhao,

135
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,928
my ride's here, I'll go first.

136
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,000
Mr. Ji, I'll leave first.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,039
Take your time.

138
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,879
I'll help you carry it.

139
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,919
- Thank you, Zhao.
- It's nothing.

140
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,919
Go ahead, get in the car first and wait.

141
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,240
- Get in the car.
- I'm leaving, Jing.

142
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,440
Be careful.

143
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Go, Tu.

144
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,856
Bye-bye.

145
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:56,008
Bye-bye.

146
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,080
Hello.

147
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,720
Sorry, I'm a bit far from your location.

148
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,679
I can't get through. Please order another one.

149
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,159
How can you just cancel it like that?

150
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm telling you, I can complain
about this. Hello?

151
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,679
Ms. Rao, my car has arrived.

152
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,320
How about I give you a lift
without harboring past grievances?

153
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,679
Mr. Ji, where's your car?

154
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,080
My car will arrive shortly, you go ahead.

155
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,720
Alright, we'll go first then.

156
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,776
Give me the suitcase.

157
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,464
Have a good rest when you get back.

158
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,279
Hello. They've left.

159
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,456
Alright then.

160
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,280
I'm coming.

161
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,279
What are you snickering about?

162
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,960
I just find it quite interesting.

163
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,576
Are you feeling better?

164
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,296
A bit better.

165
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:23,320
What happened?

166
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,639
Zhao, bent down quickly, down.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,279
Morals are declining.

168
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,168
Get up.

169
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,799
We took a trip out.

170
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,799
It seems everywhere is dangerous
when we return.

171
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,320
It's more dangerous than before.

172
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,639
If Zhao and Jing know that we are dating,

173
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,440
it won't take half a day for everyone to know.

174
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,000
Well, it's actually quite thrilling.

175
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:19,808
But could it

176
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,559
be because we've been too intimate?

177
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,519
That's normal though.

178
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,440
We're about to get married.

179
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,840
Isn't it normal to be intimate?

180
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,039
Right you are, about to get married.

181
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,799
We agreed on 12 o'clock. He is late again.

182
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,279
My name is Qi Yu. Hello, Uncle.

183
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,399
Hello, Uncle. My name is Qi Yu.

184
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,559
I was university classmates with Weiyi.

185
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,000
We are dating.

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,039
Don't be nervous, my dad isn't a tiger

187
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,759
He's not going to eat you.

188
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,256
Have you told uncle about my current job?

189
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,440
I did.

190
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
You did?

191
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,360
Will he think that this job…?

192
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,919
It's fine, I don't care, so why should he?

193
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,488
It's not like he's the one dating you.

194
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:17,080
Baby.

195
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,679
He's here. Dad.

196
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,744
You guys go ahead and get busy.

197
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,200
Dad.

198
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,639
Have you been waiting anxiously?
Are you starving?

199
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,879
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

200
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,488
I was in a meeting.

201
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,519
Hello, Uncle. My name is Qi Yu.

202
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,840
Here are some gifts.

203
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,759
You're too kind. You really
needn't have brought anything.

204
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,639
I have a sudden matter to discuss in a bit.

205
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,519
We won't go out to eat.

206
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,399
Let's have a simple meal in the meeting room.

207
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,879
Dad, I gave you such an early heads-up.

208
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,639
Why do you suddenly have a meeting?

209
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,120
No, I want to go out to eat.

210
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,639
It's okay, uncle's work is important.

211
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,919
It's quite nice to have a simple meal
in the meeting room, it's convenient.

212
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,679
Alright, come on over.

213
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,399
How can we eat in the meeting room?

214
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,496
It doesn't make a difference where we eat.

215
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,680
Let's go, don't be angry.

216
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,824
Dad.

217
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,184
Eat more.

218
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,120
Qi, where are you employed now?

219
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Dad, haven't I told you already?

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,559
I've really spoiled my daughter.

221
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,240
You must be patient with her normally.

222
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,039
No, Weiyi is especially good.

223
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,559
She's a good person,
and her personality is good too.

224
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,960
Good personality.

225
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,440
Well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

226
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,600
You young people nowadays in love

227
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
get easily carried away.

228
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,840
Dad, isn't my personality usually good?

229
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,200
Good.

230
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,919
Falling in love requires a moment
of getting carried away.

231
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:05,519
But to maintain it in the long term,
you need to rely on rationality.

232
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,159
I'm not an old-fashioned person.

233
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,639
Things like where the family lives,
what the conditions are,

234
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,600
I don't really care.

235
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,919
However, there is one thing I value very much.

236
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,000
A man must have ambition.

237
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,240
That way, two people can really live together.

238
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,320
Uncle, don't worry. I'm preparing
for the police exam.

239
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,519
Where are you at now?
Have you passed the written exam?

240
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,279
Dad, this exam has a fixed schedule every year.

241
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,600
If you don't understand it, you shouldn't ask.

242
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,039
Uncle, rest assured, I'm already preparing.

243
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,000
I will do my best to pass, trust me.

244
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,039
Well then, put aside your relationship
with Yi for now.

245
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,559
We'll talk about it after you pass the exam.

246
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,320
Alright.

247
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,352
Dad.

248
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,832
Just eat.

249
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,248
Walk slowly.

250
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,600
Why did you stop me just now?

251
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,039
What does it mean to put it aside for now?

252
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:21,039
Who can say for certain about the exam?

253
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,200
Uncle's demands on me are not excessive.

254
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,960
He didn't ask me to be extremely wealthy.

255
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,000
He only asked that I have ambition
and keep my word.

256
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,919
He is making demands on me
because he loves you.

257
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,088
But just as he said, it's so hard
to pass the judicial exams.

258
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:34,144
What if…?

259
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:37,879
I admit I'm not smart, but diligence
compensates for lack of natural ability, right?

260
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:38,879
I've enrolled in a cram school

261
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,000
and I've been reviewing
according to the planned schedule.

262
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,399
I cannot make you a 100% promise,

263
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,399
but I will definitely try my best, trust me.

264
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,000
Okay then, I'll join you.

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,519
Maybe you'll pass it in one go.

266
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,120
You live in such an expensive community.
No wonder you can't save money.

267
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,039
You choose the best in clothing, food,
housing, and transportation.

268
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,559
You really don't mistreat yourself at all.

269
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,039
What's wrong with you? You look so pale.

270
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,399
It's nothing,
just a stomach ailment flaring up.

271
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,679
Drinking some hot water will help.

272
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,920
Let me help you go up.

273
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,000
Hand, take it off.

274
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm telling you, my house
does not entertain strangers.

275
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,759
Don't think that just because
you saw my parents at my hometown

276
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,240
and had a couple drinks with me
that we're on friendly terms.

277
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,600
I definitely won't hold back
when competing for clients later.

278
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,840
Thank you, goodbye.

279
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,360
Is that what I mean?

280
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,960
Li Xiang, come here quick.

281
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,679
Although I didn't buy much,
let's all try something new.

282
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,736
Thank you, many thanks, Tu.

283
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:05,920
You're welcome.

284
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,519
Zhao,

285
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,519
Tu brought us some local specialties.

286
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,920
Jing got us souvenirs. How about you?

287
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,680
I just went on a business trip
and didn't make any money.

288
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,736
It's not like I went on a vacation.
Why would I bring gifts?

289
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,759
Stingy.

290
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,400
Besides, Ms. Rao gave you gifts
because Xihai Town is her…

291
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,519
What is Xihai Town to me?

292
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,000
Xihai Town is your land of fortune.

293
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,200
It's your good fortune that the apprentice
you mentored signed a client.

294
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,519
Yes.

295
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,880
- Zhao.
- Thank you.

296
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Where is Tang?

297
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,240
She couldn't have been upset
because she didn't outperform Tu, could she?

298
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,880
No, she has submitted
a new business trip application.

299
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,232
She probably won't come back
before the end of the year.

300
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:41,319
Another business trip?

301
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,079
This young lady becomes braver
with every setback.

302
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,319
So lively.

303
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:48,359
Specialties! Do I have any?

304
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,640
You are becoming more and more humorous.

305
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,880
Didn't you go to Xihai Town yourself?

306
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,640
Mr. Ji also went to Xihai Town?

307
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,279
Went to cheer for his junior.

308
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,336
What are you talking about?

309
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:07,680
Li Xiang.

310
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,759
Tu, your neck is injured?

311
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,519
No, the ship was rocking too much.

312
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,880
I didn't stand firm
and got scraped by the wire.

313
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,359
How could you be so careless?

314
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,839
Coincidentally, I cut my hand
while cutting paper a while ago.

315
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,000
There's still medicine here.

316
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,759
I'll get the medicine for you.

317
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:28,880
Have your master help you apply some.

318
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,559
No need, it's just a small injury,
really no need.

319
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,039
- You have to be careful with small injuries.
- No.

320
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,279
Especially metal cuts, they scar easily.

321
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,720
Really no need.

322
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,960
Everyone, I have some good news to share.

323
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,359
Ms. Rao has added three new
private enterprise clients this month.

324
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,680
Truly worthy of being
our Division One's key member.

325
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,200
I will continue to work hard, everyone.

326
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,720
Did I hear that right? Three?

327
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,640
Ms. Rao, impressive!

328
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,960
It seems you're the type who pretends
to play with classmates during the day

329
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,519
but studies hard at home at night.

330
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,680
Do I need to pretend to play with you?

331
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,319
Give this medicine to Tu to apply.

332
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,592
Her stomach hurts again.

333
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,200
Drink less coffee when injured.
It can cause pigment deposition.

334
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,160
Drink some red date water.

335
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,119
Zhao, it's just a minor injury.

336
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,279
It's okay. There's no need
to take such care of me.

337
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,680
We are comrades in the same trench.

338
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,000
It's right to look after each other, isn't it?

339
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,359
I still have a cup left here,
with no one to drink it.

340
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,200
Please send it over to your master.

341
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
- Thank you, Zhao.
- Don't mention it.

342
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,039
Jing, it's from Zhao.

343
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,168
What's this?

344
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:01,288
Red date water.

345
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:25,544
[Ling's Building]

346
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,920
How come Liu has so many parcels?

347
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,000
Let me see.

348
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,200
Your skin is so tender today. It looks like
you could pinch water out of it.

349
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,279
Indeed, love is the best cosmetic medicine.

350
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,079
Well, you had a few days of intense passion

351
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,079
and now you're treating me
like an outsider, right?

352
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,279
I just knew it about this Ji Yuheng.

353
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,920
- He is definitely…
- Shut up.

354
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,119
What's wrong with you?

355
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,079
Can you mention Ji Yuheng's name
when you are at least a kilometer away

356
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,599
from the gate in the future?

357
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,440
I've just found a client,
I don't want to be fired.

358
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,624
I was wrong.

359
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,960
I just wanted to express, you know.

360
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,960
You know, the kind that has
both capability and looks

361
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,279
and can accompany you every day,
this kind of good man,

362
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:15,200
how did he suddenly come out of nowhere

363
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,039
and with a bang, fall into your arms?

364
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,440
Luck is also a kind of strength.

365
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,240
What's wrong? Is Mr. Qi no longer good
or not perfect enough?

366
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,559
Don't like him anymore?

367
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,279
Of course, he's very good.

368
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,920
But you don't know how hard
he's been pushing himself lately.

369
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,319
That stubbornness is nearly driving me mad.

370
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,400
What's the matter?

371
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:15,079
Well, he's already been working so hard.

372
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,839
What if after all that,
he still doesn't pass the exam?

373
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,359
Wouldn't that be…?

374
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,424
An outrage against the natural order?

375
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:21,599
Exactly.

376
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,759
He's really done enough to be with you.

377
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,880
When will he have his exam?

378
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,920
- Today.
- Today?

379
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,440
No wonder you've been distracted today.

380
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,039
Don't worry about it.

381
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:39,759
How about this? I'll share some of my good luck
from passing the exam with him.

382
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,440
You can't do that. You are about
to become a regular.

383
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,599
You can't share the luck.

384
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,880
Not even for Qi Yu.

385
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,079
It's okay, I can surely become a regular now.

386
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,799
I'll give Mr. Qi a bit of it and wish him
a smooth passage of the exam.

387
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,400
My bestie is the best, truly loyal.

388
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,799
I'm leaving, Tu.

389
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:02,799
- Bye.
- Bye.

390
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

391
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

392
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,440
Bye.

393
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,920
Tu, you're off work, why not leaving yet?

394
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,160
Zhao, you go ahead.

395
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,960
I have to review a financial statement.

396
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,119
Life is a long journey.

397
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,160
Don't always strive with your life.

398
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,359
Time to leave work, time to live life.

399
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:25,680
Otherwise, what's the use if the money
is in the bank and you're in heaven?

400
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,240
Learn from your master.

401
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,599
Work hard when it's time to work.

402
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,368
After work, nobody knows
where she's gone to enjoy herself.

403
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:35,440
I'm leaving.

404
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,519
- Bye.
- Bye.

405
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,440
I am leaving, boss.

406
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,520
Okay.

407
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,632
Finally, everyone has left.

408
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,000
Why haven't you finished work so late?

409
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,519
I'm just about to go home.

410
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,680
What's wrong? I thought you left.

411
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,519
I left my work badge here.

412
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,119
I'm going first, bye.

413
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,559
Bye.

414
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,359
Zhang, I'm on my way.

415
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,799
Coming. Wait for me.

416
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,559
Since it's time to leave,
why don't we go together?

417
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,640
Sure thing, Mr. Ji.

418
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,680
Let's go.

419
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:43,240
Mr. Ji.

420
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,519
Tu, is your work going well recently?

421
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,039
Quite smooth. Thank you, Mr. Ji.

422
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,248
Come here.

423
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:01,400
What are you doing?

424
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,592
No one's around.

425
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:09,160
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

426
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,260
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

427
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,420
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

428
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:21,536
♫ My fast heartbeat ♫

429
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:24,800
♫ Hide in a few seconds ♫

430
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,896
♫ When I close my eyes ♫

431
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:34,020
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

432
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,508
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

433
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:41,420
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

434
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:45,472
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

435
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:52,416
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

436
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:56,704
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

437
00:25:56,704 --> 00:26:01,572
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

438
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:05,708
♫ To you and no one else ♫

439
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,904
Qi Yu.

440
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,319
Well, I actually took a leave today
to take an exam and didn't go to the office.

441
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,759
The Bank President is leaving
for a business trip tomorrow.

442
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,359
So I collected the cars in advance.

443
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,519
So I made a return to the company.

444
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,720
I was wrong.

445
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,119
I swear

446
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:45,359
I absolutely didn't intentionally
tell him about you two.

447
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:47,759
If you have to blame someone,
blame the enemy for being naive yet sly.

448
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,039
It lowered my guard.

449
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,119
Let me ask a question.

450
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,960
Qi Yu wouldn't betray us, would he?

451
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,160
No, he definitely wouldn't.

452
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,544
If he dares to betray you,
I'll be the first to take him down.

453
00:27:00,544 --> 00:27:01,720
Make your position clear.

454
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,816
I won't.

455
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,079
Okay, today, to show my apology,

456
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:12,519
tonight, I'll cover all the expenses.

457
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,759
Waiter, two bottles of Blue Ribbon, please.

458
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,440
We don't usually drink like this.

459
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,519
Your apology is costing quite a bit, huh?

460
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,200
I'm happy. Today is a good day.

461
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,640
Firstly, I apologize for telling Qi Yu
about your relationship.

462
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,319
- Secondly,
- Apologizing to us.

463
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,319
it's to formally celebrate the two of you…

464
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,720
To formally celebrate
Qi Yu's successful completion of the exam.

465
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,319
I did quite well on the written exam, actually.

466
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,792
I think there's a good chance I can pass.

467
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,519
Really?

468
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,839
That's great, come on.

469
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,920
Congratulations.

470
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,599
Congratulations to you.

471
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,728
Congratulations.

472
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,680
Well, go on to play?

473
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,784
Why not?

474
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,680
Go, go dance.

475
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,656
You said you wouldn't dance?

476
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,240
Well…

477
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,200
Sit down.

478
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,160
Our girlfriends are good friends.

479
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,440
So we are also good friends, aren't we?

480
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,200
Calling you Mr. Ji feels a bit distant.

481
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,759
Calling you by your full name would be weird.

482
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:37,759
Yuheng, it's a bit ambiguous, huh?

483
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,880
You can call me whatever you want.

484
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,768
I'll just call you Ji.

485
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:47,759
Sure, come on.

486
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,319
Come on, Ji, have a drink.

487
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,000
Are you going to use the restroom?

488
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,519
What?

489
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,200
Are you going to use the restroom?

490
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,359
Miss, are you alone?

491
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,519
No, I have a boyfriend.

492
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,039
Have a boyfriend?

493
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,960
Did you make that up to reject me?

494
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:33,156
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

495
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:36,256
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

496
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:41,416
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

497
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,532
♫ My fast heartbeat ♫

498
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:48,796
♫ Hide in a few seconds ♫

499
00:29:48,796 --> 00:29:52,200
♫ When I close my eyes ♫

500
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,559
My boyfriend is really handsome.

501
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,952
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

502
00:29:57,952 --> 00:30:02,160
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

503
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,880
Listen up, I won't interfere with your hobbies.

504
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,920
But next time you come,

505
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,519
be sure to tell me in advance.

506
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,359
Otherwise, if you drink too much,
I won't be there right away.

507
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,599
Well, do you want me to report to you?

508
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,800
You're not satisfied?

509
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,348
I'll have to see how you behave.

510
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:33,440
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

511
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,616
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

512
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:38,856
♫ No one knows ♫

513
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,988
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

514
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:45,100
♫ I hope you know ♫

515
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,839
I really didn't brag to you.

516
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,720
Bro, a catty of alcohol really
does nothing to me.

517
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,000
Even if I drink too much,
I don't transform or anything.

518
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,039
Are you suggesting that I transform
when I drink too much?

519
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,400
Go out and ask around.

520
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,960
I, Zhao Fanggang, have been
an Account Manager for so many years.

521
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,279
When have I ever lost face
due to drinking too much?

522
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,519
- It's been recorded.
- It's recorded.

523
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,839
- Go ahead, record it.
- I have recorded it.

524
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,848
You're bragging.

525
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,072
Regarding alcohol tolerance,

526
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:18,079
the worst in our entire office is…

527
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,079
Even if my alcohol tolerance isn't good,
I won't throw up in someone's car.

528
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,400
Didn't even pay for the car wash.

529
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,759
I'm not that bad off.

530
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:31,440
I didn't do anything weird yesterday, did I?

531
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,599
Seems like drinking really isn't for me.

532
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,200
Falling asleep over the sink
while brushing your teeth, does that count?

533
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,680
But you looked quite cute.

534
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,000
Red envelope.

535
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Mr. Ji, that's quite generous.

536
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,799
You're dispersing all your family wealth.

537
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,519
Everyone, the New Year is just a few days away.

538
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,160
We have successfully completed
the deposit task given by the bank.

539
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,599
These small red envelopes
are to wish everyone good luck.

540
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:19,400
The year-end bonus
will be settled after the festival.

541
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,880
- Great.
- Great.

542
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,160
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

543
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,119
Not bad, Mr. Ji, you've learned to win hearts.

544
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,519
Tu, you flatter me.

545
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,279
This money comes from an extra bonus

546
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:33,279
without dipping into our common fund.

547
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,960
Are you all going back to your hometowns
for the New Year?

548
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm not going back this year.

549
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,799
I've made plans with a few buddies
to go traveling. How about you?

550
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,519
I'm spending it with my family.

551
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:46,440
Mr. Ji, what about you?

552
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,359
I'm also with very important family members.

553
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,359
Zhao.

554
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,359
What about you?

555
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:56,400
I'm not that fortunate.

556
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,599
My whole big family is going
to my brother's place for the New Year.

557
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,680
I will be all alone.

558
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,720
You should be alone too, right?

559
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,119
How about we two join forces for the New Year?

560
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,799
I'm not so badly off that I need
to partner up with you.

561
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,759
If you're unwilling, forget it.

562
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,079
It was just a joke to begin with, so funny.

563
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Xu Li, make some more revisions.

564
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
You're mixing personal grudges
with official business.

565
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,776
Go make the revisions.

566
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,472
[Fortune]
[Half Moon Mountain Residence]

567
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,464
Come on.

568
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,839
You have good taste.
This guesthouse is very nice.

569
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:08,519
Today is the first time our whole family
is celebrating the New Year together.

570
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:11,840
We definitely need to stay somewhere
comfortable. This place is spacious.

571
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,840
There are two floors here.
You've thought of everything.

572
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,519
Otherwise, our family of five,

573
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,519
whether we stay at our place or at my mother's,

574
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,599
just wouldn't fit.

575
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,079
Then we wouldn't be able to stay up
together for the New Year's Eve.

576
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,872
Yes, let's go.

577
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,519
Go this way, right?

578
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,280
Right.

579
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,199
Are you sure you don't need my help later?

580
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,719
With your help, I'm afraid this New Year's Eve
dinner will last until next year.

581
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Dad, Mom.

582
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,880
How come there's nobody?

583
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,088
Dad, Mom.

584
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,239
Are they not here?

585
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,400
- I'll go have a look.
- Okay.

586
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,039
All this stuff is here.

587
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,360
No one's here. Maybe we should make a call.

588
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,559
[Dad]
The call is coming in.

589
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,559
Hello, Dad. Where are you?

590
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,360
Well, are you free right now?

591
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,440
Come and pick us up.

592
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:15,679
Don't tell Xiaoning.

593
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,592
Why can't he tell me? What's the matter?

594
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,000
Nothing. We are very well.

595
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,840
It's just that a small accident happened.

596
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,519
Hello. What's happened? What small accident?

597
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,592
Where are you?

598
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:37,960
What have you been doing?

599
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,320
Catching chicken.

600
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,199
I know this is chicken. Whose idea was it?

601
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:47,080
Mine.

602
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,119
Why are you catching chicken
during the New Year?

603
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,880
Couldn't you just buy one at the market?

604
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,039
Where in the market can you find
this kind of chicken?

605
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,119
This is called a free-range chicken.

606
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,719
The chicken here tastes good.

607
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,719
So, we came up here to catch one.

608
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,599
We have all the New Year's goods at home.
We're just missing a chicken.

609
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,639
Dad, Mom, it's cold in these mountains.
Let's get in the car first and then talk.

610
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,840
Hurry, bring it quickly, come on.

611
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,320
- Quick, put it in the car.
- Mom, get in the car first.

612
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,079
Your hands are so dirty, Dad.

613
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,176
Just stay put.

614
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,800
Come on, wipe your hands.

615
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,360
- Hurry and get in the car.
- Okay.

616
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,199
Dad, tell me the truth, was it my mom's idea?

617
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:33,159
Mine, it was my idea.

618
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:36,599
If my mom doesn't agree,
do you dare to catch the chicken?

619
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,840
This courtyard is really nice, isn't it?

620
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,719
Yeah, I don't know who chose it.

621
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,199
It seems that I didn't buy a chicken.

622
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,280
That won't do. For the New Year, we need to have
the complete set of chicken, duck, fish, and pork.

623
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,199
- Right.
- Is it for real or just joking?

624
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,440
Really.

625
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,639
Shall I make a call to have Heng come back

626
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,559
and drive us to the…?

627
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:09,639
They say there's a farmer's market.
Let's go buy some.

628
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:12,760
How long will it take to go back and forth?

629
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,920
I remember now.

630
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,360
It seems there was a farm stay on the way here.

631
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,664
There are free-range chickens for sale.

632
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:19,840
Let's go catch one.

633
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,760
It's the New Year.

634
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,119
Forget it, it's not worth it
for just one chicken.

635
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,840
It's because you didn't prepare
all the New Year goods.

636
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,519
Because of you, we don't have
a chicken to eat for the New Year.

637
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:33,239
You are given a chance to make up for it,
and you don't cherish it.

638
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:35,159
Are you going or not?

639
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:38,840
Next time my mom comes up
with such a bad idea, you stop her a bit.

640
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,320
Isn't my mother-in-law sick?

641
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,920
What if something happens?

642
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,864
In the middle of nowhere,
so far from the hospital.

643
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:45,880
How inconvenient.

644
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,360
Right, I didn't think of that.

645
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,039
That was my lack of consideration.
It won't happen again.

646
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,119
What's the point of celebrating the New Year?
It's so boring.

647
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,920
Who is it? The takeaway
hasn't been ordered yet.

648
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,984
Happy New Year! May I come in?

649
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:34,120
Come in, take off your shoes.

650
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,079
Please put them in the shoe cabinet for me.

651
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,368
Your house is quite big, isn't it?

652
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,960
If I remember correctly,
today is New Year's Eve, isn't it?

653
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,320
Is there a problem?

654
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,639
I have prepared the New Year goods.

655
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,440
You're making a fuss.

656
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,736
I'll put it there for you.

657
00:39:00,736 --> 00:39:01,760
Alright.

658
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,880
The color of your lipstick looks nice today.

659
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,752
It's the New Year.

660
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:14,984
[New]

661
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,916
♫ The wind blew across the crowded street ♫

662
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:28,832
♫ Lemon goes with coffee.
We have a rapport, flustered ♫

663
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:34,472
♫ We continue the warm moments of the past ♫

664
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,776
Come on, these are all up.
We should take a photo.

665
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,864
What's there to take a picture of?

666
00:39:40,864 --> 00:39:41,960
Quick.

667
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,760
Three, two, one, Happy New Year!

668
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,024
♫ Your eyes are as clear as the sky ♫

669
00:39:49,024 --> 00:39:52,392
♫ As time goes by, I fall for you ♫

670
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,239
This one is too thick.

671
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,880
Don't make the middle so thick.

672
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,239
- Look at this.
- Are you making a pancake?

673
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,559
I was afraid that Jing would be lonely

674
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:06,639
spending the Spring Festival alone. Look.

675
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,840
Zhao arranged it. It has
a full festive atmosphere, doesn't it?

676
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
It's really not bad.

677
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,119
It's quite romantic.

678
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,320
Come on, taste it for me
and check the seasoning.

679
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,159
Tasty.

680
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:20,232
Not bad, huh?

681
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,440
So delicious.

682
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,960
I've been sitting here
and smelling the delicious smell.

683
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,880
What filling is this?

684
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,920
This is your mother-in-law's secret family recipe
for the "Three Freshness" filling.

685
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,960
What secret recipe?

686
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,400
Just spinach, shrimp, and pork.

687
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,800
Then add some seasoned oil
to give it a quick stir.

688
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,920
Let's see if it tastes good
when we eat it later.

689
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
You want to make dumplings?

690
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,960
I'll help you out.

691
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,199
Just forget about it, your moves are all wrong.

692
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,840
If you don't pinch them tightly,
they'll turn into dumpling soup.

693
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,920
Dad, look at you, complaining
that I can't do anything

694
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,360
while at the same time,
not letting me do anything.

695
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,199
Isn't this bullying?

696
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,119
Let me try. What if I have a talent for it?

697
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Look.

698
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,920
Kid, you better give it up.

699
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,760
Your happiness is overflowing.

700
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,079
Wasting stuff.

701
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,248
Pretty good.

702
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,960
By the way, I'm putting a coin in this one.

703
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,920
Look, enclosing a coin.

704
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,000
Whoever eats the one with the coin,

705
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,119
this year will surely go smoothly.

706
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:31,119
I'll enclose a red date then. Here.

707
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,599
Mom, the coin means smooth sailing.

708
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,920
What does the red date mean?

709
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,176
- You don't know?
- No, I don't know.

710
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:39,424
Ji.

711
00:41:39,424 --> 00:41:40,880
Mom.

712
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,639
Do you know what it means
to enclose a red date in a dumpling?

713
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,559
Of course I know, Mom.

714
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:47,079
What does it mean?

715
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:49,000
You don't know?

716
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,080
You tell her.

717
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,856
I don't know.

718
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,519
May you have a precious child soon.

719
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:01,320
May you have a precious child soon.

720
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,559
May you have a precious child soon.

721
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:06,400
Xiaoning will surely get to eat this dumpling.

722
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:26,728
[The Unburst Fireworks]

723
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,159
If I want to set off fireworks together
with her for the New Year,

724
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,400
she probably won't refuse.

725
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:48,280
But it seems like we are not
that familiar with each other.

726
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,000
How should I approach her?

727
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,039
I'm stepping out for some fresh air.

728
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:59,112
Ji Yuheng?

729
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,159
It's really you. What are you doing here?

730
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:05,679
Do you have relatives living in this community?

731
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,760
I just bought some fireworks nearby.

732
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,800
- Xiaoning.
- Do you want to…?

733
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,848
Go downstairs to set off firecrackers.

734
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,112
What did you say?

735
00:43:14,112 --> 00:43:15,119
I asked if you want to…

736
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,224
Hurry up, get dressed and come down.

737
00:43:16,224 --> 00:43:18,280
Got it.

738
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,192
Happy New Year.

739
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,764
Happy New Year.

♫ I hope you know ♫

758
00:44:47,108 --> 00:44:53,700
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

759
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:59,140
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

760
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:05,892
