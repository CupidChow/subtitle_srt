Mr. Liu, well,

33
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,280
when would you have time
to come out for a chat?

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,879
An already applied commercial loan
cannot be converted to a combined loan.

35
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,239
It can only be converted
into a provident fund loan.

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,400
Right, that depends on whether the balance
in your provident fund account is sufficient.

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,439
Rest assured, I won't force you to buy.

38
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,239

If you feel it's suitable, accept it.

40

It doesn't matter if it's not suitable.

41
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,519
That would certainly be more cost-effective
than a commercial loan, okay?

42
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,120
You see, you and Mr. Ji are fellow townsfolk.

43
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,959

what is my relationship with you?

355
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,559
Do you need to be so extravagant?

356
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,839
Even if you won the lottery today,

357
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,319
you shouldn't spend your money on me.

358
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,359
And why do you care so much about me?

359
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,079
My eyes turned red that many times,
I glanced at Ji that many times.

360
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,960
What does my condition have to do with you?

361
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,039
Do you usually do this outside?

362
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,079
As long as there is someone ambiguous,

363
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,440
you're so considerate
and warm-hearted towards them.

364
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,632
Are you the central air conditioning?

365
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,359
Rao Jing, you've confused me.

366
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,559
I don't understand what you really mean.

367
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,599
What I mean is, I've realized
you're serious about me.

368
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Yes, what's wrong?

369
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:50,200
Nothing much. If it's just for fun,

370
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,799
no matter how extreme, I'm willing
to go along with it to the end.

371
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,200
We're all adults.

372
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,359
Single, bored, just for fun.

373
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,160
But if you're serious with me,

374
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,839
wanting to enter a steady relationship,

375
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,119
sorry, I have no such intention.

376
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,240
Zhao Fanggang, you're being too serious now.

377
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,319
You're so serious that I can't even play along.

378
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:27,160
So you're eager to pay me back.

379
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,079
You just want to set clear boundaries with me.

380
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,400
There's no need to draw the line at ambiguity.

381
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,279
It's the line of being serious
that I'm drawing.

382
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:43,079
Now that you've crossed the line,
it's not fun anymore.

383
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,328
So in your eyes,

384
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm no different from those little boys
who fool around.

385
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,816
I'll go boil some water for you
to soak your feet, okay?

386
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,519
- I'll go get your shoes.
- Tu.

387
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,079
Sit here, I want to talk to you for a while.

388
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,039
From now on, if you want to dance
in the square, just go dance.

389
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,839
If you want to dance with Zhang Guiying,
dance with Zhang Guiying.

390
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,119
If you want to dance with Li Guiying,
dance with Li Guiying.

391
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,128
As long as you're happy.

392
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,192
I've figured it out.

393
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,599
We are at this age and also retired.

394
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,920
The children have their own lives.

395
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,440
Let's go do some things

396
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,079
that make ourselves happy, okay?

397
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:19,200
If there's something
to be happy about every day…

398
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,279
Don't be sad.

399
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,119
From now on, when I dance,

400
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,119
I'll take you with me every time, okay?

401
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,559
If you don't know how, I'll teach you.

402
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,599
If you don't like it,
let's do something you enjoy.

403
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,039
We can go…

404
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:45,319
I'll accompany you shopping.
We can get someone to play cards.

405
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:49,200
Let's go out to have fun,
to see the scenery, okay?

406
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,720
Before, I always felt that life was still long.

407
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,720
But after going through this incident,

408
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,160
I suddenly realized the impermanence of life.

409
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,319
Live and cherish each moment.

410
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,720
I just can't stand it.

411
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,279
A perfectly good person.

412
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:18,759
How could they pass away just like that?

413
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,868
Today, I watched Ji's silhouette.

414
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:27,079
I was thinking, what if it were our turn?

415
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,599
What could Xiaoning do?

416
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:35,528
Here.

417
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,451
After all, it's impossible to stay
with a child for a lifetime.

418
00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:44,288
Right?

419
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:47,839
But start from today,

420
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,440
we can live healthily

421
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,200
and keep a good mood.

422
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,640
This way, we can spend more time
with our daughter.

423
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,664
Right?

424
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,680
I want to soak my feet.

425
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,079
Soak your feet, I will take off
your shoes for you.

426
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:15,304
Wait a moment.

427
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,400
You've been exhausted these days.

428
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,759
I can see the red veins in your eyes.

429
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:49,240
Why don't you take a rest?

430
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,352
It's okay.

431
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,240
Now it's just the two of us.

432
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,599
If you have anything on your mind,
just talk to me.

433
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,519
If you're feeling upset,

434
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:08,759
crying on my shoulder
might make you feel better.

435
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:21,119
It's okay, I'm fine.

436
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,144
Don't worry.

437
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,720
It's just that I'm really a bit tired.

438
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,912
I know.

439
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,559
You rest for a bit, I will cook.

440
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,240
Let me do it.

441
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,960
Turn on the light, it brightens your heart.

442
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,643
I know you're not feeling well

443
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:20,956
and have no appetite.

444
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,720
But still, eat something.

445
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,559
Otherwise, mom would be heartbroken
if she knew.

446
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,656
Okay.

447
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,416
How is it? Does it taste good?

448
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:57,599
Mom said

449
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,440
what I made tasted just as good
as what she made.

450
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,400
I thought I'd never be able
to taste this flavor again.

451
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,719
My mom really passed away.

452
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,719
My mom really passed away.

453
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,568
I don't have a mom anymore.

454
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,599
I found this photo album while sorting
through mom's belongings just now.

455
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,519
Take a look.

456
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,840
During her hospitalization,

457
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,719
she would always write and draw in this album.

458
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,679
It turns out it was all written for you.

Heng, I'm hospitalized again.

This time, I don't know how much longer
I can be with you.

480

Because of my illness, you gave up
the job of your dreams.

00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:13,760
Moving to the business department,
you've been working hard.

483

[The Most Delicious Dumplings in the World]

544
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,559
The key to this filling is the seasoning oil.

545
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,800
You are very photogenic.

546
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,079
Listen to me,

547
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:52,639
you just need to briefly stir-fry it
with hot oil.

548
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,840
But the key

549
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,199
is that you can't use too much oil.

550
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:04,360
Too much and it becomes greasy.

551
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,199
Another thing is to make sure
to cook on low heat.

552
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:10,336
Otherwise, if the flame is too high,

553
00:44:10,336 --> 00:44:12,920
it will be burnt and lose its delicious smell.

554
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,239
This is really a meticulous task.

555
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,920
It's almost done.
Can you smell the delicious smell?

556
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,400
Alright.

557
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,039
Then pour out the seasoning oil.

558
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,360
Mom, rest assured,
I will definitely learn well.

559
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,079
From now on, I'll do it
so you won't have to tire yourself.

560
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:34,199
It's okay if you can't learn it.

561
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:36,800
If you want to eat, I will cook for you.

562
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,440
I will cook as much as you want to eat.
