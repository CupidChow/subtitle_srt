[Episode 13]

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,920
Tu, are you okay?

33
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,519
I've taken the medicine.

34
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:43,400
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Ji. I'm fine.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,512
Are you sure?

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,560
Yes, I'm really okay.

37
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,959
Didn't expect Mr. Ji
to be quite concerned about Tu.

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,840
Caring for subordinates is part of
a department manager's duties.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,080
I hope Xiaoning becomes a regular worker soon,

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,840
so she could help reduce
some of our performance pressure.

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,879
Good, you are so positive.

42
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,319
You and Tu seem to be
the only ones in our department

43
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,199
who are about the age of Mr. Ji, right?

44
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,120
Not everyone can match my senior.

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,479
Just kidding.

46
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,632
You are being jealous.

47
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,159
Mom, don't worry.

48
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,039
Xiaoning might have caught a cold
and a sore throat.

49
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,240
I wanted to consult you.

50
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,439
When she was sick,

51
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,199
what medicine she took that worked quickly?

52
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,319
Steamed oranges.
Eating it and she'll get better.

53
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,560
Just wait. I'll make it
and bring it over to you.

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,360
It's okay, don't bother. I'll do it.

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,639
That works too, I'll send you the recipe.

56
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,639
Just follow the recipe.

57
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,759
Okay, thanks, Mom.

58
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,696
Sir, you're picking oranges?

59
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:06,759
Yes.

60
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,992
We are having a discount on them. Half price.

61
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:12,520
Buy three jin and get three jin free,
would you like some?

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,439
Do you have any of better quality?

63
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,439
The better ones might have no discount.

64
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,240
That's okay.

65
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,439
Those over there

66
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,639
are directly supplied from the place of origin,
especially fresh and sweet.

67
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,159
Alright, please pick out some for me.

68
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,160
Okay.

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,360
Mom has gone to sleep?

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,404
She went to sleep after taking the medicine.

71
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:36,600
[Time's up]

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,720
The timing is perfect.

73
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,639
Mom said you ate this to get over
a cold faster when you were little.

74
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:53,439
It's hot.

75
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,639
I forgot.

76
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,240
But it's my first time making it,
seems like I added too much salt.

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,759
It's okay, having more salt
is what makes it effective.

78
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,784
Really?

79
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:12,360
Is it okay?

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,376
Yes.

81
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,160
I'm fine. Mom took my temperature
as soon as I came home.

82
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,920
I have no fever.

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,008
Then my hands are too cold.

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
I'm really fine.
There's no need to make such a fuss.

85
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,360
Even if you are fine, don't study today.

86
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,384
Go back and rest early.

87
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,712
Okay.

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,544
Does it taste a bit sour and salty?

89
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:49,639
No.

90
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,079
- I'll make it for you again.
- No.

91
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,560
I finish this today,

92
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,519
and will surely get better by tomorrow.

93
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,519
I'm going to take another one
tomorrow morning to enhance the effect.

94
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,680
No problem, I'll make it for you.

95
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,680
Well,

96
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,199
could you put a little less salt?

97
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,160
- Of course, I can.
- Okay.

98
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,879
Sunrise, sunset, and the starry sky

99
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,160
are the most beautiful scenes I think.

100
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,808
It's really nice
to have you enjoy them with me.

101
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:10,199
What does it feel like?

102
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,879
Isn't that the feeling of being in love?

103
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,120
When you went back to your hometown,

104
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,519
I thought you would never
come back to Star City anymore.

105
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:28,600
I just thought that in the future,
there might be no one

106
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,519
to do such romantic yet boring things with me.

107
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,519
Now I am here.

108
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,360
From now on, I will stay with you
and do such things. I won't leave anymore.

109
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
Tomorrow night is the New Year's Eve.

110
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,720
In the new year, I can once again not be alone.

111
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,279
Tomorrow, I'll give you a New Year's present.

112
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,800
Really? What is it?

113
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
You're not telling me? Fine.

114
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,759
How are you?

115
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,240
You're not coughing much anymore.

116
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,720
Did you take your medicine?

117
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,800
I did.

118
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,520
Three times a day, not a single dose missed.

119
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,600
Let me talk to her.

120
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,560
Xiaoning, you have an exam tomorrow, right?

121
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,159
I have a good idea.

122
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,720
How about I go to the entrance
of your bank and put up a banner

123
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,759
to cheer you on?

124
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,919
I'll let your mom go too.
Have your mom wear a qipao tomorrow.

125
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,720
To cheer you up. What do you think?

126
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,759
I'm not going, it's embarrassing. You'd go.

127
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,919
Mom, why don't you get
some medicine for dad to take?

128
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,519
You're right. Let me tell you,

129
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,639
your dad feels uneasy
if he doesn't play fool for a day.

130
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,320
Listen,

131
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,000
how about I wear a hooded outfit tomorrow?

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,720
I'll dress up

133
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,840
as that thing that girls like nowadays.

134
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,639
- Like this.
- What's that thing again?

135
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,720
- That…
- Fox.

136
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,824
That fox.

137
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:07,399
Don't do it.

138
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,360
I know you want to soothe me.

139
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,872
I'm not nervous at all. Don't worry about me.

140
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:12,960
That's good then.

141
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,120
Okay, keep it up!

142
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,200
Go for it!

143
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,224
Bye.

144
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,559
I have used the power of metaphysics.

145
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,960
So you can definitely pass the exam.

146
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Love you.

147
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,832
You're at the top of my list

148
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:31,884
right now alone.

149
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,519
Come on. The top of your list

150
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,759
is Ji Yuheng
whom you kiss in the bedroom closet.

151
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,600
Now that you're living under the same roof,

152
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,120
you can speed up the progress now.

153
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,480
No matter how pretty that face is,
you still need to test him on the field.

154
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,759
Why is your face blushing?

155
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,808
Are you running a fever again?

156
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,559
No. I think the cold
hasn't completely cleared up.

157
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,616
Let me check.

158
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,840
Your face isn't hot.
It doesn't seem like a fever.

159
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,840
I'm not having a fever. Just the cold
hasn't completely cleared up.

160
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,600
I know my body pretty well.

161
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,679
It's fine if you don't need
to speed up the progress.

162
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,080
Why did you eavesdrop on me?

163
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
What?

164
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,159
I came in and chatted with you.

165
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,816
But you chatted with Ling Weiyi

166
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:39,879
and doubted my…

167
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,559
No, no. You heard it wrong.

168
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,759
I'm going to sleep now. You can go.

169
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,800
That sudden?

170
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,279
- Come out.
- No.

171
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,152
Come out.

172
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,240
You have an exam tomorrow.

173
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
If you get sick from it
and perform poorly tomorrow, you'll blame me.

174
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Rest well.

175
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,200
I didn't hear you cough all the way just now.

176
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,559
You should be getting better.

177
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,960
Remember to drink some water later.

178
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,200
Got it.

Mr. Zhao, getting so excited?

I am now seriously informing you as a creditor,

before the midnight on January 1st.

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,559
please settle the interest you promised me.

208
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,399
Otherwise, I will add
the interest onto the principal.

209

You understand the power
of compound interest, right?

210

I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao.
I was a bit arrogant just now.

No problem. If I'm right,

Yes, if you happen to pass away,
then I'll have an activity.

215
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,519
I could go attend your funeral.

It's the New Year, don't say such things.

217

If you don't have any plans,

218
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,096
I could ask you out,

219

Wait, Zhao. Did you ask Mr. Ji about it?

231
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,879
I did, but I was rejected.

232
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,720
He said he has to have dinner with his family.

233
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,240
Well, Mr. Zhao, I'm really sorry.

234
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,919
It looks like Tu has to refuse you as well.

235
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,000
She also has to have dinner with her family.

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,720

Seems like they are a family.

238
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,320

239
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,840
Let's dismiss. Go home.

240
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,519
Sorry.

241
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,840

Why doesn't Mom come along?

252
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,360
She is a bit tired and wants to rest tonight.

253
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,399
You've had a tough day.

254
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,879
Let's see what you want to order.

255
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,399
This restaurant is a bit expensive.

256
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,360
I heard that the food of this place is nice.

257
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,720
But I've never been here myself.

258
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,879
But it's just the two of us.

259
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,960
I think it's a bit expensive.

260
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,799
How about we go somewhere else?

261
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,576
Take a look at the menu first.

262
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,679
It's already this late.

263
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,080
The slightly better restaurants
are probably all booked by now.

264
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,639
If we must leave,

265
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,720
we might just have to go to the noodle shop
near our community.

266
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,759
Spending the New Year's Eve
at the noodle shop near our community

267
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,960
is really a bit shabby.

268
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,200
Indeed. Shall we give it a go?

269
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,559
Alright then, it's been a tough year.

270
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,799
Just take it as a little treat for us.

271
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,904
Exactly.

272
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,120
Hello, the food you ordered is here.

273
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:46,919
Thank you.

274
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,120
Please enjoy your meal.

275
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,184
Okay.

276
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I haven't ordered,
yet the food is already served.

277
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,519
You had already ordered it.

278
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,840
After all, this is our first
New Year's Eve together.

279
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,080
I must treat it seriously.

280
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,799
Rest assured, I can still afford

281
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,400
such a candlelit dinner.

282
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,960
Then why did you mention the noodle shop?

283
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,759
You treat me to dinner.

284
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,880
Let me share some good news with you.

285
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,559
Okay.

286
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,240
I think I did quite well in the exam.

287
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,079
I reviewed the case analysis
several times after the exam.

288
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,559
I think I could pass it.

289
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,559
Next, I will have to work on
independently acquiring clients.

290
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,440
After the vacation,

291
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,680
I will start looking for clients.

292
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,640
This seems pretty nice.

293
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,279
Then this is worth to celebrate.

294
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,559
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

295
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,440
Ji is so thoughtful.

296
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,839
Look, he's ordered so much delicious food

297
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,839
and even brought us here.

298
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,079
He really made it formally.

299
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,519
He is considerate.

300
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,960
It's all about the hustle and bustle
to celebrate the New Year's Eve.

301
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,920
After Yuheng got together with Xiaoning,

302
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,279
he's truly become much happier.

303
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,799
Due to my poor health,

304
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:18,519
we seldom celebrated the New Year seriously,

305
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,240
so our home was always desolate.

306
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,640
In the future, if you don't mind,

307
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,720
let's spend the festivals together.

308
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,720
That's great. It's been so long
since the home was this lively.

309
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,839
Why don't you move to our place?

310
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,440
Sure. If you move to our place,

311
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,160
then she'd have company.

312
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,160
With you, I can go out for walks or strolls

313
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,720
whenever I want.

314
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,880
What do you mean?

315
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,519
If you don't go out for walks
or strolls with me,

316
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,240
you'd go dancing with someone else?

317
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,119
- I…
- This man…

318
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,519
I'll do something else.

319
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,240
I can play chess or go fishing.

320
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,759
Alright then.

321
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,759
I'm serious, in-law.

322
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,839
Ever since Xiaoning moved out,

323
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,319
our home has been quite desolate too.

324
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,319
If you go to our place,
it would liven up our place.

325
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,720
I would bother you so much.

326
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,279
Not at all.

327
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,920
Just prepare meals for one more person.

328
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,359
Think about it,
the two of us can talk and chat.

329
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,880
We can also go shopping together.

330
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Anyway, if you are okay with it,

331
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,119
we will come pick you up right away.

332
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,599
Right, there's plenty of space at home.

333
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,079
Thank you.

334
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,104
Think about it.

335
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,960
This song is quite nice.

336
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,400
Look, he's not as handsome as Ji.

337
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,519
If I do well on my exam this time,

338
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,599
then I would have almost completed

339
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,920
about 20% of the KPIs in our agreement.

340
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,200
20%? That's quite a lot.

341
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,360
How about you?

342
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,960
Talk about it. The two of us
are friendly competitors.

343
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,839
Why do you keep it a secret? Share with me.

344
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,000
Are you halfway there already?

345
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,920
Of course not.

346
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,160
There are few clients in our department.

347
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,079
Could I possibly keep a few hidden from you?

348
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,279
But you're the leader.

349
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,000
If you keep some hidden,
I wouldn't know either.

350
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,839
I don't.

351
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,839
Good then.

352
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,880
Ji, you need to work harder.

353
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,248
Okay, leader.

354
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,759
Xiaoning, actually, I have something

355
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,240

You go first.

It's okay, you take the call first.

359
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,640
- I'm going to the restroom.
- Okay.

360
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,720
Hello, Weiyi, what's wrong?

361
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Where are you?

362
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't know either.

363
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,799
Qi Yu asked me to a place
I've never been before

364
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,512
and he hasn't arrived yet.

365

What about you? What are you doing?

366
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,119
Do you want to spend
New Year's Eve with me tonight?

367
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,200
I heard there are fireworks
at the Bell Tower tonight.

368
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,472
No.

I'm dining with Ji Yuheng

370

at a Western restaurant on Wutong Road.

371
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,160
So, I won't watch the fireworks
with you tonight.

372
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,400
I heard that restaurant is quite expensive.
He booked it?

373
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,680
I think he planned it long ago.

374
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,039
What a coincidence.
He was about to tell me something,

375
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,440
and you happened to call.

376
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,039
Is he going to confess to you?

377
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,416
I have to go now.

378
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,520
I'm back.

379
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,079
Was the call an emergency?

380
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,640
No, nothing special.

381
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,480
Okay, let's eat.

382
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,352
What do you want to tell me?

383
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:09,519
Nothing.

384
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,000
Is the food enough? Should we order some more?

385
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,720
Come on, let's cut the cake.

386
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,759
Do you really have nothing to say to me?

387
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,880
Why do you ask so suddenly?

388
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,599
Come on, cut it.

389
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,559
There really isn't a ring.

390
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,119
How is it? Is the taste good?

391
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,400
Delicious.

392
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,880
This is a new store.

393
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,960

705
00:43:58,084 --> 00:44:01,032
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

706
00:44:01,032 --> 00:44:04,132
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

707
00:44:04,132 --> 00:44:09,292
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

708
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:13,476
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

709
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:16,964
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

710
00:44:16,964 --> 00:44:20,876
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

711
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,188
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

712
00:44:25,188 --> 00:44:32,068
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

713
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:36,292
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

714
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:41,028
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

715
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:44,164
♫ To you and no one else ♫

716
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:48,996
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

717
00:44:48,996 --> 00:44:51,172
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

718
00:44:51,172 --> 00:44:54,348
♫ No one knows ♫

719
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,508
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

720
00:44:57,508 --> 00:45:00,876
♫ I hope you know ♫

721
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:08,932
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

722
00:45:08,932 --> 00:45:14,372
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

723
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:21,124
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

724
00:45:21,124 --> 00:45:25,380
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

725
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,532
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

726
00:45:30,532 --> 00:45:33,476
♫ To you and no one else ♫

727
00:45:33,476 --> 00:45:38,148
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

728
00:45:38,148 --> 00:45:40,580
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

729
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,788
♫ No one knows ♫

730
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,564
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

731
00:45:46,564 --> 00:45:50,732
♫ I hope you know ♫
