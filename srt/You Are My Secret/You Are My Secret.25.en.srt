[Episode 25]

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,879
Miss Geng, I would like to ask you

33
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,879
to arrange for Ji Yuheng from Dairui
to meet with Mr. Xia.

34
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,680
Why do you think you can
meet Xia Mingrui through me?

35
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,400
Actually, I am not sure myself.

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,000
I also know that it's highly likely
that you won't help me,

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,319
but I have no other options.

38
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,239
I can only brace myself and give it a try.

39
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,256
Please.

40
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,519
Sorry, I can't help you with this.

41
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,280
I have to go now, a press conference to attend.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,680
Regarding the matter last time,

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,400
if you want more compensation for your actions,

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,240
you can contact my assistant.

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,400
I will try my best to accommodate.

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,360
Miss Geng, I understand

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,680
that the relationships
between people are very complex,

48
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,120
and sometimes they take years to maintain

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
and can only be sustained
under tremendous pressure.

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,520
And the hardship involved
is something only oneself would know.

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,560
I feel you.

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,680
If it weren't absolutely necessary,

53
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,120
I really wouldn't have come to you.

54
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,319
Are you threatening me?

55
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,639
Of course not.

56
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,080
I'm here to plead with you to do me this favor.

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,719
I don't know how much you understand

58
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,120
about my relationship with Xia Mingrui,

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,319
but I definitely won't

60
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,840
let our relationship become
a weapon in someone else's hands.

61
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:58,319
Miss Geng.

62
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,840
Luckily, my visa has not expired,

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,520
and the bank has kindly approved my travel.

64
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,319
Besides, I am familiar with the United States.

65
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,719
I think with some effort,

66
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,439
I can certainly meet with Mr. Xia.

67
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,759
That is indeed a solution.

68
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,360
Mr. Xia is very busy in China.

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,120
Perhaps he'll have more leisure time
in the United States.

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,000
Hopefully.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,039
Anyway, I will accommodate
his schedule 24 hours a day.

72
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,319
Hopefully, his itinerary isn't too packed.

73
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,360
You've got guts to just up and go like that.

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,639
Don't be in a hurry to praise me.

75
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,240
Wait until the deal is done.

76
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,360
I don't know if the talk fails,

77
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,840
whether the bank will reimburse my airfare.

78
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,879
If Mr. Xia's schedule is uncertain,

79
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,759
do you plan to just stay off-duty
in the United States waiting for him?

80
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,960
Leaders will have objections.

81
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,680
And there's the person from Division Two.

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,800
Who knows what trouble could arise
while you're gone?

83
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,439
Yes, that's why I called you over.

84
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,759
I hope that in my absence,

85
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,599
you can keep a closer eye
on the department's work for me.

86
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,120
Make sure there are no mistakes.

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,919
Don't give the people from Division Two
any leverage over us.

88
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,000
I will arrange a meeting
with Mr. Xia as soon as possible.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,719
I got it. I'll get back to work.

90
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,479
I plan to fly to the U.S. to see Mr. Xia

91
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,160
on tonight's flight.

92
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,208
Where are you?

93
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,360
Miss Geng, Miss Geng.

94
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,079
Could you please give me a minute of your time?

95
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,279
Would you listen to me, please?

96
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,959
I beg of you, just one minute.

97
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,639
Miss Geng, Miss Geng.

98
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,639
Miss Geng, please.

99
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,399
Miss Geng, Miss Geng.

100
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,080
Stop the car.

101
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,600
Thank you, Miss Geng.

102
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,560
The terms Dairui can offer Weiji

103
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,519
are definitely the best in Star City.

104
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,959
With the endorsement of Professor Jia,

105
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,959
I believe Mr. Xia would not want
to miss this opportunity.

106
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,240
Miss Tu, threats don't work on me,

107
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,672
nor does clinging on so desperately.

108
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:53,759
Just go home.

109
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,399
I know, I just wanted to tell you

110
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,519
that Ji Yuheng of Dairui

111
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,120
is actually my soon-to-be husband.

112
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,759
Our relationship has always
been difficult to make public.

113
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm not doing this to threaten you.

114
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,000
I just want to help him.

115
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,879
Get in the car.

116
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,928
Thank you.

117
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,399
What's with your get-up?

118
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,399
None of your business.

119
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,399
You didn't do this to yourself on purpose

120
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,600
to make Senior worry about you?

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,640
Get out of my way.

122
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,920
Hey, what if you catch a cold?

123
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,136
I have something to tell you.

124
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,680
You don't have to go to America anymore.

125
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,120
Mr. Xia is actually in the country.

126
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,240
I've met someone who has agreed

127
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,720
to arrange a meeting with Mr. Xia
for us tomorrow at 4 PM.

128
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,792
Are you kidding me?

129
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:54,920
- Tang Yuhui.
- Tang Yuhui.

130
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,256
What's wrong with you?

131
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:58,920
Whether I'm kidding or not,
we'll find out tomorrow, right?

132
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,360
Why do you always look down on others?

133
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,879
Alright, I'll assume you
have made the appointment.

134
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,279
But it's something I can handle
with just a single sentence.

135
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,680
Look at the state you're in now.

136
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,800
Getting drenched like this
must have been quite an effort.

137
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,120
It's something you could
have settled with just one sentence.

138
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,879
Why didn't you do it earlier?

139
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,519
Don't think that knowing a little secret

140
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,000
gives you the right to threaten others.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,920
I won't give you the chance
to turn it into a weapon.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,639
Are you feeling unwell?

143
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm okay.

144
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,959
Come, try if it's hot.

145
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,888
It's hot!

146
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,976
As a leader, I must thank you.

147
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:04,600
But as a lover,

148
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,639
I hope that in the future,

149
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,920
you won't do such foolish things
without consulting me.

150
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,959
I would be very worried.

151
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:15,079
As a subordinate,
sales is a tough job to begin with.

152
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,000
I hope to make some achievements.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,920
As your lover, I worry about you.

154
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,560
I want to do what I can for you.

155
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,199
Besides, who knew you had a backup plan?

156
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,000
So, it sounds like you
don't have confidence in me.

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,079
That's not the case.

158
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,840
Really, I feel so terrible.

159
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,200
I might be getting a cold, a bad cold.

160
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,039
But my fiance is still here
giving me a lecture.

161
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,240
Hey, don't say that.

162
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,000
Didn't we agree

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,519
not to talk about work at home?

164
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,696
Can you stop scolding me?

165
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,240
I want to talk to you
about something very serious.

166
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,200
Tang Yuhui knows about our relationship now.

167
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,360
The whole world knows she likes you.

168
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
Would she immediately

169
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
spill the beans to everyone

170
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,200
so that I'd have to pack my things and leave?

171
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:26,519
How can you be so sure that you will
be the one who leaves in the end?

172
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,879
We have a bet agreement between us.

173
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:31,320
We must act according to the agreement.

174
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,240
Although I don't know how far along you are,

175
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
my KPI of 50 million

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,159
is still not completed.

177
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,639
If it gets out now,
I would be the one who leaves.

178
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,440
There's no need to worry too much.

179
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,840
Actually, there are generally
three types of people in the bank.

180
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,840
The first kind relies on their own abilities,

181
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,600
the second relies on their family's resources,

182
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,720
and the third has both of the aforementioned.

183
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,200
And Tang Yuhui is exactly this third type.

184
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,440
Such people, from a young age,

185
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,679
have been accustomed
to assessing the situation.

186
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,639
And they have a bit of pride as well.

187
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,720
So whatever they do
has to be to their advantage.

188
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,639
Think about it carefully.

189
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,360
If Tang Yuhui didn't expose us
at the first opportunity,

190
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,200
it means she must think this matter

191
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,360
is of no benefit to her.

192
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,840
I hope so.

193
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:33,920
The temperature is fine now.

194
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,960
Ginger soup dispels cold. Drink up.

195
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,840
I can leave Dairui to be with him,

196
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,896
can you?

197
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,159
If there really comes such a day,

198
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:55,039
what choices would Ji Yuheng and I make?

199
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Please wait a moment.

200
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,919
Mingrui is still in a meeting.

201
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,039
His schedule is particularly full
these two days before he goes abroad.

202
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,080
These two hours today
were supposed to be our date.

203
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,320
Thank you, Miss Geng.
Really, thank you very much.

204
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,304
Mr. Xia.

205
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,000
Who might these two be?

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is Xiaoning, a new friend I've just made.

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,639
This is Mr. Ji, her fiancé.

208
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,279
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Xia.

209
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,672
Hello, Ji Yuheng from Dairui.

210
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:46,304
Hello.

211
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,559
Hello, I'm Tu Xiaoning,
an Account Manager from Dairui.

212
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,632
Hello.

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,720
We've finally managed to find time for a date.

214
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,120
How did it suddenly turn into work again?

215
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,039
We have plenty of time in the future.

216
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,720
Once the resort matter is settled,

217
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,759
you'll be able to accompany me properly.

218
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,519
By the way, I heard that Star City
has a town treasure called Nanshan.

219
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,360
The temple there is very popular.

220
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
I've always wanted to go and see it,

221
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,759
but I haven't had a proper guide.

222
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,600
Xiaoning, you're a local.

223
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,840
Would you like to accompany me to see it?

224
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,639
Of course, I'd like to.

225
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,712
Then you two chat.

226
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,720
Let's go.

227
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,880
Sit down.

228
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,464
Mr. Ji, I remember your proposal

229
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:42,879
with Professor Jia Ziqing as financial advisor.

230
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,120
It was impressive.

231
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:02,268
[Release the soul of baby girl]

232
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,799
This is a souvenir from our press conference,

233
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,120
the famous Chinese zodiac.

234
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,720
It's also used for the child's
first birthday grabbing ritual.

235
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,919
I'll pay for it now.

236
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,024
Okay.

237
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,559
Miss Geng, thank you.

238
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,752
It's fine, I met your fiancé today.

239
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:44,519
Indeed, he is quite outstanding.

240
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,360
Did you get secretly married because of work?

241
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,480
Yes.

242
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,200
Even when you were fighting
for his chance to meet Mingrui,

243
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,440
you only disclosed your relationship
when you were out of options.

244
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,399
I can very much relate to that.

245
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,000
Love is the hardest thing to conceal,

246
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,039
yet you can't share with others

247
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,480
the happiness or the pain.

248
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,000
Therefore, I am willing to help you out.

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,720
It's also like accumulating
blessings for myself.

250
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,440
Thank you for your help.

251
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,879
I also believe that you will
get what you hope for.

252
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,816
Let's go.

253
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,039
So, when facing a big company like Weiji,

254
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,279
I believe that any bank

255
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,712
will offer the best solution
in terms of loan duration,

256
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:38,120
amount, and interest rate.

257
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,120
As Weiji Resort's pilot city

258
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,240
for development into second-tier cities,

259
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,080
Star City also has different consumption needs
from first-tier cities.

260
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,600
Hence, the financial service plan

261
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,799
also needs to meet the local market
and customer structure.

262
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,399
This makes it hard to simply copy
and replicate past experiences.

263
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,799
But rest assured,

264
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,519
Dairui will fully cooperate with Professor Jia

265
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,279
and optimize a financing scheme

266
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,759
that fits the economic characteristics
of second-tier cities

267
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,399
and is easy to promote
based on Weiji's actual economic needs.

268
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,879
I understood everything you just said.

269
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:13,919
Later, I will instruct my assistant
to coordinate with you on the specifics.

270
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,159
So, Mr. Xia, are you saying…

271
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,879
The structure and details
of the plan you just mentioned

272
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,159
are much more intuitive
than what's in the document.

273
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,279
Let's proceed with a strategic
cooperation agreement.

274
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,679
Alright.

275
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,148
On behalf of Dairui,

276
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,279
thank you for your support and trust.

277
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,200
Mr. Xia, just as the rumors say,

278
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,360
you seem to know the importance of time.

279
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,639
You don't waste time
on comparisons and hesitations.

280
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,440
Too many comparisons are meaningless.

281
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,039
What I choose must be the best.

282
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,464
If we leave now,

283
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:01,280
I can still see my wife
before the next meeting.

284
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,488
Shall we go together?

285
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:04,519
Sure.

286
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,632
Let's go.

287
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,799
Your contribution to securing

288
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,000
the Weiji project is indispensable.

289
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,759
Tell me, did a lot of people come to poach you

290
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,039
the minute the word got out?

291
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,000
Sir, leaders from headquarters
came for a meeting

292
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,840
and suddenly requested to see me.
Is it also because of the Weiji matter?

293
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,872
Yes.

294
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,208

Yes, let me introduce you.

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,440
This is the person who played
a key role in securing Weiji.

of Development Department Division One.

300
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,919
Hello, sir.

301
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,120
So young and promising. A bright future awaits.

302
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,200
You flatter me.

303
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,279
If not for the effort
of my team at the forefront,

304
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,639
I might not have been
able to seize this opportunity.

305
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,200
I've heard about this matter too.

306
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,559
What's the name of that newcomer? Tu…

307
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,648
Tu Xiaoning.

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,039

the deposit slip for this time.

310

I heard you were here so I brought it over.

311
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,759
Thank you for the hard work, Hui.

312

I will order it for you.

No need. I'm working right now.

314

Let's wait for next time.

315
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,359
I'll come visit you with my dad on the day off.

316
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,559
That'll be great.

317

The news that your department securing Weiji

318
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,720
took less than half an afternoon
to spread through the entire industry.

319
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,200
It's such a big honor.

320

Give me the inside scoop.

321
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,359

No, it wasn't my dad.

323
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,039

definitely consider it seriously.

Who allowed you to put this here?
There are portrait rights.

00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,240
No taking it back.

356
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,240
Is your phone just for show?

357
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,000
It doesn't even have an alarm clock.

358
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,319
Who unplugged my phone charger last night

359
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,839
and plugged it into their own phone?

360
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,119
My phone is out of battery.

361
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,000
What, should it ring by sheer willpower?

362
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,400
A day full of vitality.

363
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,640
- Good morning, Jing.
- Good morning, Jing.

364
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,960
- Morning, Jing.
- Morning.

365
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,319
Good morning, Zhao.

366
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,456
Morning.

367
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,359
What are you doing?

368
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,920
Sneaking around early
in the morning, it's terrifying.

369
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,079
Zhao, you're late!
Don't you care about your lifeline?

370
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
The full attendance bonus.

371
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,319
I was delayed by some matters
at home this morning.

372
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,720
Zhao, something seems off with you lately.

373
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,559
Last week, you could have earned
triple pay for overtime.

374
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,759
But you didn't, claiming to have family issues.

375
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,824
It's not quite normal.

376
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,920
You people…

377
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,720
When I was ambitious before,
I worked overtime every day,

378
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,760
and you invited me out for drinks.

379
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,519
If I didn't go, you said I didn't care.

380
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,039
Now that I'm indifferent to fame and wealth,

381
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,119
I leave the opportunities to you,

382
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
and you're questioning me.

383
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,000
You're indifferent to fame and wealth,

384
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,640
but there must be something else
that you're intense about, right?

385
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,839
Family matters.
Zhao, these are not minor family issues.

386
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,240
It's a big deal. You're seeing someone.

387
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,776
Are you dating someone?

388
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,359
He has a partner now.

389
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,319
Zhao, that's not cool.

390
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,720
How can you keep this a secret?

391
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,319
When will you bring your wife out
so we can meet her?

392
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,200
I, I, these past few days, well…

393
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,079
I've been busy signing the contract
with Weiji Company.

394
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,359
How about this, I'll treat everyone
to a meal in a while.

395
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,080
Is she in the same industry?

396
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,835
Take a look at this news.

397
00:22:10,835 --> 00:22:11,680
[Star City Branch reaches
cooperation with Weiji Company]

398
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,956
It seems we have successfully negotiated
a partnership with Weiji Company.

399
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:17,736
[Star City Branch reaches
cooperation with Weiji Company]

400
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,799
The watch Mr. Xia is wearing
is quite expensive.

401
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,160
How come you're interested in watches now?

402
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,648
Did you change your watch?

403
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,136
This suits you.

404
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:32,512
Look at our leader.

405
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:36,200
How long has he worn that old watch?
He's so low-key.

406
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,799
- Yes.
- You're all here.

407
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,240
I have some news to announce to everyone.

408
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,519
Tang has gone to see a client.

409
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:45,519
Please pass on the message later.

410
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,519
Okay.

411
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:49,880
We have officially settled
the contract with Weiji Company.

412
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,880
Thank you for your
hard work during this period.

413
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,440
Especially, we owe thanks to Tu.

414
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:05,279
Alright, Jing, your apprentice
has completely graduated.

415
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,160
She's even bolder than you.

416
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,240
I'm happy to see that.

417
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,079
I have another piece of news
to announce to everyone.

418
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,839
Mr. Xia has officially invited us next week

419
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,359
to visit the operational
resort project of Weiji.

420
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,319
Our department hasn't had
a team-building event for a long time.

421
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,920
This time the bank has specially
approved paid leave for us.

422
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,960
Let's take a good break.

423
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,559
- Great!
- We can go out and have fun!

424
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,712
We can drink now.

425
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,319
Go back to work, go, go, go.

426
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,000
His close female friend…

427
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,168
Alright, alright.

428
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,912
Ms. Rao.

429
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:48,319
I have a client over here.

430
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,559
He has always said that he feels at your end…

431
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,599
Here. Let me take a look.

432
00:23:58,759 --> 00:23:59,880
When did you buy it?

433
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Before coming up.

434
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,079
How is it? Any problems?

435
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,279
- No problem
- Good.

436
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,000
Remember to eat.

437
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,120
Leave. Get going.

438
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,599
Are you free after work? Come shopping with me.

439
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,920
Are you really going to buy a watch?

440
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,464
You're the one who used
to put even a single yuan in

441
00:24:38,464 --> 00:24:41,119
some Dairui account to earn interest.

442
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,680
Now you're really willing
to spend the money, huh?

443
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,160
I think that Ji Yuheng

444
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,880
has cultivated some great
fortune in his past life.

445
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,119
Keep it low-key, low-key

446
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,519
He socializes a lot.
He should have a decent watch.

447
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,640
I've been managing money for so long,

448
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,119
and I never thought about buying him a gift.

449
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,839
He settled the deal with Weiji this time.

450
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,759
This will be a celebration for him.

451
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,000
He secured Weiji
and the gift is a luxury watch.

452
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,319
Does it need to be so extravagant?

453
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,960
Of course, it does, He secured Weiji after all.

454
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,119
This way, he's more likely
to go to Ji'an Branch.

455
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,640
I'll buy him a watch

456
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,880
as an early celebration for him.

457
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,519
Besides, my birthday is in a couple of days.

458
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,240
He will buy me a gift.

459
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,519
Then, I'll immediately present
this watch as a return gift.

460
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,000
Wouldn't he be incredibly touched?

461
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,279
I aim to get a firm hold on him.

462
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:32,440
Okay, you're much more extravagant than me now.

463
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,880
I'm frequently wounded by assassins now.

464
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,079
You know, supermarket assassins are one thing,

465
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,559
but to think there are also
ice cream assassins and duck-neck assassins.

466
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:44,319
Even power banks are assassins.

467
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,440
Ever since my last argument with Qi Yu

468
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,160
about money issues,

469
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,920
I've been thinking about whether I can
live on my own salary.

470
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,400
But my salary of 3,000 yuan

471
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,528
is like a handful of sand
on the beach in the face of reality,

472
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,279
gone with the wind.

473
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,680
The power of love is truly great.

474
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,640
It can even change your view on money.

475
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,119
Dairui Qianqianbao, why don't you consider it?

476
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,319
Stop teasing me.

477
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,799
I don't even use my dad's card anymore.

478
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,279
Surviving on my own salary is a problem now,

479
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,599
let alone saving money.

480
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:20,720
No worries, when you have money,
I'll find a good wealth management plan.

481
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,519
I hope that day comes soon.

482
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,599
What are you looking at?

483
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,000
Nothing.

484
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,039
Please don't be mad.

485
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,880
I'll never believe that
you're getting a divorce again.

486
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,960
Those two people look so familiar.

487
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,279
That man is…

488
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,160
Don't point at them.

489
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,440
Let's buy a bag later, the latest model, okay?

490
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,680
To come across such a juicy
piece of gossip while shopping.

491
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,720
Incredible.

492
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,759
This isn't any gossip.

493
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:53,056
Stop looking. Don't.

494
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,720
After buying the watch later,
I'll treat you to something delicious.

495
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,119
Really? Then I must treat myself
to something expensive.

496
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,400
You have no idea what I've been through lately.

497
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,519
To implement the principle
of 'spend what you earn',

498
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:06,839
even my meals have been downgraded.

499
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,759
I'll upgrade it for you later.

500
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,759
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

501
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,720
I'm sorry we can't celebrate
your first birthday alone

502
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,319
since we've been together.

503
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,440
But you have to give me a gift.

504
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,608
What gift have you prepared for me?

505
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:25,920
It's a secret.

506
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
A secret?

507
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,839
Do you think our colleagues
know it's my birthday?

508
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,799
Will they prepare a surprise for me?

509
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,759
How would I know that?

510
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,119
You, Zhao Fanggang, and Rao Jing,

511
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,960
you conspire every day in your little group,

512
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
would you tell me about it?

513
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,640
How do you know we have a small group?

514
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,279
So there really is one, I guessed right.

515
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,799
You're really scheming.

516
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:54,720
One day if you sell me out, I'd still be
helping you count the money.

517
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,240
No, I want a refund.

518
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,759
It's too late now.

519
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,480
I think I forgot to bring my conditioner.

520
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,680
No worries, I'll get it for you.

521
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,760

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,599
♪ Oh heavens, what to do, what to do ♪

531
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,600
Do you want to hear me sing?

532
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:08,599
Of course, it's been a long time
since I heard Mr. Ji sing.

533
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,000
♪ Why am I so good-looking ♪

534
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,200
Alright, that's enough.

535
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,920
You don't have to sing, you know?

536
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,680
This was originally a pretty good song,

537
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,519
but you've sung it to pieces.

538
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,880
Listening to it really makes me a bit…
it's making me nauseous.

539
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,359
Jing, do you really feel unwell?

540
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:35,200
Maybe the work pressure
has been really too much recently.

541
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,359
Mr. Ji suddenly gave us a holiday,

542
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,079
and now I've finally relaxed,

543
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,599
I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable.

544
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:43,039
Then stop singing, Zhao.

545
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,672
Alright now.

546
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,319
Are you okay? Did my singing do this to you?

547
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,624
Feeling better?

548
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,079
Jing, you've started dating, haven't you?

549
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,168
Are you in a relationship?

550
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,079
Why are you smiling like a girl in love?

551
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,599
No, isn't it normal for me
to always be in a relationship?

552
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,599
It's not like my dating
is the whole village's hope or something.

553
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,200
Look at that look in your eyes.

554
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,400
This time it seems like you've met true love.

555
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,880
I feel it's not quite the same.

556
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,720
Is it a sunny younger guy

557
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,119
or is it a restrained older guy?

558
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:35,519
He's neither a younger guy nor an older guy.

559
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,519
He's an older brother.

560
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,000
He must be very handsome, right?

561
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,319
Otherwise, you definitely
wouldn't be interested.

562
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:42,000
Xiaoning, I just have to tell you.

563
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,119
He has looks like Daniel Wu,

564
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:50,079
a melancholic demeanor like Tony Leung,

565
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,079
and moves that rival Donnie Yen.

566
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,279
Really? Oh, my goodness.

567
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,039
The song you were just singing,

568
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,319
he can sing it as well as Jacky Cheung.

569
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,680
Wow.

570
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
That's awesome.

571
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,200
Rao Jing, are you having second thoughts?

572
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,000
The person you're describing,
does he relate to me?

573
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,912
Alright, enough joking around with you guys.

574
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:16,559
I was just teasing you all.

575
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,160
The greatest strength of this person

576
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,960
is his exceptional self-awareness.

577
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,288
♪ Secretly, secretly stole my heart away ♪

578
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,272
Okay, thank you, you go ahead.

579
00:31:42,272 --> 00:31:44,424
Come on.

580
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,000
I know everyone has been working hard recently,

581
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,759
having to meet performance goals
and dealing with clients.

582
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,599
This time, for our team building,

583
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,519
no matter how much the company reimburses,

584
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:59,720
I'll cover all other expenses.

585
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,039
What we're going for is happiness and joy.

586
00:32:03,904 --> 00:32:04,960
Mr. Ji is right.

587
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,519
Coming out to play, all we want is a good time.

588
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,519
Yeah, Mr. Ji, let's have
a whole roasted lamb tonight.

589
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,616
Sure, no problem.

590
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,279
This year, our Star City branch
is enjoying such splendid success.

591
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,119
If next year we win the sales crown,

592
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,880
should we go to Antarctica for team building?

593
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,720
That place is too cold.
If you want to go, go by yourself.

594
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,799
I'd rather go to Africa.

595
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,536
I'm going to see the animals,
the great migration.

596
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:26,599
Look at your taste.

597
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,920
Come on. The rooms are all ready.

598
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,200
Tang, you are with Jr. and Sr. Yao.

599
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,039
I can't. I'm a light sleeper.

600
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,480
I can't sleep in the same room
with someone else.

601
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,960
Alright, then I'll get you
a single room in a bit.

602
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,519
Make sure you have your ID card with you.

603
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,599
Okay, thank you.

604
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,576
- The three of us gents will share one room.
- Alright.

605
00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:50,640
- I'll give your ID cards back to you later.
- Okay.

606
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,160
Rao Jing, you'll stay with Tu in a room.

607
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,759
Come.

608
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,920
Zhao, who is Mr. Ji sharing a room with?

609
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,519
Mr. Ji will have a room to himself,
not in the same area as us.

610
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,839
Alright, let's all go back and unpack.

611
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:07,960
See you at the pool later.

612
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,160
- Alright.
- Alright.

613
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,240
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

614
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:44,640
The view looks pretty good.

615
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,799
The air is very fresh.

616
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:49,640
- Alright.
- Ms. Rao.

617
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,319
- You swim well.
- Come down for a couple of laps.

618
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:55,359
Just swim, cut down on the talk.

619
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:57,480
Have a pleasant vacation.

620
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,920
I just remembered something.

621
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,960
What are you talking about?

622
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,559
He said, my colleague called me
the other day and asked me,

623
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,519
is depression common in your line of work?

624
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,719
Later, I thought about it.

625
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,760
I don't know about other
departments in our bank,

626
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,679
but when we account managers get busy,

627
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,880
who has time to be sick?

628
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,079
Yes, and nowadays the debtors
are the ones acting like bosses.

629
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:24,320
A few days ago, I made dozens of nice calls,

630
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,280
but the boss was in a bad mood and told me,

631
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,559
'Isn't it just a few interests
that I owe you? Why the hurry?'

632
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,079
Exactly, and after hanging up,
they still don't pay.

633
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,079
Right, they wait until the People's Bank
shuts down the system,

634
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,239
and then transfer the interest
in amounts of 50,000 out of the whole million.

635
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,599
It is really troublesome and demanding.

636
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,639
A few people are quite serious,
still talking about work when out.

637
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,280
And when they need money,

638
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,079
they call you desperately,
not letting you sleep,

639
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,599
and watch you 24 hours
demanding you to make the loan.

640
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,280
This reminded me.

641
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,599
There was this one time, a female accountant,

642
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:55,159
she pulled up a chair and sat behind me
like a surveillance monitor.

643
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,559
She was staring at me like that.

644
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:57,840
I really couldn't hold back later on,

645
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,119
and I wanted to use the bathroom.
You know what she said?

646
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,400
Our loan hasn't been approved yet.
Why are you running around for nothing?

647
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,519
Right. It's so annoying.

648
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,656
This job is impossible.

649
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,568
I'm going to swim a couple more laps.

650
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,800
Okay.

651
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,832
Let's go.

652
00:35:12,832 --> 00:35:14,599
Let's go.

653
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,199
- I'll take off my shoes…
- Try the water.

654
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,880
How is it?

655
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,119
Mr. Zhao, when did you get the cupping done?

656
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,760
Feeling a bit weak lately?

657
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,920
This little yellow duck is quite cute.

658
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,119
Yes, it is.

659
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,519
Luckily, I avoided the menstrual period,

660
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:39,719
otherwise, this trip wouldn't
have been enjoyable.

661
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:43,199
Indeed, it's most troublesome to go out
during the menstrual period.

662
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,360
What did you just say?

663
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:52,800
I said I was quite lucky to have
avoided the menstrual period.

664
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,519
Jing, look at the ducks.

665
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,504
Rao Jing.

666
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,988
[Happy Birthday]

667
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:03,599
[Distinguished Middle-aged Representative]
[HAPPY BIRTHDAY]

668
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,320
Family and friends,

669
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,079
today, we gather here,

670
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,199
not just for our team building
and eat this roasted lamb,

671
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,039
but also for something even more important.

672
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:18,184
We're going to celebrate someone's birthday.

673
00:37:24,256 --> 00:37:26,800
28 years ago, she was born with a cry,

674
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
and 28 years later,

675
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,679
she has become an outstanding pacesetter
in our development department.

676
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:37,360
She is Tu Xiaoning.

677
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,368
Thank you.

678
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,599
Come on, say a few words.

679
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,000
Thank you, Zhao.

680
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,000
Thank you, everyone.

681
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,519
Actually, I did think that you
would celebrate my birthday,

682
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,880
but it's almost twelve o'clock,

683
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,280
and I saw no reaction from you all.

684
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,679
I thought you had forgotten.

685
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,599
I am very happy to be colleagues with you all.

686
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,840
I want to thank everyone one by one.

687
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,679
Ever since I came to Division One,

688
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,639
I have received so much help from everyone.

689
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,519
When I was most discouraged,

690
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,639
it was Jing who always encouraged me.

691
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,280
When my performance wasn't good,

692
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,639
it was Zhao who taught me hands-on.

693
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,039
And there're Sr. Yao, Jr. Yao,

694
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,239
Xu Li, and Li Xiang.

695
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,679
Whenever I encounter any trouble,

696
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,719
you always come to help me right away.

697
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,039
I am especially grateful to you all.

698
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:33,079
And also to my old colleague, Tang.

699
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,159
Her arrival

700
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,960
has made me realize that I need
to strive even harder for progress.

701
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,519
I would also like to thank Mr. Ji

702
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,679
for his constant encouragement
and immense trust in me.

703
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,239
He helped me to grow
from a sales newbie who knew nothing
