32
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,719
I used this kind of eraser
back in high school too.

33
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,439
Ji Yuheng also likes this kind of eraser?

34
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,520
So cute.

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,879
Maybe it's his desirable girl's.

36
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,639
Are you feeling sore?

37
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,712
A little bit.

38
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,328
I'll give you a massage.

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,360
It hurts.

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,520
It means the massage is working.

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,560
Really?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,159
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?

43
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,256
Haven't decided yet.

44
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,039
If you have no plans,

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,520
can you do me a favor?

46
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,240
Go ahead.

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,599
I need to see a client tomorrow.

48
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,919
Can you come with me?

49
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,159
You give me confidence
so that I can close the deal.

50
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,319
That's inappropriate.

51
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,080
Why? You are my husband.

52
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,680
Please, Mr. Ji.

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,159
Do me a favor.

54
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,599
Okay.

55
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,656
Deal.

56
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,560
Look at this first.

[Loan Program]

60
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,560
I am prudent

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,280
at work.

62
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,319
We used to have hard times.

63
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,680
So we feel that money is not easily earned.

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,840
Yes, we want to grow the company.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,439
Many banks have approached us for investment.

66
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,319
But I've rejected them.

67
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,968
I always feel that money borrowed

68
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:10,039
from a bank is not mine.

69
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,719
It has to be repaid with interest.
It's not worth it.

70
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,879
So I don't think it's safe to take the loan.

71
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,000
I agree

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,040
with him.

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,920
Tu contacted me before.

74
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,079
I met her today
because she and I are from the same hometown.

75
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,439
Your marketing work isn't easy.

76
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,720
It's no big deal for me to chat with you.

77
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,360
However, we really haven't considered the loan.

78
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,439
I understand.

79
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,639
Of course, I won't pressure you two
into taking a loan.

80
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,079
It's a great honor to meet you both today.

81
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,399
If you have any banking needs,

82
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,040
feel free to contact me anytime.

83
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,759
Okay.

84
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,120
Does your bank currently
have any good wealth management products?

85
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,424
We might consider it.

86
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,480
Of course.

87
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,368
Moreover, based on your investment funds

88
00:04:58,368 --> 00:05:00,759
and the assessment of the business operations,

89
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,600
we can customize a financial product for you.

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,704
Customization?

91
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,040
Sounds good.

92
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,000
So, how exactly do we need to proceed?

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,519
What materials do we need to prepare?

94
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,456
After the trade fair is over,

95
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:16,480
let's discuss it again.

96
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
This will be handled

97
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,399
by the department responsible
for wealth management.

98
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,879
But no worries.

99
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,040
Tu is familiar with wealth management services.

100
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
She will cooperate throughout the process.

101
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,839
Will it be counted as Xiao Tu's performance?

102
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,120
That's alright. It's my job.

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,079
Mr. Liu, when I just came up,

104
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,240
I saw the large venue.

105
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
I thought
the exhibitors were marketing themselves.

106
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,319
You just mentioned it was a trade fair.

107
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,160
Do you have your own brand?

108
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,600
Yes. Here is the thing.

109
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm a supplier.
They're agents at different levels.

110
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,519
They have to purchase goods from me.

111
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,160
May I know

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,639
how long this event will last?

113
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,560
What is the daily turnover approximately?

114
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
The trade fair is held
in the form of an industry summit.

115
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,399
It involves large orders.

116
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,639
It can make 30 to 40 million in a day, I guess.

117
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,120
That's a conservative estimate.

118
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,519
How do you handle the payment?

119
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,680
By cash, credit card, and Alipay.

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,759
It's all okay.

121
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,519
- I have an idea.
- Go ahead.

122
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,720
Are you interested

123
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,199
in cooperating with the bank
on promotional activities?

124
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,639
You associate the promotional discounts
with the bank account.

125
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,759
As long as you pay

126
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,519
by our bank's credit card or debit card,

127
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,360
a certain amount reached
will qualify for some discount.

128
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,312
What are the benefits for us?

129
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:50,920
Exactly.

130
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,879
Let me put it this way.

131
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,040
All the payments in this trade fair

132
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,920
will go into the enterprise settlement account

133
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,759
you opened in Dairui.

134
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,759
If the deposit
meets the five million threshold,

135
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,519
I can offer you an interest rate

136
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,000
that exceeds the one
in a current deposit account.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,120
For every increase of five million,
the interest rate can be raised further.

138
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,879
Think about it. If you put the money

139
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,839
in another bank, you'll just get the interest
of a demand deposit.

140
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,519
But if you save the money in Dairui,

141
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,759
you'll have a substantial incremental interest.

142
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,240
What do you two think?

143
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
Sounds good. We could give it a try.

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,199
Bro, what do you think?

145
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,720
I think it's safe.

146
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,000
Well,

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,560
could you go over your loan proposal?

148
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,199
Maybe I'll find it reliable too.

149
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,240
No problem.

150
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,048
I'm surprised.

151
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:45,839
You've made a lot of progress so quickly.

152
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,120
I thought when they refused the loan,

153
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,319
you would be disheartened.

154
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,879
You taught me well.

155
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,639
Marketing and negotiation shouldn't be rushed.

156
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,519
In conversations with customers,

157
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,399
I should gather useful information
and take my time.

158
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,319
But honestly,

159
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,079
your payment proposal was good.

160
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,759
It's a large order.

161
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,079
Once a cooperative relationship
with our bank is established,

162
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:14,560
it could bring
a large average daily settlement volume.

163
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,920
Also, the discount proposal is good.

164
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,759
This way, it can
increase the card issuance volume.

165
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,319
And it serves as an advertisement for Dairui.

166
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,360
That's a smart idea.

167
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,759
Perhap one day,

168
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,439
I'll work under your orders.

169
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,639
That's because you had the final say.

170
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,000
The five million quota
and incremental interest.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,080
I can't make decisions on that.

172
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,039
Anyway, thank you.

173
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,184
For what?

174
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,639
For understanding me so well.

175
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:53,440
Actually, I know you are capable

176
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,080
and confident in securing this deal

177
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,320
You keep making excuses for me to get involved

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,240
I know you want me to move on

179
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,312
and return to a normal life.

180
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,879
Honestly, I have rested enough.

181
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:14,039
I believe my mom also hopes

182
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,320
that I can live and work well

183
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,159
So it's time to move on.

184
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,240
You worked so late yesterday.

185
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,279
Do you want to take a break?

186
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,559
Honestly, last night,

187
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,840
I was on edge.

188
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,840
But now, I feel much more relieved.

189
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,519
It's more than half an hour away. Take a nap.

190
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,240
Okay.

191
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,720
What a coincidence, Mr. Zhao. You're…

192
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:39,360
Tu.

193
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,248
Zhao.

194
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:44,520
Mr. Ji is back. Why is his bag with you?

195
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:48,440
I ran into him in the elevator.
He went up to see the Bank President.

196
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,159
So he gave me his bag.

197
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,720
When I came back with him,

198
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,360
he went to the Bank President's office.

199
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,840
I wanted to help him with his bag.

200
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,600
But he refused me. It was awkward.

201
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,840
Unexpectedly, he's closer to you.

202
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,039
I just did him a little favor.

203
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,399
Maybe he's in a good mood today.

204
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,279
That's normal, isn't it?

205
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,720
Maybe Mr. Ji has something else to do.

206
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,440
That's not right, haven't you all noticed

207
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,856
that Mr. Ji has a cleanliness fetish
for personal belongings?

208
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:26,944
He never

209
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:30,279
lets anyone clean his office.

210
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:33,519
Have you completed your performance targets
for this month?

211
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,639
Do you have so much time?

212
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,080
What's the point

213
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,519
of talking about Mr. Ji's bag?

214
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,720
And you, as a leader,

215
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,759
don't gossip at work.

216
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,840
Yeah, someone has nothing to do.

217
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
So she did something annoying

218
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,440
without thinking.

219
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,679
Tu, you came out just in time.

220
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,120
I need to talk to you about a client.

221
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,208
Come with me.

222
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,928
Okay.

223
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,759
Did the client visit go smoothly
this afternoon?

224
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,320
They actually need a loan

225
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,519
with a better value.

226
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,360
I secured the deal about the promotional event.

227
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,639
When I handle the settlement card,

228
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,240
I'll market credit cards.

229
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,120
If you successfully land this project,

230
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,840
you'll have passed the second hurdle
of becoming a regular employee.

231
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,024
Congratulations.

232
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,240
Not now. Don't congratulate me in advance.

233
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,639
Let's wait until the procedures are completed.

234
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,159
Thinking about Mr. Yang's matter
still gives me the jitters.

235
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,312
Xiaoning.

236
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:45,824
Your current work state is quite good.

237
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:47,440
How so?

238
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,679
A woman should never give up her career
for love

239
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,840
or a man.

240
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,159
No matter what happens,

241
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,639
you can protect yourself

242
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,879
and live well alone.

243
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,519
Jing, Mr. Ji and I--

244
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,840
You don't have to tell me about him.

245
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,279
I'm not interested.

246
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,720
I just want to remind you

247
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,919
that since you're with him,

248
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,279
you should be mentally prepared to leave

249
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,360
when your relationship is exposed.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,120
Don't worry. I will work hard.

251
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,519
I won't leave.

252
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,000
He and I have set key performance indicators.

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,360
Whoever doesn't complete them will leave.

254
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,416
It's a bet.

255
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,200
Ji Yuheng is quite fair.

256
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,392
May I know

257
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:37,759
who's leading
in the key performance indicators?

258
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,720
After becoming a regular employee,

259
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,039
my key performance indicators
will be half completed.

260
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,840
I'm not clear about his work.

261
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,240
He's very cunning, keeping it from me.

262
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,440
I wish you success in advance.

263
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,840
Alright.

264
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,840
No, you must succeed.

265
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,279
You are my student.

266
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,559
Though your opponent is the head
of Division One,

267
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,672
you'll beat him.

268
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,519
Come on.

269
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,544
Cheer up.

270
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,120
Sir.

271
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,600
Yuheng, sit.

272
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,240
I thought
you would take a few more days of rest.

273
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,840
I'm good now.

274
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,080
It's time to get back to work.

275
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,879
So, what are your plans next?

276
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,960
After all, you promised to work here

277
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,759
for your mom.

278
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,399
Sir, don't worry.

279
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,440
Previously, you told me
to revitalize Division One.

280
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,320
I will fulfill my promise.

281
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,519
Additionally, I hope

282
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,519
that my team will have the opportunity
to advance further.

283
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,519
Tell me in detail.

284
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,720
The government has a deposit project.

285
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,879
If I can successfully secure it,

286
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,840
I might fulfill the promise

287
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,856
I made to you.

288
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,519
You're a far-sighted man.

289
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,559
Are you doing something else?

290
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,039
You know me well.

291
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:13,559
I hear of an opportunity at the bank.

292
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,840
So I want to try to seize it.

293
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:20,360
[Dairui Bank]

294
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,960
You're reviewed tender documents.

295
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,759
Let me summarize it.

296
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,320
This is a government deposit project.

297
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,840
A dozen banks will participate in the bid.

298
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,440
Ultimately, two banks will be selected
based on the interest rate.

299
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,039
The state-owned banks
have targeted deposit products.

300
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,279
Our products are single and not competitive.

301
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,120
I don't see it that way.

302
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,639
Dairui had bid on large amounts

303
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,639
with considerable experience.

304
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,639
If I remember correctly,

305
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,840
Ms. Rao took charge of it before, right?

306
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,519
Yes, so?

307
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,320
Mr. Ji, could you assign this task to me?

308
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,919
I'm confident I can do it.

309
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:01,759
This is a government-oriented task.

310
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,399
It's better to leave it
to Ms. Rao and Mr. Zhao.

311
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,600
They have more experience.

312
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,960
The rest will work together
and allocate performance reasonably.

313
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,639
No problem with that.

314
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,200
Okay, let's all work hard together.

315
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,879
Ms. Rao, you are good at the bidding process

316
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,279
You take charge of the tender.

317
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,279
Sure.

318
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,240
You will take care of the other auxiliary work.

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,840
No problem.

320
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,120
Can I help Jing write the bid?

321
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,039
I'd like to learn.

322
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,360
Of course.

323
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,000
I can take care of the data.

324
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,519
I'm good at crunching numbers.
It's my strong suit

325
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,519
Okay, Tang and Xu Li

326
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,200
do the data-related tasks.

327
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,639
I can't just be a cheerleader, right?

328
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,440
I'll take Jr. Yao and senior Yao

329
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,200
to handle the bidding materials

330
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,279
No problem.

331
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,080
Mr. Ji, rest assured, we'll secure the deal.

332
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,159
Let's all work together.

333
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,159
- Come on.
- Come on.

334
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,440
We're right outside.

335
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,200
The result hasn't come out yet.

336
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,160
You have no inside information at all?

337
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,279
Mr. Ji, don't be upset.

338
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:52,440
What do you mean?

339
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,472
100 million?

340
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:57,920
800 million?

341
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,680
- It's done?
- It's done?

342
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,519
800 million in deposits?

343
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,656
This is hard.

344
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,119
It's not easy at all.

345
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,368
You're the soul of Division One.

346
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:11,839
You did it.

347
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,359
I'm just enjoying the fruits.

348
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,279
The credit belongs to all of you.

349
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,208
Zhao, hit me.

350
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,576
Alright.

351
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:22,319
Mr. Ji, Zhao.

352
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,319
[Dear Tu Xiaoning]
We've been working like dogs recently.

353
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,839
[Congratulations on entering the interview stage]
I didn't see this coming.

354
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,480
800 million is too much.

355
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,000
Yeah, an increase of 800 million.

356
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,240
Let alone this quarter,

357
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,839
this year's performance will be done.

358
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,640
Tu, with impressive performance,

359
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,599
you'll be a permanent employee soon.

360
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,839
That's right.

361
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,839
If the deposits aren't enough,

362
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:44,736
I'll deposit my billions as your performance.

363
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:45,759
Remember to return my favor.

364
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,079
Tu doesn't need your help.

365
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,640
She can become permanent on her own, right?

446
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,359
Maybe it's not a prediction.

447
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:42,200
It's because Mr. Ji trusts us and Jing.

will give me new shoes.

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,279
Do you want to have dinner with me?

547
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,319
No plans. I have to work overtime

548
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,880
to make more money.

549
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,039
Zhao, are you talking
about the bicycle project?

550
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,720
I've heard of it from Jing.

551
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,200
Do you need any help?

552
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,400
No need, Tu. Thank you.

553
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,016
No need to bother the Chief Account Manager
with such trivial matters.

554
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:43,744
I have to go.

555
00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:44,832
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

556
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:47,784
- Bye, Zhao.
- Bye.

557
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,920
Let's go.

558
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,240
They have parents, a home, friends, and lovers.

559
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,680
They are so lucky.

560
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,759
Miss, are you okay? You seem down.

561
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:34,039
I got promoted.

562
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,400
Congratulations.

563
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,544
Thank you.

564
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,079
But apart from you,

565
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,240
I don't know who else I could share it with.

566
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,640
I used to see you coming here with the men.

567
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,359
What's going on? You're always alone.

568
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:55,319
Is that so? I just realized it.

569
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,519
I'm fine. Go ahead with your work.

570
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,584
Okay.

571
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,559
Let me pick one.

572
00:30:21,476 --> 00:30:26,280
[Pour Vintage Wine Yourself]
[Singing to the Wine]

573
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,039
It's boring.

574
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,456
Happy promotion.

575
00:30:48,356 --> 00:30:50,680
[Tu Xiaoning, Account Manager
of Development Department Division One]

576
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,839
I'm proud of my daughter.

577
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,888
She finally did it.

578
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:56,000
She became an Account Manager.

579
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,160
It's just a permanent position. Be cool.

580
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,000
Such an important photo.

581
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,799
But it looks so bad.

582
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,272
Ji, can this photo be retaken?

583
00:31:10,272 --> 00:31:11,519
It looks quite nice.

584
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,519
Stop it. Even if she's ugly, she's your child.

585
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,839
My daughter is beautiful.
She had no makeup in this photo.

586
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,880
Your daughter is ugly.

587
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,039
Come on.

588
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,079
I'm finally staffed.

589
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:25,519
You don't compliment me
and even say my photo looks bad.

590
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,559
Ugly? Let me see.

591
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:29,359
Looks bad?

592
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,720
Look great.

593
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,960
You always look nice with or without makeup.

594
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,920
Listen to him. He's emotionally intelligent.

595
00:31:41,504 --> 00:31:43,160
Dad taught me well.

596
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,920
My wife is the most beautiful woman
in the world.

597
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,599
My daughter is beautiful too.

598
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,079
That's more like it.

599
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,079
Enough. As long as I get promoted
and receive a raise,

600
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,079
I'll treat you with a big meal.

601
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,319
Okay, remember to take a nicer picture
for your next promotion.

602
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,519
Xiaoning, I wish you success.

603
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,359
Aim to become Bank President within ten years.

604
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,320
Bank President?

605
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,792
President Tu.

606
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:11,839
President Ji.

607
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,920
You're a regular worker.

608
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,319
What are your plans next?

609
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:24,920
I plan to walk home with Mr. Ji.

610
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,000
I ate too much just now.

611
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,000
I was asking about your work plans.

612
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,680
Why? Are you trying to probe

613
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,720
about my key performance indicators?

614
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,200
No comment.

615
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,160
Speaking of which,

616
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm clear about what you've done at work.

617
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,519
Do I need to inquire?

618
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,528
That's true.

619
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,799
My short-term goal is

620
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:49,400
to attend the new product launch
of decorative glass tomorrow

621
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,000
for marketing.

622
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,664
The mid-term goal is

623
00:32:53,664 --> 00:32:55,759
to attract 50 million in deposits

624
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:58,519
on key performance indicators.

625
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,480
If the 800 million in government deposits

626
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,519
is credited to your performance,

627
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,559
you will reach the goal, right?

628
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,279
I don't want it. I have my principles.

629
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,519
I want to attract deposits on my own.

630
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,559
Otherwise, even if I win, it's unfair.

631
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,039
Impressive. What about the long-term goal?

632
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:22,599
The long-term goal is
to work harder in Division One.

633
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,839
You already know about my progress.

634
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,359
You should share yours with me too.

635
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,279
My progress? I'm not clear.

636
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,799
Come on.

637
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,599
You know mine well.

638
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,079
But I know nothing about yours.

639
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,519
That's unfair.

640
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,920
Anyway, we do different jobs.

641
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,200
I'm your leader.

642
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,519
Alright, a new question

643
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,359
I'm staffed, a good worker of yours.

644
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,359
So, may I ask

645
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,839
about your work goals for the next phase?

646
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,936
Can you tell me?

647
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,160
Speaking of opportunities, there is one now.

648
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,200
Do you know Weiji?

649
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,280
Yeah.

650
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,559
It's the company that ranks first
in national leisure tourism.

651
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:15,199
Their resorts are flourishing
in first-tier cities.

652
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,519
This year, they plan to expand
into the second-tier cities.

653
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,199
I have insider news.

654
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,519
They just got a piece of land
in the north of the city

655
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,760
to develop business in Star City.

656
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,320
They just got a plot of land,

657
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,079
so their funds will be tight.

658
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,840
If they undertake a resort project,

659
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,280
there's a high chance they will seek financing.

660
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,519
You've long had this idea, haven't you?

661
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,079
Exactly, just think about it.

662
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,159
Since they're going
to develop business in Star City,

663
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,696
the local banks will have the opportunity
to cooperate with them.

664
00:34:45,696 --> 00:34:46,840
Yes.

665
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,039
I've discussed this with Xing
from Division Two.

666
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,239
He's interested.

667
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,880
If you're interested too, that would be better.

668
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,400
So you two can take care of it together,

669
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,840
increasing the chances of winning.

670
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,519
And it will greatly benefit your next goal.

671
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:04,719
With your support, I'll go all out for it.

672
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,519
Speaking of the next stage,

673
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:12,239
I have something to say to you.

674
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,480
What I may be facing

675
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,239
is a rare opportunity in my career.

676
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,760
I want to vie for it.

677
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,639
What opportunity?

678
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:22,920
Competing for the position of Bank President.

679
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,519
What? Is the Bank President stepping down?

680
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:27,280
Or are you planning a coup?

681
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,000
Of course not.

682
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,519
Actually, the head office wants

683
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,920
to set up a new branch in Star City.

684
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,320
The position of the Bank President is vacant.

685
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,679
Are you competing for it?

686
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,760
Yes, in the banking sector in Star City,

687
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,920
positions like this

688
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,920
may only become available
once every four to five years.

689
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,800
If I can secure the position,

690
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,400
I'll take a big step up the career ladder.

691
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,519
Otherwise, I have to work
as a department manager

692
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,039
for another four or five years

693
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,400
before the next chance.

694
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,039
Your position is not like ours.

695
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,719
It's too difficult for you to get a promotion.

696
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:07,079
You have to wait for someone
to vacate a position.

697
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,199
Only then can you move up.

698
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,199
It's such a good opportunity.

699
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:13,639
Many people are eyeing it eagerly.

700
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,400
What's your plan?

701
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,639
Weiji Group is planning
to develop a resort in Star City.

702
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,199
Financing will be needed by then.

703
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:24,519
However, the amount needed is huge.
It's extremely difficult.

704
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,760
Whoever secures this project

705
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,239
will certainly gain attention
from the head office

706
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,360
and have more initiative.

707
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,519
I learned about Weiji Group.

708
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:37,800
Its president is Xia Mingrui.

709
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,360
However, I've heard he is a picky person.

710
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,159
Securing his approval is not easy.

711
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,639
However, I believe you can win him over.

712
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,599
You can achieve anything.

713
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,280
As long as you want to do it,
I will support you.

714
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,320
Should I address you differently in the future?

715
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,424
President Ji?

716
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,119
I haven't finished yet.

717
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,519
Here's one more thing.

718
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,800
If I win the competition,

719
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,679
I can leave Division One,

720
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:09,719
and the two of us can be together openly.

721
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,960
No need to be on tenterhooks.

722
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,519
That's great.

723
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,800
I have even more reason to support you.

724
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,119
But I hope you don't feel too much pressure.

725
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:24,000
Don't worry. I will grow quickly
and become capable on my own.

726
