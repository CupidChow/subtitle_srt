[Episode 26]

32
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,680
Even if I am tolerant,
I shouldn't accept a woman

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,000
singing love songs
to my other half in front of me.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,359
And it's my birthday. It's too much.

35
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,879
Love that cannot be made public
is really difficult.

36
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,519
You know well how much I like you,

37
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,680
do you have to reject me from afar?

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,760
And you know very well in your heart,

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,959
without the support of the giant corporations

40
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,840
and the public companies in my grasp,

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,479
it would be difficult for you to confidently
become the branch president.

42
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,680
Effort and capability alone aren't sufficient

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
for success in this society.

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,439
You have the capability,
and I have the resources.

45
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,199
As long as you are with me,

46
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,039
you can have much more of what you want.

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,759
I'll get what I want by myself.

48
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,439
I don't need charity from others.

49
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,599
That's rich.

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,039
I can bring these people
to boost you to a high position.

51
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,800
I can also take these people away

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,680
and make you fall to the bottom.

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,752
That's what I can do.

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,599
I have no right to interfere with your choices,

55
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,919
but I have to say something.

56
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,159
Don't think too highly of yourself.

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,919
Tang, you know, your resources

58
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,759
indeed give you an advantage,

59
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,280
but I, Ji Yuheng, have come this far today,

60
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,879
not because of you, or anyone else.

61
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,599
I'm not interested in your resources.

62
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,560
To go or to stay, I won't interfere.

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,680
Previously, as your boss,

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,560
if you didn't reveal it,

65
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,560
I merely reminded you
to abandon that intention.

66
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,319
But now you're so brazen,

67
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,528
and all I can do is tell you

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,240
I have no place for you here.

69
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,159
I will certainly obtain what I want,

70
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,288
including you.

71
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,280
If the two of us were together,

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,879
I would be willing to leave Dairui for you.

73
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,560
We are not suitable, nor is it possible.

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,919
Is it because of Tu Xiaoning?

75
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,120
In terms of education,
family background, and appearance,

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,800
in what way can she possibly compare to me?

77
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,199
And after such a long time,

78
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,400
I don't believe you have
no feelings for me at all.

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Clearly, I was the first person
to catch your eye.

80
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,959
At the entrance of Building One,
during our university times,

81
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,040
when we first met,

82
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,199
I can tell from your eyes.

83
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,319
Ever since then, you have been in my heart.

84
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,680
I know, you're different from other guys.

85
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,480
You don't play games or skip classes.

86
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,600
You are serious and restrained
in everything you do.

87
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,879
You are the one I want.

88
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,199
And so many years have passed,

89
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,680
we still have the chance to meet.

90
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,160
You're not married, and I'm still single.

91
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,240
Shouldn't we be together?

92
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,464
Are you done, Junior sister?

93
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,439
Actually, apart from the fact

94
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,759
that we graduated from the same university,

95
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,439
I have no other thoughts about you.

96
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,232
Take care.

97
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,279
Is it because of Tu Xiaoning?

98
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,600
Just because she appeared,

99
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,399
you're going to deny everything from the past?

100
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,399
I just don't get it.

101
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,319
In what ways is she better than me?

102
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,959
Just because she knows how to make
a move when someone's vulnerable?

103
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,839
Because she can ingratiate herself,
because she caters to what you like, right?

104
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,000
Tu Xiaoning, you've grown another year older.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
Can you please not do things
in such a shady way?

106
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
I despise you for skulking around like this.

107
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,879
I didn't mean to eavesdrop
on your conversation.

108
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,635
I was just passing by.

109
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:23,336

But today, I want to make one thing clear.

120
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,199
In my relationship with Tu Xiaoning,

121
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,600
the person who took advantage
and catered to desires

122
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,800
was never her. It was me.

123
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,056

After all, it's your first birthday
since we've been together.

131
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,800
We should still have a sense of ceremony.

132
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,639
You just said

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,879
you fell in love with me at first sight.

134
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,439
I thought the two of us

135
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,680
dated and married because we were suitable.

136
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,840
I didn't expect…

137
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,600
Long time no see, Tu Xiaoning.

138
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,960
Is it true?

139
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,720
Why would that be?

140
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,240
Why would it not be?

141
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,240
I am a normal man with emotions and desires.

142
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,559
Of course, I can fall in love at first sight.

143
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:09,799
Besides, as you know,

144
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,679
I have always been very meticulous.

145
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,559
Marriage is important,
and I will take it seriously.

146
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,399
I wanted to marry you because I like you.

147
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,000
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

148
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,952
I…

149
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,328
I was afraid

150
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,600
that you didn't feel the same way.

151
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,696
The candle is about to burn out.
Make a wish quickly.

152
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:06,840
I hope that for every birthday in the future,

153

181

Did you already know

200
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,720
about Ji Yuheng and Tu Xiaoning?

201
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,200
The first time the two of us met

202
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,720
was actually in front of the school's
teaching building.

203
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,000
I remember the weather
was especially nice that day.

204
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,759
I had finished school

205
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,279
and was about to watch
a romantic play with classmates

206
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,600
when he suddenly appeared behind me.

207
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,919
At that moment, I felt as if time had stopped.

208
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:14,039
It was as if there were only him

209
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,052
and me in the whole world.

210
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:18,460
Speaking of which,

211
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,120
it seemed like it was
love at first sight with him.

212
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,960
But he suddenly told me
he mistook me for someone else.

213
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,000
And then he left.

214
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,000
But since that time,

215
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,279
I started to notice him.

216
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,039
And I came to realize
just how outstanding he was.

217
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,320
I remember one New Year's Day,

218
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,080
our dorm organized a social event.

219
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,919
Everyone went,

220
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,759
but he stayed behind
in the dorm to write a paper.

221
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,840
Can you believe it?

222
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,320
And not long after,

223
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,519
he became the first undergraduate

224
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,840
in the whole grade

225
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,200
to publish in a core journal.

226
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,600
And then I just thought
this guy was really outstanding.

227
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,000
So I liked him even more.

228
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,960
Once, in PE class,

229
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,519
I mustered up the courage…

230
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,488
Senior,

231
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,519
what kind of girl do you like?

232
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,504
High ponytail, bright laughter.

233
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,720
Then I thought, at that time in our department,

234
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,120
the girl who loved to wear
high ponytails was me.

235
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,039
So naturally, I thought that person must be me.

236
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:56,919
I thought maybe he was
just too shy to express it.

237
00:15:57,843 --> 00:15:59,168
And then…

238
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:02,519
he suddenly went abroad and I started working.

239
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,639
We did not see each other for a long time

240
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,879
until we met again in Dairui.

241
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:21,039
Sometimes, I start to wonder,

242
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,080
he's been single for so long,

243
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,720
even a tiny bit, does it have
anything to do with me?

244
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,519
Even if not,

245
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,480
do I have a chance in terms of romance?

246
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,600
It's quite ridiculous, you know.

247
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,679
Actually, I trapped myself.

248
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,559
I trapped myself in our student days,

249
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,519
in that fleeting moment of awe for him.

250
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,960
This is not love.

251
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,544

00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,680
Work hard, if luck is on our side,
there's a lot of hope.

358
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,440
How can you still have time
and the mindset to work?

359
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,079
- What are you doing, I'm…
- Don't move.

360
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,519
I'm revising the contract.

361
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,939
Look.

362
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:55,519
[Dairui's Cute Guy Ji Yuheng,
who took his heart?]

363
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,519
Dairui's Cute Guy Ji Yuheng,
who took his heart?

364
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,799
Tu, come here.

365
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,799
When going to work in the morning…

366
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,240
- Look at this.
- Look at this.

367
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,835
This is exciting.

368
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:09,472
[This morning, he and his girlfriend were in the car,
and they stopped at the intersection, hugging]

369
00:27:09,472 --> 00:27:10,519
Who is it?

370
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,519
Leader's girlfriend.

371
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,680
What are you talking about? Tu is asking
who the leader's girlfriend is.

372
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,799
How would I know?

373
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:21,240
You…… But judging by this description,

374
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,680
they were really hugging so sweetly.

375
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,200
[The girl was wearing a trench coat, very elegant]
Wearing a trench coat?

376
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,720
Elegant, of course.

377
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,880
Our leader has good taste.

378
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,240
Of course.

379
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,359
You can't always believe
what's on the internet.

380
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,640
Look how clearly it's stated.

381
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,839
It's not some celebrity or influencer.

382
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,440
Alright, alright, stop gossiping.

383
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,559
Hurry up and do what you need to do.

384
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,039
Ms. Rao, I was just…

385
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,400
Are you in a rush
to be reincarnated or something?

386
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,079
Look at this contract.

387
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,799
A post appeared on the internet

388
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,000
saying a mysterious woman…

389
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,079
Did you see the post on the internet?

390
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,640
Someone saw us hugging.

391
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:05,632
Don't worry.

392
00:28:05,632 --> 00:28:08,768
The person who posted only saw you
from a distance wearing a trench coat.

393
00:28:08,768 --> 00:28:12,319
They didn't get a clear view of your face,
nor a chance to take a photo

394
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,152
Well, that's a relief.

395
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,640
Where has Tang gone?

396
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,759
Why hasn't she shown up yet?

397
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,920
Zhao, come here for a second.

398
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:33,079
Okay, I'll go and get a feel
for the situation for you.

399
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:43,839
Do you think this mysterious
woman could be Tang?

400
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,519
Great temperament, wearing a trench coat.

401
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,680
Does Tang wear a trench coat?

402
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,319
And Zhao straightened it out for me yesterday.

403
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,224
I will go back to work.

404
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,200
Okay, stop gossiping.

405
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,119
The leader said that it was his fiancée.

406
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,039
Fiancée?

407
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,519
The leader has a fiancée?

408
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,079
Mr. Ji has a fiancée!

409
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,960
- What?
- When did this happen?

410
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,680
How come I haven't heard about it?

411
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,000
Oh my gosh.

412
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You guys work with Mr. Ji every day.

413
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,640
And suddenly, there's such
a high-profile girlfriend

414
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,800
without any whisper.

415
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,640
Our leader does a good job at keeping secrets.

416
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,119
He doesn't answer calls
or send messages usually.

417
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,400
Logically, if she accompanies her boyfriend

418
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,519
to work early in the morning,

419
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,400
they should be quite clingy.

420
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,160
What boyfriend? They're fiancés.

421
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Oh, right.

422
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,559
Accompanying her fiancé to work.

423
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,079
Who knows, maybe she works in this building.

424
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,920
The one on the twelfth floor
who does food marketing.

425
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,519
Or maybe the dentist
from that new dental clinic?

426
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,319
I don't think it's any of them.
The enemy is within.

427
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,799
That Tang Yuhui who just left.

428
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,640
I've heard about the two of them long ago.

429
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,440
They were seniors and juniors in college.

430
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,559
Maybe they started dating long ago.

431
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,119
Don't go spreading rumors.

432
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:11,720
Our boss and Tang are absolutely innocent.

433
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,960
Don't spread nonsense.

434
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,640
That's not necessarily true.

435
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,960
If there's nothing going on,
why would Tang just leave?

436
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:21,720
Don't spread rumors.

437
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,880
- Tu.
- Tu, second floor.

438
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,968
Not there yet.

439
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,519
Have a glass of milk.

440
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,799
Why did you tell Zhao that you were engaged?

441
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,119
Now they're all discussing this matter.

442
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,119
Instead of letting them all gossip,

443
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,559
it's better we just come out and admit it.

444
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,680
That way there will be less
such talk in the future.

445
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,559
But everyone is full of curiosity now.

446
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,880
What if we get busted?

447
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,960
Alright, don't worry,

448
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,319
Banks don't thrive on gossiping.

449
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,440
There's not enough time
to focus on performance.

450
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,759
Who has the time to watch me 24/7?

451
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:02,000
It will be okay once the heat dies down.

452
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,160
I'm also to blame today.

453
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,519
What do we do in the future?

454
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:09,920
I shouldn't have given in
to my emotions and hugged you.

455
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,839
I should have held back.

456
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,920
I can't tie hairbands anymore.

457
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
I can't wear trench coats either.

458
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,000
Most importantly, that trench coat
was just bought today.

459
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,799
Isn't this just perfect?
Take this chance and buy a few more.

460
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,984
No.

461
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,640
I thought that with Tang Yuhui leaving,

462
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,359
a time bomb was defused.

463
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:31,559
Who would have thought it was a dud?

464
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,920
How's the Ji'an branch doing?

465
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,799
Is there hope to be the candidate
for the branch president?

466
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:41,519
Originally, securing Weiji
was supposed to be my winning card,

467
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,519
but unexpectedly, a few from abroad
have come back to compete for the position.

468
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,519
It is said that their qualifications
and abilities are also quite good.

469
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,920
I guess the headquarters' leadership

470
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,039
would want to consider comprehensively

471
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,759
before making the optimal choice.

472
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,559
The more it is at such times,
the more we have to be careful.

473
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,400
In our bank, office romances

474
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,200
are a matter that can't be openly acknowledged.

475
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,000
So if we are busted,

476
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,640
it will affect
the leadership's judgment of you.

477
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,799
At this time, we must not be found out by them.

478
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,319
Especially with matters like this,

479
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,519
once one person knows,

480
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,279
soon everyone will know.

481
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,759
So starting tomorrow,
I'll take the subway to work.

482
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:29,160
If there's nothing much at the office,

483
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,440
I won't come over to bother you.

484
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:35,200
Let's wait until this period is over.

485
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,960
Okay, but you don't need to be
under such a lot of psychological pressure.

486
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,519
Regardless of what bad situations may arise,

487
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,880
I have a plan to deal with them.

488
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,519
What are you going to deal with?

489
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,400
Best to not get busted.

490
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,480
Alright, I'll listen to you.

491
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,279
Why are you ignoring me?

492
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,839
Say something, please.

493
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:57,279
I don't want to talk today.
You should go back to your place.

494
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,640
I'm not leaving. Didn't we agree at the resort

495
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,504
that you would come back
and settle accounts with me?

496
00:33:01,504 --> 00:33:03,160
I'm not in the mood, forget it.

497
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,359
No, what's really happened?

498
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,319
Why are you sticking around

499
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,240
like a persistent plaster?

500
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,776
I can't be exploited my chance

501
00:33:11,776 --> 00:33:14,559
to be alone with my girlfriend for no reason.

502
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,200
I need to be close to you first.

503
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,880
Tell me what's really going on with you.

504
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,759
Why are you suddenly indifferent to me?

505
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,319
Look at how annoying you are.

506
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,759
Can't I have some peace
and quiet every now and then?

507
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,759
Okay, occasionally giving each other
some private emotional space

508
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,200
is conducive to stabilizing the relationship,
I understand.

509
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,119
But one still has to eat.

510
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:44,799
Otherwise, it's bad for the stomach.

511
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:51,560
I made your favorite stir-fried noodles
with shredded pork and egg, come on.

512
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,279
If he were to be a father,

513
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,359
he would probably be
a responsible and good father.

514
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,480
Hand it over.

515
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:28,552
Eat slowly.

516
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,920
You're smiling, you're happy.

517
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,159
Actually, today I…

518
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,079
I'm glad you're happy.
I've been suffocating here.

519
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:56,800
Who on earth is Ji's fiancee, you think?

520
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,280
Half a day has passed,
and you're still pondering over this.

521
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,360
All this mystery is making people curious.

522
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,880
But I've already figured it out.

523
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,519
Next time, at Ji's dinner,
when he drinks too much,

524
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,039
I'll take the opportunity to take him home.

525
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,400
Then I'll be able to see
who my sister-in-law is.

526
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,280
How about that, clever enough?

527
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,960
Just don't scare yourself
half to death with your cleverness.

528
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,119
That's impossible, next week.

529
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,559
Not next week, the week after next.

530
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,719
The week after next, there's an investment
event in the park, and there will be dinners.

531
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,639
Why don't you have a bite too
and keep your mouth shut for me?

532
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,840
I made this for you.

533
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,559
Why are you walking away again? Wait for me.

534
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,800
You dared to shamelessly seduce
someone else's husband,

535
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
so why don't you dare to come out?

536
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,719
Come out, let your colleagues see

537
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:44,360
what kind of creature you are.

538
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,656
Is it you? Is it you who seduced my Xing?

539
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:47,680
What's going on?

540
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,704
- Who is it?
- Division Two,

541
00:35:48,704 --> 00:35:49,960
- Is it you?
- Mrs. Xing.

542
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,832
She says someone in the unit
is messing around with Mr. Xing,

543
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:55,320
and she's come to catch
the adulterer in the act.

544
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,119
Where's Mr. Xing? Why hasn't he come out yet?

545
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,800
What if this turns into a big issue?

546
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,880
Mr. Xing must be hiding far away.

547
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,760
Who would dare to confront
this situation head-on?

548
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,000
Stupid men.

549
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,079
Is it you who seduced my Xing?

550
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,360
Is it you? Did you seduce my husband?

551
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,920
No, no.

552
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,239
Is it you guys? Then do you know who it is?

553
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,400
Who is it? No one's talking, huh?

554
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,559
Did you guys seduce my husband?

555
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,039
What's going on early in the morning?

556
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,840
It's as noisy as a vegetable market.

557
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,119
Mrs. Xing from Division Two.

558
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,119
Mrs. Xing?

559
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:37,960
I see.

560
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,519
Excuse me, it's working hours now.

561
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,000
Could you please not do this here?

562
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,519
I see.

563
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:49,119
Looking at the way you dress,
it's clear you're a vixen.

564
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,159
It must be you who seduced my Xing, right?

565
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:53,519
Are you sure I seduced your Xing?

566
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:57,119
You dressed so provocatively for work.

567
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,639
I can tell you're not decent at first glance.

568
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,440
Oh, and you're decent?

569
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Decent enough to randomly accuse someone

570
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,440
as a vixen early in the morning

571
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,800
at the entrance of our company?

572
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,119
- Who are you saying is not decent?
- What are you doing?

573
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,119
Who are you saying is not decent?

574
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,159
- Let go.
- Let her go.

575
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:13,360
I've already called the police.

576
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,159
Take your hand off. Let go of her.

577
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,840
Who are you saying is not decent?

578
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,072
Let go.

579
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,119
Someone hit me. Help!

580
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,079
I see it now.

581
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,840
The two of you
are having an affair, aren't you?

582
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,239
Did everyone see that? Did you see it?

583
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,559
This woman

584
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:34,280
sends messages to my Xing every midnight

585
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,519
talking about sentiments and love,
all those shameless words.

586
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,320
Shut up, what nonsense are you spouting?

587
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,639
Why should I shut up?

588
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,039
Isn't she dressed like that
just to seduce people?

589
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,920
She fancies other people's husbands, right?

590
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,840
The other men give you
money to spend, is that it?

591
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,880
Without a man, you can't live, can you?

592
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,360
How she wants to dress up is her own freedom.

593
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,800
It's none of your business.

594
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,880
It's not wrong for anyone
to want to show their beauty.

595
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,800
You have no right to vilify her.

596
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,360
She has been working diligently for years.

597
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,800
Her abilities are not inferior to anyone,

598
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,280
certainly not inferior to your husband.

599
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,920
There are plenty of rich
and powerful clients of hers,

600
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,360
and she has never confused
professional and personal boundaries,

601
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,519
nor has she ever had
any improper relations with anyone.

602
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,360
She would certainly not
be interested in your husband.

603
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,000
Also, she doesn't need a man to survive.

604
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,840
She has lived alone for so many years,
very independently,

605
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,360
taking good care of herself.

606
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,639
It's not your place to gossip here.

607
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:19,360
Listen clearly, from now on,

608
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,719
if you utter one more insult to her,

609
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:24,079
I will immediately record it
and call the police.

610
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,719
Do you understand? Do you get it?

611
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
You seem to know quite a lot.

612
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,320
What, are you her man?

613
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:48,679
Yes, I'm her boyfriend.

614
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,679
The branch knows about you and Rao Jing.

615
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,519
One of you two has to be transferred.

616
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:07,519
I've thought it over carefully.

617
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,519
I'm not planning to transfer.

618
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,400
If I were to be transferred to another city,

619
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,360
Rao Jing would have to stay here alone again.

620
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,280
I want to resign.

621
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,159
What are your plans with Ms. Rao in the future?

622
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,760
I'm not sure about her,

623
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,159
but I'm definitely not giving up.

624
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:40,159
It's alright. You don't need to feel troubled.

625
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,800
I'll keep an eye out for you

626
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,519
to see if there are any
suitable positions in the city.

627
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,599
Jing, so the boyfriend
you mentioned before is Zhao?

628
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,039
Zhao's partner turns out to be Jing!

629
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,760
The two of them together, it's like
Ultraman fighting little monsters.

630
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,360
All the fights are full of passion,
and all the scolding is full of love.

631
00:40:17,056 --> 00:40:18,159
Let's go.

632
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:20,392
Let's get some fresh air.

633
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,199
Having to go through
all this early in the morning

634
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,360
makes me feel so nauseous I could throw up.

635
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,079
Wait, Jing, you've been having
stomach discomfort lately.

636
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,360
Your situation with Zhao is not clear yet,

637
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,559
and let's put that aside for now.

638
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:40,239
I'll accompany you
to the hospital for a checkup.

639
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,119
It's not good if your stomach
keeps feeling uncomfortable.

640
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,840
Stop looking. It's not like I'm carrying Nezha.

641
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,639
I'm not showing just yet. Stop.

642
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,719
Indeed, you're not showing.

643
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,159
I'm just happy for you.

644
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,920
Zhao must be thrilled, right?

645
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,159
I haven't told him.

646
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,232
Why not?

647
00:41:23,508 --> 00:41:28,440
[Dairui Bank]

648
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,679
These are all my client information.

649
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,960
After I leave, all the clients
will be left to you.

650
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,159
These are all the foundations for Division One.

651
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,679
If I were to take them with me,
it would be too unfair to Ji.

652
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,080
Are you going to resign?

653
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,039
Since everything has already come out,

654
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:00,480
one of us must be transferred away.

655
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,144
After working for so many years,

656
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,760
I've also seen plenty of workplace
bias against women.

657
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,239
If we were to start over at our age,

658
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,199
other industries would make it difficult
for you with marriage and childbearing issues.

659
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:18,320
So you cannot be the one to be transferred.

660
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,199
When I was pursuing you,
I had already thought it through.

661
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:27,039
If our affair were to be exposed one day,

662
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,719
I wouldn't be a man if I break up with you

663
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:35,199
or be a coward.

664
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,199
In that case, I'd better leave you alone.

665
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,400
The bank wants to transfer me to another city,

666
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,079
but I don't want you to be alone,
so I would rather resign.

667
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,440
What's wrong?

668
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:07,920
There's something I haven't told you.

669
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,960
I am pregnant.

00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,548
♫ I hope you know ♫

706
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,888
♫ The night swallows the dusk ♫

707
00:46:38,888 --> 00:46:41,988
♫ Only shadows follow closely ♫

708
00:46:41,988 --> 00:46:47,148
♫ You're the streetlight waiting for me ♫

709
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:51,332
♫ The beam of light behind you ♫

710
00:46:51,332 --> 00:46:54,820
♫ Warms the flowing air ♫

711
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,732
♫ Time seems to pause ♫

712
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:03,044
♫ I'm privately cherishing this moment ♫

713
00:47:03,044 --> 00:47:09,924
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

714
00:47:09,924 --> 00:47:14,148
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

715
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:18,884
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

716
00:47:18,884 --> 00:47:22,020
♫ To you and no one else ♫

717
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,852
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

718
00:47:26,852 --> 00:47:29,028
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

719
00:47:29,028 --> 00:47:32,204
♫ No one knows ♫

720
00:47:33,096 --> 00:47:35,364
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

721
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:38,732
♫ I hope you know ♫

722
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:46,788
♫ You ripple through my quiet memories ♫

723
00:47:46,788 --> 00:47:52,228
♫ Feeling each other's warmth ♫

724
00:47:52,228 --> 00:47:58,980
♫ My feel is for you, just like the rain ♫

725
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,236
♫ Falling wetly and passionately ♫

726
00:48:03,236 --> 00:48:08,388
♫ Oh, baby, my heart belongs ♫

727
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:11,332
♫ To you and no one else ♫

728
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:16,004
♫ The fireworks over my heart never cease ♫

729
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:18,436
♫ Maybe it is you ♫

730
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:21,644
♫ No one knows ♫

731
00:48:22,216 --> 00:48:24,420
♫ Baby, it is you ♫

732
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,588
♫ I hope you know ♫
