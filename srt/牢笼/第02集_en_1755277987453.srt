(I remember I've been here as a kid.)

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,880
(Buddhist Hall; Sheng.)

14
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,420
(Young Sheng)

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,350
I never forced you to get married.

16
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,240
Shiyao.

17
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,770
Think about Xue Lianzhi.

18
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,840
She drugged you
and lied about her pregnancy.

19
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,280
In the end,

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,160
you were even branded as a wife killer.

21
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,370
This Qin family girl
has a spotless past.

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,310
Better consummate your marriage soon.

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,390
It'd be good
to continue our family line.

24
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,590
Grandma,

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,910
these are troubled times now.

26
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,460
How could I think about marriage now?

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,230
It's exactly because times are so tense

28
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,150
that you should
give the Dai family an heir.

29
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,720
Give me a great-grandson.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,140
I don't want the day to come

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,340
when I'm handed your ashes.

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,900
I'd be left alone as an old woman,

33
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,580
guarding this big empty house,

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,500
lonely for the rest of my life.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,020
Grandma.

36
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,420
Look how worked up you are.

37
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,780
Let's put this on hold now, alright?

38
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,300
Who's there?

39
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,820
Shiyue.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,620
I got lost.

41
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,890
I didn't hear anything.

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,900
This is Grandma's place.

43
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,820
Don't wander in here.

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,660
Go back and wait.

45
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,700
We'll marry when the day comes.

46
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
Got it.

47
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,820
Write it like this.

48
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,660
Write: Shiyao, my dear brother,

49
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,700
I hope this letter

50
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,860
finds you well.

51
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,460
Today I saw...

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,740
Today I saw...

53
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,720
fields of lotus flowers,

54
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,220
their leaves even greener than before.

55
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,820
Dragonflies

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,940
were chasing

57
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,980
little ducklings.

58
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,820
I suppose these little creatures

59
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,540
must be lovesick.

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,300
Sis,

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,740
express your feelings through the view.

62
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,060
Wouldn't that be too subtle?

63
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,980
Not subtle at all.

64
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,100
Because I add little ducks.

65
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,180
Wouldn't that be too playful?

66
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,820
No, not playful.

67
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,660
Think about him whenever he comes over.

68
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,180
He always acts so proper.

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,990
He's actually the same age as you,

70
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,460
but pretends to be as mature as an adult.

71
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,500
So annoying.

72
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,260

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,420
Alright, you can go.

102
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
What are you doing?

103
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,690
Miss Qin.

104
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,220
Come with me for a bit.

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,360
Oh.

106
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,740

My distinguished guest.

107
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,700
Come on up.

108
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,940
And you are...?

109
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,460
You're Sheng from the Dai family.

110
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,580
You remember that well.

111
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,860
Then I fear you won't live long.

112
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,860
What do you want?

113
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,980
I'm the Young Marshal's wife.

114
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,420
Young Marshal's wife?

115
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,660
Don't you know Dai Shiyao is my brother?

116
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,340
Don't push it too far.

117
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,660
Don't forget this.

118
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
My brother was to marry your sister.

119
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,260
If your sister were still here,

120
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,500
wouldn't he become your brother-in-law?

121
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,660
When you call yourself "Mrs. Dai",

122
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,620
don't you feel even a bit ashamed?

123
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,700
The marriage was arranged by Grandma.

124
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,340
Ashamed or not,

125
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,140
it's not your concern.

126
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,980
Alright.

127
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,380
Yesterday, Young Marshal killed his wife.

128
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,180
Do you want to be the next?

129
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,340
None of your business.

130
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,580
Please be polite to me first.

131
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,940
I brought you here

132
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,860
to ask you for something.

133
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,420
About my identity

134
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,820
and the Dai family's secret brother,

135
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,500
you must not say a single word.

136
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,140
Do you understand?

137
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,700
So you're asking me for a favor.

138
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
What are you afraid of?

139
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,980
When you ask someone to keep a secret,

140
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,550
shouldn't you be a bit kinder?

141
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,780
I'm only kind to women undressed.

142
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,420
What?

143
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,020
Wanna give it a try?

144
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,060
Don't move.

145
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,980
Let me go.

146
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,700
I'm warning you.

147
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,300
If you dare move again,

148
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,500
I'll make you mine right here.

149
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,020
You're still untouched, huh?

150
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,860
I should've let you starve

151
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,180
when you were a dirty kid.

152
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,780
I shouldn't have given you mooncakes.

153
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,700
So ungrateful.

154
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,380
Over just one lousy mooncake.

155
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,910
I'm telling you,

156
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,750
my brother always

157
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,550
gives me whatever I ask for.

158
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,780
Maybe I'll just ask him for you.

159
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,460
So you can spend every day with me
at Night Queen.

160
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,780
Let's see what pride you have then.

161
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,740
Stay here.

162
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,420
The God of Wealth is here.

163
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,900
Alright.

164
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,100
Come have a drink.

165
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,940
Let's go.

166
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,020
How did things go?

167
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,900
I have to call you out here.

168
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,020
There was a hard-won peace talk.

169
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,340
But you acted on a whim,

170
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,140
and just bailed on them.

171
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,060
If we try to resume the cooperation,

172
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,100
it won't be easy.

173
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,700
You think that was on a whim?

174
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,980
Uncle Qin's family was killed.

175
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,100
That's a huge deal.

176
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,500
If I hadn't been on the road out of town,

177
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,660
I might've saved them.

178
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,180
I suspect someone did it on purpose,

179
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,660
just to start a fight.

180
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,780
That's why

181
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,500
we need to keep the situation steady.

182
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,660
If we don't handle this well,

183
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,180
we might be walking into a trap.

184
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,460
It could spark a war.

185
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,500
Then the people of Nancheng suffer.

186
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,180
Hold on.

187
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,980
All this talk about serving the people,

188
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,060
I've heard it so many times.

189
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,180
There's nothing new in it.

190
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,980
You hold this position,

191
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,940
so it's your job to do these things.

192
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,940
If it's something tricky,

193
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,980
just tell me, and I'll handle it.

194
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,380
You can't have my guys
do the dirty work

195
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,300
while listening to your moral preaches.

196
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,140
This time Marshal Liu is truly furious.

197
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,780
I can't step in directly.

198
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,660
You smooth things over quietly.

199
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,620
Brother,

200
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,820
all these years,

201
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,340
I've done plenty for you,

202
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,980
but I never asked for anything.

203
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,180
So what do you want?

204
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,220
The one...

205
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
The one you brought from the Qin family.

206
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,180
You two weren't close anyway.

207
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,540
Why don't you…

208
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,700
Why don't I what?

209
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,940
Give her to me?

210
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,980
You've been wild
in the underworld too long.

211
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,460
No one's keeping you in check, huh?

212
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,380
Say that again, I dare you.

213
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,060
Don't blame me for dropping our bond.

214
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,580
Just do what you're supposed to.

215
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,180
Who locked you in here?

216
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,020
Did you steal something?

217
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,740
This is my own home.

218
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,500
You look like Shiyao.

219
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,740
You know my brother?

220
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,940
Of course, I do.

221
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,700
My dad was in a great mood today.

222
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,860
He set up a match for my sister and him.

223
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,340
They're celebrating right now.

224
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,180
Why aren't you joining them?

225
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,820
I prefer places with fewer people.

226
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,820
I like lively crowds.

227
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,140
But I'm not allowed
in the genealogy record.

228
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,180
They said

229
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,780
I have to stay in places with few people,

230
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,940
live hidden in the shadows.

231
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,540
You didn't agree to it,

232
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,260
so they locked you in here, right?

233
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,540
Yeah.

234
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,540
That's really sad.

235
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,420
Are you hungry?

236
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,830
I'll get you a mooncake.
