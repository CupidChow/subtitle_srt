11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,000
You better keep your word.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,080
Of course.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,880
How impressive,

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,720
Qin Shiyue.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,560
Even drugged wine, you dared to drink.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,200
Or did you secretly desire me?

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,000
Speak.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,040
What clues do you have now?

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,940
If you're feeling hot,

20
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,360
just take off your clothes.

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,760
Mingmen Shipping...

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,360
The ship my family lost

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,280
was tied to that company.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,240
And to Dai Shiyao.

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,520
Who do you think you are?

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,240
You want me
to investigate my own brother?

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Your brother?

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,440
I thought you were his shadow.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,040
I'm willing to be his shadow.

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,920
You're more like his lapdog.

31
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,400
Look at yourself first!

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
What right do you have to judge me?

33
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,980
Get out.

34
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,580
Get out!

35
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,020
Have you heard?

36
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,050
At the ancestral hall that day,

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,700
Young Marshal shot that guy dead

38
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,380
for the traitor's daughter.

39
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,620
Such a sin!

40
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,420
The whole Dai Residence is buzzing.

41
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,460
Who doesn't know about it?

42
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,580
It's said that Concubine Xue

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,980
was pregnant.

44
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,020
Honestly,

45
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,900
that traitor's daughter has her tricks.

46
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,980
Otherwise, how'd she
bewitch Young Marshal?

47
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,860
Let's stay away from her.

48
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,340
Or we'll die without knowing why.

49
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,540
Get back to work.

50
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,460
Here she comes.

51
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,860
What's wrong, Shiyue?

52
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,660
Did Shiyao upset you?

53
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,580
Grandma,

54
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,870
you knew my Qin family well

55
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,860
and watched my father grow up.

56
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,620
Do you really believe

57
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,480
my father would do such a thing?

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,540
Times are unstable now.

59
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,180
Many things aren't up to us.

60
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,100
So you also think
my father is a traitor?

61
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,820
Let's eat first.

62
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,960
No talking about that at the table.

63
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,220
I can't eat right now.

64
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,020
My father was framed.

65
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,340
I have to clear his name.

66
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,140
I sympathize with your family's tragedy,

67
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,420
and you're a principled child,

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,660
but don't be unreasonable!

69
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,940
Whether your father was framed or not,

70
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,380
it's not your concern.

71
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,720
That's a road you can't return from.

72
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,440
Do you have no regard for your life?

73
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,260
If you marry into our Dai family,

74
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,580
you'll be one of us!

75
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,820
Shiyue,

76
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,620
listen to Grandma.

77
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,620
Eat up.

78
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,430
This department store has everything.

79
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,140
Get whatever you like.

80
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,620
Grandma is aging.

81
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,140
Don't defy her again.

82
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,980
Put your family matters on hold.

83
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,820
Got it.

84
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,780
Pick me up after escorting Miss Qin.

85
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,220
Yes, Young Marshal.

86
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,700
What happened?

87
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,290
Two spies from
the Collaborationist Chinese Army

88
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,380
even got your defense map.

89
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,020
There's a mole inside, Brother.

90
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Who's your handler?

91
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,620
You'll never know.

92
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,940
They hid poison under their tongues.

93
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,620
It's tetrodotoxin inside.

94
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,580
They'll die fast once they swallow.

95
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,020
Take them back for interrogation.

96
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,170
Let go!

97
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,410
Let me go!

98
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,300
Brother...

99
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,860
Brother,

100
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,780
stay away

101
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,100
from that Qin girl.

102
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,740
Qin Huai's dealings with Japan

103
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,940
are now proven.

104
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,540
I'm afraid she might harm you.

105
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,100
What do you mean?

106
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,420
I looked into it.

107
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,420
On the eighth day of the fourth month,

108
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,340
Qin Huai loaded a full ship

109
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,340
of artifacts for Japan.

110
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,500
He was caught red-handed
during the transfer.

111
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,540
Think about it.

112
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,860
Once the united front forms,

113
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,700
this incident will explode

114
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,460
on any faction's turf.

115
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,540
I've also heard

116
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,670
the National Government in Chongqing
paid big to eliminate the Qin family.

117
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,500
That girl investigates

118
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,540
like it's child's play,

119
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,980
yet you

120
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,420
keep her in our family.

121
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,780
Sheng,

122
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,660
you barely knew Uncle Qin.

123
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,100
I get why you don't trust him.

124
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,740
But none of this

125
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
concerns Qin Shiyue.

126
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,900
No, Brother.

127
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,580
I'm just looking out for you.

128
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,780
Since when

129
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,020
are you so interested
in Qin Shiyue?

130
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,620
What's that supposed to mean?

131
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,860
I just fear you'll get burned.

132
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,790
I'm not the one playing with fire.

133
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,860
It's you, Sheng.

134
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,100
Stay away from
your future sister-in-law.

135
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,710
Sister-in-law?

136
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,980
So you'll publicly

137
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,850
announce that

138
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,780
you have a twin brother?

139
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,700
Don't be reckless.

140
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,380
Each Dai has their duty.

141
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,540
This is a rule our father left.

142
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,020
And you know that.

143
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,860
Our secret

144
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,380
must stay hidden.

145
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,180
Sir,

146
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,500
why bring me here?

147
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,580
Miss Qin,

148
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,380
may I have a word?

149
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,420
Miss Qin,

150
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,220
you may not remember me.

151
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,220
Years ago, your father helped me.

152
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,100
You knew my father?

153
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,460
Miss Qin,

154
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,100
I never believed

155
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,260
Master Qin colluded with Japan.

156
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,740
Thank you.

157
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,780
Thank you for trusting him.

158
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,820
Though I'm lowborn,

159
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,300
there's something I have to say.

160
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,700
Go ahead.

161
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,820
Dozens from the Qin family were killed.

162
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,820
We don't know

163
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,420
the real mastermind.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,490
But there's a saying,
"People die for wealth,

165
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,620
just like birds for food."

166
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,660
The gold bars from Qin's vault

167
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,740
are all
in the Young Marshal's vault now.

168
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,100
The Qin's vault?

169
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,140
Miss,

170
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,380
think about it.

171
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,540
The market runs
entirely on silver dollars.

172
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,340
Who would trade in gold bars?

173
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,300
I hide here,

174
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,460
bearing my own vengeance.

175
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,220
Don't you want to avenge it too?

176
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,340
Qin's Bank.

177
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,700
That's my family's official silver.

178
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,460
(Qin's Bank)
Every gold bar bears these words.

179
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,340
The craftsmanship is

180
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,260
too complex to forge.

181
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,340
During the transport that day,

182
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,260
I secretly kept one aside.

183
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,780
That's proof of their greed.

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,900
Here comes the richest.

185
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,900
Dai Shiyao...

186
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,340
You really know good food.

187
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,960
I know this place too.

188
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,420
It's cloyingly sweet.

189
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,300
My elder sister said

190
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,140
that people with a sweet tooth are kind.
