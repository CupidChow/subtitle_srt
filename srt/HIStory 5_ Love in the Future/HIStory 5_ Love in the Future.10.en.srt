Why? Please don't take what I said seriously.

Should I go explain to Chairman?

No. It was my decision.

I've worked for Poseidon for a long while. I'm tired.

I don't know when I'll leave Hai Yi.

Hai Yi pretended to be lazing around on purpose.

He was hiding it very well.

Sorry, Master. Don't be upset. Please continue.

Because She is a western God,

that's why it took me a while, a long time.

486
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,530
when she passed away,

487
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,890
I'm in so much pain.

488
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,640
It's all my fault.

489
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,810
You have me... you have me.

490
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,375
I'm right here.

491
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,080
Stay here.

492
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,430
Let me take care of you.

493
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,770
I love you.

494
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,480
Does my Jin-hua really live here?

495
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,570
After I found out your grandma had passed away,

496
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,830
I moved her ashes here.

497
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,250
I always wanted to give Jin-hua a better house.

498
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,150
At least she lives in a mansion now.

499
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,540
Thank you.

500
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,430
Don't be sad.

501
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,540
After moving her ashes here,

502
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,670
I've visited regularly to tell her that her Ho Bo-wei is safe and doing well.

503
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,240
I believe she must be at ease in Heaven.

504
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,315
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

505
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,540
I didn't want you to be sad.

506
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,770
I didn't know how to tell you.

507
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,790
Thank you.

508
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,360
Thank you for everything you've done for me and my grandma.

509
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,390
Let's go visit your grandma.

510
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,300
I want to introduce you to my grandma.

511
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,580
Dai Zhe-ni.

512
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:51,150
Brother Fu-de? How have you been doing?

513
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,980
Not bad. My performance is not satisfactory though.

514
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,729
- "Performance"?
- Nothing.

515
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,580
I work here as a caretaker now.

516
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,630
What a coincidence.

517
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,249
- Hello. I'm Hai Yi.
- Hello.

518
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,870
Zhe-ni told me about you.

519
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:07,560
You are the owner of Poseidon. I have heard a lot about you.

520
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,350
You are the reason why I have poor performance.

521
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,150
- What brings you here?
- We're here to visit my grandma.

522
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,880
Let me lead the way.

523
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,459
I'm more familiar with this place.

524
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,220
It's good to have a witness to hear what you say to your grandma.

525
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,120
[Memorial tablet of Ho-Lee Jin-hua]

526
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,800
Jin-hua...

527
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,490
your grandson is here to see you.

528
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,520
How are you doing in Heaven?

529
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,210
I'm sorry.

530
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,280
I was unfilial.

531
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,280
I didn't stay with you.

532
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,130
I didn't take good care of you.

533
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,190
If you don't let go,

534
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,920
your grandma can't rest in peace.

535
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,110
Let me introduce you to my grandma.

536
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,310
It will make her happy.

537
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,540
Just say whatever you want.

538
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,460
I believe she can hear you.

539
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:35,280
I'm so happy.

540
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,230
I finally get to see my grandson.

541
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,810
He's getting more and more handsome now.

542
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,590
I know the guy next to him.

543
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,260
He has visited me often.

544
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,930
When they are standing together,

545
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:54,520
they look like superstars.

546
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,980
Grandma, he's Hai Yi.

547
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,910
You've probably seen him before.

548
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:04,890
He's the one who moved you here.

549
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,040
He finally brought me here today.

550
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:15,550
I'd like to tell you that I'm with Hai Yi now.

551
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:19,080
I'm very happy and blessed.

552
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,720
Don't worry about me.

553
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,010
Grandma, it's good to see you again.

554
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,710
Dai Zhe-ni and I—... I mean Ho—

555
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,060
No matter whether he's Dai Zhe-ni or Ho Bo-wei,

556
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,480
I will take care of him,

557
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,350
protect him, be there for him forever.

558
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,500
Please do not worry.

559
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,950
All right. Under the witness of me and Grandma Jin-hua,

560
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:51,760
may you be together forever, be of one mind forever, and be always in love.

561
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,570
Stop! ... Stop.

562
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,410
- What's wrong?
- If you want to do that ceremony,

563
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:06,600
I suggest you do it after you leave this place.

564
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,180
What happened?

565
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,450
You look so handsome.

566
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,639
Sorry. I'm late.

567
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,519
- Director Yeh.
- Yeh.

568
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,850
Today is New Year's Eve. Traffic is jammed.

569
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,990
It's okay.

570
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,870
You've finally made up with each other.

571
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,539
Thank you, Director Yeh, for your pep talk.

572
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,640
Don't mention it. Wun-sen and I are never polite to each other.

573
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,290
I came here right after he said he's buying me a meal.

574
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,109
"Happy Family" was a successful event

575
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:09,179
and gave Poseidon a good sales performance.

576
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,859
I'm happy to treat you to more than one meal.

577
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,419
- No backing out!
- Sure thing.

578
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,640
By the way, would you like to go to the countdown with us after the meal?

579
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,930
Sure.

580
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:21,380
It's New Year's Eve, but Fu Yung-chieh is doing

581
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,620
homework with his classmates.

582
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:30,460
That's why I'm alone. I can only be your "third wheel" then.

583
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,450
It's okay. It doesn't happen often. I'll lend you this one day.

584
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,130
Mr. Yeh Hsing-ssu, you have a visitor on the rooftop.

585
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,570
Please go there now.

586
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,400
Mr. Yeh Hsing-ssu,

587
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,280
- Did she just call my name?
- you have a visitor on the rooftop.

588
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,220
Please go there now.

589
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,970
I don't see another Yeh Hsing-ssu here.

590
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:52,840
We'll go upstairs with you.

591
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,500
All right. Let's go.

592
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,140
You've worked out a lot lately, right?

593
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:11,010
[Marry me]

594
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,030
Watch the steps.

595
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,620
- There are some steps here.
- Do I have to close my eyes?

596
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,950
Yes. Close your eyes.

597
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,930
No peeking.

598
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,740
Don't open your eyes until I say you can.

599
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,690
Stand here.

600
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,000
So mysterious.

601
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,740
- You'll know in a bit. Don't move.
- Okay.

602
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,200
Yeh, you can open your eyes.

603
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:24,020
When I was 10 years old, you found me on the rooftop.

604
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:28,180
You gave me a warm loving home.

605
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:35,470
Now, it's my turn to make a lifetime commitment to you.

606
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,770
I don't just want to be your family... and lover...

607
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,780
I want to be your life partner.

608
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,650
Yeh Hsing-ssu...

609
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:09,540
Do you want to grow old with me, as we accompany each other for the rest of our lives?

610
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,520
Say yes. Say yes. Say yes.

611
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,220
Say yes...

612
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,170
I do.

613
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,860
Don't be jealous.

614
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:32,240
I'll arrange something bigger when it's our turn.

615
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:37,170
Make sure you walk the talk.

00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:18,720
♫ Abruptly reminding me of the past ♫

648
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,630
♫ The rain sounds are foreshadowing  ♫

649
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:24,870
♫ Constantly reminding ♫

650
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:30,390
♫ Describing how powerless I am ♫

651
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:34,260
♫ Just don’t be depressed, don’t be submissive ♫

652
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,380
♫ Be courageous, but the memories fail me ♫

653
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,680
♫ When mentioning you, I become powerless ♫

654
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,470
♫ That word and sentence, I think of it but don’t say it ♫

655
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,630
♫ Even the input method doesn’t forget ♫

656
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:53,620
♫ How cruelly ask me to forget you? It’s you ♫

657
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:57,600
♫ The messages are organized over and over, but still not clean ♫

658
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,910
♫ The sceneries outside are stacked into shadows ♫

659
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:03,960
♫ Longing becomes an illness, the senses are numbed ♫

660
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,380
♫ Engraved in memory, every single drop ♫

661
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,960
♫ I overestimate myself to provoke you ♫

662
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,200
♫ I’ve used all my efforts to love in this life ♫

663
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:19,220
♫ Please let me be a fish in my next life ♫

664
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:25,200
♫ Always have a seven-second memory ♫

665
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,030
