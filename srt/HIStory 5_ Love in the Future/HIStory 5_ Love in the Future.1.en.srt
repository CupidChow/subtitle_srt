00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,670
Hello, Mr. Hai. Your food is here.

320
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,940
"Video call"?

321
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,769
What is a video call?

322
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,240
I think Mr. Hai would like to scold you to your face. Here.

323
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,320
What kind of technology is this?

324
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,620
Did you just zone out?

325
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,090
Wait.

326
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,830
Can you see me, too?

327
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,000
Nonsense. Otherwise, why would I ask for a video call? Are you crazy?

328
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,160
I'm so sorry, Sir. It's my fault.

329
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,069
Please give me another chance.

330
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,039
Don't apologize.

331
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,510
I just wanted to see what the person who cursed me looks like.

332
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,939
Now I know, I'll remember your face.

333
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,840
I'll definitely give you a bad rating.

334
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,649
Please don't do that, Sir.

335
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,410
My admiration for you is like the flowing river, lasting forever.

336
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,550
I'm terribly sorry.

337
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,889
I really need a good rating.

338
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,430
Where is the attitude? Where is the attitude you just had?

339
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,330
Sir, you have no idea.

340
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,269
I had a car accident as I was coming here,

341
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,140
and I didn't waste time going to the hospital.

342
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,440
It was not my true intention to curse you.

343
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,410
If you still insist on canceling the order,

344
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,050
there's nothing I can do.

345
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:24,190
You didn't mention it. How could I know you had a car accident?

346
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,659
I did fall from my scooter.

347
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,460
You know what? If you need help with anything in the future,

348
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,270
I'll definitely assist.

349
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,099
Okay. Deal.

350
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,139
I'll let you know if I need anything.

351
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,439
Sure. No problem.

352
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,850
About the food order...

353
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,310
Since you got hurt, I forgive you.

354
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,580
Thank you, Sir. Thank you.

355
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,319
Sir, are you done? My arm is sore.

356
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,860
Sorry.

357
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,310
This guy is pretty smart.

358
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,180
Maybe he could help me find Lu Si-chi.

359
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,940
It seems like this Dai Zhe-ni doesn't have any family.

360
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,510
The address on his identification card is a permanent address.

361
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,080
I don't know where he lives.

362
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,580
Where am I supposed to sleep tonight?

364

I'm sorry. I haven't eaten anything today.

365
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,429
I didn't have enough strength and I missed it.

366

What happened, young man? You said you haven't eaten anything.

369
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:19,270
Did you lose your job because of the pandemic like I did.

370
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,770
So are you homeless too?

371
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,779
We seem to have a similar misfortune.

372
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:27,449
So did you really lose your job?

373
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,520
No. I mean—

374
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,320
It's a long story.

375
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,620
I don't even know who I am.

376
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,199
Don't worry. A lot of people never know who they are

377
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,360
throughout their entire lives.

378
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,870
Take a seat.

379

My name is Fu-de. What's your name?

Thank God.

382

It's your luckiest moment today.

383
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,820
Come on. I have nothing but food.

384
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,720
Bananas. Taiwan golden croissants. Apples.

385
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,390
Gummies. Popcorn. Fish snacks.

386
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,200
Wafer rolls. Peanut mochi.

387
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,400
That's my favorite. I'll keep it for myself.

388
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,600
Eat as much as you can.

389
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,200
Fu-de... You are just like Xiao Ding Dang.

390
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,899
"Xiao Ding Dang"? That character is now called Doraemon.

391
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,970
No worries. Just eat.

392

I cannot send him back with my power anymore.

399

I have to find another way to return him.

400
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,310
My dream last night kind of makes sense.

401

If you want to go back, try where you woke up.

402
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:11,240
That should be the key. It works in many movies.

403

Perhaps I can send myself back with the power of lightning?

Yes.

I've always wanted to work in this company since I was little.

432

Don't be nervous.

433
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,290
My grandma once told me

434
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,289
that she saw people hold their breath or avoid her

435
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,840
when she started to sell stinky tofu.

436
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,650
She was very scared because of that.

437
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:42,659
After a second thought, though, it's a proper job. So why should she be scared?

Hey. Well...

482
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,879
You remember what you promised me last time, right?

483
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,149
Of course I do.

484
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,820
Let me know if you need anything.

485
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,350
Help me find a person.

486
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,789
Like Bright Pu's missions on "Super Sunday"?

487
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,729
I've always wanted to give it a try.

488
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,890
Sir, who are you looking for?

489
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,660
My name is Hai Yi.

490
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,729
Just call me by my name.

491
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,100
Sure. Brother Hai Yi.

492
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,069
Give me your personal mobile number.

493
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,010
I will give you the details later.

494
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:25,470
My mobile phone was broken. Just call me on this number.

495
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,219
Okay. Save my number then.

496
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:31,250
I don't give people my number easily.

497
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,090
Sure. Noted.

498
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,089
Just call me when you need anything.

499
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,589
Whether it's fruit, household items or even laundry,

500
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,159
I'll deliver anything you need.

501
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,569
You are very enthusiastic.

502
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,999
Of course.

503
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,139
People used to call me an amazing errand runner.

504
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,539
If you need anything, I'm your guy.

505
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,740
It seems like I've found the right person.

506
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,440
Thank you.

507
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,050
Brother Hai Yi looks so cute when he smiles.

508
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,320
He has charming eyes, too.

509
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,260
I thought you said you had to go?

510
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,030
Right. I need to go now.

511
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,370
I traveled all the way to Taiwan from the States because of my girlfriend, Lu Si-chi.

512
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,910
She said her deceased grandma appeared in her dream

513
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,649
and said we were not good together. So she wanted to break up with me.

514
00:37:33,649 --> 00:37:37,980
That's ridiculous. She has been avoiding me.

515
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,050
Your job is to find her. I would like to talk to her in person.

516
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,040
[Today's News: Lu Si-chi, daughter of Luquan Group, will be at the Taiwan Thanksgiving Banquet, 2 p.m. tomorrow. The license plate number is...]

517
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,920
"Lu Si-chi"?
[Today's News: Lu Si-chi, daughter of Luquan Group, will be at the Taiwan Thanksgiving Banquet, 2 p.m. tomorrow. The license plate number is...]

518
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,710
She will be present at the banquet 2 p.m. tomorrow.

519
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:01,830
The license plate number is.... This is great.

520
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,670
Lu Si-chi, I've finally found you.

521
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,369
Someone promised me that there would be no problem.

522
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,950
"An amazing errand runner."

523
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,409
At least I found her.

524
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,380
She drove an expensive car onto the highway.

525
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,110
I rode a scooter. There's nothing I could do.

526
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,309
Excuses.

527
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,680
Don't worry. I'll make a solid plan next time.

528
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,890
- I won't lose track of her again.
- Next time?

529
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,889
How about you quit the delivery job and focus on helping me?

530
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,029
No, I travel everywhere as a delivery man.

531
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:29,160
I can deliver food while looking for her.

532
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,200
No. That's not effective. The time-cost is too high.

533
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,369
Brother Hai Yi.

534
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:39,710
If I quit my delivery job, what will I eat or drink? How will I make a living?

535
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,139
Do you think I would let you work for free?

536
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,480
How about this? I will pay you twice the hourly rate.

537
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,849
But if I quit my delivery job, I won't have a mobile phone.

538
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:50,520
I'll buy you a new phone.

539
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,089
I also need some clothes and shoes.

540
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,689
Why do you need clothes and shoes to find a person?

541
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,690
Well, look at 007's films.

542
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,730
When James Bond is on a mission, he always has cool clothes and a classy car.

543
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,799
All I ask for are a few clothes. That's reasonable, right?

544
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:06,840
"007"! All right. I'll get you some clothes.

545
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,830
Just make sure you find her.

546
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,669
By the way, I just got kicked out by a bad landlord and have nowhere to live.

547
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,209
I have to find a new place to stay before I can help you find her.

548
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:16,681
It's so hard to find an apartment in Taipei. I'm not sure—

549
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,340
You're asking a lot.

550
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,679
It's not my fault. I just happen to be unlucky.

551
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,349
Of course, I can hunt for an apartment on my own.

552
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,149
I simply don't want to waste your precious time,

553
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:31,190
because it seems that you pay attention to time-cost.

554
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,219
I'll take care of everything. Happy?

555
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:37,390
Thank you, Brother Hai Yi. I'll start the 24-hour search mode.

556
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,199
Shall we go for Japanese food?

557
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:45,100
Sure. Your treat.

558
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,669
I have no money.

559
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,070
You are stingy.

560
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,679
- Why do you say that?
- I want to go too.

561
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,809
Let's go.

562
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,190
- Goodbye, Manager.
- Goodbye, Manager.

563
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,110
Goodbye, Manager.

564
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,430
Lin Huai-en, I just emailed you the materials for tomorrow's meeting.

565
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,960
- Make sure you print them out.
- Okay.

566
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,200
Do turn off the lights and lock the doors.

567
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,999
No problem. Goodbye, Manager.

568
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,470
Okay.

569
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,479
What's your relationship with Director Liang?

570
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:27,049
What do you mean?

571
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,380
Director Liang asked me to take care of you during the interview.

572
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,320
I don't know the managing director.

573
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,660
Well... you are hardworking. Good job. Keep going.

574
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,400
Okay. Thank you, Manager.

575
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,459
Are you all right?

576
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,230
I'm good. Sorry.

577
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,660
I didn't know your were the managing director when I saw you last time.

578
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,900
And this time, I... I'm so sorry.

579
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,009
You just like to carelessly appear in front of me, don't you?

580
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,640
No... I really didn't mean it.

581
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,720
I can take care of them.

582
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,260
It's late. Why are you still here?

583
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,720
I haven't finished my work.

584
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,490
I don't think these are your responsibilities.

585
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,870
My colleagues asked me for help.

586
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,009
We all have our own responsibilities and targets to meet.

587
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,909
If you spend your time on their jobs, what about your own duty?

588
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,910
Will they share the credits with you?

589
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:12,249
I just don't know how to reject them.

590
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:17,219
Saying "no" appropriately is also a skill. You need to learn it.

591
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,789
Pack your stuff and go home now.

592
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,390
No.

593
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,799
I will try to reject them next time, but I promised them today. I have to finish them.

594
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:32,770
I didn't expect that I would be the first person you've ever rejected.

595
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,470
Managing Director,

596
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:43,680
the manager said that you specially hired me.

597
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,980
May I ask why?

598
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,090
It was nothing.

599
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:53,589
I read your resume and covering letter, and I thought you would fit the company well.

600
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,689
I did not use any influence.

601
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:59,459
I see. I will do my best. I won't let you down.

602
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:01,370
Thank you, Managing Director.

603
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,999
Go back to work.

604
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,540
Sure.

605
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,419
Wei. Don't work so hard.

606
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:25,489
Let me tell you. My business is going very well.

607
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:29,330
I earned *NT$2,000 (US$66) more last week.
(*New Taiwan dollars)

608
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,359
Ms. Jin-hua, you're the one who is not supposed to work too hard.

609
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:37,400
You have knee pain, right?

610
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,610
Due to the *921 Earthquake,
(*severe earthquake on 9/21/1999)

611
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,540
there are cracks in the wall at home.

612
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,509
Our landlord doesn't bother to fix them.

613
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:51,649
I want to save up more money so we can move.

614
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,450
Wait.

615
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,750
We had a deal, didn't we?

616
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,180
I will take care of our home.

617
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:05,099
Wei, Grandma feels very sorry for you.

618
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:09,269
If your parents hadn't passed away so early,

619
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,940
you wouldn't have lived a tough life with me.

620
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,010
It's not tough at all.

621
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:18,980
I'm so happy to be with you.

622
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:24,219
After we buy our own apartment, we won't need to move anymore.

623
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:28,089
We will have our own place one day.

624
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:31,219
Nice. That will be great.

625
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:50,469
Grandma. I'm trying my best to survive here.

626
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:54,050
Take good care of yourself until I get back.

627
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,019
Dai Zhe-ni. It's really you! Do you still remember me?

628
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:08,019
Lin Huai-en. Of course I do. How was the job interview?

629
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:12,759
I got the job. Thank you for the tip. I stopped feeling nervous.

630
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:14,630
Congratulations.

631
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:18,229
Have you eaten? I will buy you some stinky tofu to thank you.

632
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:20,639
- Sure.
- Let's go.

633
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,179
Do you like it? This is one of my favorite places.

634
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:32,750
It's good, but a bit worse than the stinky tofu my grandma makes.

635
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,450
Right. Your grandma sells stinky tofu.

636
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:40,159
Where does she sell it? I'll go buy some from her later.

637
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:45,260
Somewhere really far away.

638
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,230
What's wrong?

639
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,369
I miss my grandma very much.

640
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:54,270
Go visit her if you miss her.

641
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,769
I can't go back right now.

642
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,680
You've been busy at work, haven't you?

643
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,970
Wait till the next holiday weekend. Or, make a video call. You can see her through a video call.

644
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:05,879
I can't make a video call. We're not in the same space.

645
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,450
What space?

646
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:15,660
Anyway, I'm not sure if I'll ever see my grandma again.

647
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,040
Did you forget how you encouraged me?

648
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
Pull yourself together.

649
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,809
Stay hopeful. You will definitely make it.

650
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:41,519
That's right. Whenever or wherever it is, I have to stay invincible, just like a cockroach.

651
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:45,619
Keep believing, and I will definitely find a way to see my grandma.

652
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:48,130
Yes. That's right.

653
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:52,860
You are a lot luckier... than I am.

654
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,470
Growing up, I lived in many orphanages.

655
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:01,599
I've been an introvert. That's why I'm always alone.

656
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:06,610
I never saw any meaning in my life,

657
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:09,710
until I was transferred to Rende Orphanage

658
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:13,320
and was sponsored by the Poseidon Department Store.

659
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:19,189
That's why I dreamed of working at Poseidon Department Store and working hard for them.

660
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:21,060
That's nice.

661
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,090
What's your dream?

662
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,859
My friend hid the old-warehouse key under a flower pot on the left side of the door.

663
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:31,599
You can live there temporarily. Don't mess things up.

664
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,849
This place is even better than Xiao Ding Dang's magic pocket. Its got everything.

665
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,230
What does Brother Hai Yi do for a living?

666
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:37,540
How could he arrange such a nice place?

667
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,340
These books are useful.

668
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,260
Brother Hai Yi.

669
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:32,170
He has such a charming smile.

670
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:51,660
♫ The falling rain has bad intentions ♫

671
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,870
♫ Completely leaving no room ♫

672
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:59,050
♫ Abruptly reminding me of the past ♫

673
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:02,070
♫ The rain sounds are foreshadowing ♫

674
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:05,260
♫ Constantly reminding ♫

675
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:10,810
♫ Describing how powerless I am ♫

676
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:14,730
♫ Just don’t be depressed, don't be submissive ♫

677
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:18,830
♫  Be courageous, but the memories fail me  ♫

678
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,180
♫ When mentioning you, I become powerless  ♫

679
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:25,200
♫ That word and sentence, I think of it but don’t say it  ♫

680
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,100
♫  Even the input method doesn’t forget ♫

681
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:34,040
♫ How cruelly ask me to forget you? It's you ♫

682
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,070
♫ The messages are organized over and over, but still not clean ♫

683
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,300
♫ The sceneries outside are stacked into shadows ♫

684
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,430
♫ Longing becomes an illness, the senses are numbed ♫

685
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,800
♫ Engraved in memory, every single drop ♫

686
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,550
♫ I overestimate myself to provoke you ♫

687
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:53,700
♫ I’ve used all my efforts to love in this life ♫

688
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:59,680
♫ Please let me be a fish in my next life ♫

689
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:06,100
♫ Always have a seven-second memory ♫

690
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:10,000
