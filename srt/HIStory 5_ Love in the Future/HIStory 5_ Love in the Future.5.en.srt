00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,070
Do you feel better after resting for a day?

163
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,740
I'm feeling much better.

164
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,530
Good. Here. Eat this.

165
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,640
Thank you, Managing Director.

166
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,300
Managing Director...

167
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,130
Did I say something to you...

168
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,420
before I passed out?

169
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,080
I think you said something to me, too.

170
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,060
Did I? What did I say?

171
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,650
I think... you also kissed me.

172
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,090
Sorry. I've mixed it up.

173
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,710
I think it was just a dream.

174
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,070
Silly.

175
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,670
How could you mix up your dream and reality?

176
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,472
Those are all real.

177
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:35,110
So... Are we a couple now?

178
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,220
That day when I went out with Lu Si-chi,

179
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,820
I asked you to join us the last minute.

180
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,517
Were you sad because I was using you?

181
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:12,620
No. I was happy because I could help you.

182
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,300
You probably don't remember our kiss.

183
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,520
Should I remind you of that?

184
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,070
You're still playing video games.

185
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,220
I've almost finished typing this up. You haven't even started yet.

186
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,649
Let me show you an ultimate move.

187
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:42,600
What is the "ultimate move"?

188
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,730
Scan the document with your phone,

189
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,190
and then extract the content from it.

190
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,580
Then...

191
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,080
the data is on your computer with one touch.

192
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,590
Wow. Amazing! Why didn't you show me earlier—

193
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,820
Anyway, make sure you utilize the *SMART technology.

[Wei Se-mo sent you a file.]

195
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,510
What did Momo send me?

196
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,859
Read it and you'll understand.
["HIStory3: Trapped" Spinoff]

197
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,009
Good luck.
[Side Story: Our Stories Afterwards]

198
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,459
Why are you blushing?

199
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,800
I—... Nothing.

200
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,380
Are you hiding your phone from me?

201
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,980
Did she send you some nude photos? Share them with me.

202
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,400
Of course not.

203
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,980
Hey—

204
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,559
This isn't suitable for you.

205
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,340
You should read some suspense novels to keep your brain active.

206
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,739
Why did you send Lin Huai-en to the cold storage?

207
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,399
He's new here. He said he would take any chance to learn.

208
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:20,929
I simply gave him a chance.

209
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,849
Giving him a chance by locking him in the cold storage!

210
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,299
He could have died if I hadn't arrived in time.

211
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,339
No. It's because the door of the cold storage is broken.

212
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,249
That's why he was locked inside.

213
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,019
I've reported it to Administration.

214
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,279
You're still trying to argue with me at this time.

215
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,660
I know you did it on purpose.

216
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,420
"On purpose"? That's impossible.

217
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,920
Who told you that?

218
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,550
You know what you did. I'm warning you now.

219
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,910
From now on, I don't want to hear nor see

220
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,950
anyone getting bullied in this office.

221
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,870
Do you understand?

222
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,879
I understand.

223
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,520
Get out.

224
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,500
I'm so jealous. I wish Prince Charming could hug me too.

225
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,799
Many girls will suffer from insomnia tonight.

226
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,559
Who is this Lin Huai-en? How did he steal Prince Charming so soon after arriving?

227
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,450
Managing Director said I should just do my best.

228
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,680
I don't need to care about what others say.

229
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,200
It's time for afternoon tea. What would you guys like to drink?

230
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,749
I'll order.

231
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,740
Don't worry. Huai-en, what would you like to drink?

232
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,610
It's my treat today.

233
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,450
Huai-en. Here are some trendy cookies. They are so good.

234
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,470
- Thank you, Hsuan.
- By the way, Huai-en,

235
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:57,000
please forgive us if we've ever done anything wrong.

236
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,760
- Make sure Managing Director doesn't misunderstand us.
- Don't worry.

237
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,689
We're colleagues.

238
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:04,780
I'll order some drinks for you guys. What would you like?

239
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,340
- Pearl milk tea.
- What about you?

240
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,490
- Pearl milk tea.
- Me, too.
- Sure.

241
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,970
Dai Zhe-ni.

242
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,010
Yes.

243
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,969
Where is Hai Yi?

244
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,430
Some colleagues needed his help in the store.

245
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,749
Go and get him. I'm going to make an announcement.

246
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,080
What is it about? I'll pass it to him.

247
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,020
Within 10 minutes, if I don't see both of you,

248
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,700
I'll announce that you guys are being fired.

249
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,519
Hai Yi? Are you new?

250
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,519
I haven't seen you before.

251
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,040
Yes. You don't see a handsome guy like me all the time.

252
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,839
I've seen you walking around the shop.

253
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,839
You were doing the survey for the company, right?

254
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,920
You know what? Tell management to arrange more promotional events.

255
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,499
We surely will.

256
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,349
Here is my advice. Pay more attention to male customers.

257
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,949
More and more men are caring about their skin.

258
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,000
They are potential customers.

259
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,960
I know. Let me recommend some products to you.

260
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,859
Sister, these testers look nice.

261
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,360
Hai Yi is so mean. He was flirting with me just this morning.

262
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,340
Now he's flirting with a girl.

263
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,240
I'm so annoyed!

264
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,839
- Hai Yi.
- Thank you.

265
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,940
I've been looking for you. Why didn't you answer my call?

266
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,969
Come on! You just want to stop me talking to a beautiful lady, don't you?

267
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:36,370
Do you want to talk to a beautiful lady or lose your job?

268
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,010
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

269
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,560
Hurry up.

270
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,250
Director! We are back.

271
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,810
Look. There are still 10 seconds left.

272
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,510
Good.

273
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,410
I have a question. What have you been doing every day?

274
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,079
I don't often see you in your seat.

275
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,799
Director, it's all my fault—

276
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,539
Sitting at the desk and acting busy doesn't make me good staff.

277
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:05,819
Please stop.

278
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,339
Well spoken!

279
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,880
We need some young talents like you!

280
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,209
Management has already directed that you've passed probation and are official staff,

281
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,959
effective immediately.

282
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,760
Director... is this a joke?

283
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:26,720
Here is the official document, and new badges.

284
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,250
Congratulations.

285
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,289
Thank you, Director.

286
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:36,080
So far, you two are the quickest to have become official staff at Poseidon.

287
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,159
Do you best.

288
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,149
Yes. Thank you, Director.

289
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,779
We'll surely do our best.

290
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,969
We won't let you and the firm down.

291
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,830
Hai Yi, right?

292
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,609
Okay. Go back to your work.

293
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,370
Thank you, Director.

294
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,350
We're really official staff now!

295
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,810
Here you go.

296
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,429
What are these?

297
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,109
Some testers of skin care products.

298
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,209
That lady at the counter kept forcing them on me.

299
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,440
They are free. You can try them out.

300
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,500
Are you treating me like a laboratory mouse?

301
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,780
- If you don't want to use them—
- I do.

302
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,490
I'll take anything that's free.

303
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,189
It's my treat today.

304
00:25:45,189 --> 00:25:47,320
Thank you.

305
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,909
Are you feeling better?

306
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,860
I am. Much better.

307
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,229
Congratulations. You've become official staff so quickly.

308
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:57,729
I'm very jealous.

309
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,430
You will make it too.

310
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,879
I don't even know if I can make it through probation.

311
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,970
Don't worry. You'll achieve it.

312
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:15,930
By the way, what happened between you and Managing Director?

313
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,199
Nothing. Why are you also gossiping?

314
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:22,009
No. I just wanted to remind you that

315
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:26,069
a hot, tall and rich guy like him must have a girlfriend.

316
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,929
- No way.
- It's true.

317
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:30,490
I saw her in a restaurant with my own eyes.

318
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,540
She's the daughter of Luquan Group.

319
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,919
I have to say that Managing Director has bad taste.

320
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,419
Do you mean Lu Si-chi?

321
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,190
You know her?

322
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,349
She's not his girlfriend.

323
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,130
It was just a business occasion.

324
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,930
"Business occasion"?

325
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,980
They had dinner together to discuss their two firms cooperating.

326
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,480
- They've signed the contract already.
- Are you sure?

327
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,670
Very sure.

328
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,960
How do you know that?

329
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,860
I just know it.

330
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,860
It seems that you are not just ordinary staff to Managing Director.

331
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,320
He is very nice to me and takes good care of me.

332
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,489
I'm so jealous.

333
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:20,869
I hope someone will take care of me, too.

334
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,960
Don't worry. There will be someone.

335
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,789
I know the owner of this bar.

336
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,549
It'll be an eye-opening experience for you.

337
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,690
Is it expensive to eat here?

338
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,390
Take a seat.

339
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,870
You said you wanted to celebrate our becoming official staff.

340
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,840
I could've cooked a few dishes and celebrated at home.

341
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,653
Don't worry.

342
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,490
I've seen this in the supermarket. It costs a few thousand NT dollars!

343
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,920
This is what a celebration is about.

344
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:04,180
You know what? This wine was produced in Verona, Italy.

345
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,570
It's a "love" wine from Romeo's and Juliet's hometown.

346
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,290
*Amarone.
(*a type of Italian red wine)

347
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,840
What is this?

348
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,550
Well... *pâté foie gras?
(*a delicacy made from goose liver)

349
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,149
That's pricey too!

350
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:25,170
Why did you order these? Are you crazy?

351
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,969
Don't open it. It's expensive. Return it to them.

352
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,180
Why are you acting like this? I'm the one paying the bill.

353
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,909
However, we live together now.

354
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,739
We won't have any money left if you spend it like this.

355
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:45,220
Money is meant to be earned, not saved, okay?

356
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,780
Do you know what kind of person you are?

357
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,090
I don't even know what I am.

358
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,290
I won't get rich by saving money like you do.

359
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,579
At least I wasn't dumped by a woman when I ran out of money.

360
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,860
You have to attack personally when you don't know what to say. That's harsh.

361
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,600
Hello? Momo? Yes?

362
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,570
Now?

363
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,040
Sure. Wait for me.

364
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,200
I'll come and see you right now.

365
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm going to go and celebrate with Momo.

366

Dai Zhe-ni—... Dai—

367
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:57,070
I simply wanted you to enjoy this,

368
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,913
and have some fun.

369
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,520

372

Ho Bo-wei's grandmother, Ms. Ho-Lee Jin-hua, passed away

373
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,630
in the year of 2000 because she missed someone too much.

374
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,110
You don't have a reason to go back anymore.

375
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,570
Cheers. Congratulations. You are official staff now.

376
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,149
We're colleagues from now on.

377
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,500
Thank you.

378
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,399
Tell me. How is it going with you guys?

379
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,129
Are you having romantic nights everyday?

380
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,779
I wish we were.

381
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,279
I'm just furious right now.

382
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:47,200
What's wrong? Wasn't the manga I sent you useful?

383
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,500
We just had a fight.

384
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,579
I thought he was interested in me, like you said.

385
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:56,060
It seems that I was overthinking.

386
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,349
My sixth sense is never wrong, though.

387
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:02,530
Forget it. I'm too fragile to get hurt again.

388
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,860
Do you really like him or not?

389
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,940
I do.

390
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,469
How could I possibly fall for a man?

391
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:16,330
Dai Zhe-ni. Love doesn't care about gender. Love means love.

392
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,159
I just don't know how to let him know what I feel.

393
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,199
What way? I've got tons of ideas. I have more ideas.

394
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:27,459
For example, make some breakfast for him in the morning,

395
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,659
in heart shapes, like this...

396
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,419
Or, make the rice into a heart shape.

397
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,020
When he sees it and notices the heart shapes...

398
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,199
Are you tired? You've waited for me till this late.

399
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,839
I'm not tired. You are very busy at work.

400
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:55,780
I'm happy that we have time together like this.

401
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,070
I am too.

402
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,980
Have you eaten?

403
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,079
I went to a coffee shop with my friend after work,

404
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,580
and then I had my dinner at the food court.

405
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,110
That's great that you ate. Which friend did you go with?

406
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:33,360
It's Dai Zhe-ni, the intern at the Customer Service Department.

407
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,580
I know this guy.

408
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,349
He's brilliant.

409
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,690
It didn't take him too long to become official staff.

410
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,110
I'm so jealous.

411
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,789
Jealous of what?

412
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:48,140
You can do it too. You're better than he is.

413
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,750
Dai Zhe-ni said the same thing. He's really a special person.

414
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,349
He's quick to understand, enthusiastic and righteous.

415
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,250
He is energetic all the time.

416
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,370
It's as if he has batteries in him!

417
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,859
When I'm tired at work,

418
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:07,830
talking to him makes me feel energetic again.

419
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:13,100
Why do you have to talk about another guy? You are right beside me.

420
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,980
I... just wanted to tell you about my friend.

421
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,700
I don't care.

422
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,880
You are not allowed to mention another man in front of me.

423
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,480
You are adorable. I understand.

424
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,080
I'm hungry. Come have dinner with me.

425
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,760
Would you like to try something I like?

426
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,960
Sure.

427
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,499
Do you like it? You normally eat expensive food, though.

428
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,230
Are you okay with this?

429
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,240
It's very good.

430
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,249
I used to eat street food all the time.

431
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:07,829
Really?

432
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,280
I thought rich people didn't eat street food.

433
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,029
- I actually—
- This is free of charge, Handsome.

434
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:18,680
Nice. Thank you.

435
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,670
Managing Director, what were you saying?

436
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,500
Nothing.

437
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,990
Let's eat.

438
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,560
Well... Would you do me a favor?

439
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,729
What is it?

440
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,909
Poseidon Department Store sponsored me throughout my time at Rende Orphanage.

441
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,889
I know. I saw it in your portfolio.

442
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,120
Would you arrange a meeting with the Chairman for me?

443
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,129
I've written some letters to the chairman over the years.

444
00:35:52,129 --> 00:35:57,250
Now I'm finally working there, I would like to thank him in person.

445
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,870
Sure. The chairman will come to the office next week.

446
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,510
I'll arrange that.

447
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,380
Thank you, Managing Director.

448
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,300
Let's eat.

449
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,600
Eat some breakfast.

450
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,530
Wow. There's so much food today.

451
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,280
Well... I didn't mean to make you angry yesterday.

I just hoped that you could treat yourself better.

453
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,430
I just talk like this. Don't take it seriously.

454
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,650
My attitude was not nice either.

455
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,570
All right. Let's forget about that. Let's eat.

456
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:23,110
Have you noticed something different about breakfast today?

457
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,260
Yes, I have. The bacon is burned.

458
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,160
The egg is not fully cooked. The coffee is a bit cold.

459
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,230
Where are you going? It's too early to work.

460
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,530
I would like to eat it at the office. I can't digest well when I see you.

461
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,820
What's wrong? I was telling the truth.

462
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,270
I'm not talking to you.

Hi, Beautiful.

465
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,860
If someone suddenly makes you breakfast in heart shapes,

466
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,990
what does it mean?

467
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,539
He's showing his love for you, of course.

468
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,600
What? Were you startled because of my voice

469
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,860
or because someone showed his love to you?

470
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:25,100
- It's just a cold. Be respectful, okay?
- Sorry.

471
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,330
What? Someone just confessed his love to you.

...or we could go upstairs to eat?

485
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:08,530
He really does like you. Don't let him down.

486
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,780
Oops... I still have a husky voice because I've just woken up.

487
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:19,019
Dai Zhe-ni, because of this note you left me,

488
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:20,930
I'm going to help you.

489
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,720
I hope you can live happily here.

490
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,540
Don't be so pessimistic.

491
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,569
Turning a straight guy gay might give you a bigger sense of achievement.

492
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,540
I think that he probably doesn't like me.

493
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,660
Perhaps you should confess your love in a more straightforward way.

494
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,870
How do I do that?

495
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,800
I like you.

496
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,490
How can you go on a date during working hours?

497
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,060
Hai Yi. It's not what it seems. You misunderstand.

498
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,100
What misunderstanding? I'm a girl and I am willing to do this.

499
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,449
Why are you backing out?

500
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:04,780
Do not make it worse. Hai Yi. I'll explain.

501
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,300
Why do we need to explain to him about us?

502
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,260
Hai Yi, she—... she's scamming me!

503
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,200
It's none of my business.

504
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,300
Hai Yi...

505
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,540
It's your fault. He doesn't care about me any more even if I'm scammed.

506
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,230
It's good that he's angry. You would be doomed if he had no reaction.

507
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,030
- What should I do now?
- Nothing.

508
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,980
"It's always darkest before dawn."

509
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,660
My world is completely dark now.

510
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,560
Don't worry. The dawn of happiness will come very soon.

511
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,070
Lin Huai-en.

512
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,970
- Manager.
- Do you know about

513
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,399
the street-food-shop owner who got Covid,

514
00:41:03,399 --> 00:41:05,350
and he couldn't pay rent for a few months?

515
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,319
His lease expired and the company had to break it.

516
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,390
I do.

517
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,430
A new brand couldn't move in because of this. What's wrong?

518
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,279
That street-food-shop owner is now

519
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:18,540
protesting because the new shop has such good business. Fix it.

520
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,600
But it's not a part of my job, though.

521
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,440
The marketing team is also responsible for this.

522
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,280
You should fix it since you are a part of the marketing team.

523
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,720
Fix it now. Go and talk to the street-food-shop owner.

524
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,590
Make him leave. Do not interrupt the business.

525
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,019
If you can't handle something this small,

526
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,800
you don't deserve a job here.

527
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,930
Understood. I'll go and do it.

528
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,929
I need an explanation.

529
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,480
You forced me to leave because of them.

530
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,109
Are you all uniting against me?

531
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,620
Sir, we can help you find a new location nearby.

532
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,180
Let's talk about it. Sir—

533
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,700
- What the—
- Get out.
- Don't disrupt my business!

534
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,310
Hey! What are you doing? I'm warning you.

535
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,660
These are all my hard work here. I will stay here!

536
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,210
Who is stopping me? I'll fight you!

537
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,960
Do something, please!

538
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,400
I'll see what you'll do to me!

539
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,810
Sir, please get up. Let's talk—

540
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,619
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Sir—
- I've nothing to lose.

541
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:30,410
- Lin Huai-en. Do you need help?
- I am all in!

542
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,170
- Sir.
- Don't touch me.

543
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,610
Dai Zhe-ni—... Are you all right?

544
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,340
Shut up.

545
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:42,050
Give my shop back!
["*A turtledove occupies the magpie's nest." Give my shop back.]
(*to take someone's place by force)

546
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:46,420
Hey. You are so loud. What are you doing?

547
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,490
It's embarrassing.

548
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:52,300
Wife... Why are you here?

549
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,800
Sir, your wife is worried about you. I called her.

550
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,710
Honey, I'm sorry. I had no choice.

551
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,570
What "no choice"?

552
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,619
We wrecked our business.

553
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,329
Don't blame it on others.

554
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:11,900
Well... I haven't got my taste back since overcoming Covid-19.

555
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,260
Give me more time. I'll definitely recover.

556
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,420
Mr. Huang, we are happy to help if you need anything.

557
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,450
You know what?

558
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,860
- I'm willing to be your taster.
- Me too.

559
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,540
Did you hear that? They are good people and willing to help.

560
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,040
Get your stuff. Let's go. Don't linger here.

561
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,490
Hey...

562
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,790
Honey... You won't leave me anymore, will you?

563
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:39,100
"Leave"? You still owe me a Chanel bag and a Louis Vuitton bag.

564
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,280
Also, I haven't told you yet. I'm pregnant again.

565
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,429
Don't you dare abandon me.

566
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,860
Let's go. Don't make things difficult for Mr. Lin.

567
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,610
Sure, sure.

568
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,150
Honey. I'm so happy.

569
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,300
Let's celebrate. Let's go shopping.

570
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,760
All right. Let's go.

571
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,130
Ma'am, I'm sorry for the trouble.

572
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,940
Hey, Lin Huai-en. You are amazing.

573
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,780
Thank you.

574
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:17,009
This Dai Zhe-ni really likes meddling.

575
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,660
He has been giving me an extra workload.

576
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,060
Honey, when did you get pregnant?

577
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,139
Who's pregnant?

578
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,990
Honey? Wait for me.

579
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,334
Tell me.

580
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,409
Where is he?

581
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:39,550
I overheard Hai Yi on the phone.

582
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:42,200
I think he's meeting someone at the cinema upstairs.

583
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,566
Oh, thank you.

584
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,120
"Cinema"?

585
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,980
Who is that guy?

586
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:17,500
Who was that? Why did he leave when he saw me?

587
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,700
He's my friend.

588
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,710
Your friend? Why didn't you introduce us?

589
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,519
You're hiding something.

590
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,990
You have your girlfriend. Can't I have my own male friend?

591
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:32,540
Me and Momo are just like sis—... I mean buddies.

592
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:36,300
Buddies that hug each other? Did you hear what you were saying?

593
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,560
Momo tricked me. I swear.

594
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,009
We are really not dating.

595
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:44,599
Do you even believe your own words?

596
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,990
What can I do to make you believe me?

597
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,180
Fine.

598
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,610
Let me tell you something. The person I'm falling for is—

599
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,460
It's me.

600
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,810
Yes. It's you.

601
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,720
I'll be right there.

602
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,460
Hai Yi?

603
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,699
Hai Yi. I'm falling for you.

604
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:15,150
Hai Yi. I said...

605
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,900
I'm falling for you.
