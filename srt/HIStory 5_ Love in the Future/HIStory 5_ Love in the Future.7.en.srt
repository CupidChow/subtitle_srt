I called Dai Zhe-ni but he didn't answer.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,759
He should have phoned me back when he saw the missed call.

32
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,250
What is taking him so long?

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,049
Dai Zhe-ni , why haven't you called me back?

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,410
Are you still angry with me?

I know that you are upset with me.

I will apologize to you when I see you tonight.

Hello, Chairman. My name is Lin Huai-en. I'm from the marketing team.

45
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:52,260
May I take a few minutes of your time?

46

Yes?

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,400
Chairman, it's good to finally see you.

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,320
Ever since the first day I've worked here,

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,520
I've wanted to visit you and the late Chairman.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,159
Did you know my father?

51
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,320
I grew up in Rende Orphanage, sponsored by Poseidon Department Store.

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,380
I've always dreamed of working here,

53
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,670
so that I can repay your kindness.

that the late Chairman has passed away.

59
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,760
Sorry for your loss.

60
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,480
Thank you for your concern.

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,389
Thank you very much.

62
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,309
Without the sponsorship of Poseidon Department Store,

63
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,519
I wouldn't be the person I am.

64
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,430
You're welcome. Poseidon Department Store always cares about those in need.

65

I will continue my father's custom from now on.

I'm very happy that I got to express my gratitude in person.

Yes. Chairman, how did you know?

Anyway, if you see him, tell him that—

Dai Zhe-ni. I just bumped into the chairman.

Really? Did he ask about me?

00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:56,080
He did.

What did he ask?

83
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,509
He didn't finish the question.

84
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,270
He just said "never mind" and left.

85

It's unbelievable.

It's amazing. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

88
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,099
I didn't expect him to suddenly become the chairman of Poseidon overnight either.

89
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:19,220
You two have been roommates for a while, and you didn't know that?

90
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,280
He likes to keep things from me.

91
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,289
If I knew he would become the chairman,

92
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,640
would I have used your staff discount when I shopped?

93
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,390
That's true.

Are you guys having a fight now?

95
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,009
He's probably playing me for a fool.

96
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,530
First, he lets me live in an old Poseidon's warehouse.

97
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,869
I was so grateful that I worked my butt off for him.

98
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,790
Then he got me a job in the customer service team. Without any fuss,

99
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,970
I tried my best to cover for him everyday.

100
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,790
He must be laughing at me behind my back.

101
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,139
I don't think Chairman is that kind of person.

102
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,720
There must be a reason he's hiding his identity.

103
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,250
I'm a "reasonable" person too.

104
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,769
Why didn't he tell me the "reason" then?

105
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:03,120
Perhaps... he couldn't find a chance to tell you.

106
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,549
We used to stay together all the time, and he couldn't find a chance?

107
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,750
Calm down and think.

108
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,719
If our late Chairman hadn't passed away suddenly,

109
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,170
he would've continued to train with you in Customer Service.

110
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,979
- So?
- So... It's not that he didn't tell you.

111
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,920
He directly brought you to Poseidon Department Store.

112
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,960
Are you saying that he used actions instead of words?

113
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,730
Yes. The late Chairman passed away all of a sudden.

114
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,060
The board members haven't accepted him since he's young

115
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,330
and lacks experience.

116
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,440
So at this time, you must support him.

117
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
It sounds kind of reasonable.

118
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,599
This is the "reason."

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,550
We can't imagine what he's going through at the moment.

120
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,450
So, stop fighting with him.

121
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,230
He must need you a lot now. You must support him.

Good morning, Chairman.

139
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,390
I asked for the sale report of our Anniversary Sale,

140
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,250
how come I don't have it yet?

141

Chairman, we are still working on it.

142
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,999
How long do I have to wait for it?

143
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,457
A week? Two weeks?

144
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,390
Three days. You'll have it in three days.

145
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,700
"Three days"? Are you brushing me off?

146
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,790
Chairman, I'm always conscientious and dedicated to work.

147
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,010
Is there any misunderstanding?

148
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,000
After the Anniversary Sale, we had fewer customers and some brands stopped working with us.

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
Does it sound like a misunderstanding?

150
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,310
Regarding this, I'm working with the relevant departments on strategies.

151
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,890
I hope that Managing Director Liang can tell me your strategies,

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,250

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,699
or my loyalty to the company?

156

What do you think?

157
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,080
Our late Chairman never had doubts about me.

162
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,740
Congratulations, Zhe-ni.

163
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,820
The Chairman has just assigned you

164
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,420
to be his executive assistant.

165
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,849
Really?

166
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,690
Of course. The official appointment has been announced.

167
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,560
Yes! Hai Yi still needs me.

168
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,950
That's awesome!

169
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,159
Wait. According to what Momo taught me,

170
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,410
I can't say yes immediately.

171
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,860
Director, I'd like to stay a bit longer in the customer service team.

172
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,959
I don't want to be transferred to another department.

173
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,500
It's not just any department.

174
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,790
You'll be the executive assistant to the chairman.

175
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,410
It's a dream job.

176
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,069
Working here for Poseidon Department Store

177
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:25,809
is also a way to serve Chairman.

178
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,640
It's the same.

179
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,710
Dai Zhe-ni will be very happy when he hears the news.

180
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,680
What should I say to him first when I see him later?

181
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,079
Should I act as if nothing has happened?

182
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,110
Or...

183
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,509
Should I give him a hug?

184
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,200
That seems a bit much.

185
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,430
Come in.

186
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,569
Chairman.

187
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,210
The *HR team said Dai Zhe-ni didn't accept the job transfer.
(*human resources)

188
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,890
All right. I understand.

189
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,460
Lin Huai-en.

190
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,999
- What brings you here?
- I have to take this to your manager.

191
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,060
He's not in the office. Leave it to me. I'll pass it onto him.

192
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,350
Sure. Thanks.

193
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,349
Have you made up with Chairman?

194
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:58,600
That is troubling me.

195
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,689
What happened?

196
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,879
They say Chairman made you his executive assistant.

197
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,910
I turned it down.

198
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,109
Why?

199
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,330
We shouldn't talk about it here. Shall we go for a drink tonight?

200
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,549
I can't. I have to take my friend's shift.

201
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:13,339
I don't think so.

202
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,549
You are going on a date with Managing Director.

203
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:18,989
Of course not. Don't say that.

204
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:20,459
Never mind.

205
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,920
Someone forgets about his friend when he's in love.

206
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,659
- Managing Director Liang.
- Yes.

207
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:41,329
I know you love Japanese cuisine.

208
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:45,100
This is one of my favorite places. Try it.

209
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,949
Vice Chairman Wu, you don't have to do this.

210
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,670
Here. If you recommend it, it must be the best.

211
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,110
Good.

212
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,910
I'll treat you as one of us and just say it directly.

213
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,680
All the board members would like you to be the chairman.

214
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,780
Hai Yang just favored his own son.

215
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,510
But... it's human nature.

216
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,250
I heard that you rejected the daughter of Luquan Group.

217
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,550
Vice Chairman Wu, you certainly have your sources.

218
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,780
You made Ms. Lu very angry.

219
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,919
Why did you reject such a great opportunity?

220
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,940
Don't you want to take this chance to advance?

221
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,910
As a matter of fact,

222
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,059
I don't have to be with Lu Si-chi,

223
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,460
I can achieve what I want with my own ability.

224
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,310
All right. I love your confidence.

225
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,809
Thank you, Vice Chairman Wu.

226
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,329
But I have a plan to make it happen within a month.

227
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,060
Are you interested in hearing it?

228
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,970
I'm listening.

229
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,619
Hello. Here are your meals.

230
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,260
"*Only an outstanding talent can recognize current trends."
(*anticipate what is happening)

231
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,390
I can't wait to see Hai Yi's face

232
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,410
when you're the chairman in a month.

233
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,310
- Come on. Cheers.
- Cheers.

234
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,710
Managing Director, what are you scheming with Vice Chairman Wu?

235
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,820
He said you would be Chairman within a month. What does that mean?

236
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,740
Why are you here? Are you working here?

237
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,240
I'm just substituting for a friend tonight.

238
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,790
It's not a secret part-time job. But you...

239
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,630
How could you have no conscience at all?

240
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,149
The company situation is a bit complicated now,

241
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,039
but I can't tell you all the details.

242
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,219
Anyway, colluding with Vice Chairman Wu

243
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,220
and abandoning the Poseidon Department Store, which has trained you over the years, are so wrong.

244
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,459
Huai-en, it's really not—

245
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,190
I saw it and heard it clearly.

246
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,600
I didn't know you were this kind of person.

247
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,960
I'm sorry for letting you down.

248
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,000
This is business and there are rules.

249
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,219
Please believe me.

250
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,970
I won't hurt you no matter what I do.

251
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,340
You are hurting me if you hurt Chairman.

252
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,949
He has time to spend at the gym,

253
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,890
but he has no time to text me or call me?

254
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,150
He obviously saw me. Why didn't he say hi to me?

255
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,370
Is he ignoring me?

256
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,660
Coach, please tell that guy

257
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,439
he's too weak to use the battling ropes.

258
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,559
He's not making any waves. It's embarrassing.

259
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,889
Coach, please tell the guy with the ponytail

260
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,179
not to think that other people can't do it if he can't.

261
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:39,240
Who's embarrassing?

262
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,829
Coach, please tell the guy in the backless top that

263
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,599
it's someone else's turn to use the equipment now.

264
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,000
Coach, I'm a VVIP customer here.

265
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,320
I'm a bit in the way. You two can talk directly.

266
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,260
Huai-en, why didn't you come in?

267
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,820
I have something to say to you, and I'll go once I'm done.

268
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,769
Is it about last night?

269
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:31,070
Yes. You should try your best to assist Chairman at this time.

270
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,770
How can you side with Vice Chairman Wu?

271
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,190
It's not like I don't want to help him.

272
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,529
He's young, lacks experience and is arrogant.

273
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,790
How can I help him?

274
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:49,490
None of the board members is willing to entrust the company to him.

275
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,299
Anyway... I believe in Chairman.

276
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,200
Give him some time and he'll be a good leader.

277
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,320
I'm the reason why the company has had

278
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,650
a good performance over the last few years.

279
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,470
Everyone knows it, right?

280
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,259
I didn't expect you to be so ambitious,

281
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,620
trying to replace Chairman.

282
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,950
You really disappoint me.

283
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,520

To prepare for the aftershocks later,

I'll let you hold my hand while you sleep.

291
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,579
Your hands are sweaty.

292
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:14,590

313
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,899
The patient suffered a myocardial infarction. We couldn't save him.

314
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,499
We tried our best. I'm sorry for your loss.

315
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:46,949
Daddy, I thought you didn't want me anymore.

316
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,690
Dad... How could you just leave like this?

317
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,849
I have to leave.

318
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,809
I have to go back to take care of my grandma.

319
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,089
What if I leave one day, and you don't know how to do anything.

320
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,300
How will you survive?

321
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,779
Hi, Gorgeous.

322
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:11,780
I'm Stacy. What's your name?

323
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,880
Why are you ignoring me?

324
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,950
Are you in a bad mood?

325
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,870
It's okay. I'll drink with you.

326
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,370
What are you drinking?

327
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,190
Let us be friends. I'd like to propose a toast.

328
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,280
Sorry... I didn't mean to.

329
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,510
I didn't mean to. Let me clean it for you.

330
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,970
Pretty Girl, I can take care of it.

331
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,160
How did you know I was here?

332
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,678
Because I know you.

333
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,440
Hai Yi?

334
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,980
Hai Yi.

335
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,070
Hai Yi?

336
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,670
- Hai Yi—
- Leave me alone.

337
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,109
Why are you here? You just ruined my drinking time.

338
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,489
I don't want to fight anymore.

339
00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:40,090
Come, come home with me.

340
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,500
"Home"?

341
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,060
I don't have one.

342
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,279
My dad is gone, and you don't care about me.

343
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,330
Everyone leaves me. It's okay. I don't care.

344
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,460
It's not the first time anyway.

345
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,790
- Hai Yi.
- Don't touch me.

346
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,310
- Leave me alone.
- Hai Yi.

347
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,039
Scram. Scram...

348
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,909
I don't want your pity. Scram...

349
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,959
- Okay. I'll go.
- Scram!

350
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,859
Scram!

351
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:21,090
I'll go, but not now.

352
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,840
Go away.

353
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,939
Do you seriously want me to leave?

354
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,189
You've annoyed me so much.

355
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,729
I don't know what I want from you. Can you stop asking?

356
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,020
I see.

357
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,969
I'll resign and move out as soon as possible.

358
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,729
I'll stay away from you and never show up again.

359
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,919
That's not what I meant. Dai Zhe-ni!

360
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,490
Never mind.

361
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,479
I'll find a way to go back to my world,

362
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,060
so that you won't be annoyed anymore.

363
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,450
Dai Zhe-ni.

364
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,930
Dai Zhe-ni.

365
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:43,850
Don't go. I'm begging you.

366
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,079
You just said I was annoying.

367
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,730
I'm sorry. It's me...

368
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,530
I'm sorry.

369
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,960
I said you are annoying because you've confused me.

370
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,280
I don't know what I want from you,

371
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,390
because I like you no matter what you do.

372
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,390
Are you drunk?

373
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,530
I've never been more sober.

374
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,080
Dai Zhe-ni...

375
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,810
I don't care why you are here,

376
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,020
or what brought you here.

377
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,640
I just want to be with you.

378
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,130

You did, too?

I knew it when you mentioned stinky tofu.

I think I'll stay in the warehouse for now.

00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:05,469
Why? I have many rooms. It's more comfortable.

Why not?

412

We lived together for so long before.

no one cared about us.

I love you very much,

Of course, I do.

You were so cute when you were little, but now...

485
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,790
What? I've become a hot guy, right?

486
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,060
And you love me so much.

487
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,670
Why did you have to say it out loud?

488
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,760
Right, right, right... You've become a hot guy, okay?

489
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,500
Growing up,

490
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,670
whenever I felt lonely,

491
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:26,300
I always made a wish in front of the lucky bracelet.

492
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,660
I wished to see you again.

493
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,045
I didn't expect it would come true.

494
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,140
It's like God has taken my dad away,

495
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,910
but He sends you here to protect me.

496
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:16,260
Yes. What a magical fate.

497
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,310
But... What about my grandma?

498
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,720
Come in.

499
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,600
Hello, Executive Assistant Dai. I'm your assistant. It's my first day today.

500
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,020
Lin Huai-en!

501
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,070
I'm your assistant from today onward.

502
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,790
- I look forward to learning from you.
- Seriously?

503
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,299
I even have an assistant!

504
00:42:52,299 --> 00:42:55,480
Chairman sent me to help you.

505
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,089
See? Chairman is very nice to you.

506
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,200
He doesn't want you to be too tired.

507
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,190
We can work together from now on.

508
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,279
Yes.

509
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,310
Awesome!

510
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,420
- Hello, Executive Assistant.
- Good morning.

511
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,310
- Good morning.
- Hello, Executive Assistant.

512
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,070
All the best.

513
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,280
Hello, Executive Assistant.

514
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,130
Executive Assistant, I'll refill it for you.

515
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,659
Executive Assistant, I'll print it for you.

516
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,359
Ten copies of each document.

517
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,870
All right.

518
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,670
Are these for the chairman?

519
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:42,300
- Leave it to me.
- Really? Sure.

520
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,800
Thanks.

521
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,020
Thank you, Chairman.

522
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,240
Chairman, here's your coffee.

523
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,150
How is it? That's probably not what you like.

524
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,750
Here.

525
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,780
Drink the one I made.

526
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,540
No, it's fine.

527
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,400
Thank you, Huai-en.

528
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,980
I don't care. You have to drink this one too.

529
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,729
Lin Huai-en. Are we friends?

530
00:45:11,729 --> 00:45:13,450
Of course.

531
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:17,620
Then, you absolutely can't fantasize about Hai Yi.

532
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,980
I am trying to share your workload. Don't think too much.

533
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,310
I swear.

534
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,770
All right. I trust you.

535
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,390
I'm going to a meeting now.

536
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:36,660
Yes, Chairman.

537
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,620
Good luck, Chairman.

538
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,180
Thank you.

539
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:57,340
What the heck are they doing?

540
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:11,260
♫ The falling rain has bad intentions ♫

541
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,500
♫ Completely leaving no room ♫

542
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,650
♫ Abruptly reminding me of the past ♫

543
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,700
♫ The rain sounds are foreshadowing  ♫

544
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,790
♫ Constantly reminding ♫

545
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:30,360
♫ Describing how powerless I am ♫

546
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,290
♫ Just don’t be depressed, don’t be submissive  ♫

547
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:38,340
♫ Be courageous, but the memories fail me  ♫

548
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,650
♫ When mentioning you, I become powerless ♫

549
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,450
♫ That word and sentence, I think of it but don’t say it  ♫

550
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,620
♫ Even the input method doesn’t forget ♫

551
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:53,570
♫ How cruelly ask me to forget you? It’s you  ♫

552
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:57,520
♫ The messages are organized over and over, but still not clean ♫

553
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,840
♫ The sceneries outside are stacked into shadows ♫

554
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,980
♫ Longing becomes an illness, the senses are numbed ♫

555
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,410
♫ Engraved in memory, every single drop ♫

556
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:10,030
♫ I overestimate myself to provoke you ♫

557
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:13,270
♫ I’ve used all my efforts to love in this life ♫

558
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:19,200
♫ Please let me be a fish in my next life ♫

559
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,090
♫ Always have a seven-second memory ♫

560
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:29,980
