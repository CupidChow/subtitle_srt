Choose me! Strike me!

32
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,870
Are you crazy? Do you want to get struck by lightning?

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,260
Are you out of your mind?

34
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,100
- Go away. Leave me alone.
- Do you want to become barbeque meat?

Get away from me! Don't stop me from going back!

It's thundering. Where are you going?

- I didn't expect you to do kung fu.
- I didn't expect to do this to you.

Tell me. Why are you trying to kill yourself at my place?

Ouch! Let go of me.

It's my only chance.

I need lightning's power to travel back to my time.

Your "time"? What are you talking about?

I don't belong here.

I belong in the year 2000. I've got to find a way back.

Be careful or you might go bald.

I'll do it by myself.

I hope the rain will make you more awake.

Go and find out what happened.

Go!

I couldn't find a candle, but there are some glow sticks.

Why are you here alone? Where are your parents?

64

Take these. They glow. Hold them.

You said you came from January 1, 2000.

Did you go to City Hall Square that night?

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,930
I did. How did you know?

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,239
And then? What happened?

69
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,099
To avoid traffic, I went another route,

70
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,820

Is this some trend that I missed during the quarantine?

Are you talking about a murder-mystery game?

75
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,760
No. It's not a murder-mystery game.

But he's still on probation. He doesn't know how to handle most of the work.

Since he's on probation,

128
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,550
it's a part of the evaluation to see if he can work under pressure.

Just follow what I said. If anything happens, I'm responsible.

you do the groceries, sweep and mop the floor, and the laundry.

You are responsible for all the housework.

154
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,260
How are these "roommate rules"? They're more like "unequal treaties."

- No.

00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,319
Darn it.

158
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,310
You only know how to use money to control me!

159
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,690
I won't be staying here long anyway.

160
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,990
I'll put up with it.

161
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,719
No problem.

162
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,070
It's my pleasure to take care of Brother Hai Yi.

163
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,870
Do your best. Thank you.

164
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,620
So good.

I won't need to buy any more toothpaste for six months.

167
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,961
Hang on... I won't be staying that long anyway.

168
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,980
It's so good. May I take another one?

169
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,360
Sure. Of course.

170
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,678
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

171
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,950
Thanks.

172
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,070
This is a perfect place to visit when I'm feeling hungry.

173
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,670
Please put it here.

174

Put it here.

Turn the side with the logo around to the front.

176
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,200
Okay.

177
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,140
Yes. The logo...

You look different when you are at work. So cool.

181

Welcome to our supermarket.

182
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,250
Good job. You have a bright future.

183
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,220
I'll leave you to your work. I need to go now.

184
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,790
I'll help you pay. I can use my staff discount.

185
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,270
Really?

186
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,629
A promotional price and a staff discount! Awesome!

187
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:10,010
It feels so great to have privileges.

188
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,510
Let's go.

189
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,310
Hai Yi. I've made money today.

190
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,840
What money? What the hell have you done now?

191
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,940
The more you buy, the more you save.

192
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,710
What do you mean?

193
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,070
I only bought things at discounted prices. They were a good deal!

194
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,630
A friend of mine works at the Poseidon Department Store.

195
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,609
He paid for me using a staff discount.

196
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:42,539
I ended up saving more than NT$100 (US$3.30).

197
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,760
Such a good deal!

198
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,970
It's their business strategy.

199
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,159
Do you really think you save more by buying more?

200
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,829
Use your brain, okay?

201
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,569
Saving money is good.

202
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,670
You know nothing about making a living.

203
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,390
You are a man, but you're like a girl when you shop.

204
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,719
I was just responding to the supermarket's promotional campaign.

205
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:02,330
Why am I like a girl?

206
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,670
Okay. What are we eating for dinner?

207
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,680
Let's go out for dinner.

208
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,639
Your treat?

209
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,289
We don't have to spend a dollar.

210
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,629
At the Poseidon supermarket,

211
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,419
they offer free tasting for everything,

212
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,109
including bread, meat, meat balls,

213
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:19,940
fruit, drinks and drinking yogurt.

214
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,519
We can stuff ourselves with all the free samples.

215
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,240
Do you mean we eat free samples for dinner?

216
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,610
All freshly cooked. Free of charge.

217
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,460
That's embarrassing. I'm not going with you.

218
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,390
They'll feel embarrassed if no one tries the samples.

219
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,279
Let's go.

220
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,459
If you had worked this hard to approach Lu Si-chi,

221
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,300
the task would've already been done.

222
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,110
I'd rather stay hungry than go.

Hey... I know how I can approach Lu Si-chi now.

242
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,620
Don't tell me you're going to put on those shoes for her or flirt with her at a bar.

243
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,679
I've found some tips on the Internet.

244
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,619
If she is inexperienced, I'll show her how bustling the world is.

245
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:32,250
If she's experienced, I'll take her to a carousel.

246
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,890
I believe Lu Si-chi is the latter type.

247
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,569
Are you taking her to an amusement park?

248
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,230
That's right. She'll be able to relive her childhood dreams.

249
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,839
She'll feel hassle free. She'll feel it's romantic.

250
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:47,309
She is not that simple-minded.

251
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,910
The more complicated they are, the more they long for something simple.

252
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,199
Take my advice.

253
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,589
Disguise yourself as a rich guy and seduce her.

254
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,240
Did you just ask me to seduce your girlfriend? Are you even a man?

255
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,659
Come on.

256
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,110
Naturally, I will show up at the critical moment.

257
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,550
So you'll be the hero. I'll be a pervert.

258
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,360
You saw how strong I was, didn't you?

259
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,581
Then I'll show up in a cool way.

260
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,229
Lu Si-chi will feel grateful and be willing to talk to me.

261
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,820
I'm not doing it. I'm sacrificing too much.

262
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,029
Why is it a sacrifice? It's achieving the goal by going to any length.

263
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,399
It's totally a trap.

264
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,460
I know it's a lot to ask, but it's more likely to succeed.

265
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,750
Or tell me a better idea.

266
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,590
I'm not saying I won't do it,

267
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,260
but I need...

268
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,719
I'll pay extra money for that.

269
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,620
I'm in.

270
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,599
Money does mean everything to you.

271
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,099
It's the only thing that you'll work for.

272
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,599
I do love money, but I also have boundaries.

273
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,329
I do it because you asked me.

274
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,940
If it was someone else, I wouldn't consider it, no matter what they paid.

275
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,280
- Really?
- Believe it or not.

276

Nevertheless, before I go back to my world,

00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,559
I want to help you save face from being dumped by your girlfriend.

Before you approach Lu Si-chi, I should probably take you to a doctor first.

Sorry. I'm late, am I not?

No. I'm the one who came too early.

You invited me to the gym for our first date. What a special request.

But you have such a good shape,

I believe you've worked out a lot.

290
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,080
Luckily, I enjoy working out, too.

No problem. I've done boxing, too.

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:45,280
Should I call you Paul or JJ?

318
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,850
You tricked me!

319
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,640
No, you tricked me!

320
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,770
Hai Yi? What are you doing here?

321
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,589
Dai Zhe-ni. Are you all right?

322
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,360
I'm still alive.

323
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,780
- Hai Yi.
- Are you all right?

324
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,590
Did you hire him to do this?

325
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,580
So what?

326
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,219
I simply wanted you to be tricked too.

327
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,379
I never expected you to be this vile.

328
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,170
Now I'm sure that leaving you was a good decision.

329
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,029
Did you think that only you wanted to break up? I wanted to do it long ago.

330
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,760
Lu Si-chi, you're such a gold digger. You don't deserve me.

331
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,750
You know what? I'm the one who dumped you.

332
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,139
How dare you say that?

333
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:56,300
Talking to you is such a waste of time!

334
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,900
Are you all right?

335
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,770
Let's go.

336
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,509
Managing Director, were you looking for me?

337
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,160
Yes.

338
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,720
I got you a Japanese bento. Come and eat it.

339
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,800
I've already eaten.

340
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,830
Really?

341
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,189
I saw you in the food court.

342
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,790
It didn't look like you were eating though.

343
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,140
What should I do?

344
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,560
Nothing.

345
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,150
Excuse me. Let's continue.

346
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,320
Did you see me?

347
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,120
Yes.

348
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,620
Just eat up.

349
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,200
Okay. Thank you, Managing Director.

350
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,650
It's so good.

351
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,490
Managing Director, you should try some, too.

352
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,880
It's very good.

353
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,739
Since you like it, I'll get you some more next time.

354
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:35,570
Sure.

355
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,170
Managing Director, do you have some shoulder pain?

356
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,570
It hurts. Maybe it's because I haven't slept well lately.

357
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,720
I'll give you a massage. I was trained to do it.

358
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,160
I'm full. May I give you a massage now?

359
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,680
Sure. Thank you so much.

360
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,460
No worries.

361
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,860
Wait.

362
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,659
I composed this song when I was in high school.

363
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,480
I know.

364
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,040
I meant... It's a good song.

365
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,410
Thank you. I like it too.

366
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,290
I think the melody is relaxing.

367
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,350
Come on. Take a few deep breaths.

368
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
I really like you...

369
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,790
Your music.

370
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,120
Thank you.

371
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,120
No worries.

372
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,680
Are you all right?

373
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,650
Let me check.

374
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,420
I'm fine.

375
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,910
I'm like an unbeatable cockroach.

376
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,980
Right. You're unbeatable. You'll just be killed by your stupidity.

377
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,850
I did it for you. How can you say that?

378
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,220
You are ungrateful.

379
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,719
I asked you to seduce her, not to get punched.

380
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,520
I didn't expect her to be so unpredictable.

381
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,930
That's why I said you're stupid and you still won't admit it.

382
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,099
You have to run if you can't beat them.

383
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,600
If I hadn't shown up in time, you would probably have fractures now.

384
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,170
Yes, yes...

385
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,920
You are the hero. I'm the idiot.

386
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,810
Happy?

387
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,840
At least you know you're stupid. That means you still can be saved.

388
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,980
Over there.

389
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,480
You are already ugly enough.

390
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,549
You look even worse after that beat up. No one will like you.

391
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:51,150
I got these bruises because of you.

392
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,210
Stop being so mean.

393
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,160
Sorry. It's my first time putting medicine on someone.

394
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,060
No worries.

395
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,790
Let me show you.

396
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:24,910
♫ Driving on a sleepless raining night ♫

397
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:29,330
You have to spin it to spread it evenly.

398
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,060
♫ Just driving ♫

404

All right. It's all good now.

405
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,380
What are you doing?

406
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,070
One last step.

407
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,980
♫ You are everywhere on my mind ♫

408

♫ My heart is threatened by loneliness ♫

413
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,570
I'll go and get some ice.

♫ I tell myself to give up ♫

415
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,047
It must be very painful.

416
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,690
Why am I making him suffer?

[Ho Bo-wei]

431
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,650
There really was a guy called Ho Bo-Wei.

432
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,690
He did come from the year 2000.

433
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,069
Hey, Sam.

434
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,950
I just sent you some information about a guy called Ho Bo-wei.

435
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,799
Help me investigate him.

436
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,700
I need all the details about him. The more detail, the better.

437
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,520
Thank you.

438
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,490
It's a pleasure to finally meet up with Director Liang.

439
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,470
It's my pleasure that the daughter of Luquan Group took the initiative to invite me.

440
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,620
You are welcome, Director Liang.

441
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,300
It's great that Miss Lu wants to develop an E-commerce platform

442
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,880
with Poseidon Department Store.

443
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,640
It's a win-win situation. I surely won't miss it.

444
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,709
You just can't stop talking about work, can you?

445
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,460
Don't call me Miss Lu. Call me Si-chi.

446
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,640
I'll call you... Wun-sen?

447
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,060
Sure, no problem.

448
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,770
About our cooperation...

449
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,419
Luquan Group surely wants to work with you.

450
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,600
But I want to be a friend with you first.

451
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Of course. As long as you don't mind, we can surely be friends.

452
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,120
Liang Wun-sen, are you playing hard to get,

453
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,820
or pretending to be dumb?

454
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,290
Lu Si-chi?

455
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,200
What do you mean?

456
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,190
I'll pay you back for what you did.

457
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:17,490
Not normal friends, I meant girlfriend and boyfriend.

458
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,590
Lu Si-chi, you are such a horrible woman.

459
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,170
It's you again. Why are you always haunting me?

460
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,020
I've become so ill because of you.

461
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,090
You know what? This horrible woman is my boyfriend's sugar mommy.

462
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,160
- She forced him to break up with me.
- What are you talking about?

463
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,390
I'm not your boyfriend's sugar mommy. Are you insane?

464
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,030
She even hired people to punch me, forcing me to leave my man.

465
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,680
Look. These are the proof.

466
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,670
You know what? She's so mean.

467
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,590
Wun-sen, don't listen to him. You're crazy.

468
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,210
Don't make me sue you for slander.

469
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,549
Wun-sen, I don't even know him.

470
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,340
I don't have a boyfriend. I'm no one's sugar mommy.

471
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,249
No worries. Would you like to drink some water?

472
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:11,680
That was unacceptable. I will sue him.

473
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,650
Don't worry. I don't believe rumors easily.

474
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,080
I believe that he's a liar.

475
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,960
Great.

476
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,420
Crazy people are everywhere.

477
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,760
Wun-sen, may I ask you a question?

478
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,390
Why have you stayed single for so long?

479
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,490
Because...

480
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,490
I've been waiting for the most suitable person to show up.

Chairman. Vice chairman.

483
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,270
Managing Director Liang, thanks for the hard work. Everyone has worked hard.

484
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,220
It's my pleasure. This way, please.

485
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,300
Chairman. Director Liang has done such a good job here.

486
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,150
Nice.

487
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,960
Very good.

- Sure.

- Wun-sen.
- Yes.

490
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:23,782
How's the preparation of the anniversary sale going? Is it going well?

491
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:24,920
It's going well.

492
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,260
I'm sure we will make more sales than last year.

493
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,899
The epidemic situation is subsiding.

I've read your proposal.

496

Some promotional campaigns in there

497
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,390
will definitely get into the customers' minds.

498
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,620
Good job.

499
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,180
Thank you, Chairman.

500

All the staff have been working hard for the anniversary sale.

501
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:54,120
I also thank all departments for their cooperation.

502
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,070
You are motivated. I like it.

503
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,070
Thank you, Chairman.

504

With you taking the lead,

505
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,630
Poseidon Department Store will surely be better in sales and management. Thank you.

506
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,360
It's my pleasure.

507
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,619
With Managing Director Liang's help, we don't have to

508
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,660
worry about the Poseidon Department Store anymore.

509
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,619
That's right, Mr. Wu. I told you so.

510
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:18,050
We needed to let this talented young man take charge

511
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,410
and open up new prospects.

512
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,020
You were right.

513
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,940
Thank you, Chairmen. This way, please.

514
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,580
Although we are renovating, it hasn't affected our sales.

515
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,840
By the way, Mr. Wu, the document we just discussed, is it in your car?

516
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,630
Right. I'll go and get it.

517

- Managing Director Liang.
- Yes?

518
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:44,090
Take good care of the chairman. I'll be back as soon as possible.

519
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,900
- No problem.
- Thank you.

Come on.

521
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,230
Any news about my rebellious boy?

522
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,559
I know he's back in Taiwan. He hasn't come home yet. Didn't he contact you?

523
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:01,320
No.

524
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,209
He doesn't have any cash nor a credit card. Now he has gone missing.

525
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,779
He's a grownup. He should be able to take care of himself. Don't worry about him.

526
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:16,599
"Worry about him"? I just don't want him to get into trouble.

527
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,420
I'll try again to see if I can reach him.

528
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,000
- Wun-sen.
- Yes.

529
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,920
How long have you worked for Poseidon Department Store?

530
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:38,519
Since I left the orphanage at the age of 18. It's been 12 years.

531
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,734
- "12 years"!
- Yes.

532
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,749
You just reminded me that I haven't visited Director Liu at Rende Orphanage for a long time.

533
00:40:46,749 --> 00:40:49,570
Thank you, Chairman. I visit him whenever I have time to spare.

534
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,030
Director Liu is doing well.

535
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,060
Nice. It would've been nice if my rebellious son could've been like you.

- Brother, you can't be like this anymore.
- Like what?

539
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,189
You shouldn't play video games everyday and rely on others.

540
00:41:35,189 --> 00:41:38,280
I've learnt a lot since I got here.

541
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,050
To survive and blend in, I've learnt everything.

542
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,500
You should learn it too.

543
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,350
Learn what?

Don't forget. According to the roommate rules,

you're responsible for all the housework.

547

What if I leave one day,

You still want to leave, don't you?

I have to. I have to go back to take care of my grandma.

It would be great if you didn't go.

What did you say?

Leave me alone. You are going to leave anyway. It's none of your business.

557
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,750
Add some water to it. Wash them. Wash every single grain. Look.

558
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:44,759
Good job. Okay. After you wash them...

563

Heat up the oil. While it's heating up...

564
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,090

Paper goes there. Plastic bottle.

Before we hang the clothes, make sure you shake them out.

Put them on the hangers. That's it.

572

Perfect. Your turn.

What are you doing?

575
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,770
Brother Hai Yi, hurry up. They offer free steak samples now.

576
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:42,589
A free sample is too small. You can barely taste it.

577
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:45,410
You don't get it. It's a posh supermarket for rich people.

578
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,869
They're not stingy with free samples.

579
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:51,149
They offer exactly what they sell. Let's try everything.

580
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:53,879
It's a way to experience an upper class lifestyle.

581
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,440
Why are you so frugal?

582
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,649
I'm just making use of the resources.

583
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:03,989
Growing up, my grandma was my only family. We had to make every dollar count.

584
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:09,139
We had to make use of public resources to live a nice personal life.

585
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,239
There are Japanese Shine Muscat grapes over there. Let's go.

586
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:15,230
Free samples?

587
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,969
Just buy them if you feel like eating.

588
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,439
Sir, do you know everything is expensive in this supermarket?

589
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:25,770
One bunch of Shine Muscat grapes costs more than NT$1,000 (US$33.00).

590
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,719
It's just more than a thousand dollars. I can afford it.

591
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:32,100
Stop boasting.

592
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,220
Do you think you're the heir of Poseidon Department Store?

593
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,019
If I were the heir, I would've purchased everything in this supermarket for you.

594
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:44,939
It's a shame it can never happen. Grow up!

595
00:45:44,939 --> 00:45:47,949
Even if I was the heir, I would not do something so foolish.

596
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:50,370
Stop pretending that you are rich.

597
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:54,479
If you were rich, you wouldn't live with me in that warehouse.

598
00:45:54,479 --> 00:45:59,899
You know what? We all have to face reality.

599
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,160
I don't want to taste free samples.

600
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,740
Whatever.

601
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,690
Is it really you, Zhe-ni baby? I haven't seen you for so long! Do you miss me?

602
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,709
What the hell? Who are you? Have you got the wrong person?

603
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:41,910
Why do you pretend that you don't know me?

604
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,330
Do we know each other?

605
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:48,400
Dai Zhe-ni, don't exaggerate.

606

We are "Mo and Ni forever"! Don't you remember that?

Oh no. Is she... Dai Zhe-ni's ex-girlfriend?
