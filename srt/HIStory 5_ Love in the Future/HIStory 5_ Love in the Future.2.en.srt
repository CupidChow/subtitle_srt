244
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,610

484
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,890
After I bumped into Dai Zhe-ni yesterday,

485
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,030
I went back to the office to work overtime.

486
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,170
Right. I must have left it at the office.

487
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,300
Lin Huai-en.

488
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,970
Managing Director, why are you here?

489
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,730
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

490
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,830
Why is my phone with you?

491
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,430
You left it in the pantry room.

492
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,580
I decided to bring it to you in case you needed it urgently.

493
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,710
Wonderful. Thank you, Managing Director.

494
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,200
Thank you.

495
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,100
Let's go. I'll drive you to work.

496
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,500
Okay.

497
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,890
Seat belt.

498
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,360
Be gentle.

499
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,730
Thank you.

500
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,630
It's only been a few minutes, and you've already thanked me a few times.

501
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,510
Is this still working?

502
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,810
♫ Please don’t appear in my dream ♫

503
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,910
♫ I just want to think that you’ve never come ♫

504
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,110
♫ You have been torturing me in my mind ♫

505
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,070
♫ Make me impulsive and make me fall ♫

506
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,170
♫ If I understand I shouldn’t have all these ♫

507
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,050
♫ I shouldn’t have held your hand ♫

508
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,160
♫ Like the breeze blowing lightly ♫

509
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,480
♫ From now on, all the pain and love don’t remain ♫

510
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,370
♫ If you are just a passerby, tell me first ♫

511
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,340
♫ Don’t make me wait with expectation ♫

512
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,020
♫ Love is a struggle, I am getting puzzled and puzzled ♫

513
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,000
♫ My emotion is out of control, like the withered flower ♫

514
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,740
♫ The falling leaves, are they lonely too? ♫

515
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,740
♫ They are on the ground for so long and no one picks them up ♫

516
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,400
Hi. We finally meet in person,

517
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,760
CEO.

518
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,780
I don't think I've ever allowed you to stare at me unscrupulously like that.

519
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,433
Why are you out here?

520
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,520
It's because quarantine is over, of course. Bring my luggage in.

521
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,550
How is it going? Have you got used to your new job?

522
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:07,390
I have. My colleagues are nice to me now.

523
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,530
Really?

524
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,110
Yes.

525
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,630
I see. If you encounter anything you don't know how to reject, just message me.

526
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,250
Sure. Thank you, Managing Director.

527
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,870
Did I just thank you again?

528
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,290
Have you eaten?

529
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:32,040
Not yet. I was desperate to find my phone and left the house right away.

530
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,720
I knew it. Remember to grab something to eat later.

531
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:45,460
Managing Director. Would you drop me off in front of that convenience store?

532
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,280
Why? Do you need to buy something?

533
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,970
Not really. I would like to get out of the car earlier

534
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:55,390
in case my colleagues see me and cause you trouble.

535
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,260
All right.

536
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,419
See you at the office.

537
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,360
See you. Thank you, Managing Director.

538
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,930
He's way too cute!

539
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:06,100
It's late. Why are you still here? Are you going to sleep on the couch with me?

540
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,020
What? Can I not?

541
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,570
Of course, you can. This warehouse belongs to your friend.

542
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:14,180
Don't you need to go home?

543
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,900
No. No one expects me to go home anyway.

544
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:23,540
Why do you have so many questions? Should I give you a report?

545
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:28,590
No. You're my boss. You can do whatever you like.

546
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,590
What's that smell?

547
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,740
Stinky tofu? Is it smelly? I'll go and shower then.

548
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,420
It's all right.

549
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,660
What's your plan about Lu Si-chi?

550
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,050
You are not in quarantine anymore. Just go and see her in person.

551
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,579
I can't.

552
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,460
Why not?

553
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,560
It's none of your business. Just do it for me.

554
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,680
I was very confident indeed.

555
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,080
After I talked to her a few times, I realized that she's totally unapproachable

556
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,000
unless you have a rich-family background.

557
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:24,490
Pretend that you are this rich guy and try to talk to her.

558
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:28,260
Is he famous enough? What do I need to wear?

559
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:35,600
Nice outfit! I'm going to try this on.

560
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,230
Stop staring at me. Turn around.

561
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:51,390
I was not looking at you. I was looking at the outfit.

562
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,700
All right.

563
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,220
What do you think? Is it nice?

564
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,810
It's thundering!

565
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:21,280
♫ The falling rain has bad intentions ♫

566
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,470
♫ Completely leaving no room ♫

567
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:28,700
♫ Abruptly reminding me of the past ♫

568
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,660
♫ The rain sounds are foreshadowing  ♫

569
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,830
♫ Constantly reminding ♫

570
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:40,350
♫ Describing how powerless I am ♫

571
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:44,320
♫ Just don’t be depressed, don’t be submissive  ♫

572
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,430
♫ Be courageous, but the memories fail me  ♫

573
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,700
♫ When mentioning you, I become powerless ♫

574
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,770
♫ That word and sentence, I think of it but don’t say it  ♫

575
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:57,620
♫ Even the input method doesn’t forget ♫

576
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:03,610
♫ How cruelly ask me to forget you? It’s you  ♫

577
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:07,620
♫ The messages are organized over and over, but still not clean ♫

578
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,900
♫ The sceneries outside are stacked into shadows ♫

579
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,020
♫ Longing becomes an illness, the senses are numbed ♫

580
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,430
♫ Engraved in memory, every single drop ♫

581
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,080
♫ I overestimate myself to provoke you ♫

582
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,310
♫ I’ve used all my efforts to love in this life ♫

583
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:29,230
♫ Please let me be a fish in my next life ♫

584
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:35,500
♫ Always have a seven-second memory ♫

585
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:40,230
