00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,049
Are you a couple now?

162
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,989
You're the one who loves someone else,

163
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,069
don't act like you are the victim.

164
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,469
That's so pretentious.

165
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,879
I've never changed my feelings toward Managing Director,

166
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,529
and I'll never change my mind.

167
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:01,060
It's just that it's more important to protect Chairman now.

168
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,369
- I'm going home now.
- How can you leave right after you hit me?

169
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,950
Are you okay?

170
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,519
You're awake. I'm very good.

171
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,009
I just sanitized the whole place.

172
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:07,439
I'm making some porridge for you.

173
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,690
No. I don't feel like eating. Don't cook.

174
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,970
You have to take medicine.

175
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,759
Then I want you to feed me.

176
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,469
I want to feed you too.

177
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,850
How about you open the door and let me in?

178
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,280
We have to follow the epidemic's restrictions.

179
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,179
You are so close to me. I can see you but I can't touch you.

180
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,690
It's tough for me too.

181
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,180
All right. Get some rest.

182
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,490
I'll let you know when the porridge is ready.

183
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,649
Managing Director. Do you need anything?

184
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,339
I need to talk to Chairman.

185
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,669
Chairman is ill. He didn't come to work today.

186
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,570
Would you like to leave a message?

187
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,219
Is Chairman all right? Did he go and see a doctor?

188
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,209
He's fine. I'm sure he'll get well soon.

189
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:23,760
Please don't worry about him.

190
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,770
Huai-en...

191
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,010
I understand what you are feeling right now.

192
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,480
But things are not what they seem.

193
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,180
What about you and Tony?

194
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,360
You're not answering, so your silence implies consent.

195
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,250
Such a big pot of porridge.

196
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,149
Yes. All yours.

197
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:15,330
I don't want to eat after seeing this.

198
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,479
Don't act like a spoiled boy.

199
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,529
I specially found the recipe online.

200
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:22,459
They said it's good for the immune system.

201
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,829
Make sure you eat it all.

202
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,449
You should at least give me a bowl.

203
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,230
Should I get you *a bunch of flowers and three incense sticks?
(*offerings to the deceased)

204
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,480
No.

205
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,550
I asked Managing Director about him and Manager (Tony).

206
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,560
He did not deny it.

207
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,000
How could Managing Director do this to me?

208
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,980
How could he do this to me?

209
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,510
Why?

210
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,580
Why? Why! Why!

211
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,650
Why is Managing Director like this?

212
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,130
Hello? Aunt.

213
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,709
How are you? Are you feeling better?

214
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,659
I'm feeling much better. Don't worry about me.

215
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,789
How can I not worry? You live alone. No one takes care of you.

216
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:33,100
I'm not alone. Dai Zhe-ni has been here taking care of me.

217
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,360
Dai Zhe-ni? That cute executive assistant?

218
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,089
Although he's young, he's good at taking care of people.

219
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:47,199
He could get Covid, too. Why is he willing to do that?

220
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,520
There must be something between you two, right?

221
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,829
Well... We are just friends.

222
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,089
How can you just ask a friend to take care of you like that?

223
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,999
I'll come and take care of you.

224
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,539
No worries, Aunt. I'm fully recovered.

225
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,879
You have such a busy schedule every day.

226
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,729
Just let Dai Zhe-ni take care of me.

227
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:10,980
What do you like about him?

228
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,749
He... He's humorous,

229
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:19,009
kind and considerate, energetic,

230
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:24,010
and he has this unyielding energy.

231
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,289
Aunt, why are you laughing?

232
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,820
What I meant was, what do you like about how

233
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,890
he takes care of you that keeps you complimenting him?

234
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,940
He makes good porridge.

235
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,660
Oh... you've become a porridge person?

236
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,800
I mean...

237
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,920
I rarely hear you say anything good about others.

238
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,270
Well, because he...

239
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,340
He was raised up by his grandmother,

240
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,020
which makes him very capable.

241
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,440
From what you've said, he seems to have had a tough childhood.

242
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,280
Also if he can take care of you that well, he must be good.

243
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,210
I hope he can continue working for you.

244
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,619
All right. It's good to know someone is looking after you.

245
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,019
Get some rest.

246
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,659
Thank you, Aunt.

247
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,190
Bye.

248
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,180
Goodbye.

249
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,600
I also hope he can continue working for me.

250
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,570
I just don't know if he wants to go back to his world, though.

251
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,270
Hai Yi.

252
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,090
Hai Yi?

253
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,800
Hai Yi.

254
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,840
Hai Yi. Wake up. I'm here.

255
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,869
It's fine. I'm right here. It's fine.

256
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,320
I'm right here.

257
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,470
Did you have a nightmare?

258
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,900
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

259
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,969
Don't stay so close to me.

260
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,869
Don't worry. It's past midnight. No more quarantine.

261
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:33,609
I'm also wearing a mask. Don't worry.

262
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,600
No. Go outside. Outside.

263
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,540
Did you have a dream about me leaving you?

264
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,430
In my dream, my dad ignored me and you abandoned me.

265
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,710
I won't abandon you.

266
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,080
Not now.

267
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,380
You've never mentioned your dad. What was he like?

268
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,770
He was a workaholic.

269
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,499
From my earliest memory,

270
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,530
he has worked and has never had time for me.

271
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,590
I never understood him before.

272
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,910
We always ended a conversation with a fight.

273
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,200
My parents passed away when I was very little.

274
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,990
I don't even know how to get along with a father.

275
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,970
I've heard that a lot of father-son relationships are like that.

276
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,150
When I think about it now,

277
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,980
I realize that I never tried to understand him.

278
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,790
I missed so many opportunities to get along with him.

279
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,630
I feel regretful.

280
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,270
Life is like this, full of regrets.

281
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,670
I was very close to my grandma, Jin-hua.

282
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,720
We talked about everything.

283
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,299
But I don't know if I'll ever see her again.

284
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:15,269
- Your grandma...
- It's all right.

285
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:17,930
Actually, she has passed away.

286
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,010
I believe she's having a good life in another time and space.

287
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,840
At least... there's no terrifying epidemic.

288
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,119
The epidemic has changed everything.

289
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,080
Yes. It is on and off.

290
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,110
It seems as though it's luxurious to live a normal life.

291
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,770
So we should cherish every second we have.

292
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,289
I heard the imported-watch brand on the third floor also left.

293
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,249
After the epidemic, people barely go out.

294
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,269
Many shops are struggling to survive.

295
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:25,099
How can we reach the performance target like this?

296
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,349
Don't worry. We will figure this out.

297
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,599
I'm worried that by the time we figure it out, one month will be up.

298
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,939
Fresh and delicious.

299
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,319
Traditional cotton candy. Buy two get one free.

300
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,019
I'd like to have a pink one.

301
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,349
I have an idea.

302
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:42,379
What is it?

303
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,229
I'll do some more research and prepare a proposal before I tell you.

304
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,250
It has to be better than Managing Director's strategy.

305
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,489
I'm not sure about that,

306
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,800
but I'm sure no one else can come up with such an idea besides me.

307
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,919
Did you go to the reunion party last year?

308
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,020
I didn't. I was busy.

309
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,959
I haven't gone for the last few years either.

310
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,959
I've been too busy at work.

311
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,330
- It's hard to make time—
- Director Liang.

312
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,709
Here you are.

313
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,129
He's our marketing manager, Tony.

314
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:13,829
Director Yeh. Nice to meet you.

315
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,210
- Hello.
- Take a seat.

316
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,169
Mr. Yeh is such a busy man.

317
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,980
I've been asking him out for a long time.

318
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,160
He finally has time to talk to me now.

319
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,119
I'm sorry. I've been busy working on the new branches.

320
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,579
I heard that. I haven't congratulated you.

321
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,399
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

322
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,529
Thank you.

323
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,819
Our company has been focusing on same-sex marriage recently,

324
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:37,039
it's been quite successful. We got lucky.

325
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,309
We want to promote our new branches during this cooperation with Poseidon Department Store.

326
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,229
I'm working on a new project called "Happy Family."

327
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,239
It will definitely be a win-win situation for us.

328
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,389
Yes. Director Yeh.

329
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,679
Our Director Liang has reserved the atrium on the first floor

330
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,719
for your wedding-consultation event.

331
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,279
Normally this kind of location is very expensive.

332
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,270
Thank you, my former classmate.

333
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,840
We are close friends. You don't have to say that.

334
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,780
Lin Huai-en? What are you doing here?

335
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,350
If I weren't here,

336
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,980
I wouldn't have learned how you'll steal Chairman's sales.

337
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,000
We are doing business individually.

338
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,689
What's wrong with that?

339
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:22,469
Nothing is wrong with that.

340
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,369
However, Chairman is ill now. It's not fair.

341
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,639
Lin Huai-en, you don't know the whole story.

342
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,309
You should go now.

343
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:31,709
You guys are so mean.

344
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,890
Do you really have to kick Chairman out of Poseidon Department Store?

345
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,075
Now is not the time to discuss this with you.

346
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,429
Poseidon Department Store is my savior. I have to support Chairman.

347
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:44,020
Lin Huai-en! Please go.

348
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,550
I'm sorry, Director Liang and Director Yeh. Please continue.

349
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:04,820
Is he "the kid" that you mentioned?

350
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,880
Yes.

351
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,300
I'm sorry about that. It's so embarrassing.

352
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,089
He's too young to know. Forgive him.

353
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,479
But you should fix any misunderstandings quickly,

354
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,540
before it's too late.

355
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,609
Lin Huai-en, I heard about what happened at the cafe.

356
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,559
You are too bold!

357
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,859
But I have to stop him, otherwise I will feel bad.

358
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,129
It's not right to humiliate Managing Director in public.

359
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,339
I'm Chairman's assistant.

360
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,579
How could I let him betray Chairman right in front of me?

361
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,750
I understand how you feel, but it's just a job.

362
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,600
If this destroys your relationship with Managing Director,

363
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,920
you might jeopardize your true love forever.

364
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:58,130
Would that be worth it?

365
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,209
It's not about if it's "worth it."

366
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,340
What's the problem?

367
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,299
A relationship and work are two different things.

368
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:11,760
I can't tolerate his behavior just because we have a relationship.

369
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,780
Do you remember what you told me

370
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,100
when I had a fight with Hai Yi?

371
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,700
You told me to believe in him and support him.

372
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,829
You should also believe in him and stand in his shoes.

373
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:39,170
Should I still support him if he betrays Chairman and the company?

374
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,359
He has already betrayed our relationship anyway.

375
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,060
What do you mean?

376
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,669
Anyway, Chairman is very important to me.

377
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,890
I won't change my mind.

378
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,420
I'll feel more at ease if I move in with Hai Yi.

379
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,490
I don't want to be defeated by Lin Huai-en.

380
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,499
Dai Zhe-ni. What are you doing?

381
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,590
I'm moving in. Isn't it obvious?

382
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:29,870
You refused to move in earlier. Why now?

383
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,320
There is a mouse in the warehouse.

384
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,249
Mickey mouse?

385
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:41,700
Forget it. It seems like you don't want me to move in.

386
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,900
Who said that?

387
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,510
Well... Does that mean you don't mind if people gossip about us now?

388
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,899
I came around.

389
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,919
You live in a luxurious flat.

390
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,619
I should come and enjoy it too.

391
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,189
You have so many rooms. We should not waste them by keeping them empty.

392
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,559
Besides, if I move in,

393
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,979
we can discuss new projects anytime.

394
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,000
I think so too.

395
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,599
Well... The room next to the kitchen suits you.

396
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,250
- You can stay there.
- Really?

397
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,850
Hai Yi! It's a washroom!

398
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,390
Ms. Hai, I'm sorry.

399
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,769
I came to see you right after I got your call.

400
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:43,629
I'm sorry I'm late.

401
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,729
No worries. I called you all of a sudden.

402
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,259
I hope I didn't interrupt your work.

403
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:51,320
Of course not. I'm a director.

404
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,589
I can always pass the work onto the staff, right?

405
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:56,389
Right? Little Sister Hai Yin.

406
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,580
Do you mind if I call you by your name?

407
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,540
Little Sister?

408
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,400
Do you know how old I am?

409
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,099
How can you say that?

410
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,260
In terms of your skin and your look,

411
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,330
how you dress and your temperament,

412
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,600
you are definitely a little sister.

413
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,429
I have a question for you.

414
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,569
Are Hai Yi and Dai Zhe-ni very close?

415
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:30,349
They're very close.

416
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,940
They are always together.

417
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,429
They live and work together.

418
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,599
Does Dai Zhe-ni have a girlfriend?

419
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,680
I have no idea.

420
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,389
Little Sister Hai Yin, is anything wrong?

421
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,000
Nothing. I'm just curious about Hai Yi's friends.

422
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,470
You mean Dai Zhe-ni, right?

423
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:58,680
Don't worry. He can get cheeky with people sometimes.

424
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,289
However, he's diligent and kind-hearted.

425
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,459
He's truly loyal to our Chairman.

426
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,730
He has always been there for him.

427
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,620
[Poseidon Department Store]

428
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,089
Now is not the time to discuss this with you.

429
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,489
Poseidon Department Store is my savior. I have to support Chairman.

430
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,630
Lin Huai-en! Please go.

431
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,000
Lin Huai-en.

432
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,219
Today is my birthday.

433
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:48,060
I would like to invite you to dinner at my place tonight, okay?

434
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,310
Are you awake? Did you sleep well?

435
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,180
Your mattress was so comfortable.

436
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,439
Did you order takeaway?

437
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:14,790
Come on. I made these, okay?

438
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,930
You?

439
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,429
I've studied abroad alone since I was little. I know how to fend for myself.

440
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:27,199
I can do all the housework and cuisines.

441
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,339
You acted like you couldn't do those before.

442
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,699
I even signed an unfair treaty with you.

443
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,989
You are such a liar.

444
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,189
Okay, okay.

445
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,580
That's because I enjoyed the way you took care of me.

446
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,320
All right? Don't be angry.

447
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,890
Is it good?

448
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,679
What time did you wake up to make these?

449
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,239
Though you tested negative now, there could be post-Covid conditions.

450
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,220
Don't make yourself too tired.

451
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,180
Don't worry.

452
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,489
I don't have a headache and sore throat.

453
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,969
I'm fully recovered.

454
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:15,360
If you are fully recovered, can we kiss now?

455
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,650
Eat up first.

456
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,150
I made your favorite dishes.

457
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,010
Let's kiss first.

458
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,730
Let me show you a proper kiss.

459
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,170
Don't be scared.

460
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,790
I...

461
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,420
It's my first time.

462
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,960
It's also my first time...

463
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,540
with a man.

464
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,800
I've got so many documents to sign.

465
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,130
I'm going back to my room now.

466
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,450
Come in.

467
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,530
Managing Director, I wasn't sure what to get you.

468
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,429
I don't think you need anything.

469
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,640
I got you a cake. Happy birthday.

470
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,040
Thank you.

471
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,690
It's the best gift to have you here.

472
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,010
Come in and take a seat.

473
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,360
You must be hungry. I made some dinner.

474
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,890
Where's the manager?

475
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,800
I thought you would invite him too.

476
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,000
Do you mean Tony? I didn't invite him.

477
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,960
I don't think this is right.

478
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,170
I should leave now.

479
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,110
Huai-en, don't go.

480
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,910
I'm sorry I yelled at you that day.

481
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,210
Can you stop being angry at me?

482
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,960
Actually...

483
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,210
I'm sorry too.

484
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,000
Stay with me.

485
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,470
It's my birthday wish.

486
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,530
I'll just treat this as our last beautiful memory

487
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,480
before we break up.

488
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,530
I'll give you a toast first. Happy birthday.

489
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,570
Thank you.

490
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,840
I'll give you a toast again.

491
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,450
Thank you for constantly taking care of me.

492
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,740
Drink slowly.

493
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,480
No.

494
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,050
The third drink... is to us.

495
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,430
Do you want to make a birthday wish?

496
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,170
If I tell you my wish, will you make it happen?

497
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,160
♫  I just want to be more than friends ♫

498
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,270
♫ Why are we holding back? ♫

499
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,890
♫ It’s not just a little bit ♫

500
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:45,830
♫ I just want to be your boyfriend ♫

501
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:50,940
♫ Give love a starting point ♫

502
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,760
♫ This one-foot distance is a big adventure ♫

503
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,060
♫ Day by day, I suddenly discover ♫

504
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:06,220
♫ That strong but invisible line ♫

505
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,440
♫ Lost in time ♫

506
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,790
♫ Foolishly unclear, pretends to be cool and loves to be jealous ♫

507
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:19,750
♫ Then I discover the unbelievable change ♫

508
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:26,110
♫ I like to have you by my side ♫

509
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:32,090
♫  I just want to be more than friends ♫

510
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,620
♫ Why are we holding back? ♫

511
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,580
Can you not betray Chairman?

512
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,640
Today is my birthday.

513
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,580
Don't mention another man.

514
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:50,910
♫ Give love a starting point ♫

515
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:57,680
♫ This one-foot distance is a big adventure ♫

516
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,090
♫  Maybe I’m just thinking too much  ♫

517
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:06,500
♫  You don’t even have room for me in your heart  ♫

518
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:14,120
♫  But I am still willingly obsessed with you ♫

519
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:20,180
♫  I just want to be more than friends ♫

520
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:25,350
♫ Why are we holding back? ♫

521
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,870
♫ It’s not just a little bit ♫

522
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:33,840
♫ I just want to be your boyfriend ♫

523
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,940
♫ Give love a starting point ♫

524
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:45,730
♫ This one-foot distance is a big adventure ♫

525
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,730
I'm so angry with Managing Director for betraying Chairman.

526
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,500
How could Tony fix his necktie for him?

527
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,040
But... during his birthday,

528
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,790
we again...

529
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,550
You again...

530
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,420
Nothing.

531
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,580
You should just go to him,

532
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,450
and confront him with everything.

533
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,250
Stop dwelling on it yourself.

534
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,410
All right. I'll think about it.

535
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,220
I have to go now.

536
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,040
Hang on. I have a question.

537
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,200
What?

538
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,330
What base have you and Managing Director...

539
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,570
reached?

540
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:46,400
What do you mean? Baseball?

541
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,590
No. I'm saying...

542
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,690
have you guys...

543
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,490
What? Dai Zhe-ni!

544
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:57,239
How can you ask like that?

545
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,959
Why did you even ask?

546
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,560
I'm really curious.

547
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,950
- Tell me!
- What?

548
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,449
- You must have done it.
- No!

549
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:10,400
You did. Your expression just now was so obvious!

550
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,710
Transferring to voicemail.

551
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,460
Fees apply after the beep.

552
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,500
Please hang up if you don't want to leave a message.

553
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,329
Lin Huai-en.

554
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:18,380
HR just told me that Managing Director took some extended leave today.

555
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,660
For how long? Did he say why?

556
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,940
Now is a sensitive time for him to be taking leave.

557
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,950
Everyone in the company is talking about it.

558
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:33,760
People said Vice Chairman Wu is supporting him.

559
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,390
He may be the new chairman soon.

560
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,289
It's just a rumor.

561
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,009
I don't believe it either,

562
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,680
but everyone is talking about it now.

563
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:54,110
Transferring to voicemail—

564
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:11,190
♫ The falling rain has bad intentions ♫

565
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,450
♫ Completely leaving no room ♫

566
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,670
♫ Abruptly reminding me of the past ♫

567
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,620
♫ The rain sounds are foreshadowing  ♫

568
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,820
♫ Constantly reminding ♫

569
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:30,330
♫ Describing how powerless I am ♫

570
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:34,290
♫ Just don’t be depressed, don’t be submissive ♫

571
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:38,420
♫ Be courageous, but the memories fail me ♫

572
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,640
♫ When mentioning you, I become powerless ♫

573
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,830
♫ That word and sentence, I think of it but don’t say it ♫

574
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,670
♫ Even the input method doesn’t forget ♫

575
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:53,620
♫ How cruelly ask me to forget you? It’s you ♫

576
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,570
♫ The messages are organized over and over, but still not clean ♫

577
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,870
♫ The sceneries outside are stacked into shadows ♫

578
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,980
♫ Longing becomes an illness, the senses are numbed ♫

579
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,340
♫ Engraved in memory, every single drop ♫

580
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,020
♫ I overestimate myself to provoke you ♫

581
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,260
♫ I’ve used all my efforts to love in this life ♫

582
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:19,140
♫ Please let me be a fish in my next life ♫

583
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:25,170
♫ Always have a seven-second memory ♫

584
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:30,010
