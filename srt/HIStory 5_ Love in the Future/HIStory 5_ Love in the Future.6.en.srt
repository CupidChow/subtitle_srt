Sorry to wake you.

It's all right.

I don't think I can make it happen.

Some other people will join us.

That really is Hai Yi.

Board members, thank you for being here despite your busy schedules.

190
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,100
My older brother has just passed away. It's been hard for us.

191
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,220
However, we need someone to lead Poseidon Department Store.

192
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,239
Today, I'm going to make an announcement.

193
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:08,290
His son will inherit the business.

194
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,729
Hai Yi will be the next chairman,

195
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,119
and lead the Poseidon Department Store.

196
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,710
Hai Yi has never been involved in our company's business.

197
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,420
It will severely stress him if he suddenly

198
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,440
becomes the chairman right now.

199
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,729
He's just a kid who knows nothing about the business.

200
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,860
Are you joking?

201
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,170
I heard that Mr. Hai has been abroad for a long time,

202
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,520
just spending money and enjoying life.

203
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:36,000
Are you sure he knows how to run a company?

204
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,589
Vice Chairman Wu, do you have a better candidate in mind?

205
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,800
Of course I do. Managing Director Liang is very experienced.

206
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,510
He helped Chairman run the company for years. To me,

207
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,490
he's the best candidate for this job.

208
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,759
Good idea.

209
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,180
Yes. The board can only be at ease

210
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,940
if the Poseidon Department Store is run by Managing Director Liang.

211

Board Members, thank you for the opportunity.

212

I'm afraid I can't take this job.

213
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,409
I think the most important thing to do now

214
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,650
is to help Hai Yi make arrangements for the funeral.

215
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,000
Poseidon Department Store was everything for Hai Yang.

216
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,989
He will only rest in peace

217
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,140

In the will, it clearly states that if anything happens to him,

221
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:39,930
Hai Yi will be the next chairman of Poseidon Department Store.

222
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,600
So Chairman has made the arrangements already.

223
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,600

227
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:10,039
and follow in my father's footsteps.

00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:14,310
I will lead the Poseidon Department Store to a prosperous future.

229
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,230
As you all know,

230
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,750
besides Poseidon Department Store being everything to Hai Yang,

231
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,099
it has also been everything to me.

232
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:32,920
Emotionally, of course I'd like to respect Chairman's last will.

233
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,710
Rationally, however,

234
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,620
choosing the next chairman is not a joke.

235
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,150
I have an idea.

236
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,130
I suggest that Hai Yi

237
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,960
be the interim chairman for the next three months.

238
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,959
Meanwhile, he should compete with Managing Director Liang.

239
00:23:55,959 --> 00:24:01,130
The one with the better performance gets to be the next chairman.

240
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,320
Hai Yi, will you dare to take the challenge?

241
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,360
Yes. Good idea. I agree.

242
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,259
It's reasonable. I agree too.

00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,720
He tried so hard to establish Poseidon Department Store,

328
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,350
and to make it successful,

329
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,310
because he wanted to do something for your mother

330
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,110
and pass the family business to you.

331
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,590
In the end, this made him a failed father.

332
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,380
He really did love you.

333
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,560
Know that.

334
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,850
Aunt...

335
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,340
I'm so angry.

336
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,750
I'm so angry at myself. Why did I always go against him?

337
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,240
If I had known I would never see him again...

338
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,280
I miss him so much.

339
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,680
Let it all out. You'll feel better.

340
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,210
Aunt...

341
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,170
Thank you for telling me everything.

342
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:17,700
I will do my best to fulfill his last wishes

343
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,880
and protect the Poseidon Department Store.

344
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,260
Great.

345
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,120
That cunning man Wu Chang-shan is treating you like this.

346
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,099
The most important thing now is to stabilize the company.

347
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,920
Stay focused.

348
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,149
Your dad will surely look after you from Heaven,

349
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,880
just like he did before, and silently protect you.

350
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,119
You can do it.

351
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,934
Thank you, Aunt.

352
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,510
What do you mean?

353
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,119
Someone protested at the food court.

354
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,469
You said you would punish those who didn't do their jobs.

355
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:09,170
I would like to take responsibility and resign.

356
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,389
You've worked here for a while, and you've worked hard.

357
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:16,719
It's just a small incident, yet you would like to quit.

358
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,489
This is not your style.

359
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:20,060
I—

360
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,240
I made a big mistake.

361
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,320
I don't think I should work here anymore.

362
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,620
Are you talking about always setting up Lin Huai-en?

363
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,730
You haven't given me a good explanation about that.

364
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,340
Why are you always targeting him?

365
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,219
Answer me.

366
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:47,400
I—... I'm jealous of him.

367
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,050
That's why I wanted to teach him a lesson.

368
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,500
Lin Huai-en is new to the company.

369
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,900
There's no conflict of interest between you two.

370
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,390
Why are you jealous of him?

371
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,080
Because I like you.

372
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,100
I've liked you since the first time I saw you.

373
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,680
I've kept it to myself over the years,

374
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,790
and hoped that you would love me back someday.

375
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,020
After Lin Huai-en came into the picture,

376
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:22,529
I couldn't take it anymore because you're so nice to him.

377
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:24,810
Who is he?

378
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,280
Tony...

379
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,900
Love is always inexplicable.

380
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,410
I appreciate that you like me,

381
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,804
but I can't do anything about it,

382
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,270
because I'm already in love with Lin Huai-en.

383
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,370
I can't have anyone else other than him.

384
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,549
I see.

385
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,190
Please accept my resignation.

386
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,830
This is what I can do for Lin Huai-en.

387
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,910
You—

388
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,819
There are some changes within the company.

389
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,540
I need someone to fight with me.

390
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,060
Your performance has always been outstanding,

391
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,040
and I trust you very much.

392
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,770
I really hope that you can stay.

393
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,810
Although we won't be lovers,

394
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:44,380
I hope we can be work partners from now on.

395
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,460
Are you willing?

396
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,250
I'm willing. Thank you Managing Director.

397
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,910
I'll definitely work harder.

398
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,080
Sir—... Wait.

399
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,320
Sir, you can't come in without an appointment. Sir.

400
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,170
It's okay. You can go back to work.

401
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,900
Hai Yi, why did you lie to me

402
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,490
and hide your true identity?

403
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,570
How have I lied to you?

404
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,550
You've never asked me.

405
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,740
No? You could've told me yourself.

406
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,740
We've lived together for a while.

407
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,979
I didn't even know who you were until someone told me.

408
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,820
You are my friend because of who I am,

409
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,820
and not my family background, right?

410
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,510
Of course! I did want to earn money from you at the start,

411
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:41,490
but later I truly—... wanted to be your friend.

412
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,970
Then what's the problem?

413
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,419
I even told you I time-traveled,

414
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,019
but you still don't believe me.

415
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:50,600
It's not like that.

416
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,020
I just think you don't need the details

417
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,400
because you might leave anytime.

418
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,370
So...

419
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:05,430
Am I just a passerby in your life?

420
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,202
I can't control your thoughts.

421
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,260
Everyone has secrets in this world.

422
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,920
I haven't done anything wrong to you.

423
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,610
Fine.

424
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,070
From now on, we are no longer friends.

425
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:35,550
Why can't you understand my situation now?

426
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,270
Chairman, here is an urgent document.

427
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,920
Is he coming for me? Is he here?

428
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,000
Darn it, Hai Yi.

429
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,630
He hasn't come for me at all.

430
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,990
What should I do?

431
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:21,350
I can't just go back to him and cry like a girl.

432
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,640
Dai Zhe-ni, you are so stupid!

433
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,750
Why were you so impulsive?

434
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,270
You even said, "We are no longer friends!"

435
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,080
Hello, Sam. I saw them.

436
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,700
Okay.

437
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,740
What should I do?

438
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,310
I even blocked my last way out.

439
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,640
Don't rush it. It's not that bad.

440
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,090
Are you sure? When I think about Hai Yi and I being strangers from now on,

441
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,190
I'm heartbroken.

442
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:40,360
You just have to explain your misunderstanding, talk to each other nicely and you'll be fine.

443
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,140
But he's not even looking for me.

444
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,580
Or should I go to him first? Make it less awkward for him?

445
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,840
No. You must endure it.

446
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,340
He chose to hide it. For a thing this big, you shouldn't give in.

447
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,429
He should come and explain and apologize to you first.

448
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,050
What if he never comes?

449
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,450
Then, it's a test for him.

450
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,029
Just make sure you never give in.

451
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,600
But when two people fight,

452
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,980
one of them has to give in to solve the problem.

453
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,190
Besides... I was the one who started the fight.

454
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,620
If you always apologize first whenever you fight,

455
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,960
you know what, you will be dominated.

456
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,100
As one saying goes, "Have no regrets when you love someone to death."

457
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,250
You'll have to listen to him all the time.

458
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:32,070
Love should be given unconditionally, right?

459
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,060
You can't just give in.

460
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,040
You need to know how to exit the situation.

461
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,080
But I haven't even confirmed my relationship with Hai Yi.

462
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,650
[Cartoony World]

463
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,069
Don't worry.

464
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,730
At least you've confirmed it by looking at each other.

465
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,810
Trust me.

466
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,460
Are people's mindsets 20 years later

467
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,330
really different from my generation?

468
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:03,220
I should probably listen to how modern people think.

469
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,980
All right. Momo, I'll entrust my happiness to you.

470
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,040
No problem. Leave it to me.

471
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,690
Please explain.

472
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:34,930
These are just some photos of work events. What's wrong?

473
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,690
I'm not surprised that Wu Chang-shan protects you,

474
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,960
but how could you collude with Luquan Group?

475
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,640
Chairman, "collude" is too much.

476
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,660
Luquan Group provides our E-commerce platform. Is anything wrong with that?

477
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,480
I know that Vice Chairman Wu and a few board members

478
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,829
would like you to be the chairman.

479
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,400
It's obvious that he's gathering backup for you!

480
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,090
You're just imagining things from the photos. You're overthinking.

481
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,720
You know whether or not I'm "overthinking."

482
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:14,270
If I really needed the support of Luquan Group,

483
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,180
it would be quickest to simply date Lu Si-chi.

484
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,180
You guys are no longer together anyway.

485
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,630
How would I know if you are a double-dealer?

486
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,350
My dad trusted you so much in the past.

487
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,360
Liang Wun-sen, I'm warning you.

488
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,700
You are the managing director of Poseidon Department Store.

489
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:36,670
If I find you colluding with Luquan Group, I'll surely punish you severely.

490
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,050
Even if you are the chairman now,

491
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,360
you can't insult me like this without any proof.

492
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,384
As long as I work for Poseidon Department Store,

493
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,850
I won't let something like this happen.

494
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:27,060
♫ Driving on a sleepless raining night ♫

495
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,770
♫ Aimlessly driving ♫

496
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,750
♫ Just driving ♫

497
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,740
♫ Discovering the memories about you and me ♫

498
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:46,250
♫ Have scattered in every corner ♫

499
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:50,460
♫ Every corner ♫

500
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,860
Shall we play over there later? It looks cool.

501
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,359
It's Hai Yi.

502
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,580
Don't pick up the phone.

503
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,729
Why not? He's finally calling me.

504
00:46:00,729 --> 00:46:03,350
At least, answer after he waits for 20 rings.

505
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,579
"Twenty"? What kind of plan is that?

506
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:09,470
I'm your adviser. You know nothing.

507
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,000
Seventeen...

508
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,120
Hello? Aunt, yes.

509
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,500
Nineteen...

510
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,350
This Hai Yi is not sincere enough.

511
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,950
Wei Se-mo! What a stupid idea!

512
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,470
♫ The falling rain has bad intentions ♫

513
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,700
♫ Completely leaving no room ♫

514
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,910
♫ Abruptly reminding me of the past ♫

515
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:21,980
♫ The rain sounds are foreshadowing  ♫

516
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,100
♫ Constantly reminding ♫

517
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:30,670
♫ Describing how powerless I am ♫

518
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:34,570
♫ Just don’t be depressed, don’t be submissive ♫

519
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,700
♫ Be courageous, but the memories fail me ♫

520
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,020
♫ When mentioning you, I become powerless ♫

521
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,040
♫ That word and sentence, I think of it but don’t say it ♫

522
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,950
♫ Even the input method doesn’t forget ♫

523
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:53,880
♫ How cruelly ask me to forget you? It’s you ♫

524
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,880
♫ The messages are organized over and over, but still not clean ♫

525
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,200
♫ The sceneries outside are stacked into shadows ♫

526
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,290
♫ Longing becomes an illness, the senses are numbed ♫

527
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,700
♫ Engraved in memory, every single drop ♫

528
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,380
♫ I overestimate myself to provoke you ♫

529
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,570
♫ I’ve used all my efforts to love in this life ♫

530
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:19,460
♫ Please let me be a fish in my next life ♫

531
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:25,460
♫ Always have a seven-second memory ♫

532
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,070
