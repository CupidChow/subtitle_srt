Is it that hard to say you love me?

161
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,355
"I love you" means commitment.

162
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:50,280
How would I stand it if you suddenly disappear again someday?

163
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,100
Don't worry.

164
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,909
I'll inform you before I leave.

165
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:01,600
Now. Drink the chicken soup.

166
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,960
How's that?

167
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,480
Are you willing to say you love me now?

168
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,759
You are right. I'm crazy about you.

169
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,000
So...

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,720
Are you ready for...

171
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,109
You have to be well-behaved at the office, Chairman!

172
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:44,330
What? Where are you going?

173
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,479
I can't help it.

174
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,789
I'm so energetic after having your chicken soup.

175
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:01,750
I can't help it.

176
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,340
I'm going back to my office first.

177
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,960
So hurry up and drink the chicken soup.

178
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,780
Okay. Bye.

179
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,429
Yes. I've received the proposal and I'll discuss it with my team.

180
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,639
Take your time.

181
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,069
We are planning to spend ten million dollars to run the first stage for two years.

182
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,380
Sounds reasonable for me.

183
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,680
At least I can look at the pictures when I'm back in the year 2000.

184
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,319
What about Hai Yi? He'll be by himself.

185
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,230
He is so scared of being lonely and abandoned.

186
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,220
What am I supposed to do?

187
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,335
Ms. Hai.

188
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:34,710
I would like to ask a big favor of you.

189
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,540
Hsing-ssu, where do you want me to put it?

190
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,000
Put it on that table for me.

191
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,759
I told you not to come. You've barely slept for two days.

192
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,450
Why didn't you go back to sleep after the class?

193
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,479
I didn't want to sleep alone.

194
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:27,509
If I don't come and help you, I don't know when you'll finish.

195
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,460
It's normal when it comes to setting up a booth. I'm used to it.

196
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,100
Since your company began to focus on same-sex marriage,

197
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,760
you've been as busy as I am.

198
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,689
A more capable person should do more work.

199
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,460
I'm doing this for our future.

200
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,670
Well... When are you planning our own wedding?

201
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,800
You are so busy. When will you have time to plan the wedding?

202
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,279
I can always make time for that.

203
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,440
The best in life is to strike a balance between education and personal life.

204
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,220
Really?

205
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,880
Should we do a certain step before we get married?

206
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,959
Don't tell me that you would like to skip it.

207
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,640
I didn't say that. I'll be right on it.

208
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,740
How would you like me to pop the question?

209
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,160
What do you like?

210
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,399
- Stop joking.
- Come on.

211
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,750
Come on. What do you like?

212
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,110
What do you like? Tell me?

213
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,359
- Stop joking.
- Tell me. What do you like?

214
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,450
"What do I like"? Well... What do I like?

215
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,550
Yes. Tell me.

216
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,070
Lin Huai-en.

217
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,720
Hello, Director Yeh. I'm sorry.

218
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,370
I was rude to you at the cafeteria the other day. Sorry.

219
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,179
No worries. I've been close with Wun-sen since university.

220
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:08,440
He told me about you. There's no need to worry.

221
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,509
My name is Fu Yung-chieh.

222
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,789
I'm Yeh Hsing-ssu's little brother, also his boyfriend.

223
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,809
Hsing-ssu told me about you and Wun-sen.

224
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,210
You should probably hear our story.

225
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,410
[Walk In 2]

226
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:34,150
You are having junk food again. That's unhealthy.

227
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,109
You said I'm having junk food.

228
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,930
Then Doctor Fu, what kind of food is not junk food to you?

229
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,479
That's not the point.

230
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,229
The point is you had pizza for lunch yesterday,

231
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,349
and you had cakes and milk tea for afternoon tea.

232
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,380
Now you are having fried chicken and fries.

233
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,429
You've eaten more calories than you need lately.

234
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,269
I finally have time to take a break. Relax, okay?

235
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,150
- It's for your own good.
- That's called emotional blackmail.

236
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,500
Fast break... Shoot the ball...

237
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,340
Defense... Block him...

238
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,449
Come on... Hurry... Shoot the ball.

239
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:34,940
You could've passed him the ball.

240
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,169
Fu Yung-chieh, keep your voice down please.

241
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,110
It's normal to be loud when watching basketball.

242
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,629
(...it is expected to go down to the wire...)

243
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:42,880
Again... Shoot the ball...

244
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,250
(...4 minutes, 45 seconds now—)

245
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,450
You are too loud. I can't fall asleep.

246
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,979
Why did you turn off the TV?

247
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,169
Finishing exams wasn't easy. I've waited ages for this basketball game.

248
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:55,500
Fast break... Come on... Awesome!

249
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,480
Are you angry?

250
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,429
You are annoying.

251
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,569
You know I haven't slept enough recently and still you're like that.

252
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:18,249
I'm sorry. I was too involved watching the game.

253
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:20,310
I'll pay attention next time.

254
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,920
Go away.

255
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,649
Have you forgotten we had a deal?

256
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,920
Whenever we fight,

257
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,090
we have to have a 30-second kiss before midnight.

258
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,530
That's the secret to why we are getting closer and closer.

259
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,900
How romantic!

260
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,910
I'm so jealous of you two.

261
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,030
You two are so close, and you don't mind publicly showing affection.

262
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,099
Hsing-ssu arranged a photoshoot for us.

263
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:22,900
He said he would like to keep those memories of us in love.

264
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,030
Huai-en, you and Wun-sen can do it too.

265
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,755
I don't think so.

266
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:34,970
He likes someone else now.

267
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:39,030
No way. I've known Wun-sen for a long time.

268
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,050
This is the first time he has cared for someone so much.

269
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,079
He's too young to know. Forgive him.

270
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,479
But you should fix any misunderstandings quickly,

271
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,370
before it's too late.

272
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,239
I'm so jealous of you and Yung-chieh.

273
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,140
There's such a huge age gap between you two,

274
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,359
why don't you have any communication problems?

275
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,900
Are you having a hard time with that little boy?

276
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,350
Kind of.

277
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,729
You know what happened to us back then.

278
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,599
I didn't like him at first.

279
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,660
I even ignored him and was cold to him.

280
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,089
And then?

281
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:24,069
It turns out that... I was hurting him and also myself.

282
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,700
So when it comes to love, honesty is the key.

283
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,510
Did Managing Director really say that?

284
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,850
I'm sure he loves you.

285
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,259
Perhaps Managing Director's "little boy" has become someone else.

286
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,029
You should ask him directly.

287
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:46,569
Keeping it to yourself is the most painful.

288
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,930
Yes. Just ask him. I'm sure he'll tell you.

289
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,240
I don't even know where he is.

290
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,289
Do you know where he went?

291
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,490
I haven't been in touch with him though.

292
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,690
Right.

293
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,220
I thought you guys would stay in touch because of the event.

294
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,789
He did mention he would take some leave,

295
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,999
and he asked me to do what the contract says.

296
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,600
Hasn't he called you?

297
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,100
I miss him very much.

298
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,130
You know what?

299
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,430
I'll let you know right away if he calls me.

300
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,670
Thank you, Director Yeh.

301
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,360
No worries.

302
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,750
It's not easy to meet someone you love and he loves you back.

303
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,640
I hope you can make up with him soon.

304
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,000
Aunt, what brings you here this late?

305
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,259
I just had dinner with one of my best friends.

306
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:51,089
She's the wife of Summer Group's chairman.

307
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,990
We were very excited when we talked about something.

308
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,020
She has a daughter who's about your age.

309
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,989
We were thinking about setting you two up.

310
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,150
You two can be friends.

311
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,080
Do you mean Xia Ru-feng?

312
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,299
How did you know?

313
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,750
Of course! You two were often together when you were little, right?

314
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,100
She lived in the UK for a while. She has just moved back.

315
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,429
She has become a beautiful girl with a high education.

316
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:20,270
You are both from families of equal status.

317
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,589
You've never liked setting up a blind date.

318
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:25,680
Besides...

319
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,940
I don't need one.

320
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,619
Go.

321
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:33,869
She's such a good lady. What a good opportunity.

322
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,480
Dai Zhe-ni, what are you talking about?

323
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,119
Don't say anything if you don't understand.

324
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,000
Or... Do you think you are not good enough for her?

325
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,310
I get it. Lu Si-chi just dumped you not long ago.

326
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,880
I was the one who dumped her, okay?

327
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,320
All right. I'll go.

328
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,580
I'll show you how charming I am.

329
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,540
Are you sure you want me to go on a blind date?

330
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,680
Yes. It's good for you and Poseidon Department Store.

331
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,240
Good for me? What are you thinking?

332
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,260
It's just a blind date. Why are you making it such a big deal?

333
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,849
We've confirmed our love for each other.

334
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:49,349
Why did you do that?

335
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:52,559
Hai Yi, don't take it personally.

336
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,399
You don't have anyone on your side in the company.

337
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,520
Summer Group has a lot of capital. If you marry Miss Xia,

338
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,689
it'll be very helpful for Poseidon Department Store.

339
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:07,929
Also I heard that Miss Xia is pretty and generous.

340
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:12,590
She'll definitely be a good wife to you.

341
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,465
I didn't expect you not to trust me at all.

342
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,750
Do you really think I need a business marriage to secure my job?

343
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,910
If I disappear, will you miss me?

344
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,530
If you do love me, how can you disappear?

345
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,520
Who's talking to me?

346
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,150
Lin Huai-en?

347
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,010
What a coincidence. You're here too.

348
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,460
Have you still not heard from Director Liang?

349
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,469
He hasn't answered my calls. He didn't reply to my LINE messages.

350
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:21,660
I asked many people. No one knows where he is.

351
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,860
Don't panic.

352
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,900
Perhaps Director Liang needs to take care of something urgent.

353
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,160
He'll probably call you once it's done.

354
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,350
Waiting like this is torturous.

355
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,450
I understand how you feel.

356
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,280
Managing director has never taken such a long leave.

357
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,880
Why did he choose to do it now?

358
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,680
He is senior staff. There must be a reason.

359
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,689
We just don't know what.

360
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:59,760
Why do they always treat us like fools?

361
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,439
I wish I were a fool.

362
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:07,620
They are the managing director and the chairman at work.

363
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,660
Why are they our bosses in a relationship too?

364
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,980
They are our bosses. They are always superior.

365
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,389
We are poor, weak and helpless.

366
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:20,900
We can only comfort each other.

367
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,810
Are you enjoying it?

368
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,559
It's amazing, Vice Chairman Wu.

369
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,179
There's not only a hot spring here, but also a scenic view down there.

370
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,020
Beautiful! What a nice place for a vacation.

371
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:43,849
I'm glad you like it. Here.

372
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,520
Thank you.

373
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,999
The owner of the resort is my good friend.

374
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,209
Just relax and stay here.

375
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:55,600
I'll take you to meet with a very important person in two days.

376
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,479
Lin Huai-en.

377
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,000
- Manager.
- You seem absent-minded.

378
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,939
You dropped your documents without noticing.

379
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,930
I'm sorry. Thank you.

380
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,670
Manager, do you know where Managing Director is?

381
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,299
I don't know.

382
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:27,350
Even you don't know?

383
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,270
Has something bad happened to him?

384
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,680
Aren't you worried?

385
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,880
I... We...

386
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,660
It's all right.

387
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,490
I understand if you don't want to tell me.

388
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,480
I just want to make sure he's okay.

389
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,570
Don't misunderstand.

390
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,999
Lin Huai-en, to be honest,

391
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:57,479
I fixed Director Liang's tie in front of you on purpose that day.

392
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:01,600
Director Liang asked me to pretend that we were close.

393
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,129
Why did he do that?

394
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:07,290
I'm not quite sure.

395
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,830
He said he didn't want to make things difficult for you.

396
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,260
That it's easier if you hate him.

397
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,510
"It's not easy to meet someone you love and he loves you back."

398
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,260
"I hope you can make up with him soon."

399
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,200
This place is so nice that I don't want to leave.

400
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,000
That's excellent.

401
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,360
"Managing Director, I had a car accident."

402
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,479
Vice Chairman Wu, something has come up. I have to go now.

403
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:02,310
Mr. Lu, you are here.

404
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,830
I'll come and pick you up at the entrance.

405
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,950
Let's go.

406
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,459
Hello? Do me a favor.

407
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:17,420
[Managing Director, I had a car accident.]

408
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,570
[Managing Director, I had a car accident.]

409
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,270
Managing Director clearly has a crush on me. He clearly likes me.

410
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,360
Why does he blow hot and cold toward me?

411
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,450
Why?

412
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,420
♫ You are everywhere on my mind ♫

413
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,630
Yung-chieh and I are with him now. He's fine.

414
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,990
He just wanted to see you. Don't worry.

415
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,660
All right. I see. Thank you.

416
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,490
Don't you want to talk to him?

417
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,900
It's okay. Bye for now.

418
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,590
♫ I tell myself to give up ♫

419
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,070
Have you been to the UK?

420
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,589
- Right. I used to study in the UK—
- I prefer the States.

421
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:54,459
The "States"... I like the States too. I want to go to Disneyland.

422
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:57,840
You have a beautiful ring. May I have a look?

423
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,590
Is there a female version of this ring?

424
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,870
I'll ask the designer to specially make one for you.

425
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,110
We'll have couple rings.

426
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,779
"Couple rings"?

427
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,990
How can she touch Hai Yi's hands

428
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,910
and smile crazily at him like that?

429
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,249
I really want to punch her in the face. What a hussy.

430
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:27,200
No. I have to hold it in.

431
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,690
Honey...

432
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,980
How can you do this to me?

433
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,219
Did you abandon me because I'm fat and ugly now?

434
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:40,340
What are you doing here?

435
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,839
What am I doing here?

436
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,609
You said you would marry me after having a stable job.

437
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:48,289
You can't dump me after sleeping with me!

438
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,699
Hai Yi, what's going on?

439
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:53,010
Nothing. Just ignore her.

440
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,289
What are you doing here? You are humiliating yourself.

441
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:02,809
Look how terrible he is.

442
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:04,840
Are you abandoning me and our child?

443
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,929
Are you done yet?

444
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:08,820
I told you that you're not good enough for me.

445
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,079
I asked you to get an abortion, and you refused.

446
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:14,550
Don't try to make me feel bad with this child.

447
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,780
You are such a sleazy person.

448
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,090
My baby...

449
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,880
Hello? Mommy?

450
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,270
Hai Yi is such a terrible man.

451
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,820
How is it not possible?

452
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,370
His pregnant girlfriend just appeared and made a scene.

453
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,700
I don't want to date an irresponsible jerk like him.

454
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,350
I don't want to talk any more.

455
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,410
Hello? Vice Chairman Wu.

456
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,990
A pregnant woman just came and drove Miss Xia away.

457
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,540
Should I continue to follow him?

458
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,199
Yes. Okay.

459
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:01,510
I'll send you the photos later.

460
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,339
I didn't expect acting to be so tiring.

461
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:14,909
How is it, Chairman? I did quite a good job, right?

462
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,860
- Not bad.
- Wei Se-mo, what did you do?

463
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,369
Did you see that? I was such a good actress. I was amazing.

464
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:23,880
You just ruined something big.

465
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,220
If you weren't so lackluster everyday,

466
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,990
I wouldn't have said yes to Chairman when he asked me to act.

467
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,490
Did you arrange that?

468
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,310
Why?

469
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,839
I should be asking why you're trying to push me away.

470
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,489
I told you. It's for your own good.

471
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:46,330
I don't need you to do this.

472
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,209
Chairman cares so much about you.

473
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:53,680
Don't be angry at him.

474
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,630
Don't say anything if you don't know the whole story.

475
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,899
It's obvious that you care about him a lot. Why are you doing this?

476
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,390
- What's wrong with you? What?
- Let's go.

477
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,990
You are acting weirdly.

478
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,090
If you are unhappy, tell me.

479
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,689
It has nothing to do with Wei Se-mo.

00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:11,180
♫ The falling rain has bad intentions ♫

643
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,430
♫ Completely leaving no room ♫

644
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,640
♫ Abruptly reminding me of the past ♫

645
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,670
♫ The rain sounds are foreshadowing  ♫

646
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:24,850
♫ Constantly reminding ♫

647
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:30,380
♫ Describing how powerless I am ♫

648
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,270
♫ Just don’t be depressed, don’t be submissive ♫

649
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:38,400
♫ Be courageous, but the memories fail me ♫

650
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,740
♫ When mentioning you, I become powerless ♫

651
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,420
♫ That word and sentence, I think of it but don’t say it ♫

652
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,600
♫ Even the input method doesn’t forget ♫

653
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:53,600
♫ How cruelly ask me to forget you? It’s you ♫

654
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,630
♫ The messages are organized over and over, but still not clean ♫

655
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,840
♫ The sceneries outside are stacked into shadows ♫

656
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,980
♫ Longing becomes an illness, the senses are numbed ♫

657
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,390
♫ Engraved in memory, every single drop ♫

658
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:09,970
♫ I overestimate myself to provoke you ♫

659
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,210
♫ I’ve used all my efforts to love in this life ♫

660
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:19,140
♫ Please let me be a fish in my next life ♫

661
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:25,170
♫ Always have a seven-second memory ♫

662
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:29,960
