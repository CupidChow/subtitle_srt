29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,719
Fine. It's seems like you're pretending not to know me. Are you?
[Chapter 4]

30
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,070
- How dare you!
- Have mercy, my heroine!

31
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,790
It's good that you're scared. Are you going to keep pretending?

32
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,750
I'm not pretending.

33
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,590
The thing is that I had a car accident not long ago.

34
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,350
"A car accident"? Did you get hurt? Was it bad?

35
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,229
I'm all right, but my memory is a bit messed up.

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,270
I can't remember anything in my past.

37
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,590
Do you mean you've lost your memory?

38
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,100
- I don't remember anything.
- Are you lying to me?

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,350
I swear. If I lie to you, I'm a dog.

40
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,769
Why didn't you tell me when something so serious happened?

41
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,369
Other than your memory, did you get hurt anywhere else?

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,820
Let me see.

43
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,280
Don't worry. I just can't remember my past.

44
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,449
So... Would you tell me about it?

45
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:30,259
Of course I would. What do you want to know?

46
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,640
Let's start with your favorite drink.

47
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,939
Are these all for me?

48
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,140
Of course not. Pick one. The rest of them are my favorites.

49
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,510
But... they don't look anything special.

50
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,640
It's your favorite brand of sparkling water.

51
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,304
Is that right?

52
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,490
I can't remember.

53
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,819
This is the original flavor. Sugar free.

54
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,799
This is lemon flavored. That one is peach.

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,850
If you are looking for something sweeter, go for the passion fruit flavor.

56
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,820
I'm sure you'll like it.

57
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,990
Oh no, I've never tried it.

58
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,270
What would the real Dai Zhe-ni choose?

59
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,720
It's taking you too long.

60
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,320
If you want something refreshing, choose the original flavor.

61
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,669
The bubbly taste will refresh you.

62
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:22,069
If you would like something flavored, choose the lemon one.

63
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,860
There's a hint of lemon in it.

64
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,660
I'll have this one.

65
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,830
It tastes nice. There's a fragrance of lemon in it.

66
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,970
It's refreshing and not sweet at all.

67
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,670
I prefer the peach flavor.

68
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,350
That fruity taste gives you a feeling of falling in love.

69
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:05,700
Apart from sparkling water, what do I like to eat?

70
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,880
Here are your favorite *wheel pies, cream flavored.
(*popular Taiwanese street food)

71
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,940
I see. That's what I like to eat.

72
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,869
Then... how did we meet?

73
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,680
We were classmates from primary school to senior high school.

74
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,470
We're like childhood friends.

75
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,679
Do you know about my family?

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,610
Yes.

77
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,370
Your parents were divorced when you were in Grade 10.

78
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,370
You have moved out and have lived by yourself since then.

79
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,249
So... it seems like my parents don't care about me.

80
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:46,630
Not really. They paid your rent and tuition fees.

81
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,829
You just haven't known what a loving family is like,

82
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,340
and you didn't have much pocket money to spend.

83
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,359
But everything else isn't too bad.

84
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,380
No wonder no one looks for him after he's been missing for so long.

85
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,179
What did you say?

86
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,339
Nothing.

87
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,890
It sounds like I have all the freedom I need.

88
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,470
Yes. You always say that compared to other people, you have quite a good life.

89

You even got to pick your university major.

No. I'm very busy.

102

What are you busy with besides playing video games?

103
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,800
None of your business.

You said that you time-traveled.

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,309
How come you have a childhood friend? You just blew your cover.

What cover?

120
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,819
She's Dai Zhe-ni's childhood friend.

121

It's totally reasonable that I get to know his friend.

I believe that she's really a good friend of Dai Zhe-ni.

Look. She took me to a night market and bought me so much food.

127
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:42,239
She bought these for Dai Zhe-ni, okay.

It's all the same. I get to eat them.

Come on! What are you thinking?

Momo is Dai Zhe-ni's best friend.

135

Do you really think I would take advantage of her?

You've only met her once yet you call her Momo!

I'm not you. At least I don't harass people.

00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:13,470
♫ That strong but invisible line ♫

322
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,090
♫ Lost in time ♫

324
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,260
Mr. Dai Zhe-ni, Popie Delivery has approved your job-reinstatement application.

325
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,660
That was so quick!

327
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,800
I've been giving Hai Yi the silent treatment.

328
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,250
Should I make a nice meal and make up with him tonight?

329
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,050
Don't be silly.

330
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,750
Hai Yi is so mean. You shouldn't spend money on him.

331
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,650
Hai Yi doesn't mean that. Forgive him.

332
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,580
He's such an ingrate. Wake up. You are just love-struck.

333
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,679
Hai Yi has provided free accommodation.

334
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,860
It's okay to treat him to a nice meal.

335

[Beef]

336
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,719
Dai Zhe-ni, do you have something for me?

337
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,889
Nothing.

338
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,519
May I borrow your staff ID to pay the cashier? Surprise!

339
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,709
You are such a miser.

340
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,359
- Come on.
- Thanks.

341
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,730
It's rare for you to select pricey ingredients.

342
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,650
- Are you cooking for your girlfriend?
- It's not my girlfriend.

343
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,970
It's for my roommate.

344
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,470
Your roommate must be important to you.

345
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,060
A man or a woman?

346
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,389
A man. Lin Huai-en, stop gossiping.

347
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:03,770
I was curious.

348
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,719
What's his name? What does he do?

349
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,960
Introduce him to me one day.

350
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,630
Are you a man? Prove it!

351
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,220
Come on!

352
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,210
Duel.

353
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,990
Hai Yi. Stop playing video games. It's time for dinner.

354
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,960
I'm not hungry.

355
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,709
Are you sure?

356
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,669
I don't eat expiring food from supermarkets.

357
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,399
Never mind.

358
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,540
I'm going to eat two steaks by myself.

359
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,280
You normally eat instant noodles or expiring food.

360
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
What happened today?

361
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,910
It's good to have a nice meal sometimes.

362
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,850
It's not your style at all.

363
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,929
I know. Did you mess something up?

364
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,289
Do you have to be doubtful?

365
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,180
You don't usually do something like this.

366
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,470
Forget it. I can't even shut you up with a steak.

367
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,650
I'll eat, I'll eat...

368
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,740
It's good. It's overcooked though.

369
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,520
It would be better if it was medium.

370
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,820
I shouldn't have bought steaks.

371
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,490
I should've got fish.

372
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,530
Why?

373
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,250
You are picky! I should've let you pick some fishbones.

374
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,179
A lot of money and effort went into the dinner.

375
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,780
How could he be so picky?

376
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,680
Dai Zhe-ni spent a lot on the dinner for me,

377
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,500
but I didn't say anything nice.

378
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,900
He must be very angry.

379
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,960
Hai Yi, be careful.

380
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,710
It's over.

381
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,250
It's over.

382
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,910
Are you all right?

383
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,910
Thank you.

384
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,809
It's nothing. I'm glad that it didn't last long.

385
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,660
There may be aftershocks.

386
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,280
I-I-I'll go find a place to hide in case there are aftershocks.

387
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,490
You seem to be very scared of earthquakes.

388
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,500
I've just experienced the "*921 earthquake".
(*September 21st, 1999)

389
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,760
Don't you remember that?

390
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,050
The "921 earthquake"... What year was that?

391
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,000
1999.

392
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,100
I was only five. I don't remember.

393
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,660
Five years old. No wonder.

394
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,139
It was such a big earthquake.

395
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,580
My grandma and I were so scared we ran out of the house right away.

396
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,740
Did you two get hurt?

397
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,939
No.

398
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,720
There was a big crack in the wall of our home, though.

399
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,980
There was a power outage across all of Taiwan.

400
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,130
Many buildings in Central Taiwan collapsed.

401
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:26,750
Also many people... just stayed in that night forever.

402
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,190
He describes it with so much detail.

403
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,890
Did he really travel from that year?

404
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,870
Are you still scared?

405
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,140
I would be lying if I said I wasn't.

406
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,070
At least... I'm experienced now.

407
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,030
All right. To prepare for the aftershocks later,

408
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,040
I'll let you hold my hand while you sleep.

409
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,660
How old are you? Still holding hands?

410
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,090
Forget it.

411
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,370
I want it!

412
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,890
Your hands are sweaty.

413
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,240
Mine aren't. Your hands are sweaty.

414
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,460
They are.

415
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,450
That's dirty. That's your own sweat.

416
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,920
All right. Time to sleep.

417
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,410
Thank you.

418
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,460
Hello? Managing Director.

419
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,890
There was an earthquake. Are you all right?

420
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,850
I was a bit scared, but I'm fine.

421
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,300
Everything is good.

422
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,780
It's good that you are fine.

423
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,230
What about you?

424
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,339
Me? You'll know after you look out your window.

425
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,660
- I'll go downstairs to see you now.
- It's all right.

426
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,910
It's late, and it's also raining right now.

427
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,800
Go and get some sleep.

428
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,040
I just wanted to make sure that you are okay.

429
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,470
Dai Zhe-ni said that you're his childhood friend.

430
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,470
Don't misunderstand. There's nothing between us.

431
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,360
I know you both care a lot about each other.

432
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,060
Come on.

433
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,080
I just wanted to ask you about...

434
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,820
his habits and what he likes.

435
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,149
We are roommates.

436
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,970
I... I would like to know more about him.

437
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,470
Can I take it as... you have feelings for him?

438
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,380
Just tell me all you know about Dai Zhe-ni.

439
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,130
Of course. For Ni's happiness, I will tell you everything.

440
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,589
Make sure you take notes. Hurry, jot it down.

441
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,159
He always puts his clothes everywhere.

442
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,660
They're all over his room.

443
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,120
You can barely walk in there.

444
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,210
He also likes to put on skin products...

445
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,199
Hey! CEO.

446
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,199
CEO, you are back. It's been a long day for you.

447
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,719
- I got you some food.
- You are so nice!

448
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,300
What do you think?

449
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,010
You don't like it? It's cream flavored.

450
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,330
I don't like sweet things.

451
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,610
Cream-flavored wheel pies.

452
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,970
"Cream flavored"... no?

453
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,079
Dai Zhe-ni's room is always messy.

454
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,669
He always puts his dirty clothes everywhere.

455
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,740
You can barely find a place to sit in his room.

456
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,490
You can use it.

457
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,799
I'm good. I'm not a girl.

458
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,980
I don't need it. I need to go.

459
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,889
He likes his look and always takes good care of his skin.

460
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,780
After washing his face, he uses a lot of skin care products.

461
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,210
I don't even do that.

462
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,880
He is nothing like what she described.

463
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,770
I think he really is Ho Bo-wei.

464
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,520
- Did you buy stinky tofu?
- Yes.

465
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,310
It smells bad, but it tastes so good.

466
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,450
I got it specially for you.

467
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:12,680
Big Brother, what's that smell on you?

468
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,540
It's stinky tofu.

469
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,110
"Stinky tofu"?

470
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:23,250
It smells bad, but tastes so good.

471
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,280
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

472
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,460
Is it because you don't like the smell of stinky tofu?

473
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,140
I'm all right.

474
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,540
You said you time-traveled from another year.

475
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,609
Tell me more about your year.

476
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,260
Okay. I always want to tell you, but you don't believe me.

477
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,500
Lucky key chains or necklaces were a trend back then, right?

478
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,820
How did you know? I used to have a lucky bracelet at that time.

479
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,200
"Lucky bracelet"? Where is it now?

480
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,780
I gave it to a child.

481
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,670
What child?

482
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,670
A child who couldn't find his family.

483
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,720
You look pale.

484
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,200
Are you sure you are all right?

485
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,100
That's strange. You don't have a fever.

486
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,929
I guess you are just too hungry.

487
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,570
All right. If you don't eat stinky tofu,

488
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,740
I'll cook something else for you.

I wished that I could meet Big Brother again.

497
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:50,280
I didn't expect to see you again like this.

498
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,500
Incredible.

499
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:02,120
Dai Zhe-ni. Thank you.

500
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,220
I will find a way to keep you here.

501

509
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:55,470
Miss Lu, I thought I made it clear enough last time.

510
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:00,380
Besides work, I don't think we need to meet in private.

511
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,220
You did. You made your point clearly last time.

512
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,160
Today, it's time for me to make mine.

513
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,930
All right. Say it.

514
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,350
I've thought it through.

515
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:22,000
I don't mind if you love the boy.

516
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,520
What do you mean, "You don't mind"?

517
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,510
The point is that you're the best candidate for me to marry.

518
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,189
It's a win-win situation if we get married.

519
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,810
It's good for you too.

520
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,280
I don't understand what you mean.

521
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,480
With the help of Luquan Group,

522
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,620
it will be easy for the Poseidon Department Store to become yours.

523
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,220
You are just looking for a puppet.

524
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,730
Not just anyone can be my puppet, okay?

525
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,270
After we marry, you're free to fall in love with anyone.

526
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,420
We won't interfere with each other. We'll have our own happiness.

527
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,650
You mean contracting a marriage.

528
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:20,450
But I'm telling you, marriage is sacred to me.

529
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,869
I will never recognize marriage as a business.

530
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:29,030
Why not? We'll both get what we need.

531
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,520
Many friends of mine have done the same.

532
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,620
Wow.

533
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,899
Your upper class logic is truly amazing.

534
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,319
I'm just an ordinary guy so leave me alone.

535
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,329
I will never accept a fake relationship.

536
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:48,200
Especially... I won't marry someone I don't love.

537
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,940
CEO? CEO!

538
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,579
Let's go report for duty.

539
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,600
For what?

540
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,049
It's for a job, of course.

541
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,870
You've never applied for a job. How did you get it, and why must I go there?

542
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,909
Don't ask. Just come with me.

543
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,719
No. I just got my delivery job back.

544
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,449
Just quit the job.

545
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:22,530
Again? What if the place you work at isn't reliable?

546
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,640
Don't you trust me?

547
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,290
That's true. I don't.

548
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:30,160
All right. Forget it. I'll go by myself.

549
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,950
He shows all his emotions on his face.

550
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,349
He'll make mistakes if he goes alone.

551
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,379
No. I have to go and watch him.

552
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,050
Hai Yi.

554
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,259
From today onward,

555
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,360
are we Customer Service Department staff at Poseidon Department Store?

556
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,590
Didn't Director Tseng say we could start working from today?

557
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,270
It's way too easy.

558
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:16,450
Do you think they'll find out we live in their warehouse?

559
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,560
Don't worry. It's an old one. It's not in use now.

560
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,530
Also, we've lived there for a while, and no one has come by, right?

561
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:27,050
Come. Here are your badges.

562
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,440
Welcome to Poseidon Department Store.

563
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,290
Thank you, Director Tseng. We will definitely work hard and do our best.

564
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:41,670
Very nice. Very energetic.

565
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,060
Which ones are our desks?

566
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,600
How about those two?

567
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,330
Thank you, Director Tseng.

568
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:56,390
Hai Yi... May we talk privately?

569
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,990
- Sure. Where do you want to talk?
- Right here is fine.

570
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,550
Can you lower yourself down?

571
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,970
A bit lower.

572
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,360
That's right. This height is just about right.

573
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:16,500
May I ask if you're related to our chairman?

574
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,870
"Hai" is a rare family name.

575
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,300
You're overthinking, Director Tseng. It's just a coincidence.

576
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,470
If I was really related to the chairman,

577
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:27,060
I wouldn't have had to work for a junior position.

578
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,270
Right. I'll leave you to work.

579
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,250
What did Director Tseng say to you?

580
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,270
He simply encouraged me.

581
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,410
I knew he was a good guy. We are so lucky.

582
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,590
It feels like a dream to me.

583
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,590
I've studied hard since I was young,

584
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,140
so I could get into a big company and earn a lot of money.

585
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:03,080
I didn't expect to fulfill my dream in this era.

586
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:09,000
Hai Yi, thank you. Let's do our best together.

587
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,409
It's really different to work at a big company.

588
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,880
Everything looks nice.

589
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,480
Dai Zhe-ni. Why are you here?

590
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,250
Hey... You've become staff at Poseidon Department Store too?

591
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:53,450
Surprise? Shock? Happy?

592
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,149
You've never mentioned this before.

593
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,980
I didn't expect it either. We're co-workers from now on.

594
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,739
I look forward to learning from you.

595
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,550
I'll teach you depending on your performance.

596
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,380
Are you free now?

597
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,510
I'll buy you lunch.

598
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,100
Let's go.

599
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,940
Lin Huai-en. We need you to be at the cold storage.

600
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,699
Go help check the stocks.

601
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:20,950
- Now?
- Yes. Right now.

602
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,860
Okay.

603
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,840
Sorry. I've got to work now. I'll catch up with you later.

604
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,650
All right. Well... Text me.

605
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,030
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

606
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,430
Can anyone open the door for me?

607
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,260
Anyone? Can anyone open the door for me?

608
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,740
Hsuan, Lin Huai-en is locked in the cold storage.

609
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,729
What if something goes wrong?

610
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:29,470
Just leave it. He offended Manager Tony.

611
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,290
Get out of my way.

612
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,480
Huai-en. Huai-en.

613
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,760
Huai-en, are you in there? Huai-en?

614
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,290
Huai-en. Huai-en.

615
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,200
Huai-en.
