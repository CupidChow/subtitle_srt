That's true.

1735
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,500
[You look good too.]

1736
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,460
[I take my hair loss medication on time.]

1737
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,300
[But I think you have a lot of hair?]

1738
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,080
No, I had a transplant here.

1739
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,580
[I had a transplant here.]

1740
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:30,570
About 700 follicles.

1741
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,660
[Is your hair okay?]

1742
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,180
[For now, it's fine.]

1743
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,320
It's fine.

1744
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,050
As expected.

1745
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,500
[That's a relief]

1746
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,530
I'm doing well for now.

1747
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,340
[So what are you going to do...?]

1748
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,380
[Hyung, please explain it to him. He's really curious.]

1749
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,670
-That's right.
-What kind of program would you like to work on?

1750
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,540
[Curious why we're gathered here]

1751
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:47,870
Back in the day, singers would collaborate at year-end events.

1752
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:47,820
[A brief intro to Good Day for Kian]

1753
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,940
[G-DRAGON: Like "Become One," "Hand in Hand" and similar songs,]

1754
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:54,180
[G-DRAGON: everyone sang a small part in the recording studio.]

1755
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:54,900
Could it be...

1756
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,420
[Recording studio? Could it be...!]

1757
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,730
Could it be...

1758
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,980
[Are the three of us forming a subunit?]

1759
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,460
[Being clumsy again...]

1760
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,380
[A... subunit?]

1761
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:07,850
Let's hear it out first.

1762
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,030
So that's the idea?

1763
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:11,590
The meaning is more or less like that.

1764
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,900
[Me and GD together...?]

1765
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,620
[Three people... or thirty people...?!]

1766
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,820
[Thirty is too much. How about just the three of us?]

1767
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,060
Not sure how it'll go, but...

1768
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,620
[G-DRAGON: Actually, whether it's "Hand in Hand" or "We are the world"—]

1769
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,620
[Kian84: There haven't been things like this lately, right?]

1770
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,040
Nope.

1771
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,260
Is it because of COVID-19?

1772
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,510
More than that—

1773
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:29,620
It's more of a change in the system.

1774
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,860
[There are changes in the structure of the music industry]

1775
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:30,910
Yeah, the system changed.

1776
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,860
[G-DRAGON: Before, it was mostly solo artists.]

1777
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:40,060
[G-DRAGON: Now there are groups, but also individual careers.]

1778
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:44,140
[Individualism... Rather than calling it individualism—]

1779
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,130
-It's just the industry structure.
-The system.

1780
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,400
Now we're just sitting here...

1781
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,630
With no warmth.

1782
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,220
[Suddenly, the warmth is gone...!]

1783
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,190
Yeah, there really isn't much warmth these days.

1784
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,940
[-The warmth is gone!]
[-Well, in a way, this is about sharing warmth...]

1785
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,660
[-We all live alone...]
[-So we want to share warmth.]

1786
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,700
[If there's no money involved, people won't come.]

1787
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,390
That could happen too...

1788
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:58,310
[If there's no benefit, they won't show up.]

1789
01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:59,540
But everyone understands that.

1790
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,620
[But it's understandable]

1791
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:00,830
Why should I work with you?

1792
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,620
[An unconventional way of understanding...]

1793
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:04,330
Well, I think—

1794
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,220
[Trying to smooth things over]

1795
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,400
-What we need is a title.
-A title?

1796
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,660
[A title...(?)]

1797
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:09,310
Yeah, just create a title to bring people in.

1798
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,140
[Pffft]

1799
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,140
[These days, people are always arguing...]

1800
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:13,820
It's an era full of disputes.

1801
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,260
[Immersed] [It's an era full of disputes...]

1802
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:17,310
-Everyone's busy.
-You should be the one to bring people together.

1803
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,340
[You should be the one to bring people together.]

1804
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,420
[As expected of G-DRAGON!]

1805
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,220
[I knew being your fan was the right choice.]

1806
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,540
[But I'm not very good at singing...]

1807
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,780
[Well, actually...]

1808
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,660
[So, are we really doing this together?]

1809
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,000
Me?

1810
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,300
[Ah...!]

1811
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,600
-As we're talking, I also...-So, I...

1812
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,180
[-As we're talking, I also...]
[-So, I!]

1813
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,530
I—I just stopped by, that's all.

1814
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,940
[Trying to play it cool— "Ah, it's fine! No worries! Seems like I just happened to stop by and sit down for a bit..."]

1815
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,480
-No, no—-Alright, it's fine.

1816
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,250
We're just having a meeting. Just a meeting.

1817
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,620
[G-DRAGON: Anyway, let's play to our strengths.]

1818
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:55,140
[G-DRAGON: We'll definitely be able to create something.]

1819
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,590
Yeah, no matter the outcome.

1820
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,390
[Yeah, no matter the outcome—to be honest—]

1821
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,230
-But...
-If everyone gets involved—

1822
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,580
[But...! No, but!]

1823
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:59,500
No, but...

1824
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,380
[If you say you want to do it now—]

1825
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:02,860
[Everyone will start clamoring to join, so—]

1826
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,940
[Kian84: So it'll ruin the original intention.]

1827
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,890
-No, the original intention—
-No, I want to join!

1828
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,620
["I said I wanted to join too...!"]

1829
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:11,320
-I said I wanted to join too!
-Is that the situation?

1830
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,820
["He told me not to join?!"]

1831
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:16,430
-Sorry, but—
-We already said this isn't a competition, hyung.

1832
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,580
[We already said this isn't a competition, hyung.]

1833
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,940
[What have you been listening to this whole time?!]

1834
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,800
So, basically, what does it mean?

1835
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,020
[The idea is to play to our strengths and unite as a team.]

1836
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,580
-So basically, you want me to sing?
-No, it's not like that—

1837
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,540
[Back to square one— So basically, you want me to sing?!]

1838
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,420
[Deep sigh]

1839
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,390
That's not what we meant.

1840
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,240
That's not what you meant?

1841
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:32,380
[That's absolutely not what I meant.]

1842
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:32,950
-Alright.
-So...

1843
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,920
I'll pass on the message

1844
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,780
[Kian84: to other artists.]

1845
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,840
[-G-DRAGON recently—
-Yes.]

1846
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:39,340
[G-DRAGON has been working on this project recently!]

1847
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,430
-I'd like to borrow the power of a grand prize winner.
-Is that so?

1848
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,700
[I believe in the power of a grand prize winner]

1849
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:43,240
And also,

1850
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,470
since I'm a comic artist, if I join—

1851
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,420
[Since I'm a comic artist—]

1852
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,740
[If you need an album cover, I can draw it...]

1853
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:49,780

[If you need a main vocalist, I can step up too!]

1855
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,910
-We'll talk about that later.
-Alright.

[Unbreakable defense]

1857
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,390
-Yeah.
-Alright.

1858
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,020
[Just kidding]

1859
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:59,340
[Ah!]

1860
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,980
[As expected, you're different.]

1861
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:04,730
-As expected, you're different.
-No, it's just—

1862
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,220
[You're like the universe itself.]

1863
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:10,260
[Because I'm a member of BIGBANG. (Note: BIGBANG = The Universe's Big Bang)]

1864
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:10,920
That's true.

1865
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,740
[But... can I even be of any help?]

1866
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,940
[Up until now, you haven't helped at all.]

1867
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:20,500

[Happy, happy, South Korea!]

1874
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,670
-That's right, that's actually not wrong.
-You got it.

[Kian's signature style: a concise and clear summary]

[It's simple.]

1878
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,740
[Then please keep spreading the message.]

1879
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:47,640
Got it. I'll tell everyone I meet.

1880
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,140

01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:53,350
when I was on my way out to go on leave,

[Soohyun: On my way out for leave]

2761
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:55,420
I forgot to bring sunscreen.

2762
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,380
['Ah forgot to bring sunscreen']

2763
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:59,400
So I went to a nearby Olive Young.

2764
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,540
[Went to Olive Young]

2765
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:02,700
[While choosing sunscreen there]

2766
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:02,580
While I was choosing,

2767
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:04,980
[Wearing a military uniform Wearing a military uniform!]

2768
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,920
Wearing a military uniform, a mask and a cap.

2769
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:08,220
[Wearing a military uniform, a mask and a cap, choosing...]

2770
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:08,440
I'm choosing it,

2771
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:11,980
-When suddenly, this...
-I can tell this is going to be funny even before he's done.

2772
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:11,140
[Hahaha. Suddenly there was a...]

2773
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:13,300
[Finding it funny even before he's done]

2774
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,430
man in sportswear

2775
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,880
who approached me slowly.

2776
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,820
[Suddenly, a man slowly approaches]

2777
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,010
I saw him out of the corner of my eye.

2778
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:21,420
[Looking at Soohyun from the side of his eye]

2779
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:21,810
He's looking at me like this.

2780
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:25,220
[Wondering why this person has no boundaries]

2781
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:28,100
I decided to choose my sunscreen quickly.

2782
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:27,580
[Looking around]

2783
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:29,900
[That man suddenly...]

2784
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:31,580
[Slaps]

2785
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,580
[Kim Soohyun!!]

2786
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:35,580
[Kim Soohyun!!]

2787
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,900
[In an extremely loud voice]

2788

[You're Kim Soohyun, right?]

2789
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,330
-He spoke to me like that.
-He's exactly like that.

2790
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:42,060
[Exactly the same!]

2791
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:44,130
I said oh, oh, hello.

2792
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:44,820
[Oh, oh, hello]

2793
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:47,580
He said, "It's me" and pulled off his mask.

2794
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:47,620
["It's me" he pulled off his mask]

2795
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:49,660
[Soohyun: Then we talked briefly]

2796
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:52,900
[Yes.
Was that the first time you met?]

2797
01:27:52,110 --> 01:27:55,310
Kwanghee said, give me your number. Your phone number.

2798
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:55,740
[Footage: MBC Give me your number. Your number!]

2799
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:57,100
I have almost all the contacts of those born in 1988.

2800
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:59,500
[Footage: MBC
I have almost all the contacts of those born in 1988.
Let's meet up sometime!]

2801
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,520
-Let's get together sometime. -Really?

2802
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,170
He told me once.

2803
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,500
[Did you contact each other after that?]

2804
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:07,140
[Why?
Kwanghee doesn't contact people for nothing]

2805
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,380
[I don't know either]

2806
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:09,290
With me too. Kwanghee called me and said

2807
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:11,900
[Calling Seho casually]

2808
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:11,260
'Hyung', where are you? I said I'm home.

2809
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:13,150
He said, 'hyung', have you contacted Jiyong before?

2810
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,420
[Footage: MBC
'Hyung', have you contacted Jiyong before?]

2811
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:15,140
Yes, I have. Why?

2812
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:14,940
[Footage: MBC
'Hyung', have you contacted Jiyong before?
Yes, I have. Why]

2813
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,020
Oh. You can contact him?

2814
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:18,900
[Footage: MBC
Oh... you can contact him?]

2815
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:19,130
I asked why?

2816
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,220
Call him!

2817
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:23,300
[Call him!
Why? He's very busy!]

2818
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:21,970
Why? He's very busy.

2819
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:23,660
I said, "What's the use of telling me?"

2820
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:27,470
He said, "Hyung, did Jiyong give you another gift?"

2821
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:28,860
[Hyung! Did Jiyong give you another gift?]

2822
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,770
Well, yes.

2823
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:32,540
[Unhappy...]
[Ah, really?]

2824

Ah, really?

2825
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,380
You should go talk to Jiyong.

2826
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,700
[What made him so upset?]

2827
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,730
"Go ask him."

2828
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:37,110
He said, "It's fine." Kwanghee seems a bit shy.

[Kwanghee seems a bit shy]

2830
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:38,610
He gets shy very easily.

[Surprisingly different from his public image]

2832
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:42,630
It's probably because he's just too nice.

01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,260
[Because Kwanghee is just too nice]

[He's really a nice person]

So, when we meet people while we're young,

2836
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:49,340
[Seho：When we meet people while we're young, we could instantly become good friends.]

2837
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:49,330
somehow, we can become close friends right away.

2838
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:51,100
[But when we meet people as adults in society]

2839
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,700
[Seho：It would take some time to become good friends.]

2840
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:57,660
When making friends, I also take longer to become close to people.

2841

[When we work on a project together, 
we naturally become familiar with each other, right?]

I'll become friends with them.]

[Yes, be casual!]
