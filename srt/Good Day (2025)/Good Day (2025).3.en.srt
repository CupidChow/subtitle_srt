00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,740
Me.

179
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,700
[Charcoal is a must...]

180
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,460
[I thought you guys would've chosen meat and charcoal.]

181
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,620
[So I brought the vegetables...]

182
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,440
First of all,

183
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,840
we chose ingredients that aren't necessary.

184
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,760
All three.

185
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,870
Wait, so after this...

186
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,220
[No one will choose the meat, right?]

187
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,950
-Right?
-I doubt anyone will choose the meat.

188
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,600
I think the three of us thought too much.

189
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,180
[More and more unlikely to have any meat for dinner]

190
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,120
You're right.

191
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,800
-Two charcoal sets and one plate of vegetables.
-That's horrible.

192
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,970
There aren't many of them left.

193
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,450
-Next, Mr. Yim Siwan.
-Yes. Right now?

194
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,780
[You're leaving G-DRAGON and I alone!]

195
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,860
[Producer Taeho: Should we change the order?]
[Kwanghee: No.]

196
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,700
[Hey, Jiyong. Let's film a short video.]

197
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,860
[(Scooting away)]

198
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,860
Jiyong, come on. Let's film a short video!

199
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,490
[Jiyong. Let's film a short video!

200
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,659
[Push-and-pull between Kwanghee & Jiyong]

201
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,890
Can I film you?

202
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,900
[May I? Jiyong, what do you think of me?]

203
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,060
[Sigh...]

204
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,700
[How would I know what to choose?]

205
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,580
[Analyzing the situation quickly]

206
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,180
[What is most necessary?]

207
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,380
[We can eat without (the seasoning).]

208
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,420
[We can eat without (rice).]

209
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,340
[He's weighing the pros and cons.]

210
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,780
[Think it through!]

211
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,780
[Siwan, engineering graduate, analyzing hard and long]

212
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,620
[I think this was a popular choice...[

213
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,060
[Hesitating]

214
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,830
-Choose the meat.
-Please.

215
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,950
You'll score points with them with the meat!

216
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,340
[The black trio is anxious]

217
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,860
[Oh, please...]

218
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,860
Please!

219
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,700
[Do it! Be the hero!]

220
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,650
-You really chose that?
-Be the hero!

221
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,909
-Just once.
-You...

222
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,500
[Phew!]

223
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,020
-Just once.
-You...

224
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,179
[Siwan chose the ramyeon]

225
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,320
-Okay!
-I knew he would choose ramen.

226
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,390
We can just eat it like a shabu-shabu hotpot!

227
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,460
[It's a relief to have this, right?]

228
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,470
Right?

229
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,680
We at least have a meal now.

230
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,570
First we can cook the ramyeon.

231
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,860
It was unsettling with the first three.

232
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,420
[It was hopeless.]

233
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,780
[Look at our clothes!]

234
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,070
All black.

235
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,380
[Trio just so happened to be dressed in black, like charcoal]

236
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,210
-It was bad before.
-At least there's some color now.

237
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,540
[It's best if someone brings the meat in...]

238
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,800
-The meat's the most essential, right?
-Yes.

239
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,450
We need meat.

240
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,710
Look here, Jiyong.

241
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,300
[Clueless about the mission]

242
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,460
[But you look very... much like an idol in the photos.]

243
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,420
[Showing off their idol-like beauty]

244
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,580
[Producer Taeho: Kwang-hee, please go to the kitchen.]

245
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,140
[Now? Why? I'm fine staying here with GD...]

246
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,820
[Did you think that maybe I'm not?]

247
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,140
[Just kidding. Go and eat.]

248
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,320
I'll go cook.

249
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,220
[Where did everyone go?]

250
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,940
[Staff: Please choose one ingredient, and you can leave.]

251
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,860
[Choose one ingredient and leave?]

252
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,100
[(Serious)]
[We have to have good chemistry!]

253
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,870
If Kwanghee doesn't think too much,

254
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,140
[Hoping for Kwanghee's intuition]

255
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,530
-he may choose the meat.
-So we can have more meat.

256
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,340
[Jung Hae-in is good at grilling meat, so the charcoal.]

257
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,300
[Lee Soohyuk must've chosen the sauces!]

258
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,860
[I feel like Yim Siwan chose the vegetables.]

259
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,300
[Kim Soohyun is very reliable, so the meat.]

260
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,540
Jung Hae-in must've chosen what's essential.

261
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,420
[Baseless confidence]

262
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,420
[Think again! A bit more!]

263
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,180
[Is this part of testing our relationship?]

264
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,420
[I'll take this and leave!]

265
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,260
[Made his choice really quickly]

266
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,260
[I did well, didn't I?]

267
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,610
I did well, didn't I?

268
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,800
-Well done!
-Wait, who...

269
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,180
[Kwanghee chose the ramyeon]

270
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,970
See? Okay!

271
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,420
[(Sees the ramyeon)]

272
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,900
[What is this?]

273
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,850
It's okay. We can each have two bags of ramyeon each.

274
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,860
[(Super optimistic)]

275
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,540
[Why didn't anyone choose the meat?]

276
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,040
We have only one person left.

277
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,980
[Charcoal x2] [Vegetables x1] [Ramyeon x2]

278
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,750
We're screwed.

279
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,110
Do I just choose one?

280
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,740
[It's Jiyong's turn]

281
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,210
There are six of us, right?

282
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,500
[The ingredient Jiyong chooses]

283
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,340
[will be the key today!]

284
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,610
-Yes.
-The key.

285
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,610
-But what if...
-He picked up the meat!

286
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,460
Really?

287
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,930
He'll be the hero.

288
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,260
[He's considering between the meat and charcoal.]

289
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,340
[Suddenly using his cap for divination(?)]

290
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,390
Leave it to luck.

291
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,580
[Oh!] [Oh!]

292
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,820
[Oh!]

293
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,220
[Oh?]

294
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,780
[Hears familiar voices from somewhere]
[MCs are in the room]

295
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,370
He heard the sound outside.

296
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,780
[Power! Power, power!]

297
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,940
[Anyone there?]

298
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,940
[Ay!] [Oh!]

299
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,500
[(Urgent)
Anyone here?]

300
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,700
[Heyyyyyyyy!] [Ohhhh!]

301
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,940
[Heyyyyyyyy!] [Ohhhh!]

302
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,500
[What do you want me to do?]

303
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,740
[What do their reactions mean?]

304
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,180
[Heyyyyyyyy!] [Ahhhh!]
[Not the charcoal!]

305
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,900
[Then just tell me directly! If you're going to do this!]

306
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,740
[Ah, he's so cute.]

307
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,890
Say, ho!

308
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,220
[Ho!] [Ho!]

309
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,560
Say, ho!

310
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,020
[Ho...] [Ho...]

311
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,210
-Ho?
-Ho!

312
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,420
[Their cheering is confusing him even more]

313
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,630
-Ho!
-Ho?

314
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,300
[It's time to choose]

315
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,020
It's up to Yeongcheol now.

316
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,640
Yeongcheol's choice will decide their dinner.

317
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,340
[Please, Jiyong!]

318
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,230
Please! Pork belly!

319
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,060
[Filling their bellies with ramyeon... or having their fill with the meat...]

320
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,650
Please bring the meat!

321
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,120
It must be hard to be the last to choose.

322
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,580
[What is Jiyong's choice?]

323
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,490
Here he comes!

324
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,520
[Here he comes!]

325
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,930
[Will he be the hero or not?]

326
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,080
Is he the hero or the villain?

327
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,650
He's here.

328
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,110
He's here.

329
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,180
Jiyong! Jiyong!

330
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,900
[Ji Yong chose the meat]

331
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,840
[Wow!]

332
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,280
Jiyong! Jiyong!

333
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,490
[Wow!]

-Wow!
-Wow!

[Barbecue dinner completed dramatically in the last minute]

-Please, Jiyong! 
-Please, Jiyong!

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,240
[Good job! Good job!]

338
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,990
-Well done!
-Please, Jiyong.

[(Proud)]

340
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,200
This is the least I could do.

341
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,180
[Wow! How'd you know, Jiyong?]

342
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,100
[I felt a revelation from heaven.]

343
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,860
[When he made a choice]
[Oh!]

344
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,900
Anyone there?

345

[Hey!] [Oh!]

346
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,420
[In the end, they gave the ultimate hint]

347
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,400
[These busy guys gathered together here.]

348
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,680
[We can't just let them eat ramyeon...]

349
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,560
Yes, yes.

350
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,880
-Wow.
-Why did you choose this?

351
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,440
[Thanks to the kind production team, they got the meat]

352
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,930
That was a close call.

353
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,630
How did you chose this when you went last?

354
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,490
[I don't know why I picked it up.]

355
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,140

Stop looking at me like that.

3110
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,150
[The reckless younger ones]

3111
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:24,900
Sober up.

3112
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:25,400
[Getting dizzy from the reckless juniors]

3113
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:27,850
[Didn't you come to take pictures for me?]

3114
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:30,330
I think I haven't had anything taken yet.

3115
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:31,040
[How will it go with these fearless younger ones?]

3116
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,220
[Good Day]
