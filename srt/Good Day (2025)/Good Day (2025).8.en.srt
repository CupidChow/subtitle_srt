01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,780
[I think I saved your number twice]

1902
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,870
-I wonder why there're two Mr. Jiyong. -Mr. Jiyong?

1903
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:24,180
[Mr. Jiyong? Two Mr. Jiyong...]

1904
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,870
What I saved is "Mr. Jiyong".

1905
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,140
[Anyway, his special way of saving number has been discovered]

1906
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,740
[-I'm getting prepared] [-Anyway, What are you doing?]

1907
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:33,820
[We...]

1908
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,860
[We're going on a couple date today?]

1909
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:41,140
[A couple date with Kwanghee?]

1910
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,760
Did you just say that we're a couple?

1911
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:44,850
If you have feelings for someone at the same time,

1912
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,700
[Back when the popularity poll of the 88 Land took place]

1913
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,220
[Sweet and loving]

1914
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,290
We'll give you a gift too.

1915
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:49,360
I missed him. It's been five years.

1916
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,980
[I missed Jiyong a lot.]

1917
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,820
[Hwang Kwanghee, GD] [Kwon Jiyong, Kwanghee][Kwanghee and Jiyong finally chose each other.]

1918
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:55,160
No way! Jiyong chose me!

1919
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,820
[Kwang-hee is happy when he learned that they finally became a couple.]

1920
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,870
What's going on?

1921
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,230
-Is this cute?
-Make a cute expression.

1922
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:01,340
[Finally, a special day for two people.]

1923
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,340
[Heart fluttering. Did you just say we're a couple?]

1924
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:05,940
Did you just say we're a couple?

1925
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,740
[I'm so happy today.][I'm happy too.]

1926
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,940
[Really? Really?]

1927
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,590
-Tell me if you really mean it.
-No, it's fake.

1928
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,380
[Joking]

1929
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,540
[I can't help teasing Kwanghee.]

1930
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,670
You don't really mean that.

1931
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,420
[To be honest, I'm a little scared to go on a date with you alone.]

1932
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,940
[Huh? Why?]

1933
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:25,340
[No matter what kind of date it is. We'll be together.]

1934
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:23,720
[We'll be together. You know what I mean, right?]

1935
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,510
-It's just the two of us today. -We're doomed.

1936
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:28,320
-We're doomed.
-We'll have a sweet time, you know?

1937
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,700
[Kwanghee's flirting. We'll have a sweet time.]

1938
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,160
I won't be late.

1939
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,580
[You can be late. I won't be late.]

1940
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:33,890
-You can be late.
-No. This is precious to me.

1941
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,900
[Ha ha.] [These hours are precious to me.]

1942
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:35,730
Okay, see you later.

1943
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:39,180
[Ended the call with a mix of reluctance and invitation.]

1944
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:37,750
-See you later.
-Okay.

1945
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:40,270
-What a cheerful friend.

1946
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:44,660
[After the concert, I haven't been this relaxed in a long time.]

1947
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,900
[What will the first date with Kwanghee be like?]

1948
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,420
[The night falls.]

1949
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,340
[In spring night, GD&Kwang-hee's special date is about to begin.]

1950
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,170
Awesome.

1951
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,740
[Here. Over there.]

1952
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,660
[Looks very excited.]

1953
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,220
[This place makes you want to dance as soon as you arrive...]

1954
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,820
[An amusement park, the land of adventure and mystery.]

1955
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,980
[It's a mysterious world of childhood,]

1956
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,780
[a perfect spot for everyone, young and old, to enjoy dates and relax.]

1957
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,260
Isn't a date nice?

1958
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,780
[I want to go to the amusement park with Jiyong!]

1959
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,610
Excellent. I want to go to OOO with him.

1960
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,730
-So cute.
-I want to go to Lotte World with Jiyong.

1961
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,700
[It's GD's Sunflower, Kwanghee's wish.]

1962
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,250
I really want to go to the amusement park.

1963
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,980
[I want to go to the amusement park!]

1964
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:36,140
[It's also GD's wish to go to the amusement park.]

1965
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,200
I really want to go to the amusement park.

1966
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:40,420
[So we prepared couple tickets of the 88 Land as a gift.]

1967
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,260
[An amusement park for two people.]

1968
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,380
[Wow!]

1969
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,100
[Wow amazing!]

1970
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,540
[Wow!]

1971
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,140
[He glances left and right, intrigued.]

1972
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,460
[It's a fairy tale world.]

1973
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,340
[Meanwhile, on the other side of the bridge...]

1974
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:12,460
No one is here. Great.

1975
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,310
What's going on here?

1976
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,020
[This place was full of people!]

1977
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,220
[You prepared this for Jiyong and me?]

1978
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,720
What's going on? My life...

1979
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,420
[ICan't believe I can have a party with G Dragon like this!]

1980
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,380
Can't believe I can have a party with G Dragon like this!

1981
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,400
My god! Why is it just the two of us?

1982
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,020
[Very noisy.]

1983
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,180
[(Is he here?)]

1984
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,420
[Keep going, good days await.]

1985
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,820
I keep going, that's why.

1986
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,980
[Hide]

1987
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,700
[Will I see him if I get down there?]

1988
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,980
[Should I run away?]

1989
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,390
What's going on, Jiyong?

1990
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,940
[Playing hide-and-seek.]

1991
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,750
I haven't been on a date for ages.

1992
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,730
Is Jiyong right ahead?

1993
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:55,060
[An unconventional date of mutual avoidance...]

1994
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:55,690
I'm going crazy.

1995
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,660
[Put my legs away.]

1996
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,900
[Jiyong!]

1997
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,180
[Where are you?]

1998
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,140
[Silence]

1999
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,780
[This is driving me crazy. Where are you?]

2000
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:09,360
Jiyong!

2001
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:10,740
Over here!

2002
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:12,070
Jiyong!

2003
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:14,780
[Ah, here!]

2004
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,870
Jiyong, why are you hiding here?

2005
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,300
[Why are you hiding here?]

2006
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:20,130
Why are you on the wall?

2007
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:21,840
Why are you so handsome today?

2008
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:22,580
[Holding his hand tight.]

2009
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,360
What's going on? Come here!

2010
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,020
[Why did you bring flowers for you?]

2011
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,550
-Jiyong!
-Why did you bring flowers?

2012
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,260
[I prepared it for a real date.]

2013
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:29,500
Will you let me into your heart?

2014
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,660
[Touch]

2015
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,940
[Why? Give me a hug!]

2016
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,860
Jiyong, give me a hug!

2017
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:34,320
Give me a hug.

2018
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,940
[Finally, 88 Land couple's happy hug.]

2019
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,830
You just finished your concert yesterday, didn't you?

2020
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,380
[You... You just finished your concert yesterday, didn't you?]

2021
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,300
[It's like I'm having a concert today!]

2022
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:44,080
-It's like a concert today?
-Yes.

2023
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,180
[Why...?]

2024
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:46,980
[Cuz I'm feeling high!]

2025
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,280
Really?

2026
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,500
[Shall we do this?]

2027
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,780
[Jiyong.]

2028
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,900
[Boldly professing love with a bouquet.]

2029
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,910
If we're counting high school,

2030
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,300
[Haha. I'm your fan for almost 20 years.]

2031
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:55,190
I'm your fan for almost 20 years.

2032
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,890
This moment alone with you is pure bliss.

2033
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:58,260
[This moment alone with you is pure bliss.]

2034
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:59,630
Let's make magic tonight...

2035
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:00,560
Jiyong, please accept my heart.

2036
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,380
[Will you accept my heart?]

2037
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,440
Jiyong, please accept my heart.

2038
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,580
[Just... take your heart and...?]

2039
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,420
[No, don't throw it away!]

2040
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,940
[I'm kidding. I'll take it. Hahaha.]

2041
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,080
-I'll treature it.
-Thank you.

2042
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:12,560
Your clothes... You dress up
like a prince today.

2043
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,100
[He dressed up like a prince!]

2044
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:16,040
Jiyong. Isn't this a shirt
only a prince wears?

2045
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,940
[Really?]

2046
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:19,940
[Today... the prince of fairy tales?]

2047
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:19,070
We're in fairy tale today.

2048
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,240
-Go!
-What? Hurry up!

2049
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,620
[Go!]

2050
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,500
[We have to go now. We don't have much time.]

2051
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:25,500
Not much time? Let's go!

2052
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,900
[Are we in a fairy tale now? Quick! Let’s chase magic before the crescent fanes!]

2053
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:32,260
[Are we Cinderella? Entering the land of fairy tale!]

2054
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:29,620
Are we Cinderella?

2055
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:32,550
-Let's go to the land of fairy tales.
-He's holding my hand. Awesome!

2056
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:35,060
[Holding hands and running under the moon.]

2057
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,650
How awesome is that!

2058
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,660
[Where are we going?]

2059
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,360
Jiyong!

2060
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:40,930
But, I heard we can only stay here
until midnight.

2061
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,540
[But, I heard this place only opens until midnight.]

2062
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:42,470
It's like Cinderella.

2063
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:45,340
-Has it been that long?
-Way longer than I realized!

2064
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,700
[Amusement park. Wow! I haven't been here for a long time.]

2065
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,510
-What about you?
-I haven't been here for a long time.

2066
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,420
[What about you? They haven't been here for ages.]

2067
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,840
-Right.
-Since we are here, we have to play that!

2068
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,460
[Since we are here, we have to play that!]

2069
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,980
-What? Where?
-And your song!

2070
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,140
[And your song.]

2071
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,280
-"GYRO-DROP."
-Yes.

2072
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,450
-The Drop Tower?
- Sure. Let's ride!

2073
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:57,180
[70m Jump machine (*Note: GD has a song called "GYRO-DROP.")]

2074
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,300
Are you good with all these?

2075
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,220
[I like amusement facilities.]

2076
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,980
[You love these? Oh, this is my paradise!]

2077
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,060
[Why don't you look at me?]

2078
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,000
There are many things to see.

2079
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,060
[Busy looking around, no time to look at you.]

2080
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,290
There's a lot to see.

2081
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:11,260
There are only the two of us here.
You're right.

2082
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,640
What?

2083
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,580
[Where did you get the toy gun?]

2084
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:17,150
I'm sorry. That's not what I meant. Where did this come from?

2085
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,100
[A gunfight in the moonlight suddenly begins.]

2086
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,300
[Haha]

2087
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,940
No, I... I…

2088
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,140
[(Act as being shot first)]

2089
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,900
[Phew… Where did this come from?]

2090
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,090
Where did you get that?

2091
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,610
-I prepared it just now. 
-Don't fool me.

2092
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,660
[Glibly: I prepared it just now.]

2093
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,860
[He found the toy gun by chance.]

2094
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,860
I didn't know what this was either.

2095
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,830
You look like a character from Romeo and Juliet.

2096
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,740
[One more shot!]

2097
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:30,540
And for me,

2098
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,540
[It may not be something special to you.]

2099
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:35,660
[(For me too!) These few hours is really special.]

2100
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,220
[It's hard to do the editing. I'm just helping the crew.]

2101
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:40,790
[Add some GD bombs like this.]

2102
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,060
[Add some GD bombs!]

2103
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,460
[GD added sound effect himself]

2104
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:44,860
Bang! Bang! Bang!

2105
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,110
Bang! Bang! Bang!

2106
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:47,980
[One joke can make the two mates excited.]

2107
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,400
It happens sometimes.

2108
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,820
[But if only the two of us ride it, won't it be a bit scary?]

2109
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,860
I feel strange and scared.

2110
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:57,780
[He suddenly can't be excited now that he's near it.]

2111
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:59,460
-Sit down. 
-I'll wait a minute. OK?

2112
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,500
[Sitting down first]

2113
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:02,090
You look like a prince today.

2114
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,260
[I'm a little nervous]

2115
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,700
[Is this okay?]

2116
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,790
-Is this okay? 
-What's wrong?

2117
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,820
[He's only interested in selfies.]

2118
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:09,890
No, I think... This is the first time I've played like this.

2119
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,780
[It's the first time to play like this.]

2120
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,780
[If it's just the two of us, it won't lose balance and fall over, will it?]

2121
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,940
I think it'll tilt this way.

2122
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,620
[I'm afraid it'll tilt this way.]

2123
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,260
[Starting to worry about all kinds of things]

2124
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,020
Put it down?

2125
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,100
[The time I can spend with you alone—I think today will be the last time in the short run.
After today, The next time we meet will be 10 years later, right?
Still nervous]

2126
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,170
Do you like this kind of playground? I like it.

2127
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,140
[Unlike five minutes ago when he was calm and relaxed...]

2128
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,700
[(Mumbling) It's been a while since I last rode this. I'm half excited and half nervous.]

2129
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,720
I think we meet once every 10 years.

2130
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,490
We haven't met since the ending of "HwangTaeJi" Event.

2131
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,940
[Kwanghee keeps talking.]

2132
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,120
-Everything's ready. 
-Okay.

2133
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,580
[Staff: Everything's ready.]

2134
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:36,690
-Shall we start right away? 
-Can you take a photo for us?

2135
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:38,300
[Can you take a photo for us?]

2136
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,950
-Okay, I got it. 
-A selfie angle.

2137
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,230
Take a photo with the new selfie mode.

2138
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,420
[There are so many cameras on us. Do we really need to take a photo with your phone? Hahaha.]

2139
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,160
Jiyong, this is the P.C. that the Millennials and Gen Z would use.

2140
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,060
[You need to take a photo with a P.C.]

2141
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,640
What is P.C.? A personal camera?

2142
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,700
[Holding hands tightly]

2143
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:45,720
Look that way.

2144
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,420
[Smiling]

2145
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,460
-Thank you. 
-Thank you.

2146
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,300
Jiyong, are you really not scared?

2147
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:52,180
[Jiyong, are you really not scared?]

2148
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,300
[Relaxed]

2149
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,410
I think my soul will get out for a minute.

2150
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,310
It's starting!

2151
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:57,880
It's starting!

2152
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,140
[(Right now) (Start) (At once)]

2153
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,660
[-It's scary. Let's hold hands!
-No.]

2154
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,610
-Why not? 
-Hold your own hands.

2155
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,780
[Hold your own hands!]

2156
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:06,840
So stingy. Oh my.

2157
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:09,140
Let's try other rides later.

2158
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,340
[Look at that castle!]

2159
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:14,420
-It's supposed to stop sometime while it turns. 
-Yes.

2160
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,220
[They first see a magnificent castle.]

2161
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,979
[There are only the two of us here!]

2162
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:21,069
There are only the two of us here! Only G-Dragon and me!

[Current location: 10m]

2165
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:24,740
It's always there.

2166
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:25,910
For example, when you're in a hotel,

2167
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:27,840
-If you stop here... 
-No!

2168
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:29,260
[(Still relaxed)]

2169
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:30,700
-I'm going crazy! 
-H-O-T-E-L.

2170
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,380
[Meanwhile, Kwanghee is starting to react.]

2171
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,540
Stop it, Jiyong.

2172
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:33,260
[Jiyong!]

2173
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,540

[Let's get it~]

2175

[Very quickly, they're almost 50 meters high.]

2176
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,460
[It's getting farther from the ground.]

2177
01:08:42,529 --> 01:08:45,630
I'm going crazy. Jiyong, hold on tight to this.

2178
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,060
[-Jiyong, hold on tight to this.
-This looks like that, you know?]

2179
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,319
This looks like that, you know?

2180
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,680
-I told you to hold tight. 
-You can't resist gravity.

2181
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:50,340
[The soul is out. They start to talk past each other.]

2182

-Will the gravity grow? 
-In the sky garden.

01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,540
[I was getting a bit of work done.]

2412
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:06,580
[No pushing, no slapping.]

2413
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:09,060
[A story of staying well-behaved 
for the sake of his face.]

2414
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,270
So that's how it is.

2415
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:09,140
Jiyong

2416
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:13,980
[Kwanghee: If you could go back to high school, 
would you still be a singer?
I started in middle school.]

2417
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:16,990
-Already a singer?
- Since middle school.

2418
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,100
[(Already a singer)]

2419
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:21,110
What would you want to do 
if you could go back?

2420
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,940
[What would you want to do 
if you could go back?]

2421
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,980
[Collecting memories from student days!]

2422
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,160
You didn’t have those?

2423
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,900
[G-Dragon’s student days — 
no memory of school trips.]

2424
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:34,610
-Because I was always in the practice room.
 - You were a trainee.

2425
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:37,020
[A student life completely devoted 
to practice.]

2426
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:35,740
Seriously.

2427
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:37,510
Yeah, like that.

2428
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,090
Jiyong, here.

2429
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,060
[Oof, I’m starving — 
snacks incoming!]

2430
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:40,800
I was starving.

2431
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,500
[So happy I froze in place.]

2432
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,700
[Big bite]

2433
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:47,500
Is it good?

2434
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,740
[Snacks = high energy boost.]

2435
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:01,220
[We gotta hurry up and ride it~ 
It’s almost midnight!]

2436
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,820
You want this seat? 
Do you like sitting at the end or in the middle?

2437
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,860
[Which part of the pirate ship 
do they prefer?]

2438
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:05,560
-The end.
 - The end.

2439
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,340
[The end!]

2440
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:06,280
Then here.

2441
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:08,980
[Kwanghee: You go there. Jiyong, I’ll go here.]

2442
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,270
Hey!

2443
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:09,150
What?

2444
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:10,870
Let’s sit separately.

2445
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:13,340
[Sitting at each end of the pirate ship.]

2446
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,780
[Precious snacks go in the pocket.]

2447
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:17,420
[Aww, but I can’t see you~]

2448
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,100
[You wanna see me~~?]

2449
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:22,000
I’m right here. Look all you want, Jiyong.

2450
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:22,980
[(Can’t see a thing)]

2451
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,540
[Used to go up to the rooftop 
in school uniforms.]

2452
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:26,590
Scream, scream.

2453
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:29,460
[Heart-to-heart on the pirate ship.]

2454
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,000
Yeah, didn’t we all do that?

2455
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:28,700
Let’s do it too.

2456
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:31,520
Say the things we’ve been keeping inside.

2457
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,820
[Opening up to each other.]

2458
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,780
[Everyone~ good news~]

2459
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:36,860
[The amusement park closes at 12~]

2460
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,260
[It’ll be over soon haha.]

2461
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,540
[Get ready for a two-person-only ride.]

2462
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,700
[Excited]

2463
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:46,100
What’s happening?

2464
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:47,780
[The pirate ship starts moving.]

2465
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,260
Let’s go.

2466
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,260
[Excited]

2467
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,010
Just the two of us!

2468
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:56,300
[-Kwanghee~! 
-Jiyong!! ]
[The pirate ship rises on Jiyong’s side]

2469
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:00,060
[It’s almost midnight!!! Let’s go home~!!]

2470
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,180
[Screaming true feelings into the wind.]

2471
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:04,780
[We can’t go home yet! 
10 minutes left! So much left to say!!]

2472
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:09,780
[It’s all your fault! What is this even~!!!]

2473
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,020
I know you didn’t mean that!

2474
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,300
[Denying reality]

2475
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:15,660
[The pirate ship goes even higher.]

2476
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,380
[Giggling — No, I’m actually really happy~]

2477
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:21,040
That’s all you’re gonna say?

2478
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,660
[(Didn’t hear it anyway)]

2479
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,860
[Sincere words lost in the wind.]

2480
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,900
[Jiyong~ thanks for 
always looking out for me!]

2481
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,460
[Shy — I didn’t look out for you!]

2482
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,060
[Shy]

2483
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:34,380
[You always act like that 
but take care of me anyway~]

2484
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,580
[I’m really lucky to have you.]

2485
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,940
[You always tag me 
in your posts on social media!]

2486
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:41,380
[Heart racing from shared feelings.]

2487
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:43,620
[The pirate ship carries all the feels.]

2488
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:43,780
Jiyong~

2489
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,220
[Keep singing forever!]

2490
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:48,860
[I didn’t hear what you said just now.]

2491
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,180
Is my pronunciation that bad?

2492
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,260
[Can’t hear but still excited.]

2493
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,420
Jiyong~

2494
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,380
[Would you choose 'hyung' Hyungdon or me~?]

2495
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:55,780
['Hyung'...]

2496
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,060
[Bittersweet]

2497
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:58,500
[Can’t beat him after all…]

2498
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:00,740
[We’re friends, right?!]

2499
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,930
Jiyong~ this is nice.

2500
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,500
[Friends is fine too...]

2501
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:08,340
[-Jiyong~ thanks! 
-Me too~]

2502
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,580
[Hearts finally connected.]

2503
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,620
Jiyong, from now on,

2504
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:12,380
[I’ll stay in touch more often.]

2505
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:15,220
[The king of mixed signals — 
“Maybe I’ll be busy~”]

2506
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:15,510
Maybe I’ll be busy.

2507
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:19,210
Let’s keep this kind of distance.

2508
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,380
[Let’s keep this kind of distance.]

2509
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:20,900
This far?

2510
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,860
[Friendship with space.]

2511
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,900
[Just kidding. 
A little sad. Isn’t this… too far?]

2512
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:25,640
This was so fun.

2513
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,220
[I’m satisfied.]

2514
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:27,600
It was so fun.

2515
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,060
[The pirate ship was awesome~!!]

2516
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,980
Wasn’t it fun?

2517
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:32,740
-So fun 
- Right?

2518
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:34,060
[So fun~
 Can we ride it one more time?]

2519
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,320
Now that we’ve done something exciting.

2520
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:38,060
[What’s next on the date route? 
Let’s calm down a bit~]

2521
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,170
Let’s calm down a little.

2522
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:41,180
[Let’s ride something spinny~]

2523
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:43,340
[Carousel — let’s go sit on the merry-go-round~]

2524
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,500
[Instant understanding]

2525
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:47,180
If you want a horse...

2526
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:51,700
[It’s gotta be 
Gangnam Style-level to be satisfying.]

2527
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,390
Do it like this?

2528
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:57,980
[I wanna take one last pic in front of the carousel, 
and do a challenge with you.]

2529
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:01,420
[What challenge~? 
I’m filming a challenge right now~?]

2530
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,300
What challenge is this?

2531
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,820
[Couple date challenge.]

2532
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,400
Wait, is this a “pain endurance challenge”?

2533
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,940
[A surprisingly difficult 
challenge underway.]

2534
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,610
No no.

2535
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:09,740
[Happy — big bites — you’re happy, right~?]

2536
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:09,930
So cute.

2537
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,980
[It’s already midnight...]

2538
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:17,460
[The park goes quiet like magic wore off.]

2539
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:26,540
[Creak~ the carousel turns alone.]

2540
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:28,600
Then...

2541
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:29,990
What happened?

2542
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:31,340
[What’s that?]

2543
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,980
[Wait, someone’s there…! 
In a school uniform?!]

2544
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:38,300
[Someone riding the carousel alone.]

2545
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:38,370
What are they doing? It’s midnight

2546
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:42,300
[??: Still riding the merry-go-round at this age?
 Oh man…]

2547
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,020
[They’re all horses, right?!]

2548
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,750
No.

2549
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,940
[Is that... a cow? LOL!]

2550
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:49,140
[Something’s off here…]

2551
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,120
But he is wearing a school uniform.

2552
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:53,500
[A parent who borrowed his kid’s uniform.]

2553
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:52,080
It’s 12, this place should be

2554
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,510
closed.

2555
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,200
But then...

2556
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,380
[Whoosh—]

2557
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:56,900
No way.

2558
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:01,380
['Hyung', wait for me...!]

2559
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,400
Even the cameras followed!

2560
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:05,970
Is this like Stairway to Heaven or what?

2561
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,540
['Hyung'!!]

2562
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:09,670
What’s wrong?

2563
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:12,220
[I can’t catch you...]

2564
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,820
Please stop it.

2565
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:13,990
'Hyung'

2566
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,980
[Enchanted and forgotten – 
a love lost to magic.]

2567
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:19,500
Please stop it, I’m gonna throw up.

2568
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:19,580
[Love always comes back around.]

2569
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:21,460
[When did you get here?!]

2570
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:23,580
[I’ve been spinning for 8 hours.]

2571
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,310
I’ve been spinning for 8 hours.

2572
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:30,300
[Can’t stop — it’s been 8 hours.]

2573
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,020
[Oof seriously!]

2574
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,620
[Okay then, love comes back...]

2575
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,420
[Twists and turns —
 love finds its place again...]

2576
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:39,550
Love finds its place again.

2577
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:43,580
[Happy]

2578
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:43,920
'Hyung'’s been on for 8 hours?!

2579
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,860
[Look at how happy he is.]

2580
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:48,970
Why is 'hyung' so casual with him, 
Jiyong still likes him.

2581
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:49,300
[Kwanghee’s love ends in tragedy.]

2582
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:51,060
['Hyung'!]

2583
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:52,190
