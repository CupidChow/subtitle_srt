00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,100
Don't they say a couple should go somewhere?

1726
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,820
[Your place? Let's go home…]

1727
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,300
[Oh my!]

1728
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,860
[Go back to my place]

1729
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,430
Alright, let's not tell anyone. Is that it?

1730
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,380
[The most excited]

1731
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,500
[Jiyong is really good at picking up your joke!]

1732
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:50,570
What?

1733
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,210
-He's good at picking up your joke.
-He's nice.

1734
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:54,260
[Jiyong! The 88 Land's perfect couple]

1735
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,230
Jiyong!

1736
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,740
We all came here with matching clothes.

1737
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,060
[They came with matching clothes]

1738
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,020
[We're like Boys II Men, because there are four of us.]

1739
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,870
But everyone is a little different.

1740
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,140
[Look, the same black jackets and jeans]

1741
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:01,760
Really?

1742
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,260
Yes, a little.

1743
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,100
[A surprise gift for the fans]

1744
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,860
[MV of Telepathy]

1745
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,580
[They'll shoot with their own personalities]

1746
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,900
[The four of us really... look like a group.]

1747
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,500
[You are a group.]

1748
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,860
[ZE:A is a real group]
[A past that has been forgotten for a while]

1749
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,030
What are you talking about?

1750
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,490
It's a real group.

1751
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,240
I forgot. This group is novel.

1752
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,780
[At least the costume is an idol group]

1753
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,420
-It's novel. 
-Right?

1754
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,420
[Oh! Jung Hae-in!]

1755
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,150
-Hello. 
-You're here.

1756
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,630
I thought we're shooting a movie when I saw Hae-in.

1757
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,940
[Oh… When I saw Hae-in…]

1758
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,660
[I thought we're shooting a movie!]

1759
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,740
[He just looks like someone in a movie]

1760
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,560
I thought we're shooting a movie.

1761
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,100
[I thought you came to catch me.]
[The theme changed. I thought he was from "Veteran."]

1762
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,460
-You're so handsome. 
-How have you been?

1763
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,300
[The swagger of black leather jackets]

1764
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,020
[We really…]

1765
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,320
Look like a group.

1766
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,260
[After Hae-in joined, the 5-member group is complete.]

1767
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,800
-Yes. That's what I meant. 
-Right?

1768
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:53,700
Your beret is so pretty.

1769
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:57,460
[The 5-member group suddenly get along]

1770
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,490
He's a doll. He's a doll.

1771
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,120
I wear it to match today's song style.

1772
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,520
'Hyung'!

1773
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,410
We're not buying.

1774
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,180
[We're not buying!]

1775
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,740
[I'm not here to sell things…]

1776
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,070
-We… 
-Not bad, huh?

1777
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,140
[We...]

1778
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:06,630
-Hello, 'hyung'. 
-We were talking before Hae-in came in…

1779
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,740
[G-DRAGON: We were talking before Hae-in came in…]

1780
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,180
That we were like a group.

1781
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,940
[We were like a group]

1782
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:09,010
Really?

1783
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,200
Is it because I'm too bling-bling?

1784
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,380
[G-DRAGON: We debut today.]

1785
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,250
-So you'll be the MC…
-Of course!

1786
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,540
[Of course I am the MC! Be the MC today…]

1787
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,280
I'm the MC.

1788
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,820
[It's okay! Sit here, Siwan!]

1789
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:20,800
Oh, your shoes.

1790
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,020
[They'll come in throngs later!]

1791
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,020
They'll come in throngs later!

1792
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,500
[Are all the members recording together today?]

1793
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,500
[G-DRAGON: I contacted everyone. Anyone who has time today will record first.]

1794
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,300
[Everyone is busy, so we're recording according to each person's schedule.]

1795
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,300
So, we're doing it separately.

1796
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,420
Because everyone is busy.

1797
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,520
Yes.

1798
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:38,540
[Today's schedule: Personal part recording & MV shooting]

1799
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,300
[Let's start with the song.]

1800
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,900
[Now, some people are already very familiar with each other.]

1801
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,020
Yes, yes.

1802
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,380
Some people have never met before.

1803
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,900
[Cooperate, meanwhile]
[G-DRAGON: Some people have never met before.]

1804
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,040
We need you to cooperate with each other,

1805
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,480
and meanwhile, make the song fun.

1806
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,140
[Make the song fun]

1807
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,820
[It's a project that everyone is working on.]

1808
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,230
Telepathy plus...

1809
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,780
[The existing song, Telepathy] [Plus!]

1810
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,660
-Dosi Brothers'…
-Plus…

[And then everything was sorted out!]

00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,900
Really?

1816
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,340
[The lyrics are art!
♫I'm going to knock on your window with the moonlight of love♫]

1817
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:10,680
There's a line of the lyrics saying…

1818
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:16,810
♫Wrap a bouquet of roses with paper♫

1819
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:18,940

[I might be influenced unconsciously...]

1835

[Hey... What does that mean, Jiyong?]

1862
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,980
Why are you so sure they'll miss it now that they haven't sung yet?

1863

[Maybe there will be another person who will miss it?]

-Really? 
-We haven't sung yet.

1865
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,480
Because I think I'll be that person.

1866
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:54,480
This might be the result even if you sing.

1867
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,100
[So some people actually don't care if they've cleared their throat.]

1868

No!

-It's nice.

[It started with a retro vibe.]

1878

[The first section starts with Telepathy.
With just one glance, we know it.
With just a brush of our sleeves, and we feel it all.

there is no correct answer.

[There's no correct answer to the song.]

1888
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,730

[The point is singing the part you want.]

01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,340
[Panic. Because you give me... The feeling of an brainy person...]

2912
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,990
I didn't go to college.

2913
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,060
[Hurt(?)]

2914
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:10,300
[He didn't mean to interrupt the conversation...]

2915
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,140
I think he's brainy.

2916
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:12,820
[He has this charm. That's why Jiyong likes him.]

2917
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:12,710
Right?

2918
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:13,900
[No!]

2919
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:15,050
No?

2920
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:16,990
I don't like him!

2921
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:17,500
[Hyungdon's charm is unknown.]

2922
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,980
Have you heard this song many times?

2923
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,140
["Telepathy" Have you heard this song many times?]

2924
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,740
[It's from our time.]

2925
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:20,820
Really?

2926
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:21,890
When we were in elementary school.

2927
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:24,020
[Dosi Brothers was popular in Hyungdon's childhood. ]

2928
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:23,120
It’s a popular song, right?

2929
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:24,120
Dosi Brothers. Needless to say.

2930
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:28,450
It's like young people nowadays listen
to DAY6's songs.

2931
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,740
[Just like the young people]

2932
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:29,620
[listen to DAY6's song.]

2933
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,530
I see.

2934
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:30,110
Thank you.

2935
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:31,180
[Thank you.]

2936
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,220
I know their song.

2937
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,980
[Beautiful]

2938
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,900
[The way you looked at me]

2939
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:42,540
[But are there people who likes you]

2940
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:46,580
[just like this song?]

2941
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:46,160
It's really like this when we were kids.

2942
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:49,750
DAY6 kids couldn't fully understand this song.

2943
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:50,500
[By the way DAY6 kids can't fully understand this song yet.]

2944
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,540
[Let's practice the whole song first.]

2945
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:54,720
Of course.

2946
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,940
[Sure!]

2947
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,980
[Let professional find the feeling first?]

2948
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,020
[Objection ... Ah it's a bit dangerous.]

2949
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,180
[Objection 2 I think we'll be very discouraged.]

2950
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,260
[You and Ji Yong can guide DAY6 together.]

2951
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,660
[If you're gonna do that, I'll leave now.]

2952
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,010
-Why?
-But...

2953
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:12,140
I do know something.

2954
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:15,110
What's your style of giving guidance?

2955
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:15,940
[Hyungdon's guidance...]

2956
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:17,340
[Keep cursing!]

2957
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:17,530
Keep cursing.

2958
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:21,660
[I can't stand it! I scolded Defconn so badly.]

2959
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:19,630
Really?

2960
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,520
I scolded Defconn real bad.

2961
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,300
[Mom give me some beans.]

2962
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,980
[Because it feels like giving it to dad.]

2963
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:27,670
I was very angry.

2964
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,940
[I mean these are good kids.]

2965
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,780
[Fancson is also great. That's not what I mean.]

2966
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:37,130
That's not what I mean.

2967
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,660
[Defconn started singing hip-hop in 1998. Hahaha.]

2968
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:40,690
That's not what I meant.

2969
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:41,910
The friends here can also do very well on their own.

2970
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,420
[Sweating]

2971
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:43,930
You don't have to give a scolding.

2972
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,960
First, let's take a look at the members of DAY6.

2973
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:48,460
[Hope DAY6 won't get a scolding (?)]
[Let's go!]

2974
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,350
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go.

2975
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,020
[Shall we simply sing like a chorus?]

2976
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:58,980
That is, we can sing like a chorus in the later part.

2977
01:22:56,380 --> 01:23:01,260
[They plan to sing together first, just like a chorus]

2978
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,100
That's good too.

2979
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:02,430
Dowoon can sing together too.

2980
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:05,660
[Drummer Dowoon will sing together too!]

2981
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,490

[What are you thinking? Where are you?]

2986
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,700

Okay.

2994
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,730
