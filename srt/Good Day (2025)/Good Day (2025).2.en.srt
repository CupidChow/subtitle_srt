245
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,140
But since I quit smoking, I started drinking even more.

246
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,740

258
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,180
It was really tough at first.

259
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,590
But luckily, I told myself I won't drink anywhere else

260
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,060
except with my wife. I clung onto that.

261
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,860
And my wife doesn't drink at all. She never drinks.

262
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,020
So just drinking with my wife

263
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,590
is basically not drinking at all.

264

It's just... a change of perspective,

265

Like the design of the cut by my mouth,

that was my idea too.

299

Even that?

300
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,180
While I was thinking about how to play the character,

301
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,620
I was flipping through magazines.

302
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,210
That's how I got inspiration for my hairstyle and stuff, and I made suggestions.

303
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,780
Because, especially for small roles

304
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,820
where you don't get much exposure,

305
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,900
your appearance is really important.

306
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,860
Only then can you become a part of the work

307
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,350
and it also enhances the main character better.

308
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,040
-Right, a greater contrast.
-Yes, a contrast.

309
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,280
It was really fun.

I really liked the film when I was young.

311
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,900
So by my own standards,

312
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,420
I think I act better when I'm not the main lead.

313
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,230
But I think I know what you mean. I know that feeling.

314
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,100
Because when I play the lead, I feel a greater responsibility.

315
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,020
Yes, I think I get it.

316
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,900
Since I'm responsible for the whole project, even if my character expression suffers,

317
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,200
I have to prioritize the big picture.

318
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,230
But as a supporting role, since the lead's someone else,

319
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,740
I can just focus on my role.

320
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,700
I think I'm less at ease as a solo artist too.

321

-Really?
-It's more relaxing as a group.

That's why I had it easier during MAMA.

323
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,540
Oh, so that's why. I get it now.

324

I could feel that excitement through the TV.

335

That is what's cool about singers.

345

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,780
When I perform on stage, I realized that

348
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,620
maybe this is why singers like doing concerts.

349
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,500
Interacting with the audience in real time.

350
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,500
The energy you can only feel at the scene of the concert.

351
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,700
You can't experience it anywhere else.

352
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,380
It's a unique experience with the audience that is so valuable.

353
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,610
So when I perform on stage,

354
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,740
I wonder if that's it.

355
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,380
I wonder about it sometimes.

356
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,500
I have something to ask you.

357
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,860
It's not that serious. But it's quite important to me.

358
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,150
I'm sure you relate too.

359
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,860
After I became the lead and then did many lead roles,

360
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,740
people around me always say I'm doing great, that I'm the best.

361
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,530
-"Well done." They only say good things.
-People around you.

362
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:57,540
-I want to hear honest and detailed feedback.
-From an objective standpoint.

363
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,620
That's what I want.

364
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,570
But I never get those feedback.

365
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,500
So I have to do it myself.

366
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,930
I find it really tough to judge my acting by myself.

367
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,620
[That's really tough...]

368
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,270
It's tough.

369
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,260
So what I'm curious about is, you made eight songs yourself,

370
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,180
where you're the producer,

371
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,390
and you need to judge everything yourself. Isn't it tough?

372
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,420
How did you do it?

373
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,810
Ah, that's... it's really tough.

374
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
I think from a certain moment, I no longer

375
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,660
judge it based on how good it is.

376
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,860
Because it's music.

377
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,820
Maybe I'm lucky. I'm not sure.

378
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,850
-I'm not absolutely sure the music I make will do well with the public.
-Right.

379
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,970
It takes me a long time exploring and figuring things out.

380
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,600
So I'm only back after 7 years and 4 months.

381
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,060
Rather than focusing on how it'll fare,

382
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,100
I switched to deciding based on whether I'm satisfied with it

383
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,000
from some point.

384
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,140
I see.

385
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,140
Doing it this way,

386
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,320
I feel like I have less regrets.

387
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,670
-No matter if it fared well or not.
-I see.

388
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,700
['Hyung'... this...]

389
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,580
-Project?
-This project.

390
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,620
Do you know what this project is about?

391
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,270
First, GD will be the producer.

392
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,570
We'll gather and then use the proceeds for good.

393
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,140
After hearing these two things, I agreed immediately.

394
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,140
They also told us a lot of things,

395
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,220
but I didn't want to know.

396
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,460
Because if I knew...

397
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,860
I feel like I'd prepare too much for it.

398
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,660
What matters is you're the producer

399
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,220
and the proceeds are used for good.

400
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,820
Actually those two points

401
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,500
are the main points.

402
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,900
So I wanted to persuade people I know to join first.

403
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,180
I first met up with Hyungdon.

404
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,100
I asked him for help

405
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,130
to invite artists.

406
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,600
Then he asked me who I was close to.

407
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,060
So I mentioned you,

408
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,339
but he didn't believe me.

409
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,660
You asked how I knew you.

410
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,819
"How do you know him?"

411
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,980
[We're close]

412
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,260
We're close.

413
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,040
Very close.

414
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,859
When I first was offered to join,

415
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,170
I was worried if I'm suited for this.

416
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,700
Is it alright for an old man like me to join all these youngsters?

417
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,000
Whatever! I want to do it!

418
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,359
But everyone were really quick to agree.

419
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,620
Just like you, rather than other reasons,

420
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,320
it's because it's a good cause.

421
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,400
Yeah.

422
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,220
So during all my meetings,

423
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,850
I'm gathering inspiration and ideas.

424
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,050
Don't you play instruments too?

425
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:42,800
Instruments?

426
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,100
For me, it's just a hobby.

427
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,220
A little bit, just a bit, the clarinet?

428
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,020
That's about it.

429
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,460
I remember you playing the guitar in films too.

430
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,340
Yes, when I was younger.

431
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,740
Then can you be in the band?

432
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,020
What are you talking about? I'll ruin it!

433
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,740
[Startled]

434
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,680
Call actual musicians to play

435
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,300
[I told you I'm a supporting role]

436
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,420
the accompaniment.

437
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,340
They'll agree if you tell them it's for a good cause.

438
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,980
Everyone should have an instrument.

439
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,100
[Brimming with ideas after teasing his 'hyung']

440
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,970
Actually, a new song is great too...

441
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,260
Our group did a cover song too.

442
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,260
-We did a remake of "Sunset Glow."
-Yes, yes.

443
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,100
Depending on the singer

444
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,300
-and the arrangement of the song...
-It becomes totally different.

445
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,560
I think it'd be nice to reinterpret an old song too.

446
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,410
It's a good idea.

447
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,540
Actually, in some way,

448
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,790
I can truly say I am a "K-pop" artist

449
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,790
because I grew up listening to Korean songs.

450
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,130
-That's my real foundation.
-That's right.

451
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,220
In Korea, we have this unique style

452
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,340
of melody and having fun.

453
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,390
What that is

454
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,860
is something that belongs to many Koreans,

455
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,260
where we eat and grow up on this land,

456
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,500
while getting disciplined...

457
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,100
-Yes, naturally.
-Something that naturally becomes a part of you.

458
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,130
-It's in our bones.
-Yes.

459
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,730
Old songs?

460
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,980
What songs do you like?

461
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,280
I don't really...

462
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,020
Do you have a favorite song you always sing?

463
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,340
For me...

464
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,020
The songs I always sing in the karaoke are...

465
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,060
songs by Mr. Kim Hyunsik.

466
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,770
I was a huge fan in high school.

I don't have them now. But I used to collect his vinyls.

471

I even went to his concerts.

472
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,560
You've seen him live?

473
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,820
Yes, I did!

474
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,500

Or some convention center at hotels?

483
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,260
I think it's really lucky that I've gotten

484
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,980
to know these songs from Korean veteran singers since an early age.

485
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,780
I see.

486
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,180
Up till today, I still sing songs by "Sanulrim."

487
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,660
My song "Crooked" came about

488
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,700
while I was humming after coming up with the beats,

489
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,230
and I couldn't come up with the lyrics.

490
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,850
I wanted something explosive to express my desires.

[Something to express his energy]

Then suddenly, I thought of Kang Sanae's "Crooked"...

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,140

-Yes.

[I never had the chance to talk about this anywhere else.]

506

-So cool.

[GD’s music is greatly influenced by his seniors]

510

It's a great way to nurture your artistry. Everyone should listen to more songs.

511
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,220
It's the same for me. From the films I watched when I was young,

512

the things I got from them

513
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,490
will unconsciously seep into my acting.

514
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,740
I really agree.

515
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,400

It's really...

550
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,260
Listening to the song as a musician,

551
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,340
-the progression of the melody sounds very complex.
-Really?

552
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,980
It's either really fast or really slow throughout.

553
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,860
But gradually...

554
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,810
-It gets cheerful, then...
-Intensifies a lot, yes.

-Like this.
-No wonder when I sing it in karaoke,

-I always want to throw the mic away.
-It's...

558

I can't sing this!

559
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:08,410
In terms of genres, it blends three or four genres seamlessly.

560

Think about it. With this energy, if you keep performing your songs

1542
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,180
[My muscles are amazing right now.]

1543
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,020
[Fainting]

1544
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,830
Please pay attention to Kim Soohyun.

1545
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:56,770
-That kind of reaction encourages him.
-It leaves a good impression.

1546
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,700
[That kind of reaction encourages him.]

1547
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,170

1548
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,220
[Soohyun gives Kwanghee strength through laughter]

1549
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,000
Exactly.

1550
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,870
-How much can you drink?
-Alcohol tolerance?

1551
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:04,020
[I can drink happily.]
[How much can you drink?]

1552
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,460
I can drink happily.

1553
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,700
About half a glass of soju.

1554
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,740
[Half a glass of soju.]

1555
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,540
Half... half a bottle.

1556
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,540
[Not half a glass, half a bottle!]

1557
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,740
[But after that...]

1558
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,940
[I'd start expressing my true thoughts.]

1559
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,210
I can have deep conversations.

1560
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:12,150
-When you drink...
-His version of getting drunk is speaking the truth?

1561

[His version of getting drunk is speaking the truth?]

1562
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,830
-Okay, pass.
-Pass.

00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,500
[Truth-telling... after getting drunk?]

1564
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,010
-GD.
-Hello, everyone.

[Bow]
[The third one is Jiyong.]

1566

[Defconn: Last time at Dongmyo, Jiyong...]

1567
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,300
[He gave me a bag.]

1568
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,080
-He gave me a bag.
-I heard about that.

1569
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,830
'Hyung'.

1570
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,420
[Quietly]

1571
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,540
[Shining~]

1572
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,860
[Oh? Thanks.]

1573
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,940
That's nice.

1574
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,740
[A designer bag received at Dongmyo]

1575
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:41,910
I didn't see it in the product catalog,
so out of curiosity, I went to Apgujeong.

1576
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,980
[Defconn: I didn't see it in the product catalog, so out of curiosity, I went to the store.]

1577
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,260
[Embarrassed myself big time.]

1578
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,200
I have to ask this.

1579
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,010
Even though it's not our first time meeting,

1580
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,130
standing here still makes me nervous.

1581
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,420
[Actually starting makes me nervous.]

1582
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:50,900
Right? You guys see?

1583
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,850
I told you it's hard.

1584
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,820
[Same feeling]

1585
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,180
[Kim Soohyun, look at that.]
[Hahaha.]

1586
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,830
Now's not the time to laugh.

1587
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,680
For real.

1588
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,900
[Haven't introduced himself yet]

1589
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:02,730
Anyway, let's take today's meeting as an opportunity

1590
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:03,100
[Jiyong: Let's take today's meeting as an opportunity]

1591

[Jiyong: to do something exciting.]

1592
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,940
[You've created something truly meaningful for us.]

1593
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,180
[Soohyun: Thank you so much.]

1594
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,700
[Soohyun: So, are we writing a song?]

1595
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:19,320
What I want to do is for everyone to sing a new song together.

1596
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:19,380
[His goal is to get everyone to sing together]

1597
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,340
[Soohyun: Are you going to write the song yourself?]

1598
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,820
[This is my specialty.]

1599
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,860
[Jiyong: I may not solve a Rubik's Cube, but I can write songs.]

1600
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,100
Am I singing too?

1601
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,180
[Looking forward to it]
[Am I singing too?]

1602
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,920
Hmm... well...

1603
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,500
[Hmm~]

1604
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,910
-I don't think so.
-Singing?

1605
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:39,900
-I don't think so.
-No.

1606
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,740
[Haha]

1607
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,440
He said I'm not singing, and none of you denied it.

1608
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,340
[Staring...]

1609
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,940
[But behind Soohyuk...]

1610
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,740
[It goes well with him.]

1611
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,820
-Yes.
-Right?

00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,980
[Soohyun:  Are you getting inspiration from these people now?]

1616
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,260
[Not everyone, though.]

1617
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,620
[The only one laughing out loud.]

1618
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,490
Why are you laughing?

1619
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,130
You didn't...

1620
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,770
You said it like you didn't get any inspiration from me.

1621
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:03,220
[Bickering]

1622
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:02,510
You're standing right in front of me, what else can I do?

1623
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:03,980
I can be an inspiration too.

1624
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,060
[Why can't you get inspiration from me?]

1625
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:05,780
No "inspiron"? Look at me closely.

1626
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,650
Do you mean "inspiration"?

1627
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,660
[Searching for inspiration]

1628
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,550
Got it.

1629
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:09,900
[Can I ask you another question?]

1630

[Refuse]

1631
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,090
Why?

[When's your next concert?]

1634

[It's hard to say]

Why?

1637
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:18,580

01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:21,580
[Because we're talking about first impressions!]

2058
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,590
I can't imagine it at all

2059
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:27,660
[The same gaze directed at Soohyun]

2060
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,450
since I'm very introverted.

2061
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,320
He's writing it so seriously, Who could it be?

2062
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,220
[Jealous]
[He's writing it so seriously~ Who could it be??]

2063
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,220
[Should I put you down?]

2064
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,900
[Me?]

2065
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:33,700
Should I put you down?

2066
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:36,220
[Can't stand it]

2067
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:37,330
And I think that

2068
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,620
[He's going to make people anxious about it first]

2069
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:41,540
That's his strategy.

2070
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:43,420
[Who will Jiyong vote for?]

2071
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,490
But still...because Kwanghee was here,

2072
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,060
[But today, because Kwanghee was here,]

2073
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,220
the atmosphere quickly eased up.

2074
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:51,140
[Ears perked up. Thanks to Kwanghee, the atmosphere quickly eased up.]

2075
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:49,930
Really?

2076
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,130
Me?

2077
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,490
Didn’t I say I was doing an environmental program and even talked about microplastics?

2078
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,540
[As the only variety show host among the 88-borns,]

2079
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,550
I'm very muscular now.

2080
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:00,820
[Kwanghee took charge of the atmosphere.]

2081
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:04,620
[Compared to meeting you alone, it's better to meet with everyone!]

2082
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,780
[Sober appraisal from a dear friend of 16 years]

2083
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:08,770
You always say you don’t want to do mukbang.

2084
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,300
No, really, you’re very useful.

2085
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,460
[Completely felt his usefulness (?)]

2086
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,460
Be quiet.

2087
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:15,300
[This is something only really close friends can say.]

2088
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,980
[When we’re all together, it doesn't get tiring as quickly.]

2089
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,340
[I think Kwanghee will be the first to get tired now.]

2090
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,700
[Exactly, I’m so tired.]

2091
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,220
[Kwangsoo (Kwanghee)]

2092
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,440
The most warm-hearted person.

2093
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:25,460
If it’s Kwangsoo...

2094
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:28,220
[Defconn: Kwangsoo (Kwanghee) it feels like they’d vote for him.]

2095
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,240
it feels like he'll vote for him.

2096
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,420
[Jiyong]

2097
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:29,740
For now.

2098
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:33,360
He’s wearing Yeongcheol’s scarf now.

2099
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,940
[Defconn: He’s now wearing Yeongcheol, Jiyong’s scarf.]

2100
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,750
It's like he's sending a signal.

2101
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,740
[Defconn: It looks like he’s using the scarf to send a signal.]

2102
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:38,850
The person who makes Kwangsoo feel comfortable now

2103
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:40,460
[He feels most comfortable with Yeongcheol (Jiyong)?]

2104
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:40,500
is Yeongcheol.

2105
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,020
[Defconn: But who is Kwangsoo (Kwanghee) truly thinking about deep inside?]

2106
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,950
Who is Kwangsoo really thinking about?

2107
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:43,580
[Defconn: Who do they actually want to get closer to today?]

2108
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:42,900
The person they actually want to get closer to today...

2109
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,060
[I think it's him.]

2110
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:46,470
Yeongsoo.

2111
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:48,900
[The one they truly want to be close with - Yeongsoo (Soohyun)?]

2112
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,900
[What's Kwanghee’s choice?]

2113
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,940
[Oksun, Hae-in]

2114
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:54,070
Oksun?

2115
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,120
I’m really curious. Will Jung Hae-in

2116
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,320
and G-DRAGON pick each other?

2117
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,540
[Will they pick each other?]

2118
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,520
Yim Siwan. I'm really curious  who Yim Siwan'll like among us.

2119
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,660
[Yeongja (Siwan), Kwanghee: I wonder who Yim Siwan would like among us.]

2120
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,060
[He’s my best friend!!]

2121
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:05,380
Could it be me

2122
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,380
[Will he pick me?]

2123
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,060
[Yeongho (Soohyuk)]

2124
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,990
I’m really curious about Soohyuk’s choice.

2125
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,660
[Really curious about the Cherry Blossom Knight’s choice.]

2126
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,340
I'm really curious about his thoughts.

2127
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,270
I can't predict his thoughts.

2128
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,780
[Unknown smile...]

2129
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,270
Who made the most comfortable first impression?

2130
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:16,610
That’s the selection criteria.

2131
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:18,340
[88-born first-impression voting has ended.]

2132
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:19,510
It's so pretty.

2133
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,020
[Rest time after the voting]

2134
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,120
It must be cold.

2135
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,120
Go to sleep.

2136
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:26,820
[A kitty has settled in a corner of the room.]

2137
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,740
Sleep well.

2138
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:30,540
I love animals. But animals don't really like me.

2139
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,540
[I have a cat.]

2140
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,820
[Oh, really?]

2141
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,590
I have one.

2142
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,580
[Let’s talk more casually...]

2143
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,580
Can we?

2144
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,140
[I’ll say it!]

2145
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,900
[I will! I will!]

2146
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,920
-Let's drop the honorifics.
-Okay.

2147
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,140
[I usually take a long time to drop honorifics.]

2148
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,580
[Stop it!]

2149
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,020
[Okay, Let's. Stop. Using. Honorifics!]

2150
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,200
I've never seen such an awkward group before.

2151
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:55,060
[This is the first time I’ve seen such awkward chemistry.]

2152
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:57,300
But I think everyone is quite interesting.

2153
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,620
[Even though it’s awkward (?), the 88-born friends are still having fun.]

2154
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,370
Right?

2155
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,180
[Yeongho, Kwangsoo]

2156
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:06,500
[What's your name? I'm Yeongsoo.]

2157
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,700
[Soohyuk, since we met,]

2158
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,980
[and I'm done with the shoot...]

2159
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,100
[Let’s meet up sometime!]

2160
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,020
[I'll go! You won't come!]

2161
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:18,980
[Shall we go out together?]

2162
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,660
[Kwanghee: Really, let’s meet up, friends!]

2163
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:24,250
But getting six people together like this…

2164
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,540
[Siwan: Getting six people together like this...]

2165
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:27,300
[Siwan: It won't be easy.]

2166
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,900
[Siwan: It’s not easy for the 88-born friends to gather like this.]

2167
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,500
[Siwan: I’m really happy we can get together.]

2168
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:36,020
[Hae-in: It is really hard to get together...]

2169
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,060
I’m excited.

2170
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:40,540
[Siwan: I’m curious, how did this group form?]

2171
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:43,980
[Siwan: Soohyun, how do you know Jiyong?]

2172
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:47,540
[Have we all met once or twice?]

2173
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,500
[We were on You Quiz!]

2174
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,780
[It was the first time we met.]

2175
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:54,300
[About 2 seconds? 3 seconds?]

2176
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,060
Just a quick greeting.

2177
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,860
[Hae-in: Jiyong finished filming first and left.]

2178
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:57,660
[Hae-in: Then it was my turn to go in.]

2179
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,020
[Hae-in: We happened to cross paths then.]

2180
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:01,420
It’s really hard to make friends now, right?

2181
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,500
[Now, making new friends is really difficult.]

2182
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:03,500
At this age, getting close to someone...

2183
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,530
-I really can't do it now.
-It's a little...

2184
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,740
[I really can't do it now]

2185
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:09,080
Even if you want to, it’s hard to approach someone, right?

2186
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,620
[Kwanghee: Even if you want to, it’s hard to approach.]

2187
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:12,100
[Kwanghee: I’m really grateful for this opportunity.]

2188
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,340
[Among us, Kwanghee has the hardest time opening up.]

2189
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,500
[It's harder to get me to open up, surprising, right?]

2190
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:20,820
[You're always like this, so it's more surprising.
But why are you still like this... it's much better now!]

2191
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,790
Right?

2192
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,460
[But you know, this type of person is a true friend!]

2193
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:27,140
[True...true...what was that...]

2194
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,010
Why are you speaking…

2195
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,340
[To be honest, I’m not great with words either.]

2196
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:33,060
[Your speech is really bad. Hahaha.]

2197
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,110
And you still want to be an MC?

2198
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,900
[You still want to be an MC…]

2199
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:38,620
[If I slow down a little, it’ll be fine. Just adjust my pace, right?]

2200
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:41,260
[Variety shows are all about speed.]

2201
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,340
[I’m starting to be curious about Kwanghee’s bluntness.]

2202
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,940
[Bluntness?]

2203
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,620
Starting to get curious about Kwanghee’s bluntness.

2204
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:51,220
[He’s kind of blunt(?)]

2205
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:50,590
-Blunt.
-Blunt.

2206
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:54,420
[Do you know? Of course I know~]

2207
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,260
Blunt.

2208
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,260
[One drink and he becomes a T-personality.]

2209
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,580
[Anyway, once you experience it, you’ll understand (?)]

2210
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:58,780
[What did I do?!]

2211
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,220
[I don’t even drink that much lately.]

2212
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:06,500
[Even if you only drink one glass... I just turn red.]

2213
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:09,100
[I turn red too. I turn red after one drink too.]

2214
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,180
-Even if you turn red, you can drink 5 to 6 glasses.
-You can drink a lot.

2215
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,300
[Even if he turns red, he can drink 5-6 glasses...]

2216
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:12,220
-Of course.
-You're a good drinker.

2217
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,780
[But I just end up throwing up…]

2218
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,740
[Ha...]

2219
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:18,780
[But Siwan does find Kwanghee more comforting, right?]

2220
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,740
[But wasn’t he originally not like this?]

2221
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,060
[Before, I was the one introducing him to friends.]

2222
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,300
[Now, he’s introducing me to people.]

2223
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,020
[Oh, right.]

2224
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,900

01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:33,810
Yes.

2392
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:36,020
You're saying that now?

2393
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,980
[You're saying that now?]

2394
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:38,700
[What's the point of giving it now! Haha.]

2395
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,230
-We won't let you be alone.
-But...

2396
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:44,460
[Won't let you be alone~ Thanks to Jiyong’s generosity (?), everyone got a taiyaki]

2397
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,540
Eat. We're friends.

2398
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:44,680
Okay.

2399
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,380
If I had known I could write my own name, I would have.

2400
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,300
[Pretending not to know… If I had known, I would have written my own name.]

2401
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:50,860
Are you crazy? I didn’t write my own name! I'm mad.

2402
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,260
[Are you crazy? I didn't write it!]

2403
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,380
[Even when he’s mad, it’s cute. Haha.]

2404
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,300
[Is it broadcast-appropriate (?) cursing? Haha.]

2405
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:57,930
I didn't write my name.

2406
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:59,060
Is there broadcast-appropriate cursing?

2407
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,100
[Broadcast-appropriate cursing haha.]

2408
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,260
[Jung Hae-in, if you want to curse, just do it.]

2409
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,060
[Ridiculous]

2410
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,560
Don't just sit here.

2411
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:09,260
[All of a sudden?]

2412
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:08,460
-Say it.
-Say what you want to say.

2413
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:12,180
[Say what you want to say.
 Well. What's there to scold?]

2414
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:12,540
No.

2415
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,860
[Kwanghee, Hae-in is also very straightforward~]

2416
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,130
I think so too.

2417
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,700
[OK. Just wait until we get familiar with each other.]

2418
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:20,350
What?

2419
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,780
[Whoosh]

2420
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:21,880
Your number.

2421
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,980
[Soohyun wants Kwanghee's number.]

2422
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:22,980
My number. Okay.

2423
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:25,940
[We exchanged numbers because we changed into CP today.]

2424
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,260
[If everyone knows, what am I gonna do?]

2425
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:30,860
[OK. Since we became a CP, show me your address.]

2426
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,180
Okay.

2427
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,180
[What's that? Haha.]

2428
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:32,820
Really.

2429
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:33,960
Is this the time?

2430
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:37,460
[Under Soohyun's leadership, they begin to exchange numbers!]

2431
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:37,150
Well...

2432
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,760
Give and take.

2433
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,500
[Exchanged each other's contact information]

2434
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:41,190
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

2435
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:42,970
Please give me your number.

2436
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:46,260
[88-born friends are getting closer]

2437
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,600
Amazing, Yim Siwan, this is G-DRAGON.

2438
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:49,460
[I remember the meeting with G-DRAGON on a music program]

2439
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,030
I remembered meeting him on a music program.

2440
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:52,820
[How many people were there in ZE:A?
9 people!]

2441
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:55,380
[If I can be reborn, I want to be a group of three.]

2442
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,980
[Practice singing more!]

2443
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,580
[You want the three of us to be a team, right?]

2444
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,460
[That's not what I meant!]

2445
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,620
[So fast... hahaha, can't cover it up!]

2446
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,030
Are you crazy?

2447
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,610
So fast.

2448
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:06,900
[How can you do this to someone who comes to help?]

2449
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,780
[You're here to make friends but you're saying that?]

2450
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,060
[What are you talking about?]

2451
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:12,520
Really?

2452
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:16,180
[Siwan: I saw Jiyong a while ago.]

2453
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,420
[Siwan: He was on a variety program.]

2454
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:21,020
[Siwan: To be honest, I didn't know Jiyong]

2455
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,360
I didn't know he was so flexible.

2456
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,940
[To be so flexible]

2457
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:24,500
[I'm really flexible!]

2458
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:25,980
[I learned everything when I was young]

2459
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,380
[I learned breakdancing and competition gymnastics]

2460
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:30,980
[You're very flexible~]

2461
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,260
[Wait. Try this.]

2462
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:35,400
It should be like this.

2463
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,620
[It should be like this. The flexibility test starts suddenly.]

2464
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:36,780
[Kwanghee's hand can only slightly fold back.]

2465
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:36,870
-I don't know.
-It hurts.

2466
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:40,980
Because I can do this.

2467
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:40,660
[Jiyong's fingers can be folded on the back of his hand.]

2468
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:43,700
[Yim Siwan: try this too.]

2469
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,100
You can touch it.

2470
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,460
[Oh, what?]

2471
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,520
-What?
-Try it.

2472
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:46,830
-What?
-Try it.

2473
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,740
[Not only the back of the hand, he can touch his wrist.]

2474
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,420
I can touch it.

2475
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:51,300
[Can you? I'm trash(?)] [Laughing]

2476
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:51,090
What trash?

2477
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,100
[-How can it touch there?
-I don't know. I just can...]

2478
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,180
[I can't do it either. It's stiff.]

2479
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:56,780
[I didn't know others can't do it.]

2480
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,460
[Still playing like this at 38]

2481
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,260
[So funny]

2482
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,390
Really.

2483
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:03,020
[What did you do today?]

2484
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:05,160
-I stayed at home after exercising.
-Were you at home?

2485
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,380
[Did you stay at home after exercising?]

2486
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,900
[There's no shoot today.]

2487
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,740
[If we don't have a schedule, we either go to exercise or be at home.]

2488
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:13,620
[Hey, Jiyong!]

2489
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:16,820
[Kwanghee: I thought I wouldn't take photos like this when I work out.]

2490
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,900
-Let me see.
-Let me see.

2491
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,680
-You exercise...
-Let me see.

2492
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:23,100
[He really took a lot of photos]
[Suddenly talking about
Kwanghee showing off his exercise photos today]

2493
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,770
You might fall in love with exercising. Have a look.

2494
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:22,860
You really took a lot.

2495
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:25,120
No, look at it. Give some comments.

2496
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,540
[Kwanghee: Give some comments.]

2497
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:26,980
[Kwanghee: Lee Soohyuk, come and take a look.]

2498
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:28,780
[I think I don't have to look]

2499
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:30,140
[Me too... Ha]

2500
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,160
Are these photos edited?

2501
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:31,660
[Let me give you an evaluation first.]

2502
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:32,780
[I'll show you the best photo I've ever taken.]

2503
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,870
You're still looking for the photos?

2504
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,110
Okay.

2505
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,180
[Don't show me yet.]

2506
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:39,280
-Why?
-Seriously.

2507
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,780
[(Curious)]
[Kwanghee: It's always like this in the gym.]

2508
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,200
People in the gym are all like this.

2509
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:42,780
[Jiyong is shocked?]
[Kwanghee: It's always like this in the gym.]

2510
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,930
Jiyong is shocked.

2511
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,020
[I would like to purchase eyes that has never seen this before...]

2512
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:46,390
That's annoying.

2513
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:49,120
How's my chest?

2514
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,580
[Did you take this selfie?]

2515
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:50,680
-Did you take this selfie?
-Yeah.

2516
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,340
[I'm not interested.]

2517
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:56,510
To be honest, I took the photo from this angle to focus on the chest muscles.

2518
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:55,420
[Kwanghee: To be honest, it was taken from this angle.]

2519
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,900
[Ha...]

2520
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,900
[No, no, no]

2521
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,850
-No, no.
-Look.

2522
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:03,780
[I don't like this (?)]

2523
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,490
-I don't like this.
-Please evaluate.

2524
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:04,790
You mean how's your figure?

2525
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:05,960
It's pretty good.

2526
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,140
[Anyway, it's good]

2527
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,540
Kim Soohyun, you take a look.

2528
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:10,260
[The next target is Soohyun!]

2529
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,120
Kim Soohyun, have a look.

2530
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,180
[The answer is set anyway]

2531
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:13,130
It's so-so?

2532
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,180
[Show me photos that shows the bigger picture (?)]

2533
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,300
[This is too close!]

2534
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,940
[You can't see the muscles if I take it from far away...]

2535
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,090
-Look.
-Why are you doing this to me?

2536
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,460
[Refusing to look]

2537
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,310
Gosh, I've seen it.

2538
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,900
[Your friend worked out!]

2539
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,620
[Gosh, I've seen it]
[Why are you doing this to me?]
[Hahaha]

2540
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:26,820
I said look!

2541
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:27,620
I don't have to.

2542
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:28,820
[Not looking]

2543
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:29,350
Look. I worked out so hard.

2544
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,540
[Souless]
[Wow... Amazing, amazing]

2545
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:30,320
Amazing.

2546
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:31,390
I've been working out.

2547
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,620
[Can’t stop today's workout check-in, mandatory certification]

2548
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,260
So cool. The best!

2549
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,770
They're getting closer than they started.

2550
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,940
[The 88s are getting closer]

2551
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,540
[It's dinner time]

2552
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,220
[Defconn: A group of friends meet like this]

2553
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:47,940
[Defconn: If they cook together, they'll get along soon]

2554
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:47,000
They'll get along soon.

2555
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:47,930
And boys...

2556
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:50,240
Although it's a bit late now,

2557
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:51,540
[Dinner time]

2558
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:55,140
[Oh really?]
[Producer Taeho: For you to eat well, we've prepared a lot]

2559
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:58,340
[Producer Taeho: Please go to the kitchen one by one]

2560
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,870
I'll explain in detail.

2561
