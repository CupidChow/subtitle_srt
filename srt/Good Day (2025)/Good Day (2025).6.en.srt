[I've always wanted to see him!]

1257
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:22,200
-We can meet the others in other occasions.
-Yeah.

[Jinkyung came back after having a hard time]

1260
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:27,740
But I don't get a chance to meet Kian84.

1261
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,100
[(Come this way)]

1262
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,740
[I don't get to see him (Kian84) frequently]

1263

1266
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,240
I'm curious.

1267
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,820
[We're talking about Kian84]

1268
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,580
[He seems to have a strong sense of pride]

1269
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,820
[That's right!]

1270
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,480
Jung Hae-in also finds Kian84 very funny?

1271
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,460
[Hae-in also finds Kian84 very funny?]

1272
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,660
[Haein: He's like a character you don't see on TV.]

1273
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,080
-He's brave and straightforward.
-Yeah.

[Curious]

1276
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,670
That's the same reason. I wonder if Kian84 will come?

1277
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,820
[Will Kian84 come?]

1278
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,740

[Defconn: Initially, Hong Jinkyung's schedule...]

1280
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,310
She said she would arrive after 8 p.m.

[Originally planned to arrive late]

1282
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,100
But it’s said that she came here after being fun over there.

1283
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,260
[After being funny at the previous set, she came here in a hurry]

1284

-No, during the recording... 
-This is the information I got.

1285

[I was so anxious during the previous recording haha]

1286
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,200
I was so anxious.

1287
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,460
[I was afraid you would start without me!]

1288
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,780
That's why I was so impatient.

1289
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,420
[Hahahaha]

1290
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,640
Yeah, so I came quickly.

[Too concerned, so she came quickly!]

[No] [Are you tired now?] [I lived multiple lives]

00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,620
[Jungmin: If we hadn't worked on the same project together~]

1745
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,670
We'd just be strangers.

1746
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,660
[If we didn't know each other, we'd probably ask, "Who are you?"]

1747
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,540
I see.

1748
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,340
[Right now, I'm seriously craving Korean food...]

1749
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,460
Just got back from Santiago.

1750
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,160
Yes.

1751
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,700
[After completing the Santiago pilgrimage, he can't stop craving Korean food]

1752
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:59,960
That's right.

1753
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,660
[You must have missed it so much!]

1754
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,100
[Ah... I'm losing my mind!]

1755
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,100
[Korean food in sight]
[Insight mode ON!]

1756
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:13,820
[A sacred pilgrimage to Korean cuisine]

1757
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:18,380
[If it's about cafeteria meals, there's someone else about to go crazy]

1758
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,980
The chef really loves cafeteria meals.

1759
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,660
["What's on the menu today?"]

1760
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:25,180
[Cafeteria master!]
[Always bringing up cafeteria meals while judging]

1761
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,880
A true cafeteria master.

1762
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:28,210
Eating cafeteria meals depends on the setting.

1763
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,580
[For Sungjae, cafeteria meals hold special meaning because...]

1764
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,100
[Sungjae: Before I immigrated, I attended Gangnam Elementary.]

1765
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,020
[It was the first school to introduce cafeteria meals.]

1766
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:35,720
Back then?

1767
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,420
Yes, back then.

1768
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:40,090
So it left a deep impression.

1769
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,980
[After 30 years, tasting it again]
[Such strong memories of cafeteria meals]

1770
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,740
[One bite!]

1771
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,420
-Brings back memories.
-Since he also made cafeteria meals.

1772
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,940
[The taste brings back a flood of memories]

1773
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,730
Made them for 30 to 40 years.

1774
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,780
-The emotions hit all at once.
-They really hit.

1775
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,380
[The emotions hit all at once.]

1776
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,420
[When you immigrate, these things become important...]

1777
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,510
So...

1778
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,520
It's that complicated feeling, you know?

1779
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:59,180
[Cafeteria meals aren't just about the food]

1780
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,780
It all ties together.

1781
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,500
Everyone, eat up.

1782
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,100
[Enjoy!]
[Have some more, everyone~]

1783
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:02,180
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

1784
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,130
Enjoy your meal.

1785
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,220
[GD has a really big appetite~]

1786
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,460
[Jinkyung: He eats a lot at my house too~]

1787
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,620
[I'm used to piling up my plate first.]

1788
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,520
Amazing.

1789
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,860
[I feel like I really need to eat something today...]

1790
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:11,910
Amazing.

1791
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,340
[Have you always had such a big appetite?]

1792
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:15,860
Hmm, only when I'm tired.

1793
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,860
[Hmm...]

1794
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,420
[When I'm tired!]

1795
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,700
[Ah...]

1796
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,450
So today, you must be exhausted.

1797
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,820
[Eat up and power through!]

1798
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,640
Yeah, I feel like I really need to eat a lot today.

1799
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,700
[I have to eat a lot today!]

1800
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,540
Alright, go ahead.

1801
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,100
[Eat]

1802
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,700
[Click]

1803
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,820
[Can't forget to take a food pic]

1804
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,620
[Eat]

1805
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,020
[Hyungdon: Soohyuk, I thought you weren't really into food, but you're really digging in?]

1806
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,030
He actually enjoys food.

1807
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,140
[He eats everything.]

1808
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,900
[Whenever we meet up, we go to good restaurants...]
[Even the first time we met, he ate instant noodles like...]

1809
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,860
[Hmm~ I usually don't eat stuff like that because I have to watch my figure.]

1810
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,960
Like instant noodles.

1811
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,220
[That makes sense.]

1812
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,900
[Everyone, may I have your attention for a moment?]

1813
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:55,820
[Defconn: There's something we shouldn't forget, even while eating.]

1814
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,990
Yes.

1815
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,980
[For making this gathering possible!]

1816
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,100
[Hwang Jungmin 'hyung'!]

1817
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,440
-That's true.
-Me?

1818
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,500
[Me?]

1819
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,380
[Jungmin suggested having a meal together on a day when everyone is available]

1820
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,930
Sorry, 'hyung'.

1821
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,300
[How about a toast with water instead of alcohol?]

1822
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,340
Where's the water?

1823
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,370
How about making a toast?

1824
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:13,020
[Immediately standing up at the mention of water]

1825
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,580
-Where's the water?
-Water.

1826
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,100
[Completely serious about it]

1827
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,900
[Or maybe a toast with celebratory noodles?]

1828
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,390
Celebratory noodles.

1829
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,860
[Today really is a good day...]

1830
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:21,290
All thanks to 'hyung' for making this happen.

1831
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,180
[A heartfelt moment~]

1832
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,600
-Celebratory noodles.
-Let's use this instead.

1833
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,420
[Oh my god...]

1834
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,100
[A precious moment]

1835
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,410
Anyway...

1836
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,580
[I think everyone feels the same way as I do...]

1837
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,500
[In the Gyeongsang dialect, "Thank you for including me."]

1838
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,380
[I truly appreciate being part of this program.]

1839
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,820
[Hopefully, through this experience,]

["Good Day" will continue to grow]

1841
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,180
[and truly bring good days to everyone.]

1842

I'm really happy to meet you all.

1843
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,340
[Happy to meet you all!]

[Love you all!]

1845

-Thank you.
-Cheers!

-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1847
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,100
[Cheers with noodles~]

1848
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,010
Thank you all for including me.

1849
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,440
Thank you.

1850
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:05,250
Thank you.

1851
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,220
[So happy to meet everyone~]

1852
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,180
[Cheers~]

1853
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,060
[Thank you.]

1854
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,380
[Enjoy your meal~]

1855
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,630
It feels like Pastor Jeon.

1856
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,180
["Suriname"]
[CODE KUNST: It feels like Pastor Jeon.]

1857
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,220
[But doing this really sets the mood.]

1858
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,810
It's different, right?

1859
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,500
[When each team eats separately...]

1860
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,700
[Doesn't it help everyone get closer?]
[Yes.]

1861
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:23,830
It brings us closer

1862
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,900
and lets us chat a bit more.

1863
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,580
[To become even closer...]

1864
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,480
-Hopefully, we can play more games.
-Hmm.

1865
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,660
[Hopefully, we can play more games.]

1866
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,260
[Jinkyung: I hope we can stay up all night.]

1867
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,060
[What's going on...]

1868
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,780
[Looking closely...]

1869
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,060
GD is right in front.

1870
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,860
[Diagonally across is Lee Soohyuk, and GD is right in front]

1871
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,120
Next to me are Lee Soohyuk and Jung Hae-in.

1872
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,780
[Next to me is Jung Hae-in.]

1873
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,570
This is surreal.

1874
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,980
[Hyungdon, what is happening?]

1875
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,980
[Is this even real life?]

1876
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,420
[That's why I'm here.]
[Hahaha.]

1877
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,220
[So you don't confuse reality with fantasy~]
[Exactly!]

1878
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,830
So you don't confuse reality with fantasy.

1879
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,970
You're right. Help me realize the reality.

1880
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,300
[I always watch your YouTube channel while I eat.]

1881
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,860
[Thank you!]

[Flustered]

1884

Wait...

00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,140
[Starting today...]

1886
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,500
[Surprised]
[Today is the first day?]

1887
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:06,810
What?

1888
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:07,700
-Today is the first day?
-Starting today.

1889
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,830
-Mm.
-Ah, OK.

1890
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,020
[Mm!]

1891
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,900
[Then we should exchange phone numbers~]

1892
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:11,710
Whose phone is this?

1893
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,940
[Jinkyung's phone]
[Because today is the first day~]

1894
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,120
Really?

1895
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,530
Because today is the first day.

1896
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,300
[May I?]
[Ah, really~?]

1897
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Yes.

1898
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,740
[What do I do... I'm losing my mind.]

1899
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,740
[Do you have Jiyong's number?]

1900
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,540
Since we're on the same team.

1901
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,400
Don't do that. But why?

1902
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,580
[But why~]

1903
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:25,350
Well...

1904
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,220
[Hyungdon, don't do that~]

1905
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,080
Hae-in already said we're all one team.

1906

[Hands over the phone]

1907

-Then...
-Can I call you?

[Shocked]
[Can I call you?]

1909
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,240
-Really?
-Yeah.

1910

[Why are you being so nice to me?]

1911
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,860
["Why are you being so nice to me?"]

1912

[Flustered]

-The same team.
-Fighting!

[Fighting!]

1916

[Uh, wait!]

1918
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:49,820
What's wrong?

1919
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,260
[An auto-generated response got sent!]

1920
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,660
[Jung Hae-in: I'm in class, please contact me later.]

1921
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,540
What?

1922
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,780
[An auto-generated response straight from the heart]

1923
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,450
I didn't press anything!

1924
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,500
[Shocked!]
[How could you reject me so fast...]

1925
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,440
No, I didn't reject you!

1926
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,020
[Saying you're in class, isn't that a bit...]

1927
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,900
[I... Uh! I think I pressed something by mistake...]

1928
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,220
[Teasing Hae-in #1: This is your phone, right?]

1929
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,420
[Teasing Hae-in #2: Or did you borrow someone's phone who's actually in class...]

1930
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,580
[Everyone joins in teasing Hae-in]

1931
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,950
-How could you say that?
-I pressed something wrong.

1932
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:12,840
Now that you got Hae-in's number...

1933
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,300
[While we're at it, before getting GD's number...]

1934
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,940
We should all exchange numbers!

1935
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,190
We're all on the same team.

1936
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,310
I'll give you Jiyong's number first.

1937
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,620
[Enthusiastic]

1938
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:17,540
Don't do that.

1939
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,420
[Waves hand]

1940
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,980
[Passes phone over]

1941
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,940
[Don't do that~]
[GD's number]

1942
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,140
[Even if you tell me Jiyong's number, I won't...]

1943
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,260
[I won't want it.]

1944
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:33,540
If 'noona' doesn't want it, then I don't want it either.

1945
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,220
[I won't want it.]
[[If 'noona' doesn't want it, then I...]

1946
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,420
[Kidding]

1947
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,820
[How was Paris?]

1948
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,380
[Hahaha]

1949
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,700
[It went pretty well... Seems pretty good...]

1950
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,430
He said it went pretty well.

1951
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,940
[Pfft]

1952
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,430
What?

1953
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,780
[She asked him how Paris was, and he said it went pretty well.]

1954
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,940
[Hyungdon: That basically means "don't ask anymore," hahaha.]

1955
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,590
Seriously.

1956
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,780
No, that's not what I meant.

1957
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:57,940
-Then what else could it mean?
-No.

1958
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,300
[Staring]

1959
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,580
[Hey, what's with that look? Hahaha.]

1960
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,660
[Don't talk to GD like that.]

1961
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,540
[Just let him enjoy his meal in peace!]

1962
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,460
[A sudden change]
[Eat up, Mr. GD!]

1963
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,140
[Don't worry about all that.]

1964
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,260
You're the one who cares the most.

1965
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,420
[Make sure to finish your food~]

1966
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,700
[I'll finish it.]

1967
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,500
[If it's too much, just leave some~]

1968
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:23,060
[Like taking care of a child left by the river...]

1969
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:23,100
Otherwise, you might choke.

1970
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,440
It hurts. I laughed too much.

1971
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,820
[Cheekbone pain]

1972
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,250
Where does it hurt?

1973
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,140
[Overreacting]
[Where does it hurt?]

1974
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,100
[Heartless Jiyongflower]

1975
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,620
[Wait, he says he's in pain, and you guys just...]

1976
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,030
It's because he laughed too hard, so his cheekbones...

1977
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,180
[Explaining the pain]

1978
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:35,920
Cheekbones?

1979
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,760
Yes, from laughing too much.

1980
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,070
Eat this. You need balanced nutrition.

1981
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,220
[Overly attentive]

1982
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,620
[Jiyong, hurry... Eat up~]

1983
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,580
[The three of us should get some dessert...]

1984
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:46,970
What do you think?

1985
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,540
[Immediately stands up]

1986
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,070
-Sure.
-Let's go.

1987
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,460
[Where?]

1988
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,220
[Ah, just sit down!]
[Jiyong, you keep eating!]

1989
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,140
-You haven't finished yet.
-Not done yet.

1990
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,180
-Jiyong.
-Jiyong, you keep eating first.

1991
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,100
-Keep eating.
-Jiyong.

1992
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,980
[Jiyong... Jiyong...]

1993
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:55,950
-Haven't finished yet.
-Just sit down.

1994
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,340
[Haven't finished yet...]

1995
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,480
-Jiyong.
-You barely ate anything.

1996
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,700
[Let's go!]

1997
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:00,000
You barely ate anything.

1998
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,260
[With everyone's "help," a two-shot scene finally appears]

1999
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,310
Eat up, you're the producer.

2000
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,030
-Finish everything.
-Eat up, we'll be right back.

2001
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,900
[Do you like barbecue?]

2002
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,940
[I like it... It's... quite good...]

2003
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,620
[Who do you most want to get closer to today?]

2004
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,180
[Glances over]

2005
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,620
[I just finished watching "Squid Game 2" a few days ago.]

2006
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:18,570
-I really want to meet him.
-Siwan?

2007
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,100
[I really want to meet Siwan.]

2008
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,860
[Thank you.]

2009
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,900
[It's my honor, Chef Anh Sungjae!]

2010
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,700
[Has "Culinary Class Wars 2" finished filming?]

2011
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,740
Or is it still ongoing?

2012
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:30,480
-Not yet started, but it should begin soon.
-Probably in March.

2013
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,660
[Not yet started, but it should begin soon.]

2014
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,220
Mm.

2015
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,050
It was my favorite program last year.

2016
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,140
[It was my favorite program last year!]

2017
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,810
Really? Thank you.

2018
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,740
[After watching that program,]

2019
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:43,260
[I always wondered what chefs like you eat on a daily basis.]

2020
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,390
-Super curious.
-That's what I'm most curious about.

2021
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,980
[That's what everyone wants to know too]

2022
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,020
[You'll be disappointed.]

2023
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,900
That's fine.

2024
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,380
-I only make the simplest dishes.
-The simplest ones.

2025
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,180
[I only cook the simplest and most comforting meals.]

2026
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,220
[Sungjae: The simplest food.]

2027
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:59,220
[Is there instant ramen? I'll just cook ramen if I'm hungry.]

2028
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,620
-Instinctively.
-Yes.

2029
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,740
Even today...

2030
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,180
[To put it simply, if someone buys me a bagel,]

2031
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,340
[spreading jam or butter on it is nice.]

2032
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,370
Yes.

2033
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,180
["But I think eating a plain bagel is fine too."]

2034
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:11,570
So I just eat it as is, no toppings, just the bread.

2035
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,820
[No toppings, just the bread]

2036
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,220
And that's my lunch. Just a piece of bread.

2037
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:14,970
So fascinating.

2038
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,500
[Fascinating]

2039
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,400
It's really fascinating.

2040
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,300
Since eating and tasting food have become my job,

2041
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,940
[Since eating has become my job,]

2042
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,780
[it feels like a luxury to eat just for enjoyment.]

2043
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:23,980
Even though the food I make for others...

2044
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:26,900
Even though the food I make for others is made with all my heart,

2045
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,440
since this is my profession, I can push myself to the very end

2046
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,870
for good food.

2047
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,150
But when it comes to myself, I don't feel like taking a single step.

2048
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:30,980
[When it comes to myself, I don't feel like taking a single step.]

2049
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,850
That's just my mindset.

2050
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:32,630
It feels quite unusual.

2051
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,020
[A perfectionist in cooking, but warm and easygoing in daily life]

2052

Different from us.

2053
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:38,540
[Yeah! 'Sunbae', have you been resting recently?]

2054
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:42,520
Honestly, it's been years since I last took a proper break.

2055
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,140
[It's been years since I last took a proper break.]

[For the past five years, I've been filming non-stop every single day.]

2057
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,000

[After this, I'd like to take a break.]

2060
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,540
Yeah.

2061
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,260
[This year, I even thought to myself, "I don't want to film anymore!"]

2062
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,860
Maybe it's also because...

[My little daughter just started elementary school.]

[Play the apartment game?]

2069

-Alright.
-OK.

-Okay.

2076
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,220
