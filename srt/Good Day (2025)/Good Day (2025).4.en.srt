I thought I should work to learn all his strengths.

826
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,560

[Even if I was just watching the seniors practice,]

856

[I'd be scolded for disrupting them.]

857
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,790
They'd ask why I was standing there.

858
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,500
[So I could only stand in a blind spot...]

859
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,460
Like this...

[You have to watch them to know how to practice.]

861
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,290
-Yes.
-To learn from the seniors.

[Chef Anh persisted through the rookie chores]

866
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,460
[not because he wanted to just wipe tables.]

867
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,020
[That's right.]
[Sungjae: What mattered was how you felt at the time.]

868
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,950
-The point was...
-Back then,

869
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,660
[Same feeling]
[I got through that period relying on my will to succeed.]

870
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,020
I relied on my will to succeed.

871
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,810
-No one told me to wipe the table.
-Yes.

872
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,820
Can you talk about something that made you really sad?

873
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,460
[Did you ever feel sad as the youngest?]

874
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,560
I really want to know about this.

875
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,540
[Feeling sad...]

876
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,350
Actually, I never felt that way.

877
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,620
[Can you still hold on?]
[Actually, I never felt that way.]

878
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,440
-I'm telling the truth.
-Really?

879
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,470
Can you still hold on?

880
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,050

00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,300
[Though saying there's none is also a bit of a lie...]

1054
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,020
[G-DRAGON: Rather than feeling pressure,]

1055
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,110
I do it because it's fun.

1056
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,340
[I do it because it's fun.]

1057
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,760
Passion comes first.

1058
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,230
Then people who disagree will attack you.

1059
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,140
[What if people who disagree attack you?]

1060
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,330
In music.

1061
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,080
Then I just prove it.

1062
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,420
[I just prove it!]

1063
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,700
[Yeah! That's right]
[And I don't really care about criticism, haha.]

1064
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,500
-That's what matters most.
-That's amazing.

1065
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,820
[A firm belief that won't easily waver]

1066
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,060
[Meanwhile, the rice noodles they ordered arrive]

1067
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,230
What's this?

1068
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,560
This is a peony flower.

1069
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,699
[Rising steam]

1070
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,179
[Amazing]
[Defconn: If everyone who trained under Chef Anh Sungjae is this good,]

1071
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,020
[then how skilled are the chefs at MOSU?]

1072
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,620
[Shy]

1073
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,380
[Can we even get a reservation there?]

1074
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:22,389
-A reservation?
-Yeah.

1075
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,139
[Reservation?]

1076
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,780
Isn't it fully booked as soon as they open?

1077
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,500
[Reservations are hard to come by...]
[Haha.]

1078
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,840
Right?

1079
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,860
[That kind of remark is nice too!]

1080
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,300
[Defconn: Even if it's just being polite, he could've said, "Reach out to me privately."]

1081
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,870
Yeah.

1082
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,699
[The type who doesn't make empty promises]

1083
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,580
But he wasn't. I just tested him a bit.

1084
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,900
[I'll definitely make a reservation before going.]

1085
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,219
[You're way too sincere, haha.]

1086
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,620
[His heart is full of food]
[I really want to do something together with him!]

1087

[Dripping]

1088
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,820
[You can squeeze some roasted lime on it.]

1089
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,080
-Squeeze some lime?
-Lime?

1090
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,600
Roasted lime?

1091
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,540
[Do you eat cilantro?]

1092
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,810
-Yeah, I do.
-Do you?

1093
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,940
[Yeah! I do!]

1094
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,040
Add a little cilantro.

1095

[A tip for making it extra fragrant]

1096
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,420
Then squeeze a bit of lime.

1097
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,460
[(Follow instructions exactly)]

1098
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,300
[Ha~]

1099
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,300
[Slurp]

1100
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,940
[Ah, the noodles are so delicious!]

1101
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,060
[Hyungdon: This can't be called an authentic Vietnamese pho, though.]

1102
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,230
There's a bit of

1103
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,090
refreshing.

1104
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,980
[The noodles have a refreshing taste]

1105
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,540
Because it's clam broth.

1106
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,510
Boss, did you get the clams from Noryangjin too?

1107
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,820
[Did you get the clams from Noryangjin too?]

1108
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,110
I picked them up from the supplier early in the morning.

[Junior staff enters]
[I picked them up from the supplier early in the morning.]

1110
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,300
Picked them up?

1111
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,940
-They are good quality ingredients.
-You don't need to respond to that.

1112
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,180
[No need to respond to that! Haha.]

1113
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,390
Just say "Got it."

1114
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,660
[Nervous laughter]

1115
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,260
[Thank you!]
[We appreciate it. That's so fresh!]

1116
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,980
[Defconn: Looks like we've found a great new restaurant today.]

1117
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,900
[What a relief!]

[What do you usually like to eat?]

1119
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,220
Do you have a favorite comfort food?

1120
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,560
Chef Anh Sungjae.

1121
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,020
[I especially love Chinese cuisine!]

1122
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,310
Chinese cuisine?

1123
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,740
Yes.

1124
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,300
Chef Anh also has a restaurant in Hong Kong, right?

1125
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,860
[That's right! I do!]

1126
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,160
Is it because Hong Kong is famous for its food?

1127
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,620
[The renowned culinary capital, Hong Kong, China]

1128
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,130
Did you specifically choose to open a restaurant there

1129
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,750
because Hong Kong is famous for its food?

1130
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,380
[I went there only because I love Chinese cuisine.]

1131
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,660
[Sungjae: Like what GD said.]

1132
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,060
[Follow what you love...]

1133
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,450
I just follow my heart.

1134
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,060
[Seems to be driven by the belief in following what is interesting]

1135
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,260
[After appearing on "Culinary Class Wars"...]

1136
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,060
[You went to your daughter's sports day, right?]

1137
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,940
[I heard her classmates went wild!]

1138
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,300
Yes, the kids...

1139
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,500
[Surprised!]

1140
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,510
They all called me "Chef Anh Sungjae."

1141
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,980
[They all called me "Chef Anh Sungjae."]

1142
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,250
All your daughter's classmates?

1143
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,980
[Sungjae: At the sports day, while I was rolling the ball,]

1144
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,020
[everyone was watching me instead of focusing, so their balls kept going off track.]

1145
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,980
[Unbelievable!]

1146
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,240
And they were saying things like "I love you, Chef Anh Sungjae!"

1147
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,820
[I love you, Chef Anh Sungjae~]

1148
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,420
[I was really shocked!]

1149
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,900
[I understand why GD cried now.]

1150
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,980
[Sungjae: They were shouting, "Chef Anh Sungjae is so cool!"]

1151
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,000
And the kids were reaching out their hands to me.

1152
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,060
[At the sports day, the kids reached out to Sungjae]

1153
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,660
[Wanting to acknowledge everyone, I shook every kid's hand.]

1154
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,220
[The moment I reached out...]

1155
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,720
They got super excited and started shaking uncontrollably.

1156
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,420
[They got super excited and started shaking uncontrollably.]

1157
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,970
So I thought, "I have to live my life upright."

1158
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,740
[I have to live my life upright!]

1159
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,000
That's right.

1160
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,130
-If I were to mess up...
-So many thoughts would run through your head.

1161
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,020
[So many thoughts would run through my head.]

1162
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,230
[There would be a million thoughts at that moment.]

1163
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,500
[Sungjae: Putting aside the fact that I'm a chef,]

1164
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,460
[Sungjae: I might have an impact on these kids.]

1165
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,980
[Because they're watching me closely!]

1166
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,420
So after Pororo, the title of "King of Elementary Schoolers"

1167
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,620
[Anh Sungjae is becoming the new King of Elementary Schoolers, following Pororo!]

1168
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,960
goes to Anh Sungjae.

00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,220
[Shy]

1170
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,250
People around me actually gave me that nickname.

[After "Culinary Class Wars," he became the new King of Elementary Schoolers]

1172
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,540
[Sungjae: I still don't know what part of the program made them like me.]

1173
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,540
Still don't know?

1174
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,300
[Why do elementary school kids like me?]
[Still don't know?]

1175
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,620
I don't know why elementary school kids like me.

1176
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,470
-You've got charisma.
-Yeah.

1177
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,380
[G-DRAGON: You've got charisma.]

1178
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,180
There were those moments that felt like strokes of genius.

[The moments of unexpectedly cool responses on "Culinary Class Wars"]

1180
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:32,360
And you also showed a different side of yourself that people around you don't usually see.

1181
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,460
[That probably made it feel fresh to them]

1182
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,440
But you must have received many invitations to variety shows.

1183
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,580
[You must have received many invitations to variety shows?]

1184
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,710
Why did you turn them all down?

1185
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,740
[Why did you turn them all down?]

1186
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,110
I'm a chef.

1187
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,420
[I just thought, "I am a chef!"]

1188
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,930
As a chef,

00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:46,380
[I bring people joy, good food, and wonderful moments through my cooking.]

1192
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,900
[Sungjae: I don't think I'm someone who can do other things yet.]

1193
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,810
So I turned down all the invitations.

1194
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,700
[I turned down all the invitations.]
[But "Good Day"...]

1195
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,980

[First variety appearance since "Culinary Class Wars"]

1197

[Sungjae: Even though there are talents in all kinds of fields,]

1205

[Sungjae: as a chef, I have my own domain.]

1206
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,580
[Sungjae: There's a life I can showcase as a chef.]

1207
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,100
Since I'm here,

[Joining "Good Day" for a meaningful cause]
