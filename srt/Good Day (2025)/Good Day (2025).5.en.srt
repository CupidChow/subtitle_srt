00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,620
[She's pretty close with Hae-in? Of course! They've filmed a movie together!]

1732
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:08,900
-They've filmed a movie together.
-That's right.

1733
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,980
[We're at karaoke... If you're done with your schedule, you...]

1734
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,420
[Come over??]

1735
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,220
[Then I'll...]

1736
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,020
[Oh, really?? Should I come?]

1737
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:19,600
Yeah, yeah.

1738
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,120
Okay.

1739
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,020
[Really hope you can come~ So funny, I'm really, haha]

1740
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,550
-Hae-in, luckily.
-Got it, got it.

1741
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,260
[Hae-in, luckily you're close with Go-eun, that's great!]

1742
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:27,500
You're close with Go-eun, that's great.

1743
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,460
[Actually, it's our second meeting, and she still feels a bit distant from us... Haha]

1744
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,430
She still feels a bit distant from us.

1745
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,470
Compared to us, you two are closer.

1746
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,900
[How long will it take you to get here?]

1747
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,020
[Affectionate, I'll be there soon, soon! This is Gangnam, so I can get there quickly!]

1748
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,040
-I'll be there soon, soon.
-You better come quickly.

1749
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,140
-This is Gangnam, so I can get there quickly.
-Really?

1750
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,620
[See you soon~ Okay, 'hyung'~~]

1751
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,340
[Ah, so exciting!]

1752
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:44,340
[Waiting eagerly for Oksun...]

1753
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,580
[If you don't mind... let's meet every quarter!]

1754
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,180
[Hoping the Hannam-dong gatherings continue, even if it's just for a meal!]

1755
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,410
Even just for a meal, just for a meal.

1756
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,270
-At this rate, we can meet more than just every quarter.
-Exactly.

1757
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,570
-Almost.
-Yeah.

1758
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:53,760
Hello.

1759
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,180
[At this moment, a man arrives at the karaoke place.]

1760
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,100
[Clatter]

1761
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:59,720
-Hae-in is here.
-Hello.

1762
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,140
[Hello~ Oh! Hae-in is here!]

1763
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,650
Hae-in.

1764
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,020
[Hae-in!!]

1765
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,500
[Long time no see!! The friends give a warm welcome.]

1766
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:04,610
Hello.

1767
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,260
Long time no see.

1768
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,680
Hello.

1769
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,780
[Welcome]

1770
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,480
-Hae-in, finally we meet.
-Hello.

1771
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,780
[We just started!! Awesome.]

1772
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,860
Say hello.

1773
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,940
-How have you been?
-Yeah, 'hyung'.

1774
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,940
[Yeah, 'hyung'! How have you been?]

1775
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,860
[Your haircut looks good~]

1776
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,980
[Because it was messy before.]

1777
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,140
[But Go-eun really...]

1778
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,250
-Since Hae-in arrived, you've been even more...
-No, not really.

1779
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,460
[Since Hae-in arrived, your smile has been brighter?]

1780
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,620
[I was pretty comfortable earlier~]

1781
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:28,480
Last time, we had a beer together.

1782
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,220
[Last time was the first gathering.]

1783
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,740
[I heard it was a gathering of friends around here.]

1784
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,020
So we're planning to meet every quarter.

1785
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,860
[So we're planning to meet every quarter from now on.]

1786
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,150
-That's good.
-If it's convenient for Hae-in too.

1787
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,820
[Extending an invitation, if it's convenient for Hae-in too...?]

1788
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,780
[Then count me in!!]

1789
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,440
Okay.

1790
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,180
[Just call me, and I'll come right away.
No, you have to pay 50,000 KRW.]

1791
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,080
Of course, you have to pay 50,000 KRW.

1792
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,100
[(Firmly) Of course.]

1793
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,940
[So the leader of this gathering is Go-eun!]

1794
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,500
[Me...?]

1795
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,640
Me, I'm the leader.

1796
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,060
[The leader of the Hannam-dong gathering has been chosen.]

1797
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,840
Of course, it's you.

1798
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,420
How should we sing?

1799
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:56,740
[But since we're here, let's sing one...?]

1800
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,800
That's one way.

1801
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,620
[Determining the singing order by spinning the mic.]

1802
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,140
It's Hae-in.

1803
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,660
[Contestant number 1 is Hae-in!]

1804
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,030
-This is real, this is real.
-This is real.

1805
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:03,990
Right, okay.

1806
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,260
[Okay, okay!]

1807
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,990
-'hyung', you're good at spinning.
-Right?

1808
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,260
['hyung', you're good at spinning~]

1809
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,820
No, it's my first time spinning too.

1810
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,300
[Choosing a song without hesitation.]

1811
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,660
Here, it's here.

1812
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,680
-That was originally...
-Not bad.

1813
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,100
[With an unresolved heart, Kim Kwang Seok.]

1814
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,080
-I really like this song.
-I'll sing the first verse.

1815
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,390
-I sang this song on "King of Mask Singer."
-Really.

1816
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,860
[I sang this song on "King of Mask Singer"!]

1817
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,060
[Then you sing the second verse, the second verse!]

1818
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,380
[Agreed, let's sing together?]

1819
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,430
Let's sing together, together.

1820
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:25,490
Everyone knows this song.

1821
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,340
[Accidentally contributes to the Hae-in X COKUN duet.]

1822
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:33,690
With an unresolved heart.

1823
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:34,060
[Kim Kwang-seok's "With an Unresolved Heart" (1992)
The lyrics paint a picture of loneliness, combined with a melancholic melody
that leaves a deep impression.]

1824
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:41,060
Closing the empty door.

1825
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:47,910
The scent you left behind still lingers.

1826
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:55,050
Filling my empty room.

1827
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,600
The past is buried in memories.

1828
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,740
[Seems like he comes to karaoke often, smoothly transitioning.]

1829
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:08,220
Just bury it like that.

1830
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:15,050
Why, on long nights,

1831
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:21,080
do I still toss and turn, unable to forget you?

1832
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:29,040
On the bright glass window.

1833
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:36,740
[Writing and erasing, I love you.]

1834
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:42,020
[Two comfortable and emotional voices, perfectly blending in the song.]

1835
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,120
Okay, okay.

1836
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,490
-Should we spin again?
-Hae-in, you spin it.

1837
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,620
[Deciding the next order, it's Hae-in's turn to spin the mic.]

1838
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,860
[Next is... Hae-in again...?]

1839
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,030
This won't do.

1840
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,120
This won't do.

1841
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,180
[You rascal!]

1842
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,140
Hae-in, seems like you really enjoy singing.

1843
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,300
[Seems like you really enjoy singing?]

1844
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,850
-Hae-in likes singing.
-That's a misunderstanding.

1845
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,540
[Hae-in, suspected of being a karaoke enthusiast.]

1846
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,800
-Hae-in's hands are nimble.
-Good.

1847
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,780
[Hae-in's hands are nimble.]

1848
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,420
Again, again.

1849
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,580
[Challenging again.]

1850
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,420
I'll spin it again, seriously.

1851
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,410
Seriously.

1852
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:02,940
[Ugh!!!!!!]

1853
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,540
[…Jiyong?]

1854
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,600
I was planning to go there.

1855
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:06,630
-Okay.
-Here.

1856
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,380
[Here, here!!]

1857
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,980
[No, this spot! I was planning to leave! Hahaha.]

1858
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,910
-It's you, it's you.
-You can't escape.

1859
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,300
[You think you can run away!]

1860
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,940
[Ah, what should I sing~?]

1861
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,660
[Pressure]

1862
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,700
[We're actually hearing GD sing at karaoke!]

1863
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,330
-What a great thing.
-Exactly.

1864
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,460
[What a great thing~]

1865
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,240
-No, this one.
-Actually at karaoke.

1866
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,260
[Gah]

1867
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,460
[This is an S-seat, a precious moment!]

1868
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,620
[My appearance fee has gone up recently, hahaha.]

1869
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,830
Go on stage and sing.

1870
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,180
[I'm actually singing at karaoke...]

1871
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,890
Singing.

1872
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,300
[Searching]

1873
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,500
-I don't really flip through the songbook much now.
-The person flipping through the songbook.

1874
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,980
[I don't really flip through the songbook much now...]

1875
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,140
[Ah...? Ah...!]

1876
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,110
Ah, I.

1877
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,090
-Since my dad's generation.
-I live in the analog era.

1878
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,580
[A long-lost scene, since my dad's generation...!]

1879
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,460
[Friend...]

1880
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,380
-What's the song called?
-Search.

1881
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,420
[No need, here! Sear...ch...?]

1882
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:45,370
No need, no need, here.

1883
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:49,060
[Because he's not good with machines, Saeho operates for him.]

1884
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,180
- 'hyung', help me pick.
-Just tell me.

1885
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,230
Okay.

1886
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,580
[Ah! Ahem!]

1887
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,020
[Ugh~ Huh~ Hmm]

1888
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,620
[4MEN!]

1889
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,280
4MEN.

1890
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,900
[Whoa!!!!!]

1891
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,700
[Oh oh?? Impressive...]

1892
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:59,750
- 4MEN.
-Impressive.

1893
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,420
[Chose a song by a traditional R&B group.]

1894
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,300
-4MEN.
-It's been so long since I sang this.

1895
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,780
[It's been so long since I sang this...?]

1896
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,980
-Let's start.
-Okay, I'll try.

1897
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,420
[Let's start~?]

1898
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,220
[This... ah, really... ha.]

1899

[COKUN joins. This time, we'll have a group of cameras.]

2079

I promise.

2080
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:42,780
I will become a light upon dark road.

[Your light~]

2084

2085
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,900
Really. We've got very precious shots.

[Laughing]

2087
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,050
It's very clear.

2088
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,580
[It looks like a movie no matter how I shoot it.]

2089

[Bow]

2090
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,410

[Haha...Thank you.]

2092
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,230
You really look like a director.

[Right, G-DRAGON looks like a director.]

2094
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:07,760
-Right, right? 
-Like a movie.

-You have to sing a song to end. 
-Right.

2097
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:11,410

Are you going to sing "Crooked"?

2106
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,740
Yes. Of course it should be "Crooked". Yes.

2107
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,880
-"Crooked" is perfect for the finale. 
-Very true.

2108
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,180

One, two, three, four.

2113
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,420
[Don't miss it.]

2114
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:42,500
No forever.

2117
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,420
[Yoo! No reason!]

2118
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,340
[Heart! No sincerity!]

2119

[Let it go wild tonight!]

2121
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,220
Leave me alone.

2122
01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:00,850
I've always been alone.

2123
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,900
[Yes! Yes! I have nothing!]

2124
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,700
[Loyalty! Loyalty! meaningless!]

[Ah! The comfort wrapped with sugar! Comfort!]

2126
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,350
Let it go wild tonight.

2127
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,670
Shout out loud, I feel dizzy.

2128
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:16,380
I'm venting my anger on a street couple.

2129
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,420
[Making trouble for no reason!]

2130
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,980
[Like a gangster!]

2131
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,110
Sometimes I often fool around.

2132

[Trying to provoke the neighborhood 'oppa'.]

2133
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,630

[(The director is back.)]

2135
