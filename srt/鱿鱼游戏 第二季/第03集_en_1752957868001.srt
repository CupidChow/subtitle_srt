1
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,360
成社长不会有事吧？
Do you think Mr. Seong will be okay?

2
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,154
不会已经出事了吧？
What if they already did something to him?

3
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,407
如果想弄死他
就没必要带到这么远的地方了
They wouldn't have brought him this far
if they wanted to kill him.

4
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,910
他们带成社长去那个岛了吗？
进行游戏的那个岛？
Do you think they've taken him
to the island where they play the games?

5
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,456
目前还不确定 但很有可能
I'm not sure, but it seems likely.

6
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,126
我记得那个岛
就在这片海的某个地方 我确定
If I recall,
the island was somewhere in this area.

7
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:47,047
“如果我们活捉负责人失败
无论如何都要想办法潜入游戏岛”
"If we fail to capture the Front Man,
we infiltrate the island."

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,091
按照成社长制定的备用计划行动
That was Mr. Seong's plan B.
It's going according to plan.

9
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,344
游戏一旦开始
成奇勋说不定会有生命危险
Once the games begin,
Mr. Seong's life may be in danger.

10
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,888
必须尽快找到 免得为时已晚
We must find him before it's too late.

11
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:59,100
等我抓住那些混蛋
我非用电直接电死他们
If I catch those bastards,
I'm going to electrocute their asses.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,145

You can't leave or stay.

19

拼命反抗也没用 你的命就是这样
You can't fight it. It's your destiny.

20
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,015
在九泉游荡的那些人的冤魂
在你脑中挥之不去
You have souls hovering over your head
who are lingering in this world.

21
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,686
你来这里不是你的意愿
是那些冤魂把你拉来的
You're not here of your own will.
Those vengeful souls brought you.

22
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,899
如果我们离开这里 来找我做个法事
If we get out of here,
let me perform a ritual.

请问！
Excuse me.

28
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,363
如果只是来玩游戏
这样把人绑架过来
You said I'd be playing games,
but you practically kidnapped me.

29
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,948
叫人怎么相信？
So how can I believe that?

30
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,494
不好意思 为了维护游戏的安全
I apologize.
Please understand that it was necessary

31
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,330
只能出此下策 希望各位理解

32
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,749
那你们戴面具做什么？
What's with the mask then?

33
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,627
大叔你的脸也是秘密吗？
Is your face also a secret?

34
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,714
对啊！为什么把脸遮起来？
Yeah! Why are you hiding your face?

35
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,968
这里是那种非法赌场之类的地方吗？
Is this some kind of
illegal gambling house?

36
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,971
就算在那种地方
发牌的人也不遮住脸啊！
Even the dealers don't cover their faces
in those places.

37
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,932
对 就是啊

38
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,018

and put these on me?

42
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,903
这鞋是怎么回事？
What's with these shoes?

43
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,573
我的鞋子是限量版的
My shoes are limited fucking edition.

44
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,701
很难找的！
They're hard to find!

45
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,620
如果我那双鞋毁了 你们要负责吗？
You going to replace them
if they get ruined?

46
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,207
这衣服尺寸也不合适 颜色也这么丑
These don't fit and the color sucks.

47
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,378
你们穿的那衣服 给我一件不行吗？
Can I just have
what you're wearing instead?

48

为什么被拿走了？请还给我

to continue the games or not.

115

截至那个时候积累的奖金离开
you can leave with the prize money

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,663
就算玩完一个游戏就离开
也能得到奖金吗？
we'll still receive the money,
even if we leave after the first game?

119
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,958
没错
That is correct.

120
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,349

丢脸？
Embarrassing?

126

你要是知道丢脸 还能来这里？
If you knew what was embarrassing,
you wouldn't be here!

127
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,241

你这个混蛋小子
You fool.

135

为什么要把她弄来这里？
Why would you bring
a naive old woman here?

136
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,765
万一我妈妈在这里晕倒了
你们要负责吗？
Will you take responsibility
if my mom collapses?

孩子呢？
What about your kid?

279
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,638
妈妈带走了
With my wife.

280
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,058
为什么？你们感情不是很好吗？
Why? I thought you guys were doing okay.

281
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,145
你有外遇了？
Did you have an affair?

282
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,147
你看我像能有外遇嘛？
Yeah, like I could manage one.

283
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,565
别在这里说了
Let's not talk about it here.

284
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,776
游戏结束之后
出去一起喝一杯 聊聊这些
When we get out,
let's go for a drink and talk.

285
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,908
正倍 现在开始
一定要紧紧跟在我身后
Jung-bae. Whatever happens from now on,
stay close to me.

286
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,410
都不见我了 突然这么肉麻
紧紧跟着你干吗？小子
"Stay close"? You've gotten melodramatic.

287
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,995
一定要听我的话！
Just do as I say!

288
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,998
一定要紧紧跟在我身后！
You must stay close behind me!

289
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,628
行了 知道了
All right, man. I will.

290
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,381
怎么还突然玩上火车游戏了 嗯？
Like this? Like Follow the Leader?

291
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,592
喂 不过这个地方的结构
怎么弄得这么复杂？
By the way, this is crazy.
What is this place?

292
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,159
（实时位置信息）

293
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,744
是这边！
This way!

294
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,670
从小岛周边开始 低调一点
Start from the coast. Keep it low.

295
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,754
是
Got it.

296
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,025

- Hey, señorita.

302
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,877
你不认识我吗？
Don't you know who I am?

303
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,961
应该认识吗？
Do I have to?

304
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,755
不认识也没关系
No, you don't.

305
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,883
现在开始认识就行了
你住哪里？几岁了？
We can get to know each other.
Tell me about yourself.

306
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,927
你在撩我吗？
Are you hitting on me?

307
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,306
人山人海中 你立刻吸引了我的眼球
<i>In the sea of faces, you caught my eye</i>

308
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,476
一片杂草中盛开的 我的美丽花朵
<i>My beauty, my flower blooming among weeds</i>

309
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,521
红、橙、黄、绿 我是传奇萨诺斯
<i>Red, orange, yellow, green</i>
<i>I'm a legend, Thanos</i>

310
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,858
看看我们这蓝绿色衣服
<i>Look at us in this blue-green</i>

311
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,110
拜托给我开绿灯
<i>Now give me the green light</i>

312
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,948

What's that thing?

315
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,229
可恶 这不是给人走的路啊
Damn, this isn't built for us to walk on.

- 不是赌博 是游戏
- 小孩玩的游戏啊
We're playing games, not gambling.

320
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,438
This is a children's game.

321
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,776
“一二三 木头人”？小时候玩那种？
Red Light, Green Light? The kids' game?

322
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,111
大叔
Hey, you.

327
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,457
别动
Do not move.

328
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,208
你干什么呢？怎么了？
What are you doing?

329
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,964
你把种植牙拔了吗？
Is that your dental implant?

330
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,549
在哪里？
Where is it?

331
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,060
妈的
Damn it.

332
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,238
死定了
<i>I'm fucked.</i>

333
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,574
- 这是从哪里来的？

- Get what?

334
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,159
这个为什么在你这里？
Why was this in here?

335
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,245
那个？是我刚才上船之前
That? Before I got on the boat here,

336
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,333
有人说是他剩的虫子
把这些送给我了 怎么了？
some guy said he had leftover bait
and gave that to me. Why?

337
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,420
黄刑警 完蛋了 被他们发现了
Detective Hwang, we're screwed.
They're onto us.

338
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,215
他们把追踪器
放在别人身上 送到了这里
<i>They put the GPS tracker on someone else.</i>

339
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,470

354
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,068
那位大叔喝酒了吧？
That guy must be drunk.

355
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,487
- 一定要格外小心！
- 他说如果我们被抓到会挨枪
- Stay on your toes!

356
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,114
像我们家老头子似的
He sounds like my old man

357
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:13,034
喝醉回家 刚到门口就开始胡言乱语

被侦测到就要去见爸爸了？
We might get to join Dad today.

362
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,008
说什么鬼话呢？
What the hell are you talking about?

363
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:32,637
那个人应该是故意吓我们
想自己独吞奖金
I think he's trying to scare us
so he can win the prize money.

364
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,930

别说了 你这样我更害怕了！
Cut it out. It's you that's scaring me!

你身上有只蜜蜂
He knows you're a flower.
There's a bee on you.

426
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:51,808
那个娃娃是动作探测器！
That doll is a motion detector!

427
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,352
躲在后面侦测不到！
But it can't detect motion
that's not visible to it!

428
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,482
身形小的人躲在比你大的人后面！
Get behind someone bigger than you!

429
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,985
像玩小火车游戏那样

430
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,322
没时间了 现在必须快走！
We're running out of time!

473
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,646
喂 不要这样待着啊
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

474
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,357
附近的其他小岛
都应该找找看 不是吗？
We should at least search
some nearby islands.

475
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,819
他们把我们往这个方向诱导
就应该不在这附近
They led us here, so I don't think
they're anywhere in this area.

476
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,238
今天晚上有风浪预警
A storm warning
has been issued for tonight.

477
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,365
我们最好先回港口
We'd better head back to port.

478
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,575
该死
Damn it.

479
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,702
搜索可能要花上好一阵子
The search may take a while.

480
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,204
回去重新想个计划 再准备行动
We should go back
and come up with a new plan.

481
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,999
是谁走漏了消息？
Who leaked the information?

482
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,836
喂 是不是你们谁喝醉了酒
到处乱说了？
Did one of you get drunk
and blab about it somewhere?

483
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,387
走吧 天气又冷
也快黑天了 快点出发吧！
All right, it's getting cold and dark.
Let's get moving.

484
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,580
哥 你哪里不舒服吗？
You're not feeling well?

485
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,793
- 别担心
- 啊？
- Don't worry.
- What?

486
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,211
我没事
I'm okay.

487
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:44,673
喂 奇勋 那个长得
像疯女人的娃娃是什么鬼？
Gi-hun. What the hell is that creepy doll?

488
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,217
还能用眼睛开枪
It shoots people with its eyes.

489
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,845
不是娃娃开的枪
It's not the doll.

490
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,307
有枪手在别的地方
There are shooters.

491
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:59,605
你怎么知道这么多？
你真的以前来过这里吗？
How do you know so much?

492
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,814
Have you really been here before?

493
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:24,547
恭喜各位通过第一个游戏

我儿子欠的钱 一直到我死之前

00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:02,042
我会不惜一切代价把钱还上！

503
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,753
求求你们 饶了我们吧！

505
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,802
我真的错了 求求你们饶我一次
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

506
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,764
- 我一定会赚钱还的！
- 各位好像误会了
- I promise I'll pay it back!
- There seems to be a misunderstanding.

507
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,808
饶了我们吧！
Please don't kill us!

508
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:22,313
- 请饶了我们吧！
- 饶了我们吧！
- Please don't kill us!
- Please spare us!

509
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,027
我们并没有要伤害各位
We are not trying to harm you.

510
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,613
我们是在给各位一个机会
We are presenting you with an opportunity.

511
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,156
同意书第三条！
Clause three of the consent form.

512
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:39,622
“超过一半的玩家同意
可以终止游戏”
"The games may be terminated
upon a majority vote."

513
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,332
对吧？
Correct?

514
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,959
没错
That is correct.

515
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,670
那现在立刻让我们投票
Then let us take a vote right now.

516
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,007
当然可以
Of course.

517
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:55,596
我们尊重各位的自由意愿决定
We respect your right
to freedom of choice.

518
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,897
那么在投票前
我来揭晓目前为止累积的奖金数额
But first, let me announce
the prize amount that's been accumulated.

519
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,901
第一局游戏被淘汰的有91人
The number of players
eliminated in the first game is 91.

520
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,780
因此积累了总计91亿韩元
Therefore, a total of 9.1 billion won
has been accumulated.

521
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,700
如果各位现在退出游戏
If you quit the games now, the 365 of you

522
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:02,997
91亿的奖金要在剩下的365人中平分

523
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,997
can equally divide the 9.1 billion won

524
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,207
各位带着自己的分成数额离开
and leave with your share.

525
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,918
那是多少？
How much is that?

526
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:12,631
每个玩家的分成是2493万1500韩元
Each person's share would be
24,931,500 won.

527
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,384
操 我们玩个游戏差点死了
就给我们2400万？
Fuck. We almost died,
and they're giving us 24 million?

528
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,344
说什么屁话呢 操
That's fucking bullshit.

529
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,471
两千万？
Twenty million?

530
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,642
不是说456亿吗！
You said 45.6 billion!

531
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,853
根据游戏规则
The rule is that

532
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,607
每淘汰一名玩家 奖金累积一亿韩元
a hundred million won will be accumulated
for each eliminated player.

533
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,902
如果进行下一场游戏 还有玩家淘汰
If you choose to play the next game
and more players get eliminated,

534
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,031
奖金数额会相应增加
the prize amount
will increase accordingly.

535
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:41,076
那么如果走到最后 奖金有多少？
How much will it be
if you survive until the end?

536
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,037
我已经说过了
As I already told you,

537
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,957
总共456名玩家 总奖金数额是
the total amount of prize money
for all 456 players

538
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,959
456亿
is 45.6 billion won.

539
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,546
通过全部六场游戏的玩家
Those who make it through all six games

540
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,342
可以平分总奖金456亿
will equally divide the 45.6 billion won.

541
00:43:56,425 --> 00:44:01,430
所以如果只剩下一个人
456亿可以独吞？
So if you're the only one to survive,
you get 45.6 billion?

542
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,766
没错
That is correct.

543
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,560
456亿？哇！
45.6 billion? Wow!

544
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:12,107
下一个游戏结束后出来
还是可以投票退出 对吧？
So we can take a vote again
and decide to leave after the next game?

545
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,401
正如同意书上承诺的那样
As promised in the consent form,

546
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,696
各位可以在每场游戏结束后通过投票
you can take a vote after each game

547
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,867
决定带着当时积累的奖金离开
and decide to leave with the prize money
accumulated up to that point.

548
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:29,958
我们始终认为
各位玩家主动参与的意愿是最重要的
We always prioritize
your voluntary participation.

549
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,590

这一切都毫无意义！
It's all pointless!

555
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,549
正如你们无法决定
什么时候来到这个世界上一样
You didn't decide
when to come into this world,

556
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,094
离开的时候 你们也无法决定
and you can't decide
when you leave it either.

557
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,639
你们何时何地死亡
When and where you die

558
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,934
出生的那一刻开始
天地神明就已经决定了
were already decided by the gods
the moment you were born.

559
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:35,399
不管怎么拼命挣扎 都绝对无法逃脱

you can never escape it.

00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,581
等一下 各位！等等！
Wait a minute, everyone! Wait!

573
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,876
不能再这样下去了
You can't do this.

574
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,546
清醒一点！你们还没明白吗？
Come to your senses!

575
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,546
Don't you see?

576
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,048
这不是普通的游戏
These aren't just any games.

577
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,634
继续玩下去 我们都会死！
We will all die if we keep playing!

578
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,390
我们必须马上离开这里
只要投票赢了 就可以离开这里！
We have to get out of here now.

579
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,390
With a majority vote, we can!

580
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,475
我们必须在这里停下！
We must stop here!

581
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,477
你以为你是谁啊？
Who do you think you are?

582
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,647
为什么从刚才开始
就一直怂恿所有人？
Why do you keep
egging people on like that?

583
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,650
游戏还没开始呢
就说他们会开枪 吓我们！
You scared us by saying they'd shoot us
before the game even began!

584
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,068
对啊！
That's right!

585
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,572
这个男的跑到我们面前 一直说会死
He was going on about how we'd die,

586
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,074
我因为他说那些话更紧张了
差点因为他死了！
and I almost did because I got so nervous!

587
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,535
但你是怎么知道他们会开枪的？
How did you know
they were going to shoot us?

588
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,745
你是他们的一员吗？
Are you one of them?

589
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,125
你是内部工作人员
假扮成玩家进来骗我们吗？
Are you conning us all
by pretending to be a player?

590
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,294
你这人怎么回事？
Who is this guy?

591
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,130
这个人是你们为了操纵我们
故意安插的眼线吧？
Did you plant him to mess with our heads?

592
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,758
大叔 你怎么能这么说话呢？
That's uncalled for.

593
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:52,512
多亏了这位朋友 我们才打起精神
没有被发现移动 这才活了下来！
We wouldn't have won the game
and survived if it weren't for him!

594
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:57,059
还有你！我刚才全都看到了
你在那里怕得要死 腿一直在抖
And you! I saw how scared you were.
Your legs were shaking.

595
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,519
你应该对他心存感激才对
怎么能觉得他是骗子！
You should thank him,
not treat him like a fraud!

596
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,230
你是谁啊 站出来替他说话？
你们俩是一伙的吗？
And who the hell are you?
Are you conspiring with him?

597
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,815
“你”？你几岁了？
Rude. How old are you?

598
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,901
我比你大怎么办 嗯？
Older than you. What are you going to do?

599
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,985
行了 别这样了
- Come on now.
- What?

600
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,988
各位
Please don't do this. Listen.

601
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,742
我和各位都是
None of us would be alive

602
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:18,246
如果不是这位先生 现在早都死了
if it weren't for this gentleman.

603
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,041
各位不要贪心了
So enough with the greed.

604
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,460
要认识到生命的可贵
Let's put our lives first

605
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,504
所有人离开这里吧 好吗？
and get out of this place! Okay?

606
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,507
- 离开这里！
- 我们全部离开这里！
- That's right!
- Let's all get out of here!

607
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,343
- 离开什么离开！继续游戏啊！
- 干什么要离开啊？
- Let's get out of here!
- No, we have to keep playing!

608
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:40,018
我以前参加过这些游戏！
I have played these games before!

609
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,856
我以前参加过！
I have done this before!

610
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:51,697
我从第一个游戏就知道
是因为我以前玩过 全都见过！
I knew about the first game
because I had played it before!

611
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,742
我三年前在这里玩过这些游戏！
I played the games here three years ago!

612
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,912
当时和我一起玩游戏的人
And everyone who was with me…

613
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,125
全部都死了！
died here!

614
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,670
- 真的全都死了吗？
- 真死了？
- They all died?
- All of them?

615
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,422
- 真的吗？不可能吧？
- 等一下
- Really? No way.
- Hold on.

616
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,049
他们全都死了
你是怎么一个人活下来的？
If they all died,
how did you survive alone?

617
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,929
你是自己一个人赢了吗？
Wait, are you saying
you were the sole winner?

618
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,726
没错
That's right.

619
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,897
我是当时的赢家
I was the final winner.

620
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,195
再继续游戏
If we continue the games,

621
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,033
这里的每一个人
every single person here,

622
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,828
都会像当时的那些人一样
just like all the people back then,

623
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,706
全部死亡
will die in the end.

624
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,502
放屁
Bullshit.

625
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:52,507
如果你是唯一的赢家
你应该赢了456亿
If you were the sole winner,
it means you won 45.6 billion won.

626
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,677
那你为什么又回来这里？
If you really did,
why would you come back here?

627
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,554
没错！他在骗人！
That's right! He's lying!

628
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:58,764
对 你少放屁！
Cut the crap!

629
00:50:58,847 --> 00:50:59,931
他就是个疯子！
He's a total nutcase!

630
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,892
你这样的人能赢 我也能赢！
If someone like you can win, so can I!

631
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,853
如果你真的赢过 那就更好了
If you really won,
it actually works better for us.

632
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,065
你可以给我们一些提示
You can give us some tips

633
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,526
怎么玩能获胜
on how to beat these games.

634
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,445
没错！
That's right!

635
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:18,283
我们这里有人赢过
还有什么好担心的？
We have a previous winner with us,
so what do we have to worry about?

636
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,911
我们再来一局吧！
Come on, let's do this!

637
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,162

640
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,214
去赚钱！
Let's make money!

641
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,259
我真的求你们了
我们必须马上出去！
Please, I'm begging you.
We have to get out now!

642
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:40,055
继续玩下去 会死更多的人
If we keep playing, more people will die.

643
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,266
死的也有可能是您啊
That could be you.

644
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,270
立刻停止游戏 离开这里吧！
We have to stop this now
and get out of here.

645
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,606

00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:56,988
