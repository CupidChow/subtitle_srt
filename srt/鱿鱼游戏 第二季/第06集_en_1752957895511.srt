165
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,212
- 410号
- 多亏你们 我才活了下来

166
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,963
You gentlemen saved my life.

167
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,172
- 423号
- 可是 您的儿子去哪里了？

168
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,172
Where's your son?

169
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,676
啊？
Sorry?

170
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,177
没有一起吗？
Weren't you with him?

171
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,389
啊！
Oh, well, I lost hold of him.

172
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,307
哎呀 我…

173
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,101
我跟儿子走丢了

174
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,644
我儿子…
He told me to wait
until he brought one more person,

175
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,023
说再去找一个人 让我等着

176
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,483
我有点懵了
but I lost him in all the fuss.

177
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,193
他后来没来吗？
He didn't come back?

178
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,080
我儿子不是那种人
My son isn't that kind of person.

179
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,043
再怎么穷 也是心性善良的孩子
We may be poor, but he has a good heart.

180
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,337
别人欺负他 他就忍着
He'd rather be bullied
than bully another human being.

181
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,174
不管去哪里
一次都没有伤害过别人！

182
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,049
He's never hurt a soul!

183
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,884
请不要乱说！
Watch what you say!

184
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,305
不好意思 我不是那个意思
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

185
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,276
欢迎回来 朋友们
Welcome back, my friends.

186
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,653
嘶咯！
Skrrt!

187
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,175
奶奶！
Mrs. Jang!

188
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,096
哎呀 大家都没事 太好了
Goodness! I'm so glad you're okay.

189
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,100
你们没有哪里受伤吧？
You're not hurt at all, are you?

190
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,811
这位帮我们活下来了
He saved our lives.

191
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,771
本来没多少时间了
Mr. 246 here showed up
when we were running out of time,

192
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,524
246号大叔突然就出现了

193
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,192
像白马王子一样！
just like Prince Charming!

194
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,112
哎呀 长得确实像王子呢
Boy, you do look like a prince.
Thank you so much.

195
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,239
- 真的很感谢
- 没事

196
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,367
Not at all. These two saved my life.

197
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,075
反而是这两位让我活了下来

198
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:42,868
容植呢？
Where's Yong-sik?

199
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:44,829
妈
Mom.

200
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,844
没事 妈妈活下来了
It's okay. I made it.

201
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,138
你没有哪里受伤吧？
You're not hurt, are you?

202
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,807
妈
Mom.

203
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,518
我…
I…

204
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,023
我对不起你
I'm so…

205
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,442
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

206
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,693
- 没有 没事
- 妈

207
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,486
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

208
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,111
- 我怎么办…
- 没有 没事

209
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,988
都活下来就行了
We both made it.

210
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,489
- 我对不起你
- 没有 没事的
I'm so sorry.

211
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,075
Don't be. We both made it.
That's all that matters.

212
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,283
现在你也活着 我也活着

213
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:24,785
妈

214
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,705
妈
Mom!

215
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:48,184
转圈圈 转圈圈
<i>Round and round</i>

216
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,062
转着圈圈 跳着舞
<i>Let's go around in circles and dance</i>

217
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,981
- 拍拍手…
- 六人

218
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,315
<i>Six.</i>

219
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,776
四女两男 你们先走！
Four women and two men, go!

220
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,819
- 哪个男的？
- 我要跟我妈一起！
- Which two men?
- I'm going with my mom!

221
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,987
我跟他们一起！
I… I'll go.

222
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,072
好 六个人快走！
Six! Go!

223
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,158
需要两个人！两个！
All right, we need two people!

224
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,075
那里！
Over there!

225
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,333
- What? Get out of here!
- Get out!

226
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,208
- 搞什么？快出去！
- 出去！

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,669
这里！这里没人 快！
Over here! This room is empty! Hurry!

228
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,962
十、九…
<i>Ten.</i>

229
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,304
七、六…
<i>Seven.</i>

230
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,305
<i>Six.</i>

231
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,473
- 英美呢？
- 姐姐
- Where's Young-mi?
- <i>Unnie</i>!

232
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,266
五、四、三…
<i>Four.</i>

233
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,266
<i>Three.</i>

234
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,184
英美！
Young-mi!

235
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,769
二、一
<i>Two.</i>

236
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,269
<i>One.</i>

237
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,359
姐姐
<i>Unnie</i>.

238
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,276
英美！
Young-mi!

239
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,694
英美！

240
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,071
英美！
Young-mi!

241
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,199
英美 英…

242
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,119
英… 英美！
Young-mi…

243
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,581
不要！
No.

244
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,875
不要！
No! Young-mi!

245
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:59,004
英美！

246
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,004
- No, Young-mi!
- Young-mi!

247
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,424
容植 怎么办？
Yong-sik, what do we do?

248
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,593
英美 怎么办？容植
Young-mi! What do we do?

249
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,678
都怪你！
It's your fault.

250
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,347
别说胡话
Don't kid yourself.

251
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,766
如果不是我 你们也都死了
If I hadn't come in, you'd be dead too.

252
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,395
都怪你！如果不是你
我本来可以救她的！
It's your fault! I could have saved her!

253
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,771
没时间了！
There was no time!

254
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,066
你出去救那个女的 你也会死！
The moment you went out to save her,

255
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,609
you'd have died
along with everyone else here

256
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,278
凑不够六个人
这里的所有人都会死！

257
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,528
for not having enough people!

258
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,739
是我来这里 把你们全救了！
I saved your lives!

259
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,909
不是吗？我说错了吗？
Isn't that right?

260
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,076
Am I wrong?

261
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,078
你们说说看啊！
Say something!

262
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,582
对
He…

263
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,918
这个人说得没错
is right about that.

264
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,922
没有
It's true. There wasn't enough time.

265
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,716
时间了

266
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:20,961
谢谢你
Thank you.

267
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,714
别误会
Don't get the wrong idea.

268
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,216
只是你说的话确实没错
What you said was right. That's all.

269
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,703
现在最后一轮开始
<i>Now, the final round will begin.</i>

270
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,626
转圈圈 转圈圈

271
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,294
你感觉这次会喊几个人？
What do you think it'll be this time?

272
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,047
两人
Two.

273
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,965
为什么？
Why?

274
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,592
还剩下126人
There are 126 people left,

275
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,969
有50个房间
and there are 50 rooms.

276
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,763
两两组合进房间 就是100个人
So there won't be enough rooms
for everyone, only for 100 people.

277
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,181
人数多 房间不够

278
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,726
只有先进房间的人能活下来
The rest will be killed.

279
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,773
叮铃铃铃…

280
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,442
两人
<i>Two.</i>

281
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,362
喂 奇勋
Gi-hun.

282
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,615
大哥 快走！
Gi-hun, let's go!

283
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,533
快走！
Come on!

284
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,985
干什么？放手！
What the hell? Let go of me!

285
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,987
- 快进去！
- 放开我！
Get in!

286
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,572
放开我！

287
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,286
- 出去
- 我们先进来的
Get out.

288
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,286
We were here first.

289
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,998
开门 混蛋 我先来的！
Open the door, you bastards!
I was here first!

290
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,209
- 对不住了
- 九、八…
I'm sorry!

291
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,918
<i>Eight.</i>

292
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,252
七、六…
<i>Seven.</i>

293
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:07,836
<i>Six.</i>

294
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,588
五、四…
<i>Five.</i>

295
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,671
<i>Four.</i>

296
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,466
三、二、一
<i>Three.</i>

297
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,882
<i>Two.</i>

298
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,800
<i>One.</i>

299
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,222
游戏结束
<i>Game over.</i>

300
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,667
救救我…

301
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,866
等回了宿舍 看看剩下的人
了解一下人数
When we get back, let's count
the number of people remaining.

302
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,201
为什么？
Why?

303
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,871
看看有多少圆圈和叉
If we count the numbers of Os and Xs,

304
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,417
这样就能大致预测
下次投票哪一方更有利
we'll be able to see
who's likely to win the next vote.

305
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,421
只能希望圆圈那边死的人更多了
We'll have to hope
more people from the other side died.

306
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,183
不过…
By the way,
what's this thing called again?

307
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,560
这个叫什么来着？

308
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,936
无人机
It's called a drone.

309
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,190
“无人机” 哎哟 真不错
"Drong"? It's so cool.

310
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,818
以前黄刑警自己一个人用望远镜看
Up until now, you had to use binoculars,

311
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,154
亲自到每个小岛上去查看
climb onto the island, and all that shit.

312
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,239
现在这样好方便啊
This makes things much easier.

313
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,949
飞行高度再低一点
Fly lower. They know we're onto them.
They likely improved their camouflage.

314
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,410
他们知道我们在找
可能会进行更彻底的伪装

315
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,328
好
Got it.

316
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,586
但是你那么努力找了两年
都没有找到
But what makes you think
we can find them within a few days

317
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,671
几天之内能找到吗？
when you couldn't over the last two years?

318
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,673
把这两年搜查过的地方排除掉
If we exclude the places
I've already searched,

319
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,051
可以缩小范围
we can narrow down the search area.

320
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,887
如果天公作美 天气好 应该能找到
We'll find them if the weather holds up.

321
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,641
对 现在还有高船长的船
还有这个无人鸟
That's right. We've got another team
and this "drong" thing now.

322
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,518
船长 不是“无人鸟” 是“无人机”！
Captain. It's "drone," not "drong."

323
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,603
弄不明白
Whatever.

324
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,950
我的小兄弟 敏秀！
My little boy, Min-su!

325
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,205
再见到你好开心啊 兄弟！
I'm so happy to see you again, bro.

326
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,542
敏秀 你知道大哥有多担心你吗？
Min-su, do you know how worried I was?

327
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,337
我以为我抓住了你的手在跑呢
I thought I was running with you.

328
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,256
但是跑着跑着发现
But then I realized
I was with this douche.

329
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,424
居然是这小子

330
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,427
哥 我就说这小子没那么容易死
刚才看到这小子了吧？
I told you he wouldn't die easily.
You saw what he did.

331
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,554
世美就这个样子
突然好像不会动了似的
When Se-mi stuck her hand out like this,
he took a beat, then went scissors.

332
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,056
他一下就出了剪刀

333
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,101
我那个瞬间都惊呆了
怎么还有这样的小子？
I thought, "Damn, he's unbelievable."

334
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,936
你真是让我起了一身鸡皮疙瘩 敏秀
I got chills, Min-su.

335
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,021
我们再玩一局游戏 好吗？
Let's play one more game, okay?

336
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,481
你会再玩一局游戏吧？
You'll play one more, right?

337
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,613
你想说什么？快点说
What did you want to tell me?
Make it quick.

338
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,907
纯熙
Jun-hee.

339
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,244
我们出去之后重新开始吧
When we get out, let's start over.

340
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,787
“重新”？
"Start over"?

341
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,206
怎么重新开始？
How exactly?

342
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,958
你再相信我一次
Trust me one last time.

343
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,045
我们把孩子生下来 可以重新开始的
We can have our baby and start over.

344
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,968
我大概数了一下这里剩的人
I did some calculations.

345
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,387
一个人大概能有三、四亿奖金
Each person will get 300 to 400 million.

346
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,764
以这个金额 想出去的人应该不少
A lot of people will want to leave.

347
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,433
下次投票我们有胜算
We could win the next vote.

348
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,227
出去…
If we get out,

349
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,521
之后呢？
then what?

350
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,317
我们两个的钱合起来 数额很大
If we put our money together,
it'll be a lot.

351
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,069
我们用这笔钱把着急还的债先还了
We'll pay off some urgent debts first.

352
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,238
剩下的钱 我找找新的投资方式
I'll find a new way of investing
the rest of the money.

353
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,326
我不会再投资币了
No more coin.

354
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,912
我在股市那边认识一个不错的团队
I know a team of great stockbrokers.

355
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,373
他们搞做空ETF和期货
They deal in inverse ETFs
and futures trading.

356
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,251
光是上个月 收益率就有100%
Their profit rate was
over 100% last month.

357
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,879
你是需要我的钱吧？
It's my money you need, isn't it?

358
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,548
不是需要我们的孩子
Not me and the baby.

359
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,258
不是那样的 纯熙
It's not like that, Jun-hee.

360
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,928
我会努力赚钱
我们两个一起好好过日子…
I want to make enough money
to build a good life for us--

361
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:27,846
“努力”？
"Enough money"?

362
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,182
努力能赚多少？
How much is that exactly?

363
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,558
嗯？
What?

364
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,271
你的债 你自己想办法还
Pay your debts with your own money.

365
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,566
我会用我得到的钱养我的孩子
I'm going to use mine to raise my baby.

366
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,571
纯熙
Jun-hee.

367
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,408
- 敏秀、南秀、景秀、萨诺秀
- 纯熙 你先听我说
- Listen to me.
- <i>Min-su, Nam-su, Gyeong-su, so many "su"s</i>

368
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,328
哥 你看看他们
Hey, look at those two.

369
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,833
- 他们什么情况？
- 那种关系？
What's going on?

370
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,833
Maybe they're a thing.

371
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,796
臭小子真有手段 到这里还能撩妹
That bastard sure is lucky.

372
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,129
Even in a place like this.

373
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,886
你不用那么悲伤
Don't be so sad.

374
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,431
你们也会成为她黄泉路上的
You will be joining her
in the underworld soon.

375
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,600
同伴

376
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,897
你们得到了我的诅咒
I've put a curse on you all.

377
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,444
我向天地神明虔诚地祈祷了
I've been praying to the gods
of heaven and earth with all my heart

378
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,115
你们所有人都会在这里
to let me see all of you

379
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,035
一个接一个咽气
die in this place, one by one!

380
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,623
你们也绝对无法活着从这里出去
You'll never get out of here alive.

381
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,252
你们会死得非常痛苦 惨不忍睹
You will die a miserable, painful death,

382
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,589
互相看着对方死去
staring at each other the whole time.

383
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,562
呵…

384
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,648
这个人不是巫女
That woman is not a shaman,
she's just a lunatic.

385
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,859
是个傻子吧

386
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,318
哎哟 真是的
Good grief.

387
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,070
呸呸呸！

388
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,282
你也呸呸呸！
You should spit too.

389
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:12,993
喂 奇勋
Gi-hun, there are 55 people
who voted in favor of continuing.

390
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,287
圆圈有55人

391
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,873
- 确定吗？
- 数了两次呢
Are you sure?

392
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,331
I counted them twice.

393
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,375
大哥您呢？您把自己算进去了吧？
What about you? Did you include yourself?

394
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,004
那就是56人
It's 56.

395
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:24,963
哎…

396
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,842
叉有44个人 相差12人
We have 44 people on our side,
so we're outnumbered by 12.

397
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,761
那这次投票也很难赢了
Shoot, that means
we're likely to lose again.

398
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,389
虽然看起来差距很大
It may seem like a big difference,

399
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,435
那边如果有六个人改变心意
就是50对50了
but if six of them change their minds,
it'll be 50/50, all tied.

400
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,189
有七个人改变心意 我们就赢了
If seven of them change their minds,
we could win.

401
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,108
可是相反的 上次选叉的人
也有可能改变心意 想选圆圈
But those who pressed X
might change their minds too.

402
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,986
上次选叉的人
They probably won't
change their minds easily.

403
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,696
应该不会改变心意

404
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,780
为什么？
Why not?

405
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,951
因为那些人
在奖金不多的时候 也不想玩了
They wanted to quit
even when the prize was smaller.

406
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,079
现在可以拿着更多的奖金出去
Now they can leave with even more money.

407
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,291
应该不会再继续冒着生命危险玩游戏
They wouldn't want to risk their lives
playing another game.

408
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,793
我一定会按叉
I'm going to press X this time.

409
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,755
只要再拉过来五个人 就是平局了
That means we'll have a tie
if five others change their minds.

410
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,089
再拉过来六个 就赢了
With six more, we win.

411
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,510
那现在大家一起去找选圆圈的人
Then let's go over there
and try to convince them.

412
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,928
去说服大家

413
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,054
不行 那样很危险
No, that's too risky.

414
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,056
那边无论如何
Most of them will want
to continue the games.

415
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,058
都一定要继续游戏的人更多

416
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,145
我们过去的话
那边的人也不会坐视不管
If we make a move,
they won't just sit back and watch.

417
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,772
那就只能在这里
So you think we should just stand here

418
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,651
祈祷他们千万要改变心意吗？
and pray they change their minds?

419
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,237
那样的话 如果再输
What if we lose again?

420
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:34,074
大家手拉手
一起去再来一局游戏吗？
We march down, hand in hand,
to play another game?

421
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,367
我能理解你的心情
I understand how you feel.

422
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,411
我也想现在立刻就出去
I also wish I could leave right now.

423
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,873
但是这种时候 更是要冷静
But this is the moment to stay calm.

424
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,833
“冷静”？
"Stay calm"?

425
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,753
你已经看到过两轮投票了
We've already taken a vote twice.

426
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,089
如果没办法说服
If we can't convince them,

427
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,300
就算抓住他们领口
也要给他们拉过来这边
we'll have to bring them over
to our side by force.

428
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,010
如果现在刺激那边
If we provoke them now,

429
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,055
说不定投票之前就会惹出大矛盾
we may end up in a big fight
before we even get to vote.

430
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,307
那是你希望的吗？
Is that what you want, Gi-hun?

431
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,730
对啊 奇勋
Look, Gi-hun.

432
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,650
我都吓死了 没办法再继续玩了
I'm too scared to play another game.

433
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,695
那边肯定也有跟我想法相似的人
I'm sure there are more people like me.

434
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,613
哎 大哥们
That's right. That's what I think too.

435
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:18,493
我也觉得六个人的差距
投票还是有机会的

436
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:19,119
If it's just five or six people,
we've got a shot.

437
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,080
现在一个人大概有三亿奖金
I did the math, and the prize is
now over 300 million per person.

438
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,083
这个数量 我觉得我们赢的概率很大
I think that gives us
a pretty good chance.

439
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,598
恭喜各位玩家
Congratulations to all of you
for making it through the third game.

440
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,933
通过第三个游戏

441
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:46,646
那么现在公布第三个游戏的结果
Now, here are the results
of the third game.

442
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,574
等一下
Hang on. Can you double back?

443
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,075
刚才路过那里 再回去看一下

444
00:26:59,159 --> 00:26:59,993
好
Sure.

445
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,291
那边地下肯定有什么 树也很稀疏
There's something on the ground.

446
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,127
- 那个是什么？是门吗？
- 再往下降点看看
What's that? A door?

447
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,419
Get down lower.

448
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,881
有树 没办法再往下降了
I can't because of the trees.

449
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,549
我们得亲自上岛看看
We've got to go check it out.

450
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,803
来 各位准备上岸！
Everyone, get ready to move!

451
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,138
（100人 每人奖金3亿5600万）

452
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,765
3亿5600万
It's 356 million won.

453
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,727
对 这个金额
肯定会有几个人改变心意
With that kind of money,
some of them will change their minds.

454
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,271
只要有六个人就平局
If we get six more people, it's a tie.
If it's seven, we win.

455
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,523
有七个人就胜利

456
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:34,861
本次投票再次按照倒序进行
The vote will once again be conducted
in reverse order of your player numbers.

457
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,864
请456号进行投票
Player 456, please cast your vote.

458
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,619
为了公正、民主地进行投票
To ensure fair and democratic voting,

459
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:47,540
现在开始 禁止所有扰乱投票的行为
we will not tolerate
any disruptions from this point onward.

460
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,876
希望各位注意
Please bear that in mind.

Number 011.

467
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,527
早点配合多好 嗯？
If you'd done this sooner, you wouldn't
have gotten a scratch on your pretty face.

468
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,195
我就不用亲你漂亮的脸蛋了

469
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,239
以后也麻烦你照顾了
Let's keep it this way.

470
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,139
230号
Player 230.

471
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,235
圆圈加油！
Circle! Let's go!

472
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,879
再有四个 再有四个人改变就赢了
It's four people now.
Four more, and we win.

473
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,631

475
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,512

480
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,698
哥 我跟他都聊完了
I already talked to him.

481
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,577
就只再来一局 带着十亿离开这里

119号
Player 119.

489

两个 再有两个就好了
Two more. We need two more people.

490
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,465
看起来是通往地下的门
I think it leads underground.

491
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,549
确认一下
Open it.

492
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:05,942
15号
Player 015.

493
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,709
他换边了 换成叉了
He switched to X!

494
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,753
That's six! It's a tie now.

495
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,753
- 好了
- 六个人了 现在平局了

496
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,046
再来一个人就赢了
If we get one more person, we win.

497
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,925

九号
Player 009.

499
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,316
好 加油！

500
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,861
喂 没关系 那个女人本来就选了圆圈
It's all right. She voted O before anyway.

501
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,279
七号
Player 007.

502
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,415
您儿子这次肯定会选叉吧？
Your son will definitely vote X
this time, right?

503
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,042
不用担心
Don't worry. My Yong-sik
will definitely press X this time.

504
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,754
我们容植这次一定会选叉

505
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:10,923
他换边了！
He switched sides! That's it!

506
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,341
好了！

507
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,427
好了
Yes!

508
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,180
回家吧！
Let's go home!

509
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,098
对 容植 我们回家吧！
- Yes! Let's go home!
- Yes!

510
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,185
- 六号
- 七个人了
- Player 006.
- He was the seventh one.

511
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,068
现在可以了 剩下的人全是叉了
We did it. They're both on our side.
We're going to win!

512
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:30,985
赢了

513
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,538
那个 奇勋…
Gi-hun.

514
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,415
嗯
Yeah?

515
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,167
话说 零一先生…
About Young-il…

516
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,422
- 怎么了？
- 就是…
What about him?

517
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,467
Well, when I was
in the room with him earlier…

518
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,217
刚才在房间里

519
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,684
这样才对嘛！

520
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,062
好了！

521
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,314
- 好了！
- 做得好！

522
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,233
好了

523
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,445
做得好
Good job.

524
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,447
- Well done! That's great!
- Yes!

525
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,156
要继续

526
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,493
最后 一号
Lastly, Player 001.

527
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,453
请投票
Please cast your vote.

528
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,837
零一哥
Brother Young-il.

529
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,714
加油！
Let's go!

530
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,260
大哥 50对50的话 是平局 对吧？
It's going to be 50/50,
so it's still a tie, isn't it?

531
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,401
但是我有点害怕零一先生
Young-il scares me a little.

532
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,946
怕什么？
What do you mean?

533
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,826
有点不好说…
I don't know how to put this,

534
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,329
刚才最后一轮游戏的时候 在房间里…
but when I was in the room with him
in the last game…

535
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:08,958
他把一个…
he…

536
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,212
That's it! Finally.

537
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,212
啊 好了

538
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,382
Oh, my God.

539
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,092
好了
We did it.

540
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,725
好了 行了 平局
We did it.

541
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,100
It's a tie.

542
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,520
那么现在整理一下投票结果
The vote has ended.

543
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,272
现在两边票数一样
Wait, it's a tie. What happens now?

544
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,733
那要怎么办？

545
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,401
同意书第三项
Clause three of the consent form.

546
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:40,448
“投票结果如果出现平局
再次进行投票”
"In the case of a tie,
players will vote again."

547
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:44,368
那什么时候再次进行投票？
So when are we going to vote again?

548
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,246
为了给各位思考的时间
To give you some time to think,

549
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,041
明天重新进行投票
the vote will be conducted tomorrow.

550
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:55,046
投票之前
请各位认真考虑自己的未来
Until then, please think carefully
about your future.

551
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:27,119
不是应该先回港口吗？
Listen. Maybe we should head back to port.

552
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,914
不是说若几天内找不到
游戏还是什么的 就都结束吗？
Isn't it all over
if we don't find it in the next few days?

553
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,249
确实是那样
That's true,
but you should take him to the hospital.

554
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,085
但那位朋友需要去医院

555
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,004
怎么样？能坚持住吗？
How are you holding up?
Can you push through?

556
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,131
能 我没事
Yes, I'm okay.

557
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,551
已经止血了
也进行缝针了 应该没事的
His bleeding has stopped,
and I stitched him up. He'll be fine.

558
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,388
但毕竟死人了…
Still, someone just died.

559
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,806
继续搜查吧
Let's keep going.

560
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,683
要想让那个人闭上眼睛安息
He won't be able to rest in peace

561
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,185
我们必须找到那些人 报仇雪恨
until we even the score
with those bastards.

562
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,980
不过 他们既然设置了陷阱
But they've even set up booby traps.

563
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,607
应该已经知道了我们的移动路线
That means they already know
our whereabouts.

564
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,238
从现在开始 对讲机频道每天换一次
From now on, a different radio channel
will be used each day,

565
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,990
禁止使用手机
and cell phone usage is prohibited.

566
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:05,950
都听到了吧？
You heard him.

567
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:06,867
是
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

568
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,161
请您跟二号船也说一声
Please let Team 2 know.

569
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,094
你刚才想说什么？
- What were you going to tell me earlier?
- What?

570
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,012
嗯？

571
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,139
你说零一怎么的？
About Young-il during the last game.

572
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,308
玩游戏的时候怎么了？

573
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,437
把我的给你一点？

574
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,692
真的很好吃 绝了

575
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,570
没事 怎么会是人奇怪呢？
奇怪的是这个地方
I guess it's not him. It's this place
that's making everyone crazy.

576
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,656
想办法快点从这里出去吧
We have to get out of here.

577
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,575
哎呀 再待下去 我也会变得奇怪了
I might go crazy too if I stay any longer.

578
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,584
我好害怕零一哥
You know, Young-il.

579
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,129
会像第一天晚上那样 换成选圆圈
I thought you might vote in favor,
like on day one.

580
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,299
我担心死了 都不敢看了
I was so nervous, I couldn't watch.

581
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,260
而且刚才正倍哥一直说奇怪的话…
Jung-bae also said something weird--

582
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,470
吃吧 你快吃吧
Just eat.

583
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,388
你不是饿了嘛？
Aren't you hungry?

584
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,352
零一 谢谢你
多亏了你 我们有机会了
Thank you, Young-il.
You gave us another chance.

585
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,188
我也只是想活命
No, I just wanted to stay alive.

586
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:24,487
现在我也赚到了需要的数额
当然要从这里出去
The money is enough now too,
so I should get out of here.

587
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,614
活着出去
Alive.

588
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,452
但如果再进行一次投票
But do you think
we'll be able to win the second vote?

589
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,621
我们能赢吗？

590
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,123
现在只能豁出去了
We'll have to go for broke.

591
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,293
就像刚才奇勋说的那样
Like Gi-hun said earlier,

592
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,379
明天投票之前
we should try to convince some of them
to change their minds

593
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,340
要说服那边的几个人

594
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,717
试着让他们改变心意
before the second vote.

595
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,969
Will they though?

596
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,886
能做到吗？

597
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,390
选圆圈那些人
为了钱已经完全失去理智了
They seem to have
lost their minds over the money.

598
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,017
在我看来 我们这边更有利
The way I see it,
we're more likely to win.

599
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,062
哎呀 吃一条紫菜包饭
All we've got to eat
is this roll of <i>gimbap</i>.

600
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,606
明天早上得有多饿啊
Everyone will be so hungry tomorrow.

601
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:04,860
人饿了就会想家
When you're hungry,
you start to miss home.

602
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,281
那边的！
Hey!

603
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,119
吃紫菜包饭的时候就不要苦恼了
Don't agonize over your decision
while eating this dry <i>gimbap</i>.

604
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,205
只要一个人来这边就好
I just want one of you
to come over to our side.

605
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:19,333
那样我们明天早上就能出去
If we get out of here tomorrow morning,

606
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,627
就能吃上韩牛了！
we could get Korean beef!

607
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,630
哎呀 不如直接我请客得了！
I'll tell you what. It's my treat!

608
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,758
吃完之后我再请客吃冷面！
And after that, the noodles are on me!

609
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,260
Come over to our side! Anyone!

610
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,260
过来吧 来一个人！

611
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,803
过来这边吧！
Come on over!

612
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,597
下一局游戏里 等你们都死了
Once you all die in the next game,

613
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,684
我们就能每个人带着八亿离开了！
we can all leave with 800 million each!

614
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,853
有了八亿
With 800 million,
we could buy a freaking cattle ranch!

615
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,022
开个韩牛牧场都还能剩下很多！

616
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:43,816
- 没错！
- 都过来！
- That's right!
- You can join us!

617
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,068
- 过来 这群混蛋！
- 对 过来吧！
- That's right! Come on over!
- Come over to our side!

618
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,027
过来！

619
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,697
八亿？说什么八亿 痴心妄想呢？
You'll get 800 million?
Who are you kidding?

620
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,491
你下一局游戏结束之后
还能活下来吗？
Do you think you'll still be alive
after the next game?

621
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,327
现在不出去
你们全都完蛋了 知道吗？
If you don't get out now,
you're all going to die!

622
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,246
所以到底谁会完蛋
So let's play one more game
to see who dies.

623
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,415
玩一局试试呗

624
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,460
不要那么废物 光想着逃跑
Stop trying to run away
like a goddamn coward.

625
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,172
你说什么？喂 你过来
What did you say? Hey, come here.

626
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,299
你过来 你这个王八蛋！
Come here, asshole!

627
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,925
- 妈的 什么都不是的家伙
- 过来
- Let's go.
- I'll take you down, chump!

628
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,010
- 妈的
- 别对平民这样
Not with civilians.

629
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:11,969
来啊！
Come here.

630
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,182
我是海军陆战队的 你个王八蛋！
I was in the Marines, fucking asshole!

631
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,519
你要是海军陆战队
Oh, yeah?
Then I was in the air force, fucker!

632
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,855
我就是空降部队的 王八蛋！

633
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:26,525
Hey, if you want to go home,
why would you even bother eating?

634
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,981
- 王八犊子…
- 喂！

635
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,525
既然你们想回家
还吃紫菜包饭干什么？

636
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,486
全都饿着肚子走吧 混蛋！
Just starve!

637
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,862
对啊！
That's it.

638
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:30,821
喂 有本事过来！

639
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,991
过来啊 混蛋！
- Come on, fuckers!
- You fucker!

640
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,869
我直接用可乐瓶把你脑袋削掉算了！

641
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,894
敏秀
<i>Min-su.</i>

642
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,979
哥知道你还在生哥的气
I know you're upset with me.

643
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,232
抱歉 兄弟！
I'm sorry, boy!

644
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,692
但是你怎么能那样…
But still, you shouldn't have betrayed me.
That really hurt.

645
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,529
你背叛了大哥 大哥多心痛啊

646
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,405
- 你开开门
- 喂 敏秀
- Open the door.
- Hey, Min-su.

647
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,116
反正你也被全租房骗了
You said you got scammed in a rental deal
and have no place to go anyway.

648
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,409
- 出去也没地方去
- 敏秀

649
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,869
开门！

650
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,453
Open the door!

651
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,829
就让我们再来一局吧！
Let's play one more game.

652
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:24,083
我们能对你负责
也能保护你 真的 嗯？
We'll protect you. I swear.

653
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,168
所以明天投票的时候选圆圈
So when we vote again tomorrow,
press O, all right? Come here.

654
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,461
敏秀 你过来

655
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,798
兄弟 你给我坐下
Whoa, boy. Sit the fuck down.

656
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,217
喂 敏秀
Look, Min-su.

657
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,347
我来这里之前想自杀的
都去了汉江大桥上面了
Before I came here,
I went to a bridge to kill myself.

658
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:42,476
但是在那座桥上
我见到了穿西服的那个人
But on that bridge,

659
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,728
a man in a suit came
and gave me that card.

660
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,603
收到了那张名片

661
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,022
你也收到那张名片了吧？
You got one too, didn't you?

662
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,440
是
Yes.

663
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,361
我本来没有宗教信仰 但总觉得
I don't have a religion, but it felt like…

664
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,240
这感觉像是神的启示
like divine intervention.

665
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,369
我是不是获得了一次重生的机会？
It felt like I was being given
a chance at a whole new life.

666
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:03,289
所以我真的很想努力好好活一次
So I decided to give it my best shot

667
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,790
让我妈妈自豪
and make my mom proud.

668
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,501
但因为你 我没办法做到了
But you're stopping me from doing that.

669
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,004
It makes me fucking furious!

670
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,045
你都要气死我了！

671
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,131
我他妈气死了 兄弟！
I'm so fucking angry, man!

672
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,048
你差不多行了
Knock it off.

673
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,474
喂 你别过来多管闲事 滚
Mind your own damn business and fuck off.

674
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,143
你们这是在妨碍投票
You're interfering with the vote.

675
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,021
绝技明基 你算个屁？
The amazing Myung-gi.
Who do you think you are?

676
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,024
嗯？选票管理委员会的吗？

677
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,024
The election commissioner?

678
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:30,941

MG Coin.

679
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,944

You're next,
so just take a piss and get out.

680
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,280
不要插手 尿完快滚

681
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,200
选叉的各位！
Everyone on Team X!
These guys are threatening one of us!

682
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,203
现在这几个人在威胁我们这边的人！

683
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,415
强迫他在重新投票的时候选圆圈！
They're forcing him to vote O next time!

684
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,791
真的吗？
Is that true? Hey, that's cheating.

685
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,085
喂 你们这样是犯规啊

686
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,339
哎哟 一群乳臭未干的小子
You kids are still so young.

687
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,424
做这么缺德的事情 在哪里学的？
Who taught you to do something so nasty?

688
00:43:55,758 --> 00:44:00,679
Hey! Team O!

689
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,594
哎！

690
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,721
选圆圈的各位大哥！

691
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,098
这边选叉的人攻击我们的人！
These Xs are about to attack us!

692
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,933
- 选圆圈的人！
- 什么情况 王八蛋？
What the fuck? Why would they attack us?

693
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,143
干吗攻击选圆圈的人？

694
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,354
喂 闭上你那张胡说八道的嘴吧
Shut your trap.

695
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,814
喂 选叉的胆小鬼

你嗑药了吗？
Are you high?

701
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,788
目中无人吗？
Have you lost your mind?

702
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,332
你是因为那个人吧？
It's because of her, isn't it?
We saw him with some bitch earlier.

703
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:32,169
哥 他刚才跟那个女的
气氛特别那个…

704
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,504
It looked like they were a thing,

00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,504
懂我的意思吧？

706
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,342
你这小子 来这里还把妹
You little shit. You have time
to fool around with a girl?

707
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,303
我刚才仔细看了一眼那女的
I've been watching her carefully.

708
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,766
走路姿势很奇怪 肚子…
She was walking a bit funny,
and her belly looked--

709
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,893
你们不许动她 王八蛋！
Leave her alone, you bastards!

710
