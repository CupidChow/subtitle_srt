哦 那个…
Oh, well…

61
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,665
那不是我的无人机吗？
Isn't that my drone?

62
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,294
啊？啊 这个？
What? Oh, this?

63
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,297
不是 我睡不着 在找东西
Well, I was looking for something
because I couldn't sleep,

64
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,132
偶然看到的…
and I just stumbled across it.

65
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,262
您动了这个吗？
Did you do something?

66
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,224
没有 我只是看看
No, I was just looking.

67
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,269
这东西能飞上天 感觉太神奇了
I'm fascinated by
how this thing can fly in the sky.

68
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,898
来 我都看好了
All right. I'm done now.

69
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,566
看着真神奇
It's so fascinating.

70
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,070
哎哟 一股酒味
You reek of alcohol.

71
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,738
快点回去睡觉吧 嗯？
Go get some sleep now, okay?

72
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:08,993
等一下！
Stop!

73
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,038
你是什么人？
Who are you really?

74
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:14,832
混蛋！
You son of a bitch!

75
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,016
谁在那里？
Who's there?

76
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,855
Choi, is that you?

77
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,522
崔理事

78
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,690
是我 朴船长
It's me, Captain Park.

79
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,819
船长
Captain, I thought you were asleep.
What are you doing out here?

80
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,948
雨下这么大
您不睡觉 跑来外面做什么？

81
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,948
It's pouring down.

82
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,367
睡不着觉 翻来覆去的
I couldn't sleep.
I was tossing and turning,

83
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,577
好像听到外面有什么声音
then I heard some noise.

84
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,162
我也听到了
I heard it too.

85
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,873
我好像听到有人尖叫
然后听到了咣当的声音
I think I heard someone scream
and some thuds after that.

86
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,959
所以我也跑出来查看了
That's why I came out to take a look.

87
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,797
应该是海浪拍击甲板的声音
I think it was the waves hitting the deck.

88
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,298
你看 乱七八糟的
Look at the mess.

89
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,135
啊 这样啊
Oh, you're right.

90
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,181
暴风雨来的时候
出来很危险 快进去睡吧
It's dangerous out here in the rain.
Go back inside and get some sleep.

91
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,726
我睡不着 海浪晃动太厉害了
The boat's rocking so much.
I can't really sleep.

92
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,770
那也应该稍微睡一会儿
Still, you've got to wake up early.
Try to get some sleep.

93
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,148
清晨又要开始新的一天了

94
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,317
不睡明天就受罪了
Or you'll be exhausted tomorrow.

95
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:42,211
41、42、43、44、45
41, 42, 43, 44, 45,

96
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,255
46
46,

97
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,215
47
47.

98
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,596
死了三个人
Three dead.

99
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,099
- 确定吗？
- 数了三次呢
Are you sure?

100
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,099
I counted three times.

101
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,017
他们呢？
What about them?

102
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,230
42、43、44、45
42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.

103
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,566
46、47、48

104
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,153
我们这边死了两个人
Two people died on our side.

105
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,447
死了五个人 两个人是我们这边的
Two out of five.
That means they lost three people.

106
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,657
也就是说他们那边死了三个人

107
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,035
那么
Then we have a better shot
at winning the vote tomorrow.

108
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,621
明天投票 对我们这边更有利

109
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,876
喂 48对47
Hey, it's 48 against 47.

再投票一次就赢了！
As long as we don't change our minds,
we'll win by one vote!

111
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,631
赢了！

- 妈的

You think we'll be okay?

148

真的吗？
Really?

152
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,846
我们死了 他们投票会赢
Because if they kill us, they'll be able
to win the vote and increase the prize.

153
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,391
奖金也能增多

154
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,185
那怎么办？

155
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,185
So what do we do?

156
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,646
我们先进行攻击吧
Let's attack them first.

157
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,817
那边的人
They're probably thinking
we'll just wait for the second vote.

158
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,487
会觉得我们只会等着明天重新投票

159
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,864
我们反其道行之
We can use it to our advantage.

160
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,159
熄灯之后 我们先攻击他们
We'll attack them first
once the lights go out.

161
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,662
对啊 还是我们先动手吧
That's right.
It'd be better to attack them first.

162
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,623
我们这边女士和老年人很多
We have more women
and elderly on our side.

163
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,625
对我们进行攻击 对我们很不利
If we get attacked,
we'll be at a disadvantage.

164
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,380
还不如我们先偷袭 胜算还更大一点
Attacking them first
would give us a better chance of winning.

165
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,465
- 我也赞成
- 不行
- I agree.
- We can't do that.

166
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,928
无论如何也要想办法出去啊
But we have to get out of here.

167
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,056
你不是也说嘛
You said it yourself.

168
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,892
现在开始 冷静已经没用了
Staying calm won't get us anywhere now.

169
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,396
那我们也不能互相残杀啊
That doesn't mean
we should kill each other.

170
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,191
这样就正中那些人下怀
That's exactly what they want us to do.

171
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,318
“那些人”？
"They"?

172
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,283
创造这个游戏的那些人
The ones who created this game.

173
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,745
还有监视我们玩这个游戏的那些人
The ones who watch us play.

174
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,372
如果我们要战斗
If we're going to fight someone,
it should be them.

175
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,332
应该是跟那些人战斗

176
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,630
那些人在哪里呢？
Where are they?

177
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,012
在那上面
Up there.

178
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,851
在楼上
On the upper levels

179
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,271
控制这个游戏的人和设备都在那里
are the rooms they control the games from.

180
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,691
戴黑色面具的是他们的队长
The man in the black mask is their leader.

181
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,110
抓到那个人
Once we capture him, we'll be able to win.

182
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,404
我们就能赢

183
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:05,993
要怎么战斗？
How are you going to fight them?

184
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,122
那些人有枪
They have guns.

185
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:19,673
各位武装士兵 请前往指定场所
<i>All armed soldiers,</i>
<i>please move to your designated locations.</i>

186
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,512
稍后将开始特别游戏
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

187
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,224
我们也要用枪战斗

188
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,474
We'll fight them with guns too.

189
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,018
哪里有枪？
But we don't have any.

190
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,021
抢他们的就行
We'll take their guns.

191
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,111
从面具人手里抢吗？
From those masked men?

192
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,283
太危险了
That's too dangerous.

193
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,955
就算我们能抢来几把枪
他们比我们人数多太多了
Even if we manage to take a few guns,
we'll still be outnumbered.

194
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,206
那么就在这里
What then?

195
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,042
整夜互相残杀
Are you going to kill each other all night
and hope you survive?

196
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,503
希望自己能活下来吗？

197
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,633
这真的是你希望的吗？
Is that what you want, Young-il?

198
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,889
会有…
Do we…

199
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,725
胜算吗？
stand a chance?

200
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,727
偷袭就有胜算
We do if we catch them off guard.

201
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,814
尤其是那些人
Out of everyone,

202
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,317
不会预料到我们会先进行攻击
they're the ones
who would least expect us to attack first.

203
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,319
这次
This is

204
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,699
是我们能让整个游戏都结束
our last chance
to end these games once and for all.

205
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,492
最后的机会

206
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,163
要怎么把枪抢过来？
How are you going to take their guns?

207
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,168
今天晚上
Once the fight begins tonight,

208
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,880
打起来之后

209
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,800
就会有机会
we'll have our chance.

210
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,935
距离熄灯还有五分钟
<i>Lights out in five minutes.</i>

211
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,870
萨诺斯这个傻瓜
Thanos, that fucking asshole.

212
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,665
太目中无人了 混蛋
That son of a bitch
treated me like a fucking idiot.

213
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,161
李明基
Myung-gi.

214
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,583
一会儿熄灯之后马上藏起来
When the lights go out, hide.

215
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,921
不管发生什么事情都不要出来
No matter what happens, don't do anything.

216
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,550
嗯
Okay.

217
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,179
还有 你把血擦擦吧
And wipe that blood off.

218
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,400
距离熄灯还有十秒
<i>Lights out in ten seconds.</i>

219
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,777
十、九
<i>Ten,</i>

220
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,277
<i>nine,</i>

221
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,778
八

222
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,320
<i>eight,</i>

223
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,821
七

224
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,321
<i>seven,</i>

225
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,822
六

226
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,364
<i>six,</i>

227
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,864
五

228
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,323
<i>five,</i>

229
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,824
四
<i>four,</i>

230
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,825
三

231
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,325
<i>three,</i>

232
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,826
二

233
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,326
<i>two,</i>

234
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,827
一

235
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,285
<i>one.</i>

236
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,724
熄灯之后
<i>Once the lights go out,</i>

237
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,144
静悄悄移动到床下面
<i>get under the bottom beds quietly.</i>

238
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,522
不能让那些想攻击我们的人
<i>You must not get caught</i>
<i>by those planning to attack us.</i>

239
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,734
先发现我们

240
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,710
安静！
Shut up!

241
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,005
去死吧！
Die!

242
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,049
去死吧！

243
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,718
不要！

244
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,297
走开 混蛋 滚开！

245
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,142
大家在各自的位置上等待
We have to hide until the fight ends.

246
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,936
一直到战斗结束

247
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,731
绝对不能卷入战斗
Don't get caught up in the fight.

248
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,399
这样一来
But that would put people on our side
at quite a disadvantage.

249
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,653
对我们选叉这边很不利

250
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,616
我们全都退出战斗 人数也比他们多
Without us in the fight,
they'll be outnumbered.

251
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,660
我知道
I know.

252
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,163
但如果我们卷入战斗
But if we fight with them

253
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,250
我们中如果有几个人死亡或者受伤
and some of us end up dead or injured,

254
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,252
机会就全没了
it will ruin our entire plan.

255
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,672
如果我们这边比现在人数还少
We can't beat those bastards
with a lower headcount.

256
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,341
那就没办法赢过那些人

257
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,676
所以为了大义
Are you suggesting that

258
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,346
就要承受小的牺牲吗？
we make a small sacrifice
for the greater good?

259
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,103
如果错过这次机会
If we miss this opportunity,

260
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,940
会让更多人牺牲
the sacrifice will be even greater.

261
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,486
就算现在会有牺牲…
Even if it takes a sacrifice…

262
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,283
这次也一定要让游戏结束
we must put an end to this game now.

263
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,915
那么我就
In that case,

264
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,793
按照你的意思做吧
I'm with you.

265
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,810
斗争不会持续太久
<i>The fight won't last long.</i>

266
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,355
那些人看到玩家全都死亡或者受伤
<i>Because if all of us end up hurt or dead,</i>

267
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,609
这样就没办法进行下一场游戏
这是他们不希望见到的
<i>there can't be a next game,</i>
<i>and they wouldn't want that.</i>

268
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,676
世美姐
Se-mi.

269
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,887
你个混蛋婊子
You fucking bitch.

270
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,519
妈的！
Fuck!

271
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,690
兔崽子！
You goddamn bastard!

272
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,904
贱人！
You fucking bitch!

273
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,867
喂 你说我混蛋吗？
You think you're better than me?

274
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,931
镇压！
Suppress!

275
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:06,848
准备
<i>Prepare.</i>

276
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,184
镇压
<i>Suppress.</i>

277
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,355
开灯之后 士兵会进来
<i>Once the lights come on,</i>

278
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:16,858
<i>the soldiers will come</i>
<i>to settle the situation.</i>

279
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,316
开始整顿现场

280
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,568
手举起来 退后
Hands up. Get back.

281
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,196
他们会先控制在打斗的人
<i>They'll try to break up the fight first.</i>

282
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,239
放下武器 举起手
Drop your weapon. Hands up.

283
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,491
根本不会在意死的人
<i>They won't pay attention to the dead.</i>

284
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,830
他们会确认
倒下的淘汰人员身份信息…
<i>- They will scan our trackers…</i>
- Check the IDs of the dead.

285
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,747
检查淘汰人员

286
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,332
…进行扫描
<i>…to identify us.</i>

287
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,675
我们就在这个时候伺机行动
<i>That'll be our window.</i>

288
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,762
大虎！
Dae-ho!

289
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,538
全体人员撤退 关门
Have everyone retreat and close the gate.

290
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,959
撤退
<i>Retreat.</i>

291
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,479
停止！射击停止！
Stop! Hold fire!

292
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,023
所有人停手！
Everyone, hold fire!

293
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:22,901
手放在头上！
Hands above your head!

294
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,279
跪下！
On your knees!

295
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,658
你们这些混蛋！
You goddamn bastards!

296
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,160
不行！
No!

297
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,954
让开！
Move! Do you not see this?

298
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,206
你眼里看不到这些吗？

299
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,708
那些混蛋根本不是人
They are not human.

300
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,795
他们像蛀虫一样 被钱蒙蔽了双眼！
They're like goddamn vermin
blinded by money!

301
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,342
我们把枪抢过来 不是为了杀他们的
This is not what we took these guns for.

302
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,930
我们如果也这样
就跟那些面具人没有区别了
If we do this, we'll be no different
from those masked men.

303
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,610
各位！
Everyone!

304
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,363
不用害怕
Don't be scared.

305
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,074
Gather round, please!

306
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,657
大家都过来！

307
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,576
没关系 出来吧
It's okay to come out.

308
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,287
我们无意伤害各位！
We're not trying to hurt you!

309
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,665
- 从死的面具人身上…
- 大家全都出来！
- Get the guns and ammo from the dead.
- Come on! I have something to say!

310
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,959
- …收集枪和弹仓吧
- 我有话要说！

311
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,886
所有士兵集合！
Gather all soldiers.

312
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,515
请所有士兵带上武器
<i>All soldiers, please move</i>
<i>to the assembly point with your weapons.</i>

313
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,477
前往集结地点

314
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,979
重复一遍
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

315
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,940
请所有士兵带上武器
<i>All soldiers, please move</i>
<i>to the assembly point with your weapons.</i>

316
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,359
前往集结地点

317
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,132
各位
Everyone.

318
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:11,885
现在我们
We will now

319
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,888
要去楼上的
head up to the masked men's headquarters.

320
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,474
那些面具人的大本营

321
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,519

每人拿一个对讲机
Let's take one radio each.

342
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,133
为了幸运 我们使用七号频道

343
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,391
刚才谢谢你
Thank you for earlier.

344
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,438
等出去了
You can buy me a soju when we get out.

345
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,607
你请我喝杯烧酒

346
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,577
各位注意
Attention.

347
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,748
这是MP5冲锋枪
This is the MP5, a submachine gun.

348
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,291
首先
First, if you press this lever
in the middle and pull the magazine,

349
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,919
把中间这个控制杆按下 拔出

350
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,420
就可以把弹仓分离
it comes off like this.

351
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,715
然后把这个调整杆往下压
是连续发射
If the selector switch is down,
it's set to full auto mode.

352
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,259
往上抬就是单次发射
Up is single-fire mode.

353
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,137
我们现在剩下的弹仓不多
We don't have many magazines,
so set it to single-fire mode.

354
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,806
请一定要调整到单次发射模式

355
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,767
最后 把弹仓装上
Lastly, insert the magazine,

356
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,479
把拉手往上拉 再放手 就会上膛
pull the handle, and then release it.

357
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,439
That's how you load it. Are we clear?

358
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,439
都听懂了吗？

359
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,399

- Yes.
- Yes.

360
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,446
您怎么这么了解枪？
How do you know so much about guns?

361
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,369
我以前是特种兵的中士
I was a sergeant first class
in the ROK Special Forces.

362
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,042
摘掉
Take it off.

363
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,514
这个也摘掉
Take that off too.

364
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,647
哎呀
Good God.

365
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,817
你做这种工作 你父母知道吗？
Do your parents know
what you're doing here?

366
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,409
带我们去你们队长那里
Take us to your captain.

367
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:55,043

370
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,802
将会被淘汰

371
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,387
重复一遍
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

372
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,848
各位玩家
<i>All players, it is bedtime…</i>

373
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,850
- 睡觉时间到了
- 啊 这个声音

374
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:13,144
I think I'll be hearing this voice
in my dreams. Don't you?

375
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,143
回家做梦都会听到吧？

376
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,144

- 是啊

377
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,063
…立刻回到宿舍
<i>Please return to your quarters</i>

378
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,023
不回宿舍…

379
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,360
趴下！
Get down!

380
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,372
一点方向！
One o'clock!

381
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,667
掩护我！
Cover me!

382
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,043
- 掩护！
- 掩护！

- 是

那我们走吧！
All right, then. Let's go up!

389
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,362
绝对不能让他们靠近管理区域
Do not let them get close
to the management area.

390
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,433
还要走多远？
How much farther?

391
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,980
真是这条路吗？
Is this the right way?

392
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,402
在那个尽头转弯 有管理区入口
The entrance to the management area
is around that corner.

393
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,988
那上面就是控制室
The control room is right above it.

394
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,783
快走！
Move it, then.

395
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,992
等一下
Wait.

396
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,954
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

397
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,664
想要通过 必须有面具
I need my mask to pass security.

398
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,421
我去找找管理区入口！
I'll go look for the management area!

399
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,631
能找到吗？要我跟你一起去吗？
Will you be able to find it?
Should I come?

400
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,966
我跟正倍一起去！
I'll go with Jung-bae.

401
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,885
请你在这里想办法拖延一下时间！
I need you to buy us some time!

402
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,388
正倍 走吧！
Jung-bae, let's go.

403
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,185
等我！
Wait up!

404
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:04,959
给你！
Here!

405
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,463
子弹很宝贵！
Don't waste your ammo like that!
You'll quickly run out!

406
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,631
那样用的话 坚持不了多久！

407
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,366
身份确认完毕
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

408
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,971
你为什么不跟零一来 要带我来？
Why did you have to bring me
instead of Young-il?

409
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,641
毕竟你是我朋友
Because you're my friend.

410
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,769
这小子 紧急情况就承认是朋友了
You only say that when you're in a jam.

411
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,231
我们进入管理区域了
We're in the management area.

412
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,483
我们上去看看
<i>We'll make our way up.</i>

413
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,937
正倍 这些家伙裤兜里也有弹仓
They have magazines in their pockets.

414
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,579
现在要往哪边走？
Which way should we go?

415
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,333
那些家伙来的方向
The way they came.

416
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,846
守住通往控制室的台阶！
Guard the stairs to the control room!

417
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,402
我们在这里待着不是办法
我们也上去吧！
This isn't getting us anywhere!
Let's follow them to the upper level!

418
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,658
都没有计划 全部冲上去
可能会被包围！
We might get surrounded
if we move together without a plan!

419
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,370
我们再稍微等一下
等到他们在对讲机里说
Let's wait until
they find the control room!

420
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,579
找到控制室再上去！

421
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,537
所有人确认一下弹仓！
Everyone! Check your magazines!

422
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,123
我就剩一半了！
I'm down to half.

423
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,667
我都没剩一半了
I've got less than half.

424
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,419
妈的 我也是！

425
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,377
Same!

426
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,503
我还剩三分之二
I've got two-thirds left.

427
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,213
我全都用掉了！
I'm almost out!

428
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,299
我没有了！
Mine is empty!

429
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,969
我也没多少了！
I'm almost out too!

430
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,016
零一 大虎 有人在听吗？
<i>Young-il, Dae-ho. Can you hear me?</i>

431
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,727
你说！
Go ahead!

432
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,314
从这里过去应该就是控制室了
哎呀 我们两个人不太行！
I think we're right below
the control room!

433
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,024
But we need backup and more ammo.

434
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,940
派点支援过来 再拿点弹药！

435
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,026
这边弹药也不够了！
We're running out of ammo too!

436
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,071
宿舍士兵尸体的口袋里
应该有剩的弹仓
There should be spare magazines
in the soldiers' pockets in our quarters.

437
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,281
把那些带过来就行了！
Go get them!

438
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,615
知道了！
Got it!

439
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,409
都听到了吧？
Did you hear that? They need backup!

440
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,453
上面需要支援！

441
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,040
先过去三个人 剩下的守在这里！
Three of us will go,
and the rest will stay!

442
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,584
取到弹仓 然后就加入大家！
Join us once you get the magazines!

443
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,377
谁跟我一起走？
Who wants to go with me?

444
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,379
- 我去！

so just hold on until then!

449
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,683
贤珠！
Hyun-ju!

450
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,727
我过去！
I'll go!

451
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,903
我没有子弹了
I… I'm out of ammo.

452
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,905
你认识路吗？
Do you know the way?

453
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,281
认识
Yes.

454
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,743
我们一路过来的时候
把摄像头打掉了 顺着那个走就行
We destroyed the cameras on the way.
Follow them.

455
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,161
好！
Okay.

456
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,871
你带上这个
Take this. You might run into
the masked men on the way.

457
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,082
路上有可能会遇到面具人

458
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:37,792

459
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,752

大虎！
<i>Dae-ho.</i>

464
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,999
大虎 能听到我说话吗？
弹仓拿到了吗？
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>Where are those magazines?</i>

465
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,169
能听到 大哥

466
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,546
Yes, brother. I'm on my way to get them.

467
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,546
我正在往那边走

468
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,548
好 大虎 全靠你了！

What are you going to do?

472
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,688
Get their magazines.

473
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,398
不行 太危险了！
No, that's too dangerous.

474
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,191
没有多少弹药了
I'm almost out of ammo.

475
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,277
如果被他们发现了 会直接杀过来
If they notice, they'll close in on us.

476
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,738
要坚持到大虎过来 我们需要弹仓
We need more magazines
to hold out until Dae-ho gets here.

477
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,757
奇勋 快点！

00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,238
弹仓
Magazines…

480
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,532
弹仓
Magazines…

481
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,868
裤兜里的弹仓
Magazines in pockets.

482
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:26,627
那个人干什么？
What's up with him?

483
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,879
我也不知道

484
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,171
I'm not sure.

485
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:35,886
大虎
Dae-ho, what happened?

486
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,638
怎么样了？

487
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,598
你怎么一个人回来了？
Why are you back by yourself?

488
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,183
弹仓
Magazines.

489
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,020
请帮我找到这些家伙裤兜里的弹仓！
Get the magazines
from those bastards' pockets. Hurry!

490
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,689
- 快点！
- 哦 好

491
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,314
Oh, okay.

492
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,068
没事吧？
Are you all right?

493
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,196
没事 擦伤了一点
I'm fine. It's just a graze.

494
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,241
如果你比我先死 我饶不了你
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

495
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,451
不用担心 我会比你活得久
Don't worry. I'll be sure to outlive you.

496
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:02,913
奇勋！
Gi-hun! Did you find the control room?

497
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,873
找到控制室了吗？

498
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,710
应该就在上面 但这边上不去
I think it's right up there,
but we can't go this way.

499
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,712
你们找找其他路径
I want you to find another way.

500
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,463
我上来的时候看了一眼结构
I did a quick scan of the layout here.

501
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,091
后面肯定有路过去
I'm sure there's a way to go around them.

502
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,594
你们两个在这里吸引那些人的注意
I want you guys
to keep their focus on you.

503
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,470
我从后面攻击 过去找找
We'll hit them from behind.

504
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,388
好
Okay.

505
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:20,889
等一下
Wait.

506
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,726
Here, take this.

507
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,726
带上这个

508
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,060
你用得上
You're going to need it.

509
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,521
你真的没事吗？
Are you sure?

510
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,191
大虎会带着弹仓过来
Dae-ho will be back with more.

511
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,416
全都翻出来了
This was all we could find.

512
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,419
妈的 他怎么还不来？
Damn it, what's taking him so long?

513
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,798
不会是忘记路了吧？
Do you think he got lost?

514
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,257
大虎 能听到吗？
Dae-ho, can you hear me?

515
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,219
大虎 你在哪里？能听到吗？
Where are you? Can you hear me?

516
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,347
弹仓怎么样了？拿到过来了吗？
<i>Did you find the magazines?</i>
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

517
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,517
大虎 请回答！
<i>Dae-ho, answer me.</i>

518
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,105
大虎！
<i>Dae-ho, are you there?</i>

519
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,523
你在吗？

520
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,944
大虎 拜托你回答！
<i>Dae-ho, please answer me!</i>

521
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,323
- 大虎 回答！
- 坚持不住了
Dae-ho! Answer me!

522
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,617
We can't hold out much longer.
We need those magazines now.

523
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,617
我们现在就需要弹仓

524
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,202
应该是发生什么事情了
Something must've happened.
I'll go down and check.

525
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,203
我过去看看！

526
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:07,913

Please do.

527
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,290
掩护我！
Cover me!

528
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,197
奇勋 找到了
Gi-hun, we found it.

529
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,992
你先攻击他们 引起注意
<i>Start attacking and draw their attention.</i>

530
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,618
然后我们从后面攻击
Then we'll hit them from behind.

531
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,370
好 知道了！
Okay, got it!

532
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,771

已经发动攻击了吗？
<i>Young-il, what's going on?</i>
<i>Are you attacking?</i>

533
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,323
奇勋 对不起
Gi-hun, I'm sorry.

534
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,742
完蛋了
<i>It's all over.</i>

535
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,495
我们也中枪了
<i>They got us too.</i>

536
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,207
零一 发生什么事了？
Young-il, what happened?
Are you all right?

537
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,667

对不起
I'm sorry.

不要！
No.

559
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,153
不能这样送死
You can't die like this.

560
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,875
面具人正在过来！
They're moving!

561
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,504

先遣队 能听到吗？
<i>Advance team, do you copy?</i>

577
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,196
没有弹药了
<i>We're out of ammo.</i>

578
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,157

看好了
Look closely

586
