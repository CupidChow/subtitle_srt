你哥哥的事 我很遗憾
但你应该忘了这件事
I'm sorry about your brother.
But you should forget about it.

94

Can you forget?

95

死在那个岛上的那些人？
The people who died on that island?

96
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,731
我在那里看到了你没看到的东西
I saw things that you didn't.

97
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,150
你想做的事情…
I can help you…

98
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,987

with what you're trying to do.

99
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,831
不能再重新考虑一下吗？
Please reconsider, Mr. Seong.

100
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,876
我年轻的时候
有一次被骗了 钱都被骗走了
I once got scammed and lost all my money.

101
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,379
我太生气了
去找到那个家伙 打了他几下
I was furious,
so I roughed him up a little.

102
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,172
也没有很严重 就稍微打了几下
It wasn't even that bad,

103
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,717
但警察只把我抓走了
还叫我跟他和解
but the cops only arrested me
and told me to settle with him.

104
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,219
我哪有钱用来和解呢 嗯？
But with what money?

105
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,680
那个混蛋把我的钱全部拿走了
That asshole took everything.

106
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,684
真正荒唐的是 我一个人进了监狱
那个混蛋没有受到任何惩罚
You know what's crazy?
I went to prison, and he got away with it.

107
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,811
从那以后 我就再也不相信警察了…
Since then, I've never trusted cops…

108
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,400
钱？
The money…

109
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,901
成社长
Mr. Seong.

110
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,821
您真的赢了那个游戏吗？
So it's true that you won the game?

111
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,249
这些是游戏里所有死去的人的买命钱
It's blood money
for all those people who died there.

112
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,130
我要用这笔钱跟那些混蛋对抗
I'm going to use it
to fight those bastards.

113
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,094
如果你们愿意帮我
想要多少报偿都可以
If you help me,
I'll give you as much as you want.

114
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,805
我做这件事不是为了钱
I'm not doing this for money.

115
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,391
我也一样
Me neither.

116
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,061
那个混蛋就在我眼前杀了我大哥
That bastard killed my boss
right in front of me.

117
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,481
我大哥主持了我的婚礼
跟亲哥没什么区别
He was like a brother to me.
He even officiated my wedding.

118
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,319
我要把那个混蛋上头的人
全都找到、绑起来
I'm going to find the fat cats,
tie them up,

119
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,779
玩石头剪刀布 全都开枪打死
make them play Rock, Paper, Scissors
and shoot them dead.

120
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,866
那个岛上有武装部队
They have armed forces on that island.

121
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,077
不是几把这样的手枪就能打得过的
We can't fight them with a few pistols.

122
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,542
这些是我这几年收集到的
These are what I've collected so far.

123
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,215
这些都是真枪吗？
您从哪里弄来这么多…
Are they real?
Where did you get all these?

124
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:38,220
看来我们成社长早就有计划啊！
Man, Mr. Seong. So you've got a plan!

125
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,973
请帮我召集一起共事的人手
I want you to gather people
we can join forces with.

126
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,892
好 请放心
Sure, don't worry.

127
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,645
我在这方面认识一些得力帮手
I know some men
who are good at that stuff.

128
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,564
这些是K2吧？
These are K2s, aren't they?

129
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,400
哎呀 我当兵的时候用过
之后就再没见过了
I haven't seen one
since I was in the military.

130
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,029
跟黑市弄来的一样
I'm guessing they're black market.

131
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,531
真的能用吗？
Do they even work?

132
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,354
有空就请过来练习
Come and practice whenever you can.

133
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,564
还有
Also,

134
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,860
您最好能辞掉现在的工作
I suggest that you quit your current job.

135
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,044
天啊 好热 把空调开大一点！
God, it's hot. Turn up the AC!

136
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,423
天啊 这里是什么空调啊
怎么还没有外面的风凉快？
Man, why is the AC here so weak? Damn it.

137
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,591
怎么不凉快呢？

138
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,012
- 快把空调修修吧
- 天气怎么这个样子 真是的

- I'm in.
- A new place opened nearby.

142
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,982
- 我累死了
- 太累了
- I'm exhausted.
- That was rough.

143

兔兔 这是给你的
Bunny, this is for you.

144
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,982
兔兔 这里痛吗？
Bunny, does it hurt here?

145
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,445
啊 太热了 这种事根本做不来
It's too hot for this, man.

146
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,826
戴着这个该死的猪头
都没办法呼吸 只有我这样吗？
I can't breathe in this fucking pig head.
Is it just me?

147
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,462
娜妍！

150
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,179
娜妍 爸爸告诉过你
千万不要到处乱跑的
Na-yeon.
I told you not to go into random places.

151
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,224

Daddy!

152
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,645
别哭了 非常抱歉
Don't cry. I'm sorry, guys.

153
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,648
没事了 爸爸来了
You're okay. Daddy is here.

154
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,323
她是怎么从医院跑出来的？
When did she get out of the hospital?

155
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,576
那是谁啊？
Who is she?

156
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,956
公园里不是有
给游客画画像的画家吗？
You know the artists
who draw people's portraits in the park?

157
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,042
刚才那个男的
就是那个画家 那个是他女儿
That guy is one of them,
and she's his daughter.

158
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,211
她病了吗？
Is she sick?

159
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,882
我听说她得了血癌
Well, I hear she has blood cancer.

160
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,426
需要进行骨髓移植
Apparently, she needs
a bone marrow transplant,

161
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,553
应该不容易吧
but it's not easy to get one.

- 你吃晚饭了吗？
- 吃了
- Have you had dinner?
- Yes.

167
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,582
我和朋友们吃了汉堡
I had a burger with my friends.

168
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,211
那个能吃饱吗？奶奶蒸了红薯
That's not enough.
I steamed some sweet potatoes.

169
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,422
红薯？但我吃饱了
Sweet potatoes? But I'm full.

确认最近才被释放
She was recently released from
a prison camp in North Hamgyong Province.

173
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,397
她身体状况怎么样？
How is she doing?

174
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,233
她的收容所里肺结核爆发了
There was a tuberculosis outbreak
in her prison,

175
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,527
没有好好接受治疗
but she never received proper treatment.

176
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,238
现阶段行动都有点困难
She won't be able to move for a while.

177
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,200
请帮我想办法尽快把她送过来
Please just get her here
as soon as possible.

178
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:56,288
我在中国和朝鲜
都安排了最好的专家交涉
I've got the best experts ready
in China and North Korea.

179
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,334
等她身体状况好一点
我们会立刻带她过来
As soon as she recovers,
we'll get her moving.

180
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,504
如果需要更多的钱 我可以再给
I can give you more money
if that's what you need.

181
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,172
不用了
No.

182
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,299
您给我的钱已经够多了
You've already given me enough money.

183
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,265
毕竟是我欠姜晓的
After last time, I owe it to Sae-byeok.

184
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,687
这一次我一定会想办法做到
I'm going to make this happen.

please contact this number.

好 我知道了
All right, I will.

191
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,025
我去 你又来了
Oh, for God's sake. You again?

192
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,740
你为什么一定要来缠着我？
拜托你去找别的代理人吧
Why do you keep bothering me like this?
I told you to find another broker.

193
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:17,036
其他人都说她死了
Everyone else says she's dead.

194
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,580
那就是死了呗
Then she must be dead.

195
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,708
你觉得我能有办法让人起死回生吗？
Do you think I can magically
bring people back to life?

196
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,461
您不是说还有可能活着吗？
You said she might be alive.

197
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,713
不是 我的意思是
No, what I meant was

198
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,967
没有人亲眼目睹她的死亡
也没找到她的尸体
no one has actually witnessed her death
or found her body.

199
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,720
不是说她还活着的意思
I wasn't saying that she's alive.

200
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,847
也没有人见过她活着啊
No one has seen her alive either.

201
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,187
请您再最后找她一次
Please look for her one last time.

202
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,856
今天怎么这么多人都要给我钱？
Why is everyone offering me money?

203
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,651
所以才说人要善良地活着才对吗？
I knew being kind has its rewards.

204
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,904
真的拜托您了
Please give it another try.

205
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,198
如果不够我会再给您加钱
If this isn't enough,
I'll bring you more money.

206
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,038
如果是为了钱 我早就做了
If this was about money,
I would've asked for it a long time ago.

207
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:05,709
霞 你也知道 这段时间
我费了多大力气找她
No-eul, you know
how hard I've tried to find her.

208
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,963
我自己家也有孩子
能理解你的懊悔 我在加倍卖力找了
I felt bad for you
because I'm a father myself.

209
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,465
- I really did my best.
- I hear you.

210
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,465
所以说

211
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,760
拜托再帮我找一次
Please, one last time.

212
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,472
但我跟你说实话
Let me be honest with you.

213
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,058
一个没有父母的一岁孩子
How do you expect a one-year-old

214
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,144
自己一个人怎么在朝鲜生存下来？
to survive in North Korea
without her parents?

215
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,481
而且孩子妈妈对着上级开枪
Besides, her mother shot her superior

216
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,192
自己一个人跑到南边来 反动分子…
and defected
to South Korea like a traitor…

217
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,368
不是 那又不是你的错
I'm not saying it was your fault, No-eul.

218
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,038
只是事情就是这样啊
That's just what happened.

219
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,838
我知道告诉一个母亲
忘掉自己的孩子是有点过分
I know it's harsh to tell a mother
to forget about her child,

220
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,133
但你也要忘掉
but you really should.

221
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,177
除了忘掉 也没什么办法了
There's nothing else you can do.

222
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,428
不好意思 我马上把车开走
I'm sorry. I'll move my car right away.

Ms. Kang No-eul.

224
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,509
喂 妈妈
Hi, Mother.

225
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,471
你在哪里？你到了吗？
<i>Where are you? Are you there yet?</i>

226
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,973
已经到门口了
I'm walking up there now.

227
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:30,062
俊昊 好好观察一下 你哥有没有去过
<i>Jun-ho. Take a look and see</i>
<i>if your brother has visited.</i>

228
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:36,944
毕竟是妻子的忌日
如果他还活着 应该会留下鲜花
<i>If he's alive, he would've left flowers</i>
<i>on the anniversary of his wife's death.</i>

229
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,383
没去过吗？
Did he come by?

230
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:00,842
没有
No.

231
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,473
你哥哥现在
I suppose your brother

232
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,770
不再希望我们出现在他的生活中了吧
doesn't want us in his life anymore.

233
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,109
我们已经好几年没有他的消息了
We haven't heard from him in years now.

234
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,945
你哥应该到现在
It's probably because

235
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,615
心里还是很怨恨我吧
he still resents me deep down.

236
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,454
我们当时也很挣扎 哥也知道
We were also struggling back then,
and he knows that.

237
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,291
因为我不是他亲妈妈
I just don't want him to think

238
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,837
我更偏爱你 他应该对我有怨恨
that I favored you over him
because he's my stepson.

239
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,424
我最害怕会这样
That's what I'm afraid of.

240
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,301
拜托您不要有这样的想法
Please stop thinking that.

241
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,512
哥也知道 不是这样的
He knows that's not true.

242
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,682
你哥哥
Your brother…

243
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,603
给你捐了一个肾 救了你的命
He saved your life
by giving you one of his kidneys.

244
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:59,026
你嫂子生病受苦的时候
But when his wife got sick,

245
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,571
我什么都没能帮上
I couldn't do anything for her.

246
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,200
如果有可能…
If I could have…

247
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:16,126
我愿意卖掉我的器官来帮助她
真的会尽我所能帮她
I would've sold my organs to help her.

248
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,920
那还不如怨恨我好了
If that were the issue,
he'd resent me instead.

249
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,133
如果不是他把肾给了我
If he hadn't given me his kidney,

250
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,219
他就可以卖掉那个肾
用那笔钱给嫂子看病了
he could've sold it
and gotten her the treatment she needed.

251
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,765
还不如当初让我死了
If I had just died--

252
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,058
在妈面前别说这种话
Don't say such a thing.

253
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,809
您在我面前也一样！
Neither should you!

254
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,228
别再说这些了！
Stop saying these things!

255
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,775
嫂子得了那个病 是她的命
Fate gave her that disease,

256
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,695
哥收受贿赂也是他自己决定的
and it was In-ho's own decision
to take bribes.

257
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,200
哥变成这样
不是我的错 也不是妈妈的错！
You and I are not responsible
for what happened to him!

258
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,205
只是为自己的所作所为付出了代价
He simply paid for what he had done.

259
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,375
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

Still, you can't quit so suddenly.

263

I'm sorry.

265
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,637

No-eul, how did you work in this thing?

266
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,599
可恶 这东西比那个猪头更不透气
Damn, it's even worse
than the stupid pig head.

267
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,311

Sir, this must be why No-eul is quitting.

268
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,897
在室外看到我们穿这些衣服
只有孩子们会觉得开心
Kids might be happy
seeing us in these things,

269
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,650
一点都不考虑服装里面的大人
but it totally sucks
for the adults wearing them.

270
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,901
对吧 霞？
Isn't that right, No-eul?

271
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:09,573
我们今晚要聚餐
最后跟大家道个别 嗯？
We're having dinner together tonight.
You should come and say goodbye.

272
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,783
对 一起吃顿饭吧
That's right.
You should join us for dinner.

273
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,454
再喝杯烧酒 嗯？
直接这样走 太遗憾了
And have a drink.
Everyone will be sad if you don't.

274
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,913
这段时间感谢您的照顾
Thank you for everything.

275
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,174

Man, she's cold.
Right up until her last day.

一次都没有好好说过话
but we've never even had
a real conversation.

278
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:37,726
就是啊 真不知道她这个性格
这两年怎么做的这份工作
I know. I don't know how she worked
this job with that kind of personality.

279

Here.

280
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,381
- 怎么回事？
- 她自己突然晕倒了
- What happened?
- I found her unconscious.

Are you with her?

对 我是她爸爸
Yes, I'm her father.

那个药现在还不能用保险报销

by insurance at this point.

294

医生 我一定会想办法筹到钱的

302
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,191
如您所见
As you can see,

303
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,861

who'd go through hell or high water

304

it could ruin everything.

310
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,502

您的哥哥在那个岛上 您面孔已暴露
说不定会被那些家伙先看出端倪
Your face was exposed on the island.
They might recognize you.

319
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,693
明天我给你们发出信号之前
千万不能提前擅自行动
Don't make a move
until I give you the signal.

I'm getting a bad feeling.
This may be some kind of ruse.

352
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,818
那些人被称为负责人
That guy they call the Front Man.

353
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,365
你说他们穿灰色帽衫
戴黑色面具 是吧？

and a black mask, right?

354
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,574
对
Yes.

355
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,246
啊 那家伙就是为了遮住脸
才选的今天吧
Oh, that must be why he chose today.
To cover his face.

356
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,375
这家伙动了脑子的
That bastard is trying to be clever. Damn.

357
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,632
- 进去
- 是
- Let's go.

I'll take this. How much?

360
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,538
我们已经进来了！

366
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,008
全都遮着脸
根本分辨不出来谁是谁！
Everyone is wearing masks,
and I can't tell who's who!

367
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,011
总之 如果有什么情况发生
我立刻联系你
Anyway, I'll let you know
if something happens.

368
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,053

正在进入俱乐部

面具人？这里全都是面具人啊！
The masked men?
Hey, everyone here is wearing a mask!

371
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,641
在小岛上穿粉色衣服的那群家伙！
The men in pink jumpsuits from the island!

372
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,436
真的吗？
Really?

373
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,658
大叔 你认识我吗？
What? Do I know you?

374
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,452
搞什么？妈的 晦气
What the fuck?

375
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,375
哎 不能插队 请去外面排队
Hey, no cutting.
Go to the back of the line.

376

我是警察 让开
Police. Move.

377
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,547
在这里警察都得排队 没看到吗？
See your fellow officers waiting in line?

378
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,593
今天是万圣节
穿着警察制服再过来呀
It's Halloween.
Go put on your uniform first.

379
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,680
你觉得这个是开玩笑的吗？
Does this look like a toy?

380
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,895
没看到粉色！
I don't see any pink jumpsuits!

381
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,370
嗯？
What?

382
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,543
找到一个！
刚刚跟成社长接头了 正在移动！
I just spotted one!
He's taking Mr. Seong somewhere!

383
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,877
我跟过去看看！
I'll follow them!

384
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,296
- 还有一个面具人
- 你说什么？
- <i>There were two of them.</i>

385
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,006

崔理事！
Mr. Choi!

388
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,001
崔理事！
Mr. Choi!

389

他们正在往俱乐部外面走

<i>Player 456.</i>

396
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,607
还记得吗？
<i>Do you remember?</i>

397
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,443
我们在这辆车里说过话的
<i>We once spoke in this car.</i>

398
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,530
当时是这辆车吗？
Was it this car?

399
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,285
这辆车比想象中要酷炫
It's nicer than I remember.

400
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,788
我真心希望你能过得好
<i>I sincerely hoped you'd have a good life.</i>

401
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:33,125
希望你能忘记过去的一切 幸福生活
<i>I hoped you'd forget everything</i>
<i>that happened and be happy.</i>

402
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,753
这么关心我的人生
I didn't know you cared so much about me.

403
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,675
我都快感动哭了
I'm almost moved to tears.

404
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,302
你应该上那架飞机的
<i>You should have gotten on that plane.</i>

405
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,555
那是你最好的选择
<i>That's the best choice</i>
<i>you could have made.</i>

406
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,724
你当时对我说过的话
I have never forgotten…

407
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,770
我从未忘记
what you said to me then.

408
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:58,025
所以我一定要再见你一次
That's why I wanted
to see you again so badly.

409
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,862
现在这样见了 想说什么就说吧
<i>Now that we're here,</i>
<i>say what you want to say.</i>

410
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,156
你想从我这里得到什么？
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

411
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,038
停止游戏
Stop the game.

412
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,963
游戏？
<i>The game?</i>

413
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,673
你们一直在举办的
The game you've been playing.

414
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,302
现在依然在举办的那个游戏
The game
that's still going on to this day.

415
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,304
我们只是创造了游戏
<i>All we did was create it.</i>

416
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,015
参加游戏都是你们自愿选择的
<i>All of you participated by choice.</i>

417
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,891
少跟我说那些废话
Don't give me that shit.

418
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,854
你们这些人利用陷入绝境的人的心理
You manipulate people
who feel like they're at a dead end.

419
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,441
把他们逼死 以此为乐
You drive them to their deaths
and enjoy it.

420
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,486
如果你们非要把这种情况美化成选择
You think if you just call it
their own choice,

421
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:47,908
那你们做的肮脏事
难道也变成做慈善了不成？
your filthy game will become
some sort of charity event?

422
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,412
反正他们是在游戏里输的人
<i>They were all just losers of the game.</i>

423
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,081
在竞争中淘汰出局的垃圾
<i>Trash eliminated from the competition.</i>

424
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:59,170
现在这个世界上
每天都有成千上万垃圾出现
<i>A ton of new trash is being poured</i>
<i>into the world as we speak.</i>

425
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,756
你到现在都没看出来吗？
<i>You still don't see, do you?</i>

426
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,052
这个世界不会改变 游戏也不会结束
<i>The game will not end</i>
<i>unless the world changes.</i>

427
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,012
你们确定能看到豪华轿车吗？
<i>Do you have the limo in sight?</i>

428
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,513
是 能看到
Yes, we see it.

429
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,850
正在西江大桥上
前往汝矣岛方向 要怎么做？
It's on Seogang Bridge,
headed toward Yeouido. What now?

430
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,978
再稍微等一会儿 去人少的地方抓人
Don't do anything yet.
It has to be somewhere less crowded.

431
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:16,937
知道了
<i>Understood.</i>

432
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,447
“反正世界就是这样的
闭上嘴过你的日子”
"That's just how the world is,
so just shut up and accept it"?

433
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,077
是你们这些人编造的故事
That's a story created by people like you.

434
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,748
把人当成赛马场的马
You think people are just
horses in a race,

435
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,709
自以为你们是马的主人
and you own the horses.

436
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,255
你的口才进步了不少
<i>Your way with words has improved.</i>

437
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,386
所以你是想要说服马的主人吗？
<i>So? Is your plan to convince</i>
<i>the owners of the horses?</i>

438
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,846
拜托主人叫停比赛？
<i>To stop the race?</i>

439
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,724
我们正在追赶
We're on it now.

440
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,893
但豪华轿车的行踪似乎很奇怪
But the limo's movements seem suspicious.

441
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,103
哪里奇怪？
<i>How so?</i>

442
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,313
一直在汝矣岛里面转圈
<i>It's circling the Yeouido area.</i>

443
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,525
对方有可能已经发现我们了
立刻截停豪华轿车！
<i>They might have caught on already.</i>
<i>Stop the limo now!</i>

444
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,985
知道了 作战开始
<i>Roger. Initiating the plan.</i>

445
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,452
搞什么 见鬼！
Shit!

446
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,788
什么鬼？
What the hell?

447
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,039
怎么回事？
What's going on?

448
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,416
一个轮胎爆了
One of the tires blew out.

449
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,709
现在开始二号车追赶
Shit. Team Two will follow them.

450
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,337
- 好 倒车！
- 快点！
<i>- Okay. Back the car up now!</i>
<i>- Back up.</i>

451
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,510
有狙击手 趴下！
There's a sniper. Get down!

452
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:34,723
一号车、二号车都受到攻击了
没办法再继续作战了
<i>Both teams are under attack.</i>
<i>We have to abort the operation.</i>

453
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:38,519
还是说你们想绑架我？
<i>Or were you going to kidnap me?</i>

454
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,896
我在跟着
I'll follow them.

455
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,240
我也受到攻击了
They got me.

456
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,616
没办法再追了
<i>I'm losing them.</i>

457
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,411
停车
Stop the car.

458
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,170
用你那一把手枪 能让游戏停止吗？
<i>Do you think you can stop the game</i>
<i>with a pistol?</i>

459
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,899
让我参加游戏
Put me in the game.

460
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,984
你说要参加游戏吗？
<i>You want to be in the game?</i>

461
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,821
让我重新参加游戏
Put me back in the game.

462
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,617
你刚刚不是还说要让游戏停止吗？
<i>Weren't you telling me</i>
<i>to stop the game just a second ago?</i>

463
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,411
如果能让我再参加游戏
If I'm back in the game,

464
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,831
你服务的那些有钱人
those fat cats you serve

465
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,876
一定会觉得更有趣
will find it fun for sure.

466
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,046
所以
So,

467
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,090
带我去游戏场
<i>take me to the games.</i>

468
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,597
你在犹豫什么？
What are you hesitating for?

469
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,475
你是害怕了吗？
Are you scared?

470
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,604
你害怕也像吴一男那样 输给我吗？
That you might lose to me
like Oh Il-nam did?

471
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,859
吴一男直到死的那一刻都不想承认
Oh Il-nam didn't want to admit it
until the moment he died.

472
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,863
他明知道有人来
帮助那个无家可归的人了
He knew someone had come
to help that homeless man,

473
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,782
但他都没有看窗外
but he refused to look out the window.

474
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,450
但是
But

475
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:22,831
他停止呼吸的那一瞬间 分明知道了
when he stopped breathing,
I'm sure he knew

476
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,585
他输了的事实
that he had lost.

477
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,922
你看过《黑客帝国》这部电影吗？
<i>Have you seen </i>The Matrix<i>?</i>

478
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,717
本来吃了蓝色药丸
安生过日子就好了
<i>They could've lived in peace</i>
<i>if they took the blue pill.</i>

479
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:38,055
但他们非要吃红色药丸 扮演英雄
<i>But they still chose the red pill</i>
<i>to play the heroes.</i>

480
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:42,601
你也觉得自己是能改变这个世界的
<i>Do you also think you're a hero</i>

481
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,603
英雄吗？
<i>who can change the world?</i>

482
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,780
我会让你看到
I'll show you

483
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,158
这个世界
that the world…

484
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,997
不是只按照你们想要的方式
doesn't always go

485
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,166
运转的
the way you want it to.

486
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,755
既然你想这样做 那就请便吧
<i>If that's what you want, have it your way.</i>

487
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,510
456号
Player 456.

488
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,097
欢迎回到游戏
Welcome back to the game.

489
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,520
现在开始执行备用计划
We will now initiate plan B.

490
