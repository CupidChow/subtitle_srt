枪林弹雨中玩过抓石子
You said you played <i>Gong-gi</i>

When I played baseball,
my pitches might've been slow,

123
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,592

往后扔也是个方法
Throwing it backwards, now that's a skill.

Hang on.

161
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,427
Let me do this.

00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,929
- 怎么了？
- 来 一、二…

163
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,472
哎呀 怎么这个样子？真是的
What the hell is the problem?

164
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,391
慢点来 嗯？冷静一点

168
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,740
- 来 现在时间…
- 为什么会这样 真是的！
- We still have time--
- What the hell is wrong with me?

169
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,997
喂 你这个窝囊废！窝囊废！
You goddamn idiot! You're an idiot!

170
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,792
没有人怪你！
No one is blaming you!

171
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,420
来 深呼吸 继续 嗯？
All right. Take a deep breath, okay?

172
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,633
想想小时候玩的那种感觉
Try to remember the times
when you had fun playing this.

173
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,926
好 深呼吸
Now, deep breaths.

174
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,431
深呼吸 来 冷静一点
Deep breaths. Calm down.

175
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,267
来 没关系
It's okay.

176
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,021
慢慢来 嗯？冷静
Take your time, okay? Stay calm.

All right.

178
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,202
成功

179
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,663
来 快走 开始！
Let's go! Ready, go!

180
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,831
一、二…

181
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,166
你怎么样？
How are you holding up?

182
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,129
没事吧？
Are you okay?

183
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,053
知道了 让开吧

184
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,553
Okay, move.

00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,706
快走！
We're almost there!

191
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,666
一、二…

192
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,257
- 成功了！
- 辛苦了！
- We did it!
- Well done!

193
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,099
宣布淘汰人员
<i>The following players</i>

195
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:05,149
263号、415号…
<i>263, 415…</i>

196
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,906
啊 妈的 太多人活下来了
Fuck, way too many are still alive.

197
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,411
喂
Hey.

198
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,290
你觉得有多少？
How many do you think are left?

199
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,583
啊？
Sorry?

200
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:27,838
现在这里面 你觉得像小强一样
杀不死的家伙能有多少？
How many roaches
do you think we have left in here?

201
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,387
能有两百人
About 200.

202
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,973
你怎么知道的？你是人工智能吗？
How do you know?

203
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,265
What are you, an AI bot?

204
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,225
你去数一数
Go count them.

205
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,894
现在吗？
Now?

206
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,563
- 啊 好
- 嗯
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

207
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,318
为什么要数那个？好傻
Why do you want to count them?
Are you stupid?

208
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,905
反正再等一会儿
面具人就过来告诉我们了
The masked men will come and tell us soon.

209
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,406
闭嘴吧你 晦气女
Shut up, bitch.

210
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,324
别说了
Stop it.

211
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,787
- 你叫什么来着？
- 我叫敏秀
- What's your name again?
- It's Min-su.

212
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,080
你多大？
How old are you?

213
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,207
我27岁
I'm 27.

214
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,711
那就是1997年生人
喂 那你为什么跟他用敬语？
So you were born in 1997.

215
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,711
Why do you treat him like he's your boss?

216
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,004
你们两个同岁
He's the same age as you.

217
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,173
喂 南秀 你是1997年生吧？
- Nam-su, isn't that right?
- It's Nam-gyu.

218
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,759
- 南奎
- 对 南奎 你是97年的

219
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,052
- Yes, Nam-gyu. Isn't that right?
- Yes.

220
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,179
- 对
- 既然同岁 就不用敬语了

221
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,179
You're the same age.
Treat him like a friend.

222
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,057
这样才能更好合作 好吗？
We'll work better as a team that way.
Okay?

223
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:21,975
你多大？
How old are you?

224
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,060
我1998年生
Born in 1998.

225
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,771
- 你呢？
- 1996
You?

226
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,188
Born in 1996.

227
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,066
那就排序好了
It's settled.

228
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,276
景秀最小
Gyeong-su is the youngest,
you're the same age, and you're older.

229
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,654
你们两个同岁 你是姐姐

230
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,948
喂 南秀
Hey, call her <i>noona </i>since she's older.

231
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:37,866
叫声“姐姐”听听

232
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,161
叫啊
Do it.

233
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,748
姐姐
<i>Unnie</i>.

234
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,544
我可以问你一件事吗？
Can I ask you something?

235
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,421
可以
Yes.

236
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,884
你是怎么知道的？翻过去会打得更好
How did you know it'd be easier
to flip the <i>ddakji </i>with the other side?

237
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,598
小时候
I used to play <i>Ddakji</i>
with my friends when I was a kid.

238
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,269
经常跟同一个小区的孩子玩打画片

239
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,062
那个
And that was my secret trick.

240
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,773
算是我的秘密法宝

241
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,984
I see.

242
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,821
那个…我也可以问你一个问题吗？
Listen, can I ask you something too?

243
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,738
可以
Yes.

244
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,116
刚才踢毽子的时候
When you were playing <i>Jegi</i>,
how come you didn't want us to look?

245
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,994
为什么不让大家看啊？

246
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,829
Oh.

247
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,583
因为我有点…
Well, I…

248
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,378
Are you shy?

249
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,378
性格有点内向 是吧？

250
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,505
不是那样的 是…
It's not that.

251
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,800
我现在还没完呢
I'm just not completely done.

252
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,303
什么还没完呢？
What do you mean?

253
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,764
妈 你别问了 打听别人的事干什么？
Mom, stop asking questions.
You're being nosy.

254
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,600
没关系的
It's all right.

255
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,853
我还要继续接受手术才行
I still have some procedures left.

256
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:49,980
所以
I just didn't want people to stare at me.

257
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,025
很多人看着我就有点…

258
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,318
什么手术？
What procedures?

259
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,700
Oh, so that's how
you got yourself those too?

260
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,491
啊 是那个 做手术变性的

261
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,828
怪不得感觉那么大…
Of course. I knew they were too big--

262
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,246
行了 妈 真是的！
Mom, please!

263
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,915
抱歉 不好意思
I'm so sorry.

264
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:11,877
怎么回事？
What? We have more survivors?

265
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,629
还有人通过？

266
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,590
是那个疯子的队伍
It's that nutjob's team.

267
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,970
妈的 这样奖金又要少多少啊？
Goddamnit. There's going to be a big drop
in the prize money they add.

268
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,474
- 哎哟 那个小姐活下来了
- 谁？
- That young lady made it.
- Who?

269
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,643
那个小个子姑娘
The tiny young lady.

270
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,353
感觉大家不是很欢迎我们啊
They don't seem so happy to see us.

271
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,400
That sweet old lady.

272
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,108
还是这位老人家有人情味

273
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,319
我都想妈妈了
I miss my mom.

274
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,792
今日工作已结束
<i>The day's work has been completed.</i>

275
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,505
请各位士兵自行前往宿舍休息
<i>All soldiers,</i>
<i>please proceed to your quarters.</i>

276
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,246
我以为你完全是个疯女人呢
I thought you'd be a total freak,
but you actually have a decent face.

277
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,082
比想象中要漂亮嘛

278
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,917
所以都说“韩男朝女”嘛
North Korean girls are pretty.

279
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,169
你们干什么？这样违反规定
What the hell is this?
You're breaking the rules.

280
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,088
说什么规定呢
Rules, my ass.

281
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,674
就算帮不上忙 也不要妨碍啊
You should've steered clear
if you weren't going to help.

282
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,259
我要往上报告
I'm going to report this.

283
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,389
给谁报告 部队长？
To whom? The officer?

284
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,434
你觉得部队长能帮你多久 嗯？
How long do you think he'll protect you?

285
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,686
你的铁饭碗丢了
He's already cut you loose.

286
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,442
要我给你详细说明一下吗？
Do you want me
to explain it to you in detail?

287
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,359
嗯？

288
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,737
你现在是什么处境？
The situation you're in right now?

289
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,753
妈的！

290
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,212
Fuck. You damn commie.

291
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,129
你这个共产娘们儿 妈的

292
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,510
我把你的脸毁掉 怎么样？还是…
Shall I ruin your face?

293
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,600
我把你的手指全剁了？
以后你就不能扣动扳机了
Or shall I cut your fingers off
so you can't pull the trigger anymore?

294
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,356
这是最后警告
Last warning.

295
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,317
再妨碍一次我们的事情
If you get in our way again,

296
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,571
到时候我把你的手指全剁了
送进火化炉烧了
I will cut off all your fingers
and throw them in the incinerator.

297
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,740
再跟你好好玩 嗯？
And play with you a little too.

298
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,846
哎呀 对不起各位 刚才因为我…
I'm sorry about earlier, everyone.

299
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,890
No, it's okay.

300
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:12,849
没事
Don't be.

301
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:17,020
刚才踢毽子的时候 如果不是你
最后一个就踢不到了
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have made the last kick.

302
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,359
222号 身体还好吧？
Player 222, are you feeling all right?

303
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,027
是
Yes.

304
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,740
谢谢你们 大家都这么照顾我
Thank you all
for letting me be on your team.

305
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,244
222号打画片 第一次
She smashed that <i>ddakji</i>
and flipped it on her first try.

306
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,121
就直接翻过来了 太帅气了

307
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,080
That was impressive.

308
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,290
怀着孩子还那么擅长蹦蹦跳跳
She did great, even while carrying a baby.

309
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,459
我就觉得她是我们队的福星
We were lucky she joined our team.

310
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,879
啊 大哥 打碑石

311
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,879
What about your Flying Stone play?

312
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,881
怎么会一次就直接打中
You hit it with one shot.

313
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,592
手从下面打 一下就中！
With an underhand pitch at that. Bam!

314
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,138
我以为是国际棒球选手金炳贤呢
You were like Kim Byung-hyun.

315
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,558
你不愧是小时候就开始玩抓石子
And you? Was <i>Gong-gi</i>
the only game you ever played?

316
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,979
都看不到你的手影
我以为是什么武侠电影呢
I could barely see your hand.
It was like a martial arts movie.

317
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,063
啊 是吗？

318
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,731
I'm the only son for two generations.

319
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,731
我是两代单传独生子

320
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,484
我妈只让我在家里跟姐姐们玩
My mom only let me play at home
with my sisters.

321
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:08,029
And yet they let their precious son
join the Marines?

322
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,029
两代单传独生子还送去海军陆战队？

323
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,285
爸爸想让我有男子汉的样子
才把我送进去的
My father's idea,
he wanted me to be more of a man.

324
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,496
我爸是参加过越南战争的勇士
He fought in the Vietnam War, you see.

325
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,583
- 你爸爸很优秀呢

- Yeah.

326
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,293
Was he a Marine too?

327
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,170
- 那你爸爸也是海军陆战队吗？
- 对 是 大哥

328
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,671
Yeah, well…
Would you excuse me for a moment?

329
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,671
抱歉打断您的话 稍等一下

330
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,841
我…
Listen. Perhaps we should learn
each other's names.

331
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,343
我们互相了解一下姓名 怎么样？

332
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:34,556
I still don't know your names, gentlemen.
Or yours, Miss.

333
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,556

to be twice as righteous.

纯熙小姐

go see a doctor right away.

Listen, I think it's more than
a coincidence that we met here.

从这里出去之后 大家都去我家
If we get out, I'd like to invite you
to our house for a meal.

再烤点五花肉 嗯？
We'll grill some pork belly.

396
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,531
真的可以吗？
Would that be okay?

397
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,700
哎哟 有什么不行的？
Absolutely!

398
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,035
我们家虽然有点小
We live in a small place, but there is
enough space for four people to eat.

399
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,830
四个人吃饭足够用了

400
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,457
躺下吃都够了 睡一觉再走
There's space for you to lie down.
You can sleep over.

401
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,586
姐姐
<i>Unnie</i>, are you coming?

402
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,880
你也去吗？

403
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,479
不过你们家都住在哪里呀？
By the way, where do you all live?

404
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,398
我们住在奉天洞
We live in Bongcheon-dong.

405
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,526
真的吗？我住在新林洞
Really? I live in Sillim-dong.

406
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,779

00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,028
哎呀 那就是邻居了！

408
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,990

412
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,956
大家怎么都住得这么近呢？

这一次一定要出去

419
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,282
Damn it.

420
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,619
战势不利的时候就要知道撤退
这才是海军陆战队
A Marine should think strategically
and know when to retreat.

421
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,829
对吧 大哥？
Isn't that right, brother?

422
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,499
嗯 对
Yeah, you're right.

423
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,043
海军陆战队又不是有两条命
Marines aren't invincible.
We should get out.

424
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,128
当然要走 嗯

425
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,589
一定要想办法让游戏在这里终止

Are you all out of your minds?

00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,787
你们亲眼看到那么多人死了
You still want to keep going
after watching all those people die?

459
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,789
还要再玩？

460
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,167

就拿着
What do you think
we can do with a mere 70 million?

466
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,145
七千万出去能做什么？

467
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,108
我不知道你欠了多少钱
I don't know how much you owe,
but for most people here,

468
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:14,070
在这里的各位现在拿着那笔钱出去

469
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:16,239
that doesn't even cover 10% of their debt.

470
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,780
债务的10%都还不上

471
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,323
你们不是吗？
Am I right?

472
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,867
我们哪有机会谈别的问题？
There's no next step for us!

473
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,453
拿走那笔钱 能改变什么？
That money won't change anything!

474
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,205
- 对 没错！
- 对！
- Yes, he's right!
- That's right!

475
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,875
拿着那笔钱出去 我坚持不了多久
With that amount of money,
I won't last long.

476
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,419
第一局之后2500万
It was 25 million after the first game,

477
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,839
第二局之后7800万！
and now it's 78 million!

478
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,632
再来一局之后
After one game,
the amount more than tripled!

479
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,218
奖金翻了三倍！

480
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,388
如果现在再来一局
If we play one more game,

481
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,476
奖金至少有两亿四千万！
the prize will be at least 240 million!

482
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,062
我坚持不下去了
But I can't do this anymore.

483
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,149
拜托
Please.

484
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,986
求求你们让我离开吧
Please let me out of here.

485
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,196
真的
I really…

486
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,492
我真的好想回家
I really want to go home.

487
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,370
我真的不想死

488
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,121
I don't want to die.

489
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,543
这位小姐
Young lady.

490
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,715
你还年轻 出去说不定还有机会
You're young, so you'd probably have
another chance.

491
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,885
但我没有啊
But I don't.

492
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,720
求你们了
Please.

493
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,096
我和我的家人
My family and I have no future.

494
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,764
都没有未来

495
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,227
我做生意失败 欠了五亿
My business failed,
and now I owe over 500 million.

496
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,148
我至少要带着欠债金额的一半出去
I've got to make
at least half of that here

497
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,651
才能有机会重新开始啊
if I want a real shot at a fresh start.

498
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,652
那万一你死了呢？
What if you die?

499
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,573
如果你死在了这里
你的家人连你的尸体都找不到
If you die here, your family
won't even get your body.

500
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,869
那样你和你的家人就都完了！
Then it'd be the end
for you and your family!

501
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,998
- 你不知道吗？
- 靠 不要害怕！
- Don't you see?
- Don't get fucking scared!

502
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,586
打画片、木头人、陀螺！
<i>Ddakji</i>, Red Light, Green Light,
Spinning Top!

503
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,797
这些不是大家
小时候就开始玩的游戏吗？
It's not like the games
are that difficult.

504
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:58,966
请看
Look.

505
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,055
还有255人 超过一半的人活了下来！
There are still 255 players.

506
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,680
Way more than half of us survived!

507
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,226
既然都走到了这一步
那就再来一局吧！
We've made it this far,
so let's do this one more time!

508
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,520
这位年轻人说的话真让人心情舒畅
You make such a good point, young man.

509
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:12,980
没错！
That's right!

510
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,650
各位都在游戏中表现很好
We've all played the games well
and are still standing!

511
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,194
在这里生存了下来！

512
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,280
来 就一局！
Now, let's play one more game!

513
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,200
不多也不少
Just one more, and that's it.
Let's play just one more game!

514
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,078
就再来一局吧！

515
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,746
没错 再来一局吧！
Yeah, let's play one more game!

516
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,206
再来一局！
One more game!

517
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,833
再来一局！
- One more game!
- One more game!

518
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:27,596
圆圈139票 叉116票
The results are 139 for O and 116 for X.

519
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,516
根据各位民主投票的结果
Based on the majority vote,
we'll proceed to the third game tomorrow.

520
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,644
明天将会举行第三局游戏

521
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,229
辛苦各位了
Thank you.

522
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,113
谢谢
Thank you.

523
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,325
谢谢
Thank you.

524
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:44,965
姐姐
<i>Noona.</i>

525
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,805
- 你不害怕吗？
- 怕什么？
Aren't you scared?

526
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,305
Scared of what?

527
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,183
在这里玩游戏
Playing more games.

528
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,145
害怕
I am scared.

529
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,608
那为什么还要继续玩呢？
Then why do you want to continue?

530
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,615
现在出去的话…
Because if I go out now,

531
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,576
有比这个游戏更让我害怕的东西
I'll have to face even scarier things.

532
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,584
以后别叫我姐姐了
Don't call me <i>noona</i>.

533
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,129
我是1998年生人 别告诉那几个小子
I'm younger than you,
but don't tell those jerks.

534
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,430
妈
Mom. Are you angry?

535
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,807
妈 你生气了吗？

536
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,642
别叫我“妈” 你个兔崽子
Don't call me "Mom," you damn fool.

537
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,770
妈 对不起
Mom. I'm sorry,
but I can't go home with just that.

538
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,481
可是我拿着那笔钱 没办法回家

539
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,781
什么意思？
What do you mean?

540
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,119
我还有一些债
I have a little more debt.

541
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,708
有多少？
How much?

542
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,294
大概一个亿
About 100 million.

543
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,507
我管私人放贷和赌博公司借的
I borrowed it from loan sharks
and the gambling den.

544
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,469
如果下个月之前没有还上
If I don't pay them back by next month,

545
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,138
就完蛋了
I'll be in huge trouble.

546
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,100
他们说要把我的眼睛、肝、肾
They said they'd take and sell
my eyes, liver, and kidneys.

547
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,478
全都挖出来卖掉

548
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,646
那些家伙真的会说到做到
I know they'll actually do it.

549
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,192
我之前没办法回家
就是因为那些家伙
That's why
I haven't been able to come home.

550
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:33,032
就再玩一局 下一局一定出去
Just one more game.

551
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,032
Next time, I promise I'll vote to leave.

552
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,075
再玩一局就全都能还上了
After one more game,
I'll be able to pay off all my debts.

553
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,786
那样才是全新的开始 嗯？

554
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,786
We'll make a fresh start then. Okay?

555
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,540
容植 “下一局”？
Yong-sik. "Next time"?

556
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,918
“全新的开始” 嗯？
"Fresh start"?

557
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,926
如果在那之前 你和我两个人中
有一个人出事了 怎么办？
What if one of us gets killed before that?

558
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,428
也对 你…
I know…

559
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,432
没有妈妈可能也没关系
maybe you'd be fine without me.

560
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,730
如果你在这里出了事情
But if something happens to you…

561
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,276
我自己一个人出去
I wouldn't have a reason to live,
even if I make it out of here.

562
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,363
就没有活下去的理由了

563
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,617
为什么要说这种话？
Why would you say such a thing?

564
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,537
我们两个人
一起好好努力就可以了 嗯？
We'll get through this together.

565
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,336
大哥！
Brother!

566
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,756
正倍哥！
Brother Jung-bae!

567
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,302
Man…

568
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,223
大哥 您过来这边嘛
Hey, just come back here.

569
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,600
- 不用 我就不用了
- 别这样
- No, I'm good here.
- Oh, come on.

570
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,519
- 行 我知道了
- 不行

571
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,770
- But… Hey.
- All right.

572
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,814
- 不要 你等一下
- 不行 那你要去哪里？

573
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,772
You should've gone farther away then.

574
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,817
你一直可怜巴巴地坐那边干什么？
我看着怪难受的
It bugs me seeing you
sitting there all pathetic.

575
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:55,948
对不起
I'm sorry.

576
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,451
纯熙 零一 对不起
Jun-hee, Young-il. I'm sorry.

577
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,455
奇勋 对不起
Gi-hun, I'm sorry.

578
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,710
我本来有点急事 借了点钱先用着
I borrowed some emergency cash,

579
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,421
催债的一直去骚扰
跟我离婚的妻子和孩子
and the creditors are harassing
my ex-wife and kid.

580
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,048
我真的只要再来一局
If I play one more game,

581
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,217
就全都能还上了
I think I'll be able to settle my debt.

582
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,302
- 所以说…
- 正倍
- So--
- Jung-bae.

583
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,263
别人我们管不着
正倍你也这样 就太过分了
You of all people shouldn't have done it.

584
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,433
你是要加倍正直活着的人
It's not twice as righteous.

585
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,271
不过话说回来
But, looking at the results,
even if you had voted against,

586
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,607
看两方票数差异 就算你选了叉

587
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,276
也不会改变结果
we would still have been outvoted.

588
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,193
对吧？
Right? It's not entirely my fault.

589
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,654
变成这样 不是我一个人的错 嗯？

590
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,780
知道了 说实话
All right. To be honest,

591
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,534
我能理解大哥
I understand why you did it.

592
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,663
其实那个钱数对我来说也有点不够
我过去投票的时候
The money isn't enough for me either,
so when I went up to vote,

593
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,791
心里也纠结过 要不要再来一局
I did think about playing one more game.

594
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,835
- 原来是这样啊？
- 行了 知道了
You did?

595
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,002
I said I get it.

596
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,005
哎呀 谢谢你们能理解我
Thank you for understanding.

597
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,506
哎呀 不过

598
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,176
But I voted in favor
partly because I feel confident.

599
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,176
我真的很有信心 所以才按继续的

600
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,011
我们队的合作太好了 对吧？
We did so well as a team, didn't we?

601
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,347
再来打拼一局
If we stick together one more time,
I'm sure we'll be fine. Jun-hee.

602
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,432
下一局游戏肯定也会安然无恙通关

603
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:06,602
纯熙 下一局游戏
我也会负责帮你 让你不会有事

604
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,727
I'll make sure we survive the next game--

605
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,519
下一局游戏？
"The next game"?

606
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,898
下一局游戏里
In the next game,

607
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,068
我们也有可能会互相残杀
we might have to kill each other.

608
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,614
奇勋 你至于这样吗？哎呀
Gi-hun, that's a bit much.

609
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,325
反正都已经变成这样了
There's nothing we can do now,
so let's try to stay positive.

610
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,411
大家都往好处想吧

611
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,039
先吃饭 然后一起加油
We should eat, pull ourselves together,
and try our best again.

612
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,291
再努力一次

613
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:34,129
纯熙 你多喝一点 下一局游戏要加油
Here, Jun-hee. You can have mine too.
Hang in there until the next game.

614
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,632
- 不用了 我没事的
- 给你喝吧
- No, it's okay.
- Take it.

615
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,385
我本来也不喝纯牛奶
I don't drink plain milk.

616
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,264
谢谢
Thank you.

617
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,559
这个面包也给你吃 我没有吃的资格
Have my bread too.

618
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,851
I don't deserve to eat.

619
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,437
那把您的牛奶给我吧
I'll take your milk then.

620
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,744
又不是只有我按了继续
It wasn't just me.

621
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,539
嗯？你看看 这里也有
Oh, look. See?
I'm not the only one who voted in favor--

622
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:09,790
这里也有按圆圈的人…

623
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,173
贤珠 你为什么这样 嗯？
Hyun-ju, why did you do it?

624
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,552
说好一起去我们家吃顿饭
把这一切都放下
We said we were all going
to get together at my house.

625
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,179
为什么又改变心意了？
Why did you change your mind?

626
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:27,850
嗯？你又不是像那个家伙一样
有赌博的债要还
I wouldn't think you'd have
gambling debts like my son.

627
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,894
是因为需要手术吗？
Is it because of the surgery?
Does it cost that much?

628
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,647
手术需要那么多钱吗？

629
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,278
如果你不愿意说 不说也可以
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

630
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,990
我自己的孩子 我都管教不好
I can't even keep
my own child under control,

631
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,700
我有什么资格对你
so who am I to tell you anything?

632
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,952
说三道四的？

633
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,627
我…
I…

634
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,676
在说出自己是这样的人之前
一直没什么问题
Everything was fine
until I told people who I really am.

635
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,722
People would look at me strangely,

636
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,430
虽然身边的人会觉得我有点奇怪

637
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,099
但没有什么大问题
but I never had any big issues.

638
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,644
可是
But…

639
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,690
我告诉大家 我想做女人
once I told people
I wanted to live as a woman

640
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,485
开始性转变之后
and started transitioning,

641
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,529
就完全不一样了
everything changed.

642
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,913
妈妈常常以泪洗面
My mom cried a lot.

643
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,541
爸爸也跟我断了联系
And my father stopped talking to me.

644
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:41,340
工作单位也把我开除了
朋友们也跟我疏远了
I got fired from my job,
and lost all my friends.

645
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,469
我应该要继续接受治疗 进行手术的
I wasn't done with
the treatment and procedures,

646
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,807
没有收入 债务增多
but I wasn't earning any money,
so my debt kept piling up.

647
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,726
虽然心里舒服了一点
Although I felt liberated,

648
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,187
生活上
my life…

649
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,232
却困难了很多
became so much harder.

650
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,733
哎哟
Oh, dear.

651
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:06,949
Well, what did you do for work before?

652
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,321
之前

653
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,949
你是做什么工作的？

654
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,827
我是军人
I was in the army.

655
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,834
你在这里赚到了钱离开之后
If you make money here, then what?

656
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,877
有什么计划吗？
Do you have a plan?

657
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,256
我要去泰国
I think I'm going to move to Thailand.

658
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,257
泰国？
Thailand?

659
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,719
真的就再玩一局 赚一点钱
I want to play just one more game.
If I win the money…

660
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,682
过去把手术做完
I'll finish my transition there
and buy a small house.

661
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,767
再买一个小房子

662
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,812
过去生活一段时间看看
I want to start a new life there.

663
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,814
我以前去过泰国
I've been to Thailand before.

664
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,275
那里有很多像贤珠这样的朋友
There are a lot of people
like Hyun-ju over there.

665
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,362
人家真是比普通的女人更苗条、高挑
They're hotter and more beautiful
than most women,

666
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:49,074
那里遍地都是这样的美女

667
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,992
and you see them everywhere.
Isn't that right?

668
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:49,992
对吧？

669
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,285
对
Yeah. I hear a lot of them
are really beautiful.

670
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,454
那里真的有很多美女

671
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,958
姐姐你也很漂亮
You're beautiful too, <i>unnie</i>.

672
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,725
我不知道能不能说你漂亮
I don't know if I could say "beautiful,"

673
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,352
你看起来
but I've spent some time with you now,

674
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,814
还不赖
and I think you look fine.

675
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,109
妈 你之前不是说她很吓人吗？
You said she was unsightly.

676
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,487
喂！
Hey.

677
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,086
喂 你这个叛徒
You traitor.

678
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,881
你现在还能尿得出来吗？
How can you take a piss
under these circumstances?

679
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,970
尿吧 尿到一半断了 会生病的
Just finish. You'll get an infection
if you stop mid-stream.

680
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,279
你真想从这里出去吗？
Were you really trying to get out?

681
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,406
才七千万 能做什么？
What can you even do with 70 million?

682
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,369
那笔钱都不够还我的
That's not even enough to pay me back.

683
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,372
你要多赚一点
You need to pay me back, and also

684
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,250
你还要赔偿我的精神损失
compensate for the damage
you did to my soul.

685
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,669
我跟你说过几次了？
How many times do I have to tell you?

686
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,630
那个币明明涨上去过
That coin's price did go up.

687
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,674
还想多赚点 不卖掉 是你们的问题
You held out for more cash
but didn't sell at the right time.

688
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,968
要不要从这里出去 是我的自由
And I have the freedom
to decide if I want to leave.

689
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,261
这小子说话太混蛋了
I don't care for your fucking tone.

690
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,764
要不我干脆把他的嘴撕烂算了？
Hey, should I just rip his mouth off?

691
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,058
“自由”？
You have the freedom?

692
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,435
- 你没有那种东西
- 妈的
- You don't have such a thing.
- Goddamnit.

693
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,521
你把欠的债还清之前 就是我的奴隶
You're my slave until you pay me back.

694
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,064
我的奴隶
My slave.

695
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,859
所以你要在这里 把游戏玩到最后
So you have to keep playing
the games until the end.

696
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:48,777
谁知道呢？
And who knows?

697
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,072
你赢了的话 说不定456亿都是你的
You might win the entire prize alone.

698
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,242
这样才能把我的钱还清
<i>Then I will get my money back</i>

699
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,786
你才能找回幸福
<i>And you will get your happiness back</i>

700
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,496
哇

701
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,416
我一个人把456亿全赢到手 你就死了
If I won the prize alone,
that'd mean you're dead.

702
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,419
我为什么要还死人的钱？
Why would I pay you back if you were dead?

703
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,089
How do you even remember your lyrics?

704
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,089
你这个脑子是怎么记住说唱歌词的？

705
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,216
啊 对了
Oh, right.

706
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,760
你当初决赛的时候也忘词了吧？
You forgot the lyrics
in the show's finale.

707
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,471
你个王八蛋 你死定了
You son of a bitch. Got a death wish?

708
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,140
我都没吃东西 怎么还想上大号…
I didn't even eat anything, so why…

709
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,234
我会盯着你的
I'm watching you.

710
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,408
那些家伙现在还欺负你呢？
Are those guys still bullying you?

711
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,661
如果他们继续这样
你可以来找我们帮忙
If they keep doing that,
you can ask for our help.

712
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,163
没事的
I'm fine.

713
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,178
十分钟后将会熄灯
<i>Lights out in ten minutes.</i>

714
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,432
- 请各位玩家准备就寝
- 来给我
<i>- Please prepare for bedtime.</i>
- Pass it to me.

715
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:01,933
放这下面
Go under.

716
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,068
非要这么做吗？
Is this really necessary?

717
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,445
我不想在下面睡
I don't like sleeping under there.

718
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,531
今天晚上熄灯之后
可能会有人攻击我们
Once the lights go out,
somebody might attack us.

719
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,034
啊？谁啊？
What? Who?

720
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,286
在这里相互残杀 奖金会增多
The prize money still goes up
if we kill each other.

721
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,164
这也是那些人所设计游戏的一部分
It's part of the game they designed.

722
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,250
奇勋 你刚才是不是太敏感了？
Gi-hun, I think you're overreacting here.

723
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,753
再怎么说 大家也不会对别人下手
Even if that were true,
people wouldn't do that.

724
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,797
上次游戏里
In the previous games,

725
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,509
有几十个人在夜里相互残杀而死
dozens of people
killed each other at night.

726
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,053
就在这里
Right here.

727
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,514
你根本不知道
You have no idea

728
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,516
这里面的人…
how people can change…

729
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,603
会变成什么样
in this place.

730
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,022
知道了 哎哟
All right, I guess I didn't know
what I was talking about. I'm sorry.

731
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:53,026
是我不懂状况 失言了 抱歉

732
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,282
熄灯回去之后 我们要轮流值夜班
We need to take turns keeping watch
after lights-out.

733
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,578
我先来值班 剩下的顺序你们决定
I'll take the first watch.
You should decide the order for the rest.

734
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,686
你去哪里？

735
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,311
Where are you going?

736
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,229
嗯？
To the bathroom.

737
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:30,856
洗手间

738
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,193
哎呀 妈 你非要大半夜去
You always go to the bathroom
in the middle of the night.

739
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,446
要我陪你吗？
Should I come with you?

740
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,531
不用
No. Why would you want to come
to the ladies' room?

741
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:43,076
我去女卫生间 你跟过来干什么？

742
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,661
你一个人可以吗？
Will you be okay alone?

743
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,998
我感觉这里的人
I'm a little scared of the people here.

744
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,292
都有点可怕

745
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,675
Look.

746
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,765
哎呀妈 你…
Whoa.

747
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,933
- 这个…
- 嗯
- What…
- Listen.

748
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,103
这是你奶奶传给我的簪子
This is the <i>binyeo</i>
your grandmother gave me.

749
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,441
我怕来这里万一有什么事情
插在头上防身的
I put it in just in case
I need to protect myself.

750
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,862
如果有坏人 我直接…
If somebody messes with me, I'll just go…

751
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,156
哎呀 果然…

752
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,489
Of course.

753
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,702
不愧是从朝鲜战争中
存活下来的张金子女士

754
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,994
Madam Jang Geum-ja,
who survived the Korean War.

755
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,206
太厉害了
Very impressive, ma'am.

756
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:36,796
大叔
Mr. Seong.

757
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,218
我想去卫生间
I need to use the bathroom.

758
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,387
现在自己一个人去危险
It's too dangerous to go by yourself.

759
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,723
跟我一起去吧

760
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,015
We can go together.

761
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,782
我想去洗手间
We need to use the bathroom.

762
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,493
不行 现在禁止出入
No. Entry and exit
are restricted at this time.

763
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,703
拜托你了
Please. I'm not feeling very well.

764
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,081
我身体不太舒服

765
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,833
不行 现在禁止出入

766
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,917
No. Entry and exit
are restricted at this time.

767
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:14,751
那个…
Look.

768
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,045
这位三角形小伙子
Mr. Triangle.

769
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:21,132
虽然你戴着奇怪的面具
Even though you're wearing a weird mask,
you're still human, aren't you?

770
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,176
你也是人 对吧？

771
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,137
三角形小伙子 你在外面的世界
In the outside world,
you might have a sister like her

772
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:30,225
可能也有这样的姐妹
还有我这样的母亲

773
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,433
and a mom like me.

774
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:34,020
女孩子说想去卫生间
When ladies say
they need to use the bathroom,

775
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:38,191
是因为有不好意思说出来的情况

776
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,692
it's for reasons they can't tell you.

777
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,610
这都不让去的话
If you can't understand that,

778
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,781
三角形小伙子
你有点不近人情了 这样可不行啊
you shouldn't even call yourself human.
You really shouldn't.

779
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:49,744
我…
Listen.

780
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,333
年过花甲之后
我开始出现排尿控制方面的困扰
Ever since I entered my 60s,
I've had bladder control issues.

781
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:58,295
不穿纸尿裤 都不能出门了
I can't go out without wearing a diaper,

782
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,214
但我来这里的时候什么都没带
but I couldn't bring
any of the things I need here.

783
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,467
你真的一定要看我在这里尿裤子吗？
Do you really have to make me wet myself?

784
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,888
你把我想象成你妈妈
Imagine if I was your mother,
Mr. Triangle.

785
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,808
哎哟 你不能这么对妈妈
You wouldn't do that to your mother.

786
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,812
我因为儿子欠的债来到了这里
I came here because of my son's debt.

787
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,356
都不能尿尿 你非要我死在这里吗？
I should at least get to pee
when I want, shouldn't I?

788
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,694
我上辈子作了什么孽啊…
What did I do
in my previous life to deserve…

789
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,324
哎呀 谢谢
Well, thank you.

790
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,160
我也想一起…
Can I come too?

791
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,953
啊 没事的
Oh, that's okay.

792
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,206
是女生 名字都叫贤珠
She's a woman. Her name is Hyun-ju.

793
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,168
没关系 走吧
It's fine. Let's go.

794
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,045
哎呀 快点过来
Come quick.

795
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,214
谢谢你 三角形小伙子
Thank you, Mr. Triangle.

796
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,056
如果感觉累 就抓着我
Hold on to me if you need help.

797
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:54,976
没事的
I'm okay.

798
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,441
这样的身体状况 怎么还进来这里？
In a place like this in your condition…

799
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,569
父母该有多担心啊
Your mom and dad must be worried sick.

800
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,572
我没有
I don't have any.

801
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,367
父母
I have no parents.

802
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,295
那个…
Listen.

803
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,465
如果有什么需要帮忙
不管是什么 尽管开口
If you need help with anything,
just let me know.

804
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,135
我没事的
I'm okay.

805
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,352
她身体出什么问题了？
Is she sick or something?

806
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,564
怀孕了
She's pregnant.

807
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,984
应该临近生产了
I think she's almost due.

808
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,380
奇勋 我醒了
Gi-hun, I'm up.

809
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,970
你回去睡一会儿吧 我来守夜
You should get some sleep. I'll take over.

810
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,013
我现在还好
I'm not that tired.

811
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,975
你再睡一会儿
Get some more sleep.

812
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:29,696
对不起
I'm sorry.

813
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:31,865
别说那些了
Let's not talk about it.

814
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:34,951
我知道不是你的错
I know it wasn't your fault.

815
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,495
不是 我不是说那个
No, it's not about that.

816
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,501
以前在扎啤店
I'm sorry I didn't lend you money
when you came to my pub before.

817
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,879
你来找我借钱 我没能借给你的事

818
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,841
如果我那时候想想办法借给你
If I had found some way to help you,
your mom might still be alive now.

819
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,968
你妈妈也许就不会那样去世了

820
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,306
哎呀 但我那个时候是真的没钱
Man, but I really
didn't have any money then.

821
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,436
我知道
I know.

822
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,689
我没有怨恨过你
I've never resented you for that.

823
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,319
你上次是因为那件事才来这里的吗？
Is that why you came here before?
To pay for your mom's treatment?

824
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,528
因为你妈妈的住院费？

825
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,287
喂 那你干什么又进来一次？
So why did you come back?

826
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,999
嗯？如果我是你
会把这些全都忘掉 用那笔钱
If I were you,
I would have put everything behind me

827
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,084
重新开始了
and started a new life with the money.

828
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,298
你…
If…

829
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,428
如果我在你眼前死了
I died right before your eyes,

830
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:38,973
你带着
and you…

831
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,851
那笔钱出去了
won all the money,

832
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,562
会感觉如何？
how would you feel?

833
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,360
你这么说干什么？一起出去就好了
Come on, don't say that.
We'll make it out together.

834
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,153
所以我才回到了这里
That's why I came back.

835
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,949
为了这次让所有人一起出去
To make it out with everyone.

836
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,077
为了让这个游戏结束
To end this game.

837
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,039
但是
But

838
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,625
现在我也不知道…
I don't know anymore.

839
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,838
我还能在这里做什么
I don't know what more I can do here.

840
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,803
原来是我把你的计划毁了
我按了那个按钮
I ruined your plan
by pressing that button.

841
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,638
我说了 不是你的错
I told you it's not your fault.

842
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,187
喂 你还记得以前吗？
Hey, do you remember
when we went on strike?

843
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,981
我们在公司罢工那次

844
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:31,609
我们把工厂占领了
他们让我们离开占领区
We were occupying the factory,
and management told us to come out.

845
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,571
如果主动出去
They said anyone who came out voluntarily

846
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,449
他们就不会追责 也会多给离职费
would be let off the hook
and receive more severance pay.

847
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,994
怎么会忘呢？
How could I forget?

848
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,831
我当时在守夜 其实我想出去来着
When I was on night watch,
I wanted to go out. Guess why I didn't.

849
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,249
你知道我为什么没出去吗？

850
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,960
你在我旁边睡着了
You were sleeping beside me,
and you were talking in your sleep.

851
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,337
说梦话

852
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,508
“妈妈 我好饿 给我饭”
"Mom, I'm hungry. Give me some food."

853
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,595
“妈妈 我好饿 给我饭”
"Mom, I'm hungry. Give me some food."

854
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,598
你这样说着 在睡梦中抽泣
You were sobbing in your sleep.

855
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,897
- 我睡觉的时候哭了？
- 嗯
- I cried in my sleep?
- Yes.

856
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,983
- 一边说着“妈妈给我饭”？
- 嗯
Asking for food?

857
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:11,983
Yeah.

858
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:14,611
- 所以你是因为我才没出去的？
- 嗯
So you stayed because of me?

859
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:18,197
Yeah. I was watching you, and I thought,

860
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,863
我就这样看着你

861
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,323
看着看着

862
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,785
“哇 这个可怜巴巴的傻小子怎么办？
"Man, look at this poor little wuss."

863
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,537
睡着睡着 醒来发现我不见了
"If he wakes up and sees that I'm gone,

864
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,249
自己一个人都没办法去卫生间
感觉会哭哭啼啼的”
he'll start crying and won't even
be able to go the bathroom."

865
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,628
一想到这里 妈的 我就没办法出去了
Then I knew I couldn't fucking leave you.

866
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,005
你这家伙胡说八道什么？真是的
You're so full of shit.

867
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,381
真的 我以你妈的名义发誓
No, I swear on your mom.

868
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,634
为什么以我妈妈发誓？
以你妈妈发誓才对啊
Why on my mom? Swear on your own.

869
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,802
不管以谁妈妈发誓 都是真的
Whoever's mom it is, it's true.

870
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,139
我是那个时候没能出去 被公司解雇
变成现在这个样子的 不是吗？
I got fired and ended up like this
because I stayed.

871
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:46,142
反正你这家伙
发生不好的事情 全都是因为我
You always blame me
for every bad thing that happens,

872
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,480
赌马的时候输了也是因为我
开炸鸡店也是因为跟着我才毁了的
losing money on the horses
and for your failed chicken shop.

873
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:51,856
结婚也是因为我 是吧？
What else? Getting married?

874
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,817
不是 结婚是因为我喜欢她才结的
离婚是因为你离的
No, I got married because I wanted to.
I got divorced because of you.

875
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,695
那我也是因为你才跟佳英妈妈分手的
Hey, I got divorced because of you.

876
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,947
你天天叫我去喝酒
Because you'd always
invite me out for drinks.

877
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,158
赌马最开始也是你带我去的
And you're the one
who got me into horse racing.

878
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,786
啊 知道了 你别说了
All right. Quiet down.

879
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,083
你这小子
这才是我认识的那个成奇勋
You're finally acting like
the Seong Gi-hun I know.

880
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,005
这段时间你一直像变了个人似的
You've been acting like
a different person.

881
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,220
喂 奇勋
Gi-hun.

882
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:24,806
下一局游戏结束之后
After the next game,
let's get out of here, okay?

883
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,850
我们一定要出去

884
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:28,768
出去后

885
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,313
去喝杯烧酒 好久没喝了
Let's go drink soju like old times.

886
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,818
你请客
You're buying.

887
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,950
果然人都是江山易改 本性难移
People really don't change.

888
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,537
双门洞吝啬鬼成奇勋
Seong Gi-hun,
the cheapskate of Ssangmun-dong.

889
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,123
吝啬魔王
The biggest cheapskate.

890
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,667
吝啬大王
The king of cheapskates.

891
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,880
双门洞吝啬鬼 好久没这样叫你了
"The cheapskate of Ssangmun-dong."
That takes me back.

892
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,277
她还没出来吗？
Is she still in there?

893
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,362
没有
Yes.

894
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,454
喂
Hello? Are you all right?

895
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,414
你还好吗？

896
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,878
你没事吧？发生什么事情了吗？
Are you okay in there? Is something wrong?

897
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,727
哎呀 你怎么了？
Oh, dear. What's wrong?

898
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,729
哪里不舒服吗？嗯？
Are you in pain? Is your belly hurting?

899
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:56,731
嗯？是肚子痛吗？

900
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,983
哎呀 出大事了 孩子要出来了
Oh, no. Your baby must be coming.

901
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,944
你哪里痛 告诉我 嗯？
Listen, tell me where and how it hurts.

902
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,281
我好怕
I'm scared.

903
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,375
没事的
It's okay.

904
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,670
没事
It's okay.

905
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:21,756
没事
It's okay.

906
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,969
不会有事的
Everything is going to be okay.

907
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,809
你和宝宝都不会有事的
You and your baby
are going to be all right.

908
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:34,560
不用担心
Don't worry.

909
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,318
二队也要小心
Team 2, be careful too.

910
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,655
如果搜索发现了什么
请立刻用对讲机联系
If you find anything suspicious,
contact us right away.

911
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:46,781
是 知道了

912
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,616
朴船长
Captain Park, be careful out there.

913
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,451
小心一点

914
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,166
二队往北搜索
Team 2 will search up north.

915
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,168
我们再往西南方向走远一点搜索
We'll head out to the southwest.

916
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,086
好
Okay.

917
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,421
We have to find it in the next four days.

918
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,421
最迟必须在四天内找到

919
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,339
不用担心
Don't worry.

920
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:07,426
那艘船的高船长也是
土生土长的本地人 对附近了如指掌
Captain Ko over there is a local too.
He knows the area inside and out.

921
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,681
我们带了充足的油和粮食
能坚持一周左右
And we've got enough fuel
and food for a week.

922
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,850
- 找找试试吧
- 知道了
- Let's give it a go.
- All right.

923
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:14,976
带烧酒了吧？
You've got some soju too, right?

924
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,021
晚上我用这个抓几条鱼
I'll catch some fish with this at night.
You can slice it up nicely for us.

925
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,147
再弄点生鱼片

926
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,275
喂 你乘坐的是钓鱼船吗？
Hey, do you think
you're on a fishing boat?

927
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:27,446
找到那个岛之前
你给我集中注意力 嗯？
Stay on your toes
until we find that island.

928
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,951
太阳落山之后 一片漆黑
反正也什么都做不了
When it gets dark,
we won't be able to do anything anyway.

929
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,328
在大海上漂一整夜还能做什么？
What are we supposed to do all night?

930
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,291
船长打算给我们唱歌、跳舞吗？
Are you going to sing and dance for us?

931
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,132
来吧 出航！
All right, let's set sail!

932
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,802
先找到的队伍有额外奖金 加油！
The team that finds it first
gets a bonus! Good luck!

933
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,637
- 加油！
- 好 太好了！
- Let's go!
- Good luck!

934
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:01,397
稍后将开始第三项游戏
<i>The third game will begin momentarily.</i>

935
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:06,193
请各位玩家起床准备
<i>All players, please get out of bed</i>
<i>and get ready.</i>

936
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,571
重复一遍
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

937
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,284
稍后将开始第三项游戏
<i>The third game will begin momentarily.</i>

938
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:17,914
请各位玩家起床准备
<i>All players, please get out of bed</i>
<i>and get ready.</i>

939
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,170
大哥 可以给我一个吗？
Hey, brother. Can I have one too?

940
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,048
你不要好奇
You don't want to know.

941
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,634
那东西试过一次之后
你就再也无法理智了
Once you take it,
you'll never be normal again.

942
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,764
而且等你从这里出去之后
千万不要再跟那些混蛋有联系
If you get out of here,
don't get involved with them ever again.

943
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,936
那你为什么跟他们一起玩游戏？
Why did you team up with them then?

944
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,772
那几个人蠢 比较容易应付
Because idiots like them
are easier to deal with.

945
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,358
那你为什么
What about me?
Why did you team up with me?

946
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,610
跟我一起玩？

947
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,029
你…
Because…

948
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,699
感觉你不会坑我
I thought you wouldn't deceive me.

949
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,284
啊？
What?

950
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:02,124
反正 等我能拿到两亿奖金
就从这里出去
Anyway, I'm getting out
once the prize money reaches 200 million.

951
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,461
我不知道你欠了多少钱
但你也好好想想
I don't know your situation,
but think carefully.

952
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,799
你在这里没办法坚持很久
You won't last long in here.

953
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:42,081
各位士兵出发 请前往指定位置
<i>All soldiers,</i>
<i>please proceed to your stations.</i>

954
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,593
- Wow.
- Yeah!

955
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:13,821
英美
Young-mi.

956
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:18,868
对不起
I'm sorry.

957
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:22,246
没关系
It's okay.

958
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:27,418
大家一起好好表现
这局游戏结束再出去就好了
We can all win the game
and make it out together.

959
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,602
欢迎各位来到第三项游戏
<i>Welcome to your third game.</i>

960
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,230
本项游戏是找同伴
<i>The game you will be playing is Mingle.</i>

961
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,858
重复一遍
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

962
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:54,570
本项游戏是找同伴
<i>The game you will be playing is Mingle.</i>

963
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,907
Hey, we'll be mingling together.

964
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:56,989
大家一起找同伴

965
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,533
真有意思 是吧？
Doesn't that sound like so much fun?

966
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:01,786
啧啧啧！

967
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:07,416
<i>All players,</i>
<i>please step onto the center platform.</i>

968
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,662
各位玩家

969
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:07,374
请全体移动到中央的圆盘上

970
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:10,503
游戏开始后 圆盘会旋转
<i>When the game starts,</i>
<i>the platform will begin to rotate,</i>

971
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,129
稍后将播报数字
<i>and you will hear a number.</i>

972
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:16,383
在30秒内按照播报的数字寻找同伴
<i>You must form groups of that size,</i>

973
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,887
进入房间 关上门 即为成功
<i>go into the rooms,</i>
<i>and close the door within 30 seconds.</i>

974
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,013
啊 这个…
Oh, this game? We used to play
something similar on school trips.

975
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,224
跟我们小时候去郊游时玩的差不多

976
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,142
说完“几人”之后抱在一起的那个游戏
We formed groups by hugging.

977
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,603
这个不是抱在一起 是进入房间
Yeah. Instead of hugging,
we go into those rooms.

978
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:29,355
没错 是那个
I know this game.

979
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:32,608
什么 要怎么玩？没有什么策略吗？
How should we play this?
Is there a strategy?

980
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,611
如果是四个人 我们一起去就好了
If the number is four,
we can stay together.

981
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,614
如果是两个人 我们两两一起就好了
If it's two, you and me pair up.

982
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,324
如果宣布的数字超过五个人
If the number is bigger than five,
we'll get the additional people we need.

983
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,409
人数不够 要把别人拉进来

984
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:45,121
如果少于五个人呢？
But what if it's smaller than five?

985
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,207
比如三人、两人…
Like three or four.

986
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,543
到时候看情况应对就好了
We'll figure it out as we go.

987
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,587
来 各位不管遇到什么情况
不要慌张 冷静一点
No matter what happens, don't panic.
Let's stay calm.

988
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:54,839
互相信任
Let's trust each other.

989
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,882
一个人都不要丢下 一起出去 来

991
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,144
- 加油！

992
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:12,189
那么 游戏现在开始
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

993
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:26,537
转圈圈 转圈圈
<i>Round and round</i>

994
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:30,374
转着圈圈 跳着舞
<i>Let's go around in circles and dance</i>

995
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:35,629
拍拍手 唱唱歌
<i>We will clap our hands and sing</i>

996
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:39,758
啦啦啦啦 开心地跳舞
<i>La-la-la-la, let's have fun dancing</i>

997
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:44,763
叮铃铃铃
<i>Ring-a, ring-a, ring-a</i>
<i>Ring-a, ring-a-ring</i>

998
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:49,310
叮铃铃铃
<i>Ring-a, ring-a, ring-a</i>
<i>Ring-a, ring-a-ring</i>

999
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:53,480
手拉着手 所有人一起
<i>We will go hand in hand</i>

1000
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:58,152
<i>And have fun jumping around</i>

1001
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:58,152
欢乐地蹦跳

1002
