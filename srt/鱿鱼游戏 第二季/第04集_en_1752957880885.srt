EPISODE 4
SIX LEGS

3
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,882
呀 这个跟以前
我妈给我带的饭一模一样
Just like my mom used to make.

4
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,885
你那里面都有什么？什么小菜？
What's in yours?

5
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,972
你真不吃吗？
Aren't you going to eat?

6
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,976
喂 你先吃点 嗯？
Look, you've got to eat.

7
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,896
“饱死鬼总比饿死鬼好看”
You know what they say.
"Eat up, even on your deathbed."

8
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,358
你先吃点 吃完再苦恼
吃完再思考 来 张嘴
Just do your thinking while you eat,
or afterwards. Here.

9
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,152
啊
Come on.

10
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,404
哎 不吃算了
Forget it then.

11
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,408
说不定这样更好
This might be for the best.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,579
我不知道你什么情况
I don't know about you,

13
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,958
说实话 拿着那两千万离开
连我欠债的利息都不够
but that 20 million
wouldn't even cover my interest.

14
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,793
如果再玩一场游戏 再离开这里…
If we play just one more game--

15
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,794
正倍
Jung-bae.

16
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:14,342
上次我来这里的时候
有人也说了同样的话
Last time I was here,
someone said the exact same thing.

17
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,762
后来那个人
And in the end,

18
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,765
死在了这里
that person died here.

19
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,019
您救我们就好了
Help us then, sir.

20
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,857
您不是说玩过这个游戏嘛
You said you've played these games.

21
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,154
我刚才是因为有您在 才按圆圈键的
I pressed the O button because of you.

22
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,034
其实我也很害怕 想放弃离开的
Honestly, I was scared.
I wanted to quit and leave.

23
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:45,248
听了您说的话之后
我就想 再玩一场游戏试试
But you made me think
maybe I could play just one more game.

24
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,875
- 我也是
- 我也一样
- Me too.
- Same here.

25
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,501
- 我也是 先生
- 我也是这样
- Yes.
- Me too.

26
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,840
先生
Sir.

27
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,885
下一个游戏是什么 您知道吧？
You know which game's next, don't you?

28
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,432
哎 对啊
That's right.

29
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,102
既然你赢过
应该很了解下一个游戏吧
You're a previous winner,
so you should know.

30
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,271
下一局游戏是什么？
What are we playing next?

31
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,442
第二局游戏
The second game

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,445
是取“达固那”
was <i>Dalgona</i>.

33
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,534
“达固那”？糖融化了
雕刻出形状那个？
<i>Dalgona</i>? The sugar candy
with a shape you can carve out?

34
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,077
没错
That's right.

35
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,623
从四种形状里选择一个 从糖里取出
We had to choose one of four shapes
and carve it out.

36
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,793
四种形状？最简单的是哪一种？

37
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,793
Four shapes? Which was the easiest one?

38
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,961
三角形
Triangle.

39
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,714
最难的是什么？
Which was the hardest one?

40
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,716
雨伞
Umbrella.

41
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,634
雨伞吗？
Umbrella?

42
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,763
真有人选雨伞吗？
Some people chose umbrella?

43
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:49,062
哇 不知天高地厚选了雨伞的人
不是等于直接见阎王了吗？是吧？
Those unlucky bastards
must have bitten the dust.

44
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,988
不是啊 那我们
全都选三角形不就好了？
So that means
we should all just pick triangle.

45
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,532
这一关感觉全都能通过呢 是吧？
Everyone could probably pass the round.

46
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,159
等一下！
Hush now!

47
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,539
如果我们365个人全都活下来
奖金一分都不会增长
If all 365 of us survive,
the prize money won't go up at all.

48
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,251
那我们就白冒着生命危险
再来一局游戏了
Then we'll have risked
our lives again for nothing.

49
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,294
- 对啊
- 没错
- That's true.
- He's right.

50
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,174
现在大家听到的信息
谁都不要告诉其他人 怎么样？
Listen. We should probably
keep this information to ourselves.

51
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,301
- 不要说
- 就这样吧
- What do you say?
- Let's do that.

52
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,970
不行
We can't do that.

53
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,847
我现在说这些话
是为了救所有人的命
I'm telling you this
to save everyone's lives.

54
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,268
如果确认了
下一场游戏是抠糖取形状
If it's confirmed
that the next game is <i>Dalgona</i>,

55
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,312
我所知道的一切 会告诉所有人
I'm going to tell everyone what I know.

56
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,111
达固那 三角形
<i>Dalgona</i>, triangle.

57
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,995
你上次取的哪个形状？
So which shape did you pick?

58
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,878
妈 我知道了一件重要的事
Mom. I just found out something important.

59
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,552
该死 妈！
Shit. Mom!

60
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,934
多吃点
Have this too.

61
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,647
为了宝宝 吃吧
You should eat it for your baby.

62
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,483
鸡蛋对孕妇有好处
Eggs are good for pregnant women.

63
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:25,867
在我家住的社区 我帮忙接生的孩子
I've helped more than
a dozen women in my neighborhood

64
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,286
就有十几个 都是我来接生
deliver their babies.

65
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:34,125
我只要看到你的体态
和走路的方式 就都知道了
I can tell just by looking at
your body shape and the way you walk.

66
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,004
我看你好像快足月了
It looks like
your due date is getting close.

67
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,132
如果你为了掩饰而压住肚子
If you compress your belly to hide it,

68
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,385
对宝宝和产妇都不好 会出大事的
it'll be bad for both you and your baby.
It could be dangerous.

69
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,721
难怪你刚才那么痛苦
That's why you were in pain earlier.

70
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,348
不是那样的
It's not what you think.

71
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,645
怎么拖着这样的身体来到了这里？
How did you end up in a place like this
in your condition?

72
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,148
- 妈 你来这里干什么？
- 你吓死我了！
- What are you doing here?
- You startled me!

73
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,025
- 快过来 没时间唠嗑了
- 怎么了？
- Come. No time for socializing.
- What…

74
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,277
行 等一下 知道了
All right, just wait.

75
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,237
不要剩饭 全吃了
You should finish your food,

76
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,656
如果感觉不对劲 马上叫我过来
and if something feels off,
come find me right away.

77
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,785
- 你快过来！
- 我就在那边 知道了吗？
- Come on!
- I'll be over there, okay?

78
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,870
哎呀 真是的 到底什么事？
Why? What is it?

79
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,925
我可以跟您打听一件事吗？
May I ask you something?

80
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,643
为什么又回到这里来？
Why did you come back to this place?

81
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,397
您说自己获胜 从这里离开了
You said you won and made it out.

82
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,149
那您应该收到了456亿奖金
Then you must have received 45.6 billion.

83
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,693
不会全花完了吧？
Did you spend it all?

84
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,405
你又去赌马了？
Did you bet on horses again?

85
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,407
那笔钱不是我的
That money doesn't belong to me.

86
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,121
是所有死在这里的人的买命钱
It's blood money
for the people who died here.

87
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,208
那上面的钱也是一样
The same goes for the money up there.

88
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,754
有必要这样想吗？
You don't have to think of it that way.

89
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,007
那些人又不是您杀的
It's not like you killed those people,

90
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,927
不花那笔钱
也没办法让那些人起死回生
and saving that money
won't bring them back to life.

91
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:13,599
如果你最后按了叉
至少这里的每个人都能活着出去
If you had pressed the X,
everyone here would've made it out alive.

92
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,521
没错 我是最后一个按圆圈键的
That's right.
I was the last to press the O button.

93
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,861
可是就算没有我
这里想留下来的人还有182个
But there were 182 more people
who wanted to stay.

94
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,823
选择离开这里的人也有182个
And there were also 182 people
who wanted to leave.

95
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,950
如果我像您说的那样
Let's say

96
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:37,206
按了叉键 我们都离开了
大家真的会开心吗？
I pressed X and we all left.
Would everyone have been happy?

97
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,042
如果他们以后在什么地方遇到我
Do you think if they ran into me later,

98
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:45,423
会感谢我当时救了他们的命
说“我现在过得很幸福”吗？
they'd thank me for saving their lives
and tell me they're happy now?

99
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,639
对啊 已经变成这样了
现在责怪谁也没有意义了
All right.
There's no point in placing blame now.

100
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,684
寡妇最了解鳏夫的境遇
不然大家怎么会这样说呢？
You know the saying,
a widow understands a widower best.

101
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,479
我们还是专心想明天的游戏
好好表现 好吗？
Let's just focus on tomorrow's game, okay?

102
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,564
游戏他全都玩过 还都赢了
He has won all these games before.

103
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,901
只要我们团结在一起
就完全不用担心了
If we stick together,
we'll have nothing to worry about.

104
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,152
没错 各位大哥
He's right, sirs.

105
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,783
我们难道不应该团结在一起吗？
We have to stick together.

106
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,702
我也会一直跟大哥们一起
I'll be with you all the way.

107
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,828
您是哪位啊？
Who are you?

108
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,330
哎呀 大哥
My good sir.

109
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,709
我是大虎 姜大虎 大哥
I'm Dae-ho. Kang Dae-ho.

110
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,128
- 大虎先生
- 是的
- Oh, Mr. Dae-ho.
- Yes.

111
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,046
我们认识吗？
Have we met?

112
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,843
刚才在游戏里 456号大哥
Earlier during the game,
Mr. 456 here was like,

113
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,847
说“不要动！”开始
我就成了他的粉丝
"Freeze!" And I became his fan.

114
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,808
我想现在开始
认识一下各位大哥 请给个机会！
I'd like to get to know you, sirs.
Please give me the chance!

115
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,020
“不要动！” 太帅了
"Freeze!" That was so cool.

116
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,355
等一下
Hang on.

117
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,564
怎么了 大哥？
Yes, sir?

118
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,815
海军陆战队？
You were in the Marines?

119
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,108
对 怎么了？
Yes, why?

120
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,193
哪届的？
Class number?

121
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,447
呵 真是的

122
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,074
你还笑？
You're laughing?

123
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,163
必胜！
Victory at all costs!

124
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,998
1140届兵！
I was in Class 1140, sir!

125
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,416
稍息！
At ease!

126
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,960
大虎！
"Dae-ho."

127
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,963
怪不得刚才就觉得你不一样
I knew there was something about you.

128
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,674
- 是！
- 我是746届 我们好好相处吧
- Sir!
- Class 746 here. Let's make a good team.

129
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,716
定不辱使命！
I won't let you down!

130
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,469
是！
Sir!

131
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,054
精神面貌不错！
You're full of spirit.

132
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,014
是！
Yes, sir!

133
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,225
是！
Yes!

134
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,854
好吃吗？
Enjoying your food?

135
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,274
我吃不下去
I couldn't eat.

136
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:30,027
那么多人被开枪杀死 血流成河
妈的 你还有胃口吗？
After seeing everyone get shot dead,
you still have a damn appetite?

137
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,322
那个币也一样毁了我的人生
That crypto ruined my life too.

138
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,409
所以我也为了赚钱来到了这里
That's why I'm here, to make money.

139
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,288
没错 钱 你可要多赚点
That's right.
You'd better make a lot of money.

140
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,498
你这个混蛋 因为那个该死的币
Because of that damn coin,

141
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:47,837
我靠说唱辛苦赚的钱
损失了超过五亿
I lost over 500 million won, the money
I earned from busting my ass rapping.

142
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,171
我损失三亿
I lost 300 million.

143
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,801
你要想还上那么多钱
游戏好好玩 要赚很多钱才行
You'd better win the games
and make a load of money to pay us back.

144
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,846
知道了 你可以让开了吗？我要吃饭…
I get it. Can you go away now?
I'm trying to eat--

145
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,725
你这个小混蛋 吃得那么专注
You little shit,
eating like a fucking pig.

146
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,310
还给我
Give it back.

147
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,227
我不给呢？
No.

148
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,689
你那么想吃吗？
You want to eat this so badly?

149
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,483
我萨诺斯喂你吃
Then Thanos will feed you.

150
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,780
好吃吧？
Good, isn't it?

151
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,577
- 你这个混蛋
- 喂 王八蛋
- You motherfucker.
- Son of a bitch.

152
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,746
- 你这个混蛋
- 别闹了
- You asshole.
- Knock it off.

153
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,372
- 白痴
- 放手！
Fucking asshole.

154
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,084
兔崽子！
Son of a bitch.

155
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,920
我因为你损失了多少钱？你个混蛋
I lost all that money
because of you, fucker.

156
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,215
- 兔崽子！
- 哥 让我也打一下
- You piece of shit.
- Let me get in there.

157
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,092
- 妈的…
- 喂
- You son of a bitch.
- Hey.

158
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,260
你让开
Step aside.

159
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,514
别人给你饭 就要心存感激吃掉！
Be grateful and fucking eat
what you're given!

160
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,018
年轻就是好
鬼门关走了一遭 居然还有力气
It's good to be young.
They still have the energy to do that.

161
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,563
这样下去会严重受伤的
应该有人阻拦一下 不是吗？
He might get really hurt.
Someone should stop them.

162
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,648
就是啊
I know.

163
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,400
我吗？
Me?

164
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,325
孩子们 吃饭时间 你们干什么呢？
Boys, what are you doing
in the middle of mealtime?

165
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,035
吃饭的时候不能打架
No fights during mealtime.

166
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,579
有这么多长辈在场 太没有礼貌了
There are elders present.
Mind your manners.

167
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,456
而且还是两个欺负一个
And two against one?

168
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,376
不觉得丢脸吗？
Aren't you embarrassed?

169
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,796
你也进来这里了
怎么好意思教训我？
You're lecturing me
when you ended up in this shithole too?

170
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,550
大叔 不要随便站出来管闲事
Dude, stop running your mouth

171
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,011
回家管好你自己的孩子吧
and take care of your own damn kids.

172
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,889
你说什么？
What did you just say?

173
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,851
你那些教训人的话
留着对你自己的孩子说去吧
I said save the lecture
for your own damn kid.

174
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,728
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

175
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,196
啊 等一下
Wait.

176
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,288
我错了
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,750
求您饶了我吧
Please…

178
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,922
求您饶了我
Let me go.

179
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,558
- 太帅了！
- 帅气！
- Great! You're the man!
- Nice!

180
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,603
好帅！
That was cool!

181
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,820
那位朋友什么来头？
What is he?

182
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,239
也是海军陆战队的吗？
Is he an ex-Marine too?

183
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,042
今天的工作全部完成了
<i>The day's work has been completed.</i>

184
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:36,130
请全体员工回到自己的宿舍休息
<i>All soldiers,</i>
<i>please return to your quarters.</i>

185
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,607
娜妍！
Na-yeon!

186
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,819
你是监护人吗？
Are you with her?

187
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,237
对 我是她爸爸
<i>Yes, I'm her father.</i>

188
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,364
麻烦快点送她去西贤大学医院
<i>Please take her</i>
<i>to Seohyeon University Hospital.</i>

189
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,928
解我的孽缘和恩怨…
Dissolve my karmic ties and grievances…

190
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,204
妈 睡了吗？
Mom, are you asleep?

191
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,594
老婆 我错了
Honey, I'm sorry.

192
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,392
对不起 别打我
I'm sorry.

193
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,771
先生
Excuse me.

194
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,234
如果您还没睡 我们可以聊聊吗？
If you're still up,
can we have a little talk?

195
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,112
啊 好
Sure.

196
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,415
我刚才说话有点过分了
我想道歉 对不起
I think I was out of line before.
I'd like to apologize. I'm sorry.

197
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,834
没事 没有
No, that's okay.

198
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,547
我把责任都推到您头上了
I laid all the blame on you.

199
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,092
是我过分了
I was out of line.

200
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,436
我老婆病得很重
My wife is very sick.

201
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,442
得了急性肝硬化
需要做肝脏移植手术
She has acute cirrhosis.
She needs a liver transplant.

202
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,613
但是在医院接受检查的时候
But when she was going through the tests,

203
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,116
我们得知她肚子里有了孩子
we found out she was pregnant.

204
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,203
医生建议终止妊娠
The doctor suggested a termination,

205
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,956
但她不听
but she won't listen.

206
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,043
说就算死 也要把孩子生下来
Says she'll give birth
even if it kills her.

207
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,172
我老婆固执得很
You see, my wife is stubborn.

208
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,592
她太固执了 我一次都没能说服过她
I've never been able
to change her mind about anything.

209
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,974
我们一直在努力寻找肝捐献者
她的情况越来越糟
We were struggling to find a donor,
and her condition was getting worse.

210
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,728
能借来的钱 全都借来了
I borrowed as much money as I could,

211
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,397
但还是不够
but it still wasn't enough.

212
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,278
我太着急了
有一个我认识很久的客户
I was desperate.
Then one of my oldest vendors

213
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,865
听说了我的情况 提出要帮忙
heard about my situation
and offered to help.

214
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,201
我管对方借了一点钱
So I borrowed money from them.

215
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,665
结果被认为这是贿赂 出了问题
But people saw it as a bribe,

216
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,877
我被单位辞退了
and I got fired from my job.

217
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,131
我的整个青春都奉献给了那里
I had devoted my entire youth to it.

218
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:13,138
这个游戏是我最后的希望
These games were my last hope.

219
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,727
我也知道
I get it.

220
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,399
456号先生说的话是什么意思
I know what
you were trying to say, Mr. 456.

221
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,528
那是一笔什么钱
What that money represents.

222
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,491
可是我…
But I…

223
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,914
真的很需要那笔钱
I really need that money,

224
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,958
即使知道那是别人的买命钱
even if it's blood money.

225
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,127
我也想用那笔钱…
I need that money…

226
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:59,852
救我老婆和孩子
to save my wife and our child.

227
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,874
盖上
Close up.

228
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,626
怎么了？没什么可用的？
Why? Nothing usable?

229
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:35,888
搞什么？
What the hell?

230
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,933
只有这个吗？剩下的呢？
This is it? Where's the rest?

231
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,019
脏器已经受损了
The organs were not viable.

232
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,022
死得太久了 能挽救的只有眼睛了
Dead too long.
Only the eyes were salvageable.

233
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,858
我不是说了吗？
尽量先把有呼吸的带过来
I told you to bring live ones.

234
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,694
你在说什么？我明明
故意打偏了好几个人
What are you talking about?
I missed on purpose.

235
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,281
有人又在脑袋上开了一枪
确保给打死了
Someone shot them again
to make sure they died.

236
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,953
那个人也是
That guy too.

237
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,500
腿部中弹
但有人又朝他的头开了一枪
He was shot in the leg,
but someone shot him again in the head.

238
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,089
是谁干的？
Who's doing this?

239
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,525
认证通过
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

240
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,155
部队长 这里是手术室
<i>Sir. Reporting from the operating room.</i>

241
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,615
怎么样了？
How did it go?

242
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,704
大部分人头部
或者心脏中弹 当场死亡
<i>Most players were shot in the head</i>
<i>or chest and died on the spot.</i>

243
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,749
有人对当时还有呼吸的人
又开了一枪 确保死亡
<i>Someone shot those who were still alive</i>
<i>a second time to confirm the kill.</i>

244
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,751
基本没有什么可以用的商品
<i>We only got a few usable products.</i>

245
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,589
是谁干的？
Who did that?

246
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,426
好像是11号
Number 011, I think.

247
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,206
11号
Number 011.

248
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,878
部队长叫你
Officer wants to see you.

249
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,712
认证通过
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

250
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,417
您叫我吗？
You wanted to see me, sir?

251
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,212
摘下面具
Mask off.

252
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,556
我告诉过你
就算不想帮忙 也不要妨碍
I told you not to interfere
if you're not going to help.

253
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,732
听说你对那些还有呼吸的人
又开了一枪 确保对方死亡？
I hear you shot them a second time
to make sure they died.

254
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,944
我只是在做我该做的工作
I was just doing my job.

255
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,991
你跟我…
How long…

256
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,369
认识多久了？
have we known each other?

257
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,705
我不太记得了
I don't quite remember.

258
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,872
我记得…
If I remember correctly…

259
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,756
应该已经有七年了
it's been about seven years.

260
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,721
我第一次去见你的时候
When I first went to see you,

261
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:52,019
你在破烂的病房里
像尸体一样呆呆躺在那里看着空中
you were staring at the ceiling
like a corpse in that cheap hospital room.

262
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,273
你就带着一支狙击枪
把追击你的人全杀了
I couldn't believe you had taken out
the entire pursuit unit

263
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,235
自己一个人冲破了休战线边界
跑到了南边来 我简直不敢相信
and made your way
to the demarcation line by yourself.

264
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,161
你那个样子 让我很心疼
I felt bad for you.

265
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,417
我想再给你一次可以活下去的机会
I wanted to give you a second chance.

266
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,295
我一直心存感激
I've always been grateful to you.

267
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,672
那就照我说的做
Then do what I tell you.

268
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,549
我不想
I do not wish to.

269
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,304
你怕队长发现吗？
Are you afraid the captain might find out?

270
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,475
那个你不用担心
You don't have to worry about that.

271
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,103
上次我们让一名玩家
通过帮我们进行手术来换取游戏信息
We made a mistake last time
and had a player do the operations

272
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,605
结果出了问题
in exchange for game info.

273
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,733
这次我们直接请了外面的医生
This time, we hired a doctor from outside.

274
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,361
不会被发现 就算被发现…
So he will never find out,
and even if he does--

275
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,362
不是那个问题
It's not about that.

276
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,946
那是什么问题？
Then what is it about?

277
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:09,554
我们第一次见面时
你说想找你留在北边的孩子 对吧？
When we first met, you said you wanted
to find the child you left behind.

278
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,308
你说为了能找到孩子
愿意做任何吩咐给你的事
You said you'd do anything.

279
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,147
莫非你改变心意了？
Did you have a change of heart?

280
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,112
第一次来找我的时候
When you first came to me,

281
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,531
您对我说 我在这里的工作是
you said my job here would be

282
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,495
帮助那些没有活下去希望的人
让他们毫无痛苦地安息
helping those who feel hopeless
by putting them out of their misery.

283
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,459
我信了您的话
为了做那份工作 来到了这里
I trusted you.
That's what I came here to do.

284
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,672
改变的人是您
You're the one who has changed.

285
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,218
反正那些人已经死了
Those people are going to die anyway.

286
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,472
用那些人的器官去救能救活的人
We're just using their organs
to save others.

287
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,808
有什么错？
What's wrong with that?

288
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,354
如果没有其他指示 我就回去了
If there are no further orders,
I'd like to be excused.

289
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,124
（首尔道峰警察局）
SEOUL DOBONG POLICE STATION

290
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,635
哟 黄刑警 好久不见了？
Hey, Hwang. It's been a while.

291
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,100
喂 黄俊昊！
Hwang Jun-ho!

292
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,312
你个臭小子
一句话都没跟上级说 就递了辞呈？
You handed in your resignation
without a word to me?

293
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,856
联系你也不接电话
你跑到哪里去了？
Then you went MIA.
Where the hell have you been?

294
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:46,443
为了把你的辞职改成休假
你知道我怎么向所长苦苦哀求的吗？
Do you know how much I had to beg
to change it to a leave of absence?

295
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,945
班长 您说完了吗？
Chief, are you finished?

296
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,946
什么？
What?

297
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,156
那就帮帮我吧
Please help me.

298
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,368
喂 我还能怎么帮你？
Look, what else
could I possibly do for you?

299
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,454
跟你一起去找那个岛吗 臭小子？
You want me to look
for that island with you?

300
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:58,872
对
Yes.

301
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,082
疯子
For God's sake.

302
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,335
必须马上开始搜查
We must start the search immediately.

303
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:07,214
再拖下去 不只是成奇勋先生
进入游戏的所有人都会有危险
Otherwise, Mr. Seong Gi-hun
and everyone else there will be in danger.

304
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,759
这个话题我们不是已经讨论完了吗？
Haven't we already finished
discussing this?

305
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,720
所长 现在的情况跟当时不同了
Sir, things have changed since then.

306
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,766
如果我们现在不阻止
以后可能再也没有机会了
If we don't stop them now,
we may not get another chance.

307
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,725
金班长
Chief Kim.

308
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,643
是
Yes, sir.

309
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,896
这孩子又怎么了？不是说好多了吗？
What's gotten into him this time?
You said he was doing better.

310
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,359
俊昊 你继续接受心理治疗吧
没什么好丢脸的
Jun-ho, go back to therapy.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

311
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,485
所长！
Sir!

312
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,279
您真的要放任那些人死掉吗？
Are you really going to let
those people die?

313
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,574
你这小子胡说八道已经多少年了！
You've been talking about
this shit for years now!

314
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,826
那你带着证据来啊 小子！
If it's true, bring me evidence!

315
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,622
警察是讲证据的 证据！
The police work with evidence!

316
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,963
你处理黄刑警的辞职申请吧
Process his resignation.

317
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,589
已经无药可救了
He's beyond help now.

318
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,132
不是 所长…
But, sir…

319
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,220
真是疯了 喂
Damn it. Hey!

320
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,391
我告诉你了 让你别来吧
你现在没办法复职了 小子！
I told you this was a bad idea.
You'll never be able to come back now.

321
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:04,145
所长！我会确保他接受心理治疗！
好吗？所长 等我一下！
Sir! I'll make sure
he goes back to therapy! Please wait!

322
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,857
看到了吗？我跟你说什么了？
警察根本帮不上忙
See? What did I tell you?
Police are never helpful.

323
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:12,112
我们自己来吧
两支队伍同时搜索 也许有机会

324
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:12,112
We'll do it ourselves. If we split into
two teams, we might have a chance.

325
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,324
嗯 朴船长找认识的人
为我们准备了另一艘船
Yeah.
Captain Park got another boat for us,

326
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,995
又联系了一些搜索的人手
把他们分成了两个搜索小队
and we also got more men.

327
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,036
<i>We divided them into two search teams.</i>

328
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,162
好 很好
Okay, good.

329
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,583
游戏已经开始了
我们剩下的时间最多只有五天
If the games have begun,
we only have five days at most.

330
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,834
必须尽快行动
We've got to move fast.

331
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,085
知道了
Got it.

332
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,046
我们已经准备好了
等天气放晴 马上可以行动
We're all set to go
once the weather clears up.

333
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,506
你来的路上小心
I'll see you soon.

334
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,769
放松一下 喝一杯
反正今天也不能出海了
Have a drink and relax.
We can't set sail today anyway.

335
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,653
船长 您确定我们明天
可以开船出去吗？
Captain. Are you sure we can go tomorrow?

336
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,573
我看天气预报 明天的天气也不太好
Tomorrow's weather forecast
isn't looking good either.

337
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,827
我已经航海30年了
Look.

338
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,827
I've been sailing for 30 years.

339
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,498
跟那些坐在桌前
整天盯着电脑的人相比
You think those guys who sit
in front of their computers all day

340
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,083
我不是更了解大海吗？
know the seas better than me?

341
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,795
那么如果明天不能开船出海
船长您可要负全责
I'll blame you
if we can't set sail tomorrow, then.

342
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,840
着什么急 嗯？
What's the rush?

343
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,217
找了两年 都没有找到的岛
We've been trying to find
that island for two years.

344
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,552
现在怎么能突然找到？
How will you find it now?

345
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:22,724
其实这个是秘密
所以我不能告诉你太多细节
Well, this is a secret,
so I can't really tell you in detail.

346
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,437
但我们的一个朋友
被抓到了那个岛上
But one of our friends
has been taken to that island.

347
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,483
玩过游戏的那个朋友？
The one who was there before?

348
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:32,942
嗯？
What?

349
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:38,156
等一下 成社长的故事您都听说了？
Wait, you know about Mr. Seong?

350
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,368
黄刑警给我讲了个大概
Hwang gave me a rough idea.

351
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:45,330
哎呀 那我可以跟您说啊
All right, then. I can just tell you.

352
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:51,044
他叫成奇勋 是之前的游戏赢家
His name is Seong Gi-hun.
He's a previous winner of the game.

353
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,338
他想找那些混蛋报仇
He wanted to get back at those bastards,

354
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:57,050
在这里放了一个定位追踪器
故意让自己被带到岛上去了
so he put a GPS tracker in here
and let them take him to the island.

355
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,886
但是不知道怎么走漏了消息
But I don't know how the intel leaked.

356
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,431
那么 黄刑警说的事情全都是真的？
So everything Hwang told me was true?

357
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,724
嗯！
Yeah!

358
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,436
我只是因为救了黄刑警
I just helped him look for the island

359
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,605
跟着他一起找那个岛
because I rescued the guy from the water.

360
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,901
哎 但他说的话我不信
But, come on,
I couldn't believe what he was saying.

361
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,486
什么游戏、奖金、几百亿…
About the games, the money, and--

362
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:20,323
船长 我一开始也像您一样不信
Captain, I didn't believe it
at first either.

363
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,035
但那些人是真的存在
But they really do exist.

364
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,538
我看到了那些面具人
Those masked men. I saw them.

365
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,499
那些家伙在俱乐部
用电击枪打了我脖子
They zapped me with a stun gun at a club.

366
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,252
面具人用电击枪打人？
Masked men with stun guns?

367
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,169
嗯！
Yeah!

368
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:37,674
所以你才带了这么多人来
So that's why you brought all those men.

369
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,593
我去了
Damn.

370
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,306
那眼神像鲨鱼 杀气腾腾
They look so intimidating.
Like a bunch of sharks.

371
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,852
那些家伙是特别残忍的人
We're dealing with
some brutal bastards here.

372
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,937
我大哥也在找那些人…
My boss was looking for them, and…

373
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,403
反正 您现在跟我们
在同一条船上了 好吗？
Anyway, you're now
in the same boat as us, okay?

374
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,613
同生共死
We live or die together.

375
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,782
为什么要死？
Nobody is going to die.

376
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,286
我开那艘船已经十年了 好吗？
I've been sailing that boat for ten years.

377
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,122
那艘船连小事故都没有过
Never seen any trouble.

378
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,999
在船上摔倒的人都没有过
No one's even tripped once.

379
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,670
好 那就全靠船长了
All right. I'll count on you then.

380
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,217
欢迎各位来到第二项游戏
<i>Welcome to your second game.</i>

381
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,351
三角形是最简单的 对吧？
So the triangle is the easiest one?

382
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,771
对
Yes.

383
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,542
喂 这怎么会是三角形？
Hey. How's that a triangle?

384
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,461
连我们海军陆战队都做不到这样！
Even we Marines couldn't do that!

385
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,758
这是里面最简单的？
This is supposed to be the easiest one?

386
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,301
哎哟 这是什么啊？
What the heck is that?

387
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,304
这家伙会害死我们所有人的！
This guy is going to get us all killed!

388
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,430
- 喂！
- 不是…
- Hey!
- I…

389
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:11,142
你能负全责吗？你要怎么负责？
What are you going to do,
take responsibility for this?

390
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,228
- 这个…
- 你不是说你赢过嘛！
You said you won!

391
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,270
不是说你做过吗？
You said you've done it!

392
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,855
- 你要怎么负责？
- 不是…
- No, I…
- What are you going to do?

393
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,357
你要怎么负责？
How will you take responsibility?

394
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,111
你要负责！负责！
Do something!

395
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,655
不是！
I… I just…

396
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,765
瞧你这副惨样
Look at you.

397
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,436
纯熙
Jun-hee.

398
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,355
这么说你是真的没看到我？
So you really had no clue?

399
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,567
我以为你看到了 故意不理我呢
I thought you were just ignoring me.

400
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:05,154
也对 你眼里始终只有自己
Well, you've always been self-absorbed.

401
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,990
你怎么会在这里？
Why are you here?

402
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,199
你忘了吗？
Have you forgotten?

403
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,912
你也叫我买那个币了
You told me to buy that coin too.

404
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,672
你…
You…

405
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,800
看来这件事你没忘
Oh, you haven't forgotten about this.

406
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,970
你没去堕胎吗？我们说好了要打掉的
You didn't get rid of it? We agreed.

407
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,223
我要留着
I'm keeping it.

408
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,476
现在怎么生孩子、养孩子？没有钱啊
How can you raise a baby
without any money?

409
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,978
我要赚钱
I'm going to make money.

410
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,023
我要赚钱 把债还了 找个房子
I'm going to make money,
pay off my debt, and get a place for us.

411
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,403
反正这个孩子没有爸爸养
妈妈总要赚钱吧
This baby has no father,
so its mom needs to make money.

412
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,322
所以你为了赚钱来了这里？
That's why you're here? To make money?

413
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,950
你现在这个身体
要怎么在这里坚持下去？
How the hell will you survive here
in your condition?

414
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,620
我不会找你负责 你就别演了
I'm not going to ask for your help,
so drop the act.

415
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,289
特别不像你
It doesn't suit you.

416
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,084
你是为说这话来找我的？
That's what you came to say?

417
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,879
不是 我是来参观你挨打的脸的
No, I came to take a look
at your beat-up face.

418
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,758
看着爽
Serves you right.

419
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,598
重要公告

426
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,589
奇勋
Gi-hun.

427
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,841
三角形
Triangle.

428
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,136
无条件相信你 朋友

429
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,429
哦
Yeah.

430
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,906
那是什么？
What's that?

431
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,366
你不需要知道
You don't need to know.

432
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,244
该去玩游戏了
It's time to play the game.

433
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,172
三角形
Triangle.

434
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:57,243

438
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,593
本项为团体游戏
<i>This game will be played in teams.</i>

439
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,804
十分钟内 请分成五人一组
<i>Please divide into teams of five</i>
<i>in the next ten minutes.</i>

440
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,057
达固那是团队游戏吗？
Is <i>Dalgona </i>a team game?

441
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,226
不是玩达固那吗？
Aren't we playing the <i>Dalgona </i>game?

442
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,646
对 好像不是
No, it doesn't look like it.

443
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,190
那会是什么？
What's the game then?

444
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,233
我也不知道
I'm not sure.

445
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,819
什么鬼？不是说你以前都玩过吗？
What? You said you'd done this before.

446
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,322
不是说三角形是最简单的吗？
胡说八道的？
That triangle was the easiest.
Was that all bullshit?

447
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,325
对不起
I'm sorry.

448
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,326
道歉就完了？
Sorry won't cut it!

449
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,204
说得好像你什么都知道似的
You talked like you knew everything.

450
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:44,123
大家都信了你的鬼话
你让这里的其他人怎么办？
All these people believed your bullshit.
What are you going to do?

451
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,833
你能负责吗？
Will you take responsibility?

452
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,587
您还是适可而止吧
That's enough.

453
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,175
请大家选择队伍
<i>Please divide into teams now.</i>

454
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,970
对啊 别说了
Yeah, just drop it.

455
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,181
您跟那个疯子有什么好费口舌的？
Don't waste your time
talking to this nutjob.

456
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,934
我们精神正常的人错信了他
是我们的错
We shouldn't have fallen for his nonsense.

457
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,938
来吧 先组队吧
Jesus. Come on, let's form a team first.

458
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,774
还说自己赢过？疯子！
Previous winner? Damn lunatic!

459
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,777
达固那 三角形？发神经
<i>Dalgona</i>? Triangle? Screw you.

460
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,989
大哥 先跟我一起吧
How about teaming up with me?

461
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,158
怎么回事？
What's going on?

462
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,162
- 不是达固那吗？
- 嗯？嗯 好像不是
- It's not the <i>Dalgona </i>game?
- No, I don't think so.

463
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,831
那我们怎么办？
What do we do then?

464
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,415
走吧
Let's go.

465
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,583
去哪里？
Go where?

466
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,921
我们也要组队
不快点组队 就进不去好的队伍了
We've got to get a move on
if we want to join a good team.

467
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,467
对不起
I'm sorry.

468
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,053
但我还是相信您
I still trust you.

469
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:45,059
如果您不介意
这个游戏我想跟您一起玩
I'd like to play the game with you,
if that's okay?

470
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:49,230
就是 虽然不知道玩什么
不要害怕 试一试吧
All right. Let's be real men
and give it a shot.

471
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,817
反正都是小孩子的游戏
我们以前每天都玩
It's a children's game, right?
We used to play games all the time.

472
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,280
没错 各位大哥 我跟你们一起
That's right, sirs. I'll join you.

473
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,241
跟各位大哥一起
感觉做什么都能成功
I feel like I can do anything with you.

474
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,618
不愧是我们海军陆战队
That's the Marine spirit.

475
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,706
擒魔捉妖的海军陆战队
搞什么达固那抠糖 多丢脸？
It'd be embarrassing for brave Marines
to be carving <i>Dalgona </i>anyway.

476
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,792
既然要玩这个游戏
就要拼上性命来一局
If we're playing a game,
it should be worth risking our lives for.

477
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,129
比如跳大马
或者鱿鱼游戏那种 对吧？
Like Buck Buck or the Squid Game, right?

478
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:17,300
是！我也一样 一定会拼命努力
Yes! I will certainly
risk my life to win, sir.

479
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,387
那现在只要再找一个人就好了
We only need one more person then.

480
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,849
大哥 交给我吧 我去找
Leave it to me, sir. I'll go find someone.

481
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,269
好吧 那就找一个
愿意拼上性命去赢的人来
All right, then.
Get someone who'd risk their life to win.

482
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,146
是 必胜！
Yes, sir! Victory at all costs!

483
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,190
行动
Go.

484
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,206
纯熙
Jun-hee.

485
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,753
跟我一组吧
Let's team up.

486
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,670
不用
No.

487
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,339
你也必须加入一个队伍
You have to join a team.

488
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,423
我不想跟你一起
Not with you.

489
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,925
不要逞强
Stop trying to act tough.

490
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,344
你这个身体状况
觉得有队伍会要你吗？
Do you think
anyone would want a pregnant girl?

491
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,055
不用你管 我自己会想办法
Mind your own business.
I can take care of myself.

492
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,973
没能联系你 对不起
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

493
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,268
但我也过得很辛苦
But I had a tough time too.

494
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,772
你也知道 到处都有想把我抓住
想把我杀了和想找我麻烦的人
You know that
all those people were out to kill me.

495
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:16,275
半年的时间里 电话、短信全都不回
我还以为你死了呢
You completely ignored me for six months.
I thought you were dead.

496
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,985
知道了 是我对不起你
All right, I'm sorry.

497
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,488
所以我们一起组队吧
Now, let's team up.

498
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,367
你要先从这里活着出去 才有机会
决定孩子要不要生下来 不是吗？
You can't have the baby
unless you make it out of here alive.

499
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,662
我不相信你
I don't trust you.

500
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,374
在我心里 你已经死了
You're dead to me.

501
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,430
- 喂 那个
- 那个人怎么样？
Over there. How about him?

502
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,100
- 因为他跑得很快？
- 嗯
- Because he can run fast?
- Yeah.

503
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,310
也有可能不快 你看他的腿…
I told you. It may not be a race…

504
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,730
如果你们还需要一个人 我可以…
If you need one more person, I could…

505
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,697
我们不用了
No, we're good.

506
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,421
请问
Excuse me.

507
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,595
您愿意和我组队吗？
Would you like to team up with me?

508
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,643
- 如果需要力气 我们来就行
- 打扰一下
- If it's about strength, we've got it, so…
- Excuse me.

509
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,854
如果你们需要两个人
我们能加入吗？
If you need two people, can we join you?

510
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,107
当然了 那太好了
Sure. That'd be great.

511
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,900
另一个人呢？
Where's the other person?

512
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,075
不好意思 我们要找的不是这种
I'm sorry. You're not the kind
of people we're looking for.

513
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,369
好
All right.

514
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,540
如果您甩掉那个老太太 我们就带您
We'll take you if you ditch the old lady.

515
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,085
不是老太太 是我妈
The old lady is my mom.

516
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,636
容植 你自己去加入他们
妈妈自己会想办法 嗯？
Yong-sik, you should join them.

517
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,636
I'll find a team on my own.

518
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,098
啊 妈！你别胡说八道了
Mom! Don't be ridiculous now.

519
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:18,064
妈 你的气势哪里去了 嗯？
Mom, why do you look so down?
You're a tough cookie.

520
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,192
来 抬起头
让我看看你眼中强烈的气势！嗯？
Keep your head up.
Let me see that fire in your eyes!

521
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,445
拿出你平时骂我的样子
Just be yourself
when you're letting me have it.

522
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:28,157
混蛋小子 怎么能让妈妈瞪大眼睛
You little brat.
How dare you take that tone with me?

523
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,493
- 发什么神经！你个臭小子
- 对 就是这样
- You've got some nerve!
- There you go.

524
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,661
这才是我妈
There's my mom.

525
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,247

为什么？
Well, why should I?

533
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,853

Don't you know who he is?

<i>Your goal is to win all the mini-games</i>

582
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:45,396
五分钟内冲过终点线即为成功
<i>and cross the finish line in five minutes.</i>

583
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:49,483
- 请各团队决定每个任务的玩家

What are you good at?

585
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,367
喂 幸好我们选了个女生 是吧？
It's good that we got a woman.

586
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,661
你会抓石子吧？
You can play <i>Gong-gi</i>, right?

587
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,667
现在女生都不玩抓石子了吗？
Don't girls play <i>Gong-gi </i>anymore?

588
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,503
一次都没玩过
I've never played it.

589
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,421

海军陆战队员玩抓石子？
You? An ex-Marine?

593
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,142
我们家四个女孩一个男孩 我最小
跟几个姐姐玩了很多次
I grew up with four older sisters.

594
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,103
从小就时不时一起玩

from time to time.

595
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,400
没错 海军陆战队
怎么会有不擅长的事？
That's right.
There's nothing a Marine can't do.

596
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,154
其他人都说说 对哪个游戏有信心
Everyone else,
what game are you confident playing?

597

我会打画片
<i>Ddakji </i>for me<i>.</i>

598
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,576
我在地铁站跟那个男的打画片的时候
我赢的次数比他多
At the subway station,
I won more times than the guy.

I'm good at throwing.

603
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,881
那就剩下毽子和陀螺了
That leaves <i>Jegi </i>and Spinning Top.

604

啊 那个…您的朋友那样叫您
我也不知不觉这样叫了
Oh, your friend was calling you
by your name, so I thought I'd try it.

609
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,858
您介意吗？
Does it bother you?

610
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,237
没有 没关系
No, it's fine.

611

With Spinning Top,
it'll take even longer if you mess up.

您真的会转陀螺吗？

如果您没有自信 可以跟我换…

decide where I go.

We should have left!

大家全都要死了！
We're all going to die
because of those who voted to continue!

717
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,822
现在要怎么办？
What are you going to do now?

718
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,575
- 你们自己能成功吗？
- 那些人都是你们害死的
- You think you can survive?
- Look at them!

719
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,576
怎么了？
- What?
- You killed them.

720
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,578
- 都是你们害死的
- 能不能…

721
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,622
Can you…
Can you please give me one of those?

722
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,622
那个 您也给我一点不行吗？

723
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,665
- “那个”？
- 您刚才吃那个
- "Those"?
- The thing you took.

724
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,251
您藏在十字架里的那个东西
You're keeping them inside your cross.

725
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,339
我不知道你在说什么鬼
I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

726
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,550
如果我紧张 输了游戏 我们都会死
If I get nervous
and lose the game, we'll all die.

727
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,054
现在我的手很抖
My hands are shaking like crazy.

728
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,931
- 重要公告
- 喂 南秀
<i>- Attention, please.</i>
- Nam-su.

729
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,057
- 各位玩家…
- 是南奎
- <i>Players.</i>
- It's Nam-gyu.

730
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:46,394
- …清理场地期间 请耐心等待
- 喂 南奎
- Right. Nam-gyu.
- <i>Please wait while we tidy up the venue.</i>

731
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,396
你知道这是什么吗？
Do you know what this is?

732
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,108
摇头丸？氯胺酮？
Ecstasy? Ketamine?

733
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:56,113
这是新合成的品种 超级疯狂
兄弟 你吃了根本受不了
It's a new kind. It's fucking crazy, man.
You can't handle it.

734
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,322
大哥
Hey.

735
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,703
我在俱乐部做事的时候
基本全都见识过了
I did all kinds of stuff
when I was working at the club.

736
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:08,583
而且哥来俱乐部的时候
我还往您的房间送过这种东西
I even brought you some
when you came to the club.

737
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,133
你这个瘾君子
You junkie.

738
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,391
看什么？
What?

739
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,601
没什么
Nothing.

740
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,396
你叫什么名字来着？
What's your name again?

741
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,898
我叫敏秀
It's Min-su.

742
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:32,816
敏秀
Min-su.

743
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,903
敏秀 李舜臣将军说过什么？
Min-su. What's that famous quote
by Admiral Yi Sun-sin?

744
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:42,242
“幸生则死 必死则生”
"Those seeking life shall croak.
Those seeking death shall live."

745
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:47,122
所以大家不要害怕 抱着必死的心态
“我死了也没关系”的心态进行游戏
So don't be scared. Just tell yourself
that you don't care if you die.

746
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:50,333
那么就能一起活下去 赢到钱 走出去
Then we'll survive, win the money,
and get the fuck out.

747
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,879
喂 你自己好好表现吧
Hey, mind your own business.

748
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,547
我？
Me?

749
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,757
对 就是你 你的手倒是别抖啊
Yes, you. Mr. Shaky Hands.

750
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,678
说话态度怎么这么晦气？
所以我就说不该选女的
What's with the attitude?

751
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,596
We shouldn't have picked a girl.
She's got an attitude.

752
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,556
- 晦气
- 真是个白痴

753
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,057
You're a prick
who had to pop a pill for his nerves.

754
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,057
怕到乱吃药的白痴

755
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,058
该死的女人
Fucking bitch.

756
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,438

这是命令
That's an order.

760
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,784
请救救我
Please don't…

761
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,016
接下来两队 请准备
<i>The next teams, please get ready.</i>

762
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,448
你看着我
Look at me.

767
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:05,176
刚才英美跟我说话的时候
我一眼就看出来了
Young-mi, when you spoke to me earlier,
I could tell right away.

768
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,929
您是一个多么勇敢的人
I could tell how brave you are.

769
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,017
所以 英美也要相信自己才行
So you've got to believe in yourself.

770
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,644
能做到吗？
Can you do that?

771
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,190
我尽量
I'll try.

772
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,905
没错 我张金子
经历了朝鲜战争都坚持活了下来
That's right. I, Jang Geum-ja,
survived the Korean War.

773
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,117
这只是孩子们的游戏
我不会死在里面
I will not die playing some kids' games.

774
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,788
我们打起精神 一起加油
Everyone.
Let's pull ourselves together and do this.

775
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,667
我是在朝鲜战争中
幸存下来的张金子的儿子
I'm the son of Ms. Jang Geum-ja,
who survived the Korean War.

776
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,669
朴容植
I'm Park Yong-sik.

777
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,882
阿姨 您叫什么名字？
Ma'am, what's your name?

778
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,052
我叫仙女
I'm Seon-nyeo,

779
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,679
龙宫仙女
shaman of the sea.

780
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,355
我相信我们一定可以的
I believe we can do this.

781
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,941
我们要展示给后面的人看
Let's show everyone else here

782
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:07,113
这个游戏根本不算什么
that these games are no big deal.

783

<i>- Teams three and four, get ready.</i>
