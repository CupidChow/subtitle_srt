1
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:30,530
你这样要去哪里？你应该无处可去吧
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

2
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,530
<i>You've got no place to go.</i>

3
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:44,169
别像鬼祟的老鼠一样躲起来耍我
有本事出来见我
Don't hide like a sneaky little rat.
Show yourself.

4
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,296
你应该上那架飞机的
<i>You should have gotten on that plane.</i>

5
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,507
你会后悔这个选择的
<i>You will regret your decision.</i>

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,510
我一定会找到你
I'm going to find you.

7
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,305
不惜一切代价
No matter what it takes.

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,568
您去哪里？
Where to, sir?

9
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,325
去首尔
To Seoul, please.

10
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,910
好
All right.

11
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,440
不好意思…
I'm sorry, but…

12
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,612
可以五分钟之后再过来吗？
could you give me five minutes?

13
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,738
俊昊
Jun-ho.

14
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,035
俊昊 你醒了吗？
Jun-ho, can you hear me?

15
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,583
医生！请过来看看！
Doctor! I need a doctor in here!

16
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,628
我儿子睁开眼睛了！
My son just opened his eyes!

17
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,505
哥
In-ho.

2 YEARS LATER

22
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,040
搞什么？
What the hell?

23
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,961
你没戴安全头盔 请出示驾照
You're not wearing a helmet.
Your license, please.

24
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,631
该死 这不是钓鱼执法吗？
Damn it. Isn't this entrapment?

25
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,800
警察这么卑鄙地藏起来
Hiding to catch people is shady.

26
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,261
从贫苦辛劳的市民手里抢钱呢
You want to squeeze money
out of broke citizens?

27
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,345
请出示驾照
Your license, please.

28
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,766
你等一下
Hold on.

29
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,229
警察叔叔 不能放过我们一次吗？
你看我戴了呢
Look, can't you just let us go?
I'm wearing one.

30
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,939
不行
No, ma'am.

31
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,944
哥哥 你好帅啊
Hey, you're really hot.

32
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,863
我会起诉你妨碍公务
I could charge you with obstruction.

33
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,532
天啊 这么强硬
You're a tough cookie.

34
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,958
哥哥 一起来 嗯？
Come on, get in here.

35
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,296
拍得真好
Damn, great picture.

36
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,549
不戴安全帽罚款两万韩元
请在期限内缴清
The fine for not wearing a helmet
is 20,000 won. Pay it on time.

37
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,426
哥哥 我能把这张照片发到网上吗？
Hey, can I post this picture online?

38
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,803
你有照片墙吗？我们互关吧 嗯？
Are you on Instagram?
Let's follow each other!

39
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,389
哥哥 你去哪里？
Where are you going?

40
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,058
哥哥 你去哪里？一起走啊！
Hey! Where are you going? What about me?

41
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,771
你可以让
那个死条子用他的警车送你！
You can ask that stupid pig
for a ride in his patrol car!

42
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,483
喂！
Hey!

43
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,277
喂 你这个混蛋！
You asshole!

44
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,278
可恶！
Damn it!

45
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,614
喂 黄俊昊！
Hwang Jun-ho!

46
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,746
你这臭小子 调来这里
是为了听别人叫你“蠢猪”的吗？
Is this why you transferred here?
To be called a "stupid pig"?

47
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,540
班长
Chief.

48
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,002
您喜欢给腌萝卜和洋葱加醋吗？
Do you like vinegar on these?

49
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,839
时间太久了
我都不太记得你的口味了
It's been so long, I can't quite remember.

50
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,677
俊昊 别在外面浪费时间了
回到重案组吧
Jun-ho, stop wasting your time out here.
Come back to the Major Crimes Division.

51
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,431
啊 洋葱不放醋 腌萝卜放 对吧？
Wait, not on the onions.
Just on the pickled radish, right?

52
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,061
哎哟 你这臭小子
到现在还没消气吗？
For God's sake, are you still brooding?

53
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,772
喂 我真的能做的都做了
Look, I've tried.

54
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,232
一有机会就向上级反映
I've made enough appeals
to the authorities,

55
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,651
海警也在那边
跨越边境搜索了好多天
and I had the coast guard
search the area for days.

56
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,905
是 我知道 快吃您的炸酱面吧
一会儿都没有嚼劲了
I know. Just eat your noodles
before they get soggy.

57
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:10,453
喂 我真的很想相信你说的
不对 我相信
Listen.

58
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,160
I want to believe you.

59
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,453
No, I do believe you.

60
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,539
但你说发过来的照片
我们一张都没收到
But we never got those photos
you said you sent.

61
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,377
你的手机也掉进海里了
你又不记得那个岛的位置
Your phone is at the bottom of the sea,
and you don't know where that island is.

62
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,631
你说你看到的那个杀人游戏
Those games you said you saw,
where people got killed?

63
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,175
我想让上面的人相信
I've tried to make
the higher-ups believe it,

64
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,428
但没有什么证据啊
but there's just not enough evidence.

65
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,641
唯一的证据是你肩膀上那颗根本
无法追查的子弹 你觉得充足吗？
The only evidence is
the untraceable bullet in your shoulder.

66
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,687
再加上你小子那么武断
拿着枪就一个人行动去了
And let me remind you, smart-ass.
You went rogue with a gun

67
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,816
突然出现就变成植物人了
and suddenly turned up at death's door.

68
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,734
我之前没告诉你
I haven't told you this before,

69
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,237
当时你醒过来的时候
but when you woke up,

70
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,615
上面准备解雇你了
我费了很大周章才给拦下来
they were ready to fire you,
and I went out of my way to stop them.

71
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,409
是 忠诚
Right, thank you.

72
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,246
以后我会一辈子
把您当成恩人对待 长官
I'll be forever indebted to you, sir.

73
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,790
你这个玩世不恭的臭小子 真是的
You sarcastic little shit.

74
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,543
喂 我们是警察
Look, we're the police.

75
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,963
消防员用水灭火 而警察
Firemen fight fire with water,
and the police--

76
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,215
“用证据打击犯罪”
"Fight crime with evidence."

77
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,636
我知道 所以我现在才去做交警了
I know. That's why I work in traffic now.

78
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,349
交警这里
证据总是非常确凿的 好吗？
You see,
we always have clear evidence here.

79
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,686
闯红灯 超速 没戴头盔…
Running red lights,
speeding, not wearing a helmet…

80
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,148
监控拍得清清楚楚
犯事的人根本没办法狡辩
Our evidence is there in pictures.
No one can dispute it.

81
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,070
俊昊 你真的不记得了吗？
Jun-ho, do you really not remember

82
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,906
朝你开枪的人是谁？
who shot you?

83
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,077
不记得
No.

84
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,082
（首尔钟路警察局 玉人派出所）

85
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,160
哥
In-ho.

86
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,206
跟我走吧
Come with me.

87
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,459
哥 你为什么会…
In-ho, why…

88
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,763
要去哪里啊？
Where are we going?

89
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,556
哦 这里有一家汽车旅馆
Look, there's a motel here.

90
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,599
这里？
Here?

91
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,518
搞什么？
What?

92
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,146
社长
Excuse me.

93
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,483
不在吗？
Is anyone there?

94
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,277
不做生意了吗？
Are you open or what?

95
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,321
社长
Hello?

96
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:54,992
哥哥 一定要来这里吗？好脏乱啊
Babe, do we have to stay here?

97
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,992
Looks like a dump.

98
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,705
灯也关了 真不做生意了？
The lights are off too. Are they closed?

99
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,167
那正好 灯不亮说明房间满了
我们去别的地方吧
Good. No lights means the rooms are full.
Let's go someplace else.

100
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,003
你怎么知道的？
How do you know that?

101
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:07,922
在哪里学来的？
Who told you?

102
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,424
干吗刨根问底的？就是知道呗
Do you have to ask? I just know.

103
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,594
就是知道？你是汽车旅馆专家吗？
You just know?
What are you, a motel expert?

104
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,472
怎么了？废物
Seriously? You're a dick.

105
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,517
- “废”…
- 不是说喜欢我懂得多吗？
- "A dick"…
- You said you liked how I knew everything.

106
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,896
喂 你到底是怎么知道的？
前男友教的吗？
<i>Just tell me how you knew.</i>
<i>Did your ex-boyfriend tell you?</i>

107
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,939
滚吧！
<i>Get lost!</i>

108
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,983
喂 你回答一下嘛！不好意思了吗？
<i>Why can't you answer me?</i>

109
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,851
你是谁？
Who's there?

110
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,134
456号
Player 456.

111
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,054
你在找这些吗？
Looking for these?

112
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,912
是我
<i>It's me.</i>

113
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,967
我给你买了点药和粥
身体感觉怎么样？
I got you some food and medicine.
How are you feeling?

114
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,553
我没事
I'm fine.

115
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,431
你现在气色一点都不好
Come on, you don't look any better.

116
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,767
我不是告诉你 不要太勉强自己吗？
I told you not to overdo it, didn't I?

117
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,770
你这样 还没等找到那家伙
就先筋疲力尽了
You'll burn yourself out
before you find that guy.

118
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,689
怎么样了？
How did it go?

119
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,443
今天我们检查了
一、二、三、四号线所有的地铁站
We checked all the subway stations
on Lines 1 to 4 today.

120
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,196
又是毫无收获
But again, nothing.

121
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,158
搜查时间呢？
Time of search?

122
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,035
从上午10点到晚上10点
From 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

123
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,331
除去午餐和晚餐休息一小时
饭都是轮流吃的
We took one-hour lunch and dinner breaks.
We take turns eating.

124
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,838
是不是他知道你盯上他了
换到别的地方去了？
What if he knows you're onto him
and he's gone somewhere else?

125
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,967
都已经过去两年了
我们那么找 连个影子都没看到
We've been searching for two years
but found no trace of him.

126
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:04,390
明天加派更多人手
从早上第一班车到最后一班车搜索
Tomorrow, get more men, extend the search.
From the first train to the last.

127
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,560
同时搜查所有地铁线路
Check all the lines at the same time.

128
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,395
所有线路同时搜查？
All the lines at the same time?

129
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,775
不过 要做到那种程度
Pulling off something that extensive

130
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,486
人工费可不少呢
would mean shelling out
a ton of money on staff.

131
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,627
我接到那张名片
就是三年前的这个时候
I was approached by him three years ago,
around this time of year.

132
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,882
如果那个游戏还在继续举办
If the game is still going on,

133
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,010
他现在一定在招募参加的人
he's recruiting players right now.

134
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:49,310
如果错过现在这个机会
说不定还要再等一年
It may take another year
if we don't find him now.

135
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,482
好… 我知道了
Yeah… Okay, I got it.

136
00:12:54,565 --> 00:13:00,070
我这次一定帮你找到 一定
I… I'll make sure to find him this time.

137
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,070
I promise.

138
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,620
- 宇锡
- 嗯
- Woo-seok.
- Yeah.

139
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,749
从明天开始再多叫点人手
From tomorrow,
we're going to need more people.

140
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,211
啊？要叫多少？
What? But how many more?

141
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,463
把所有能联系上的人都拉来
Just call everyone you know.

142
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,300
而且要从早上六点开始
- But--
- Also, we start at 6 a.m.

143
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,094
晚上不要喝酒 早点回家休息
So don't stay out drinking.
Go home and get some sleep.

144
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,931
早上六点？谁会大清早玩打画片…
At 6 a.m.? Who'd play <i>ddakji </i>at--

145
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:31,352
不过大哥 我怎么想都觉得不合常理…
Come on. Boss. I've thought about it,
but it just doesn't make any sense--

146
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,897
不对 肯定有什么事
No. I'm sure something is going on.

147
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,776
你也知道 这几年里
欠我钱的那些家伙
As you know, most of the people
who owe me money

148
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,694
几乎全都毫无痕迹地消失了
have disappeared over the last few years.

149
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,738
本金和利息一分都没拿回来 妈的
- I never got any money back…
- Okay.

150
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,866
所以你觉得那些欠你钱的人
被带到了某个岛上
So you think everyone who owes you money
was taken to some island

151
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,244
玩儿童游戏的时候被杀了
这说得通吗…
and got killed playing kiddie games.
That sounds--

152
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,287
妈的 谁说我相信那家伙说的话了？
Goddamnit, I barely believe a word,

153
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,456
我是为了赚钱！
but I'm doing this for the money!

154
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,045
毕竟成奇勋那家伙主动来找我
If Seong Gi-hun hadn't come to me himself

155
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,131
把债还清了 雇我做这份工作 我才能
to pay off his debt
and hired me for this job,

156
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,218
在这些年付给你们所有人工资
让生意维持下去 知道了吗？
I couldn't have paid you all
or kept the business running.

157
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,135
我知道…
I know that, but--

158
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,013
知道就闭嘴 明天清晨开始
睁大眼睛好好找
Then shut up and search
with your eyes wide open.

159
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:08,931
好
Okay.

160
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,851
如果我们找到打画片那个混蛋
If we find that bastard with the <i>ddakji</i>,

161
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,770
会得到十亿韩元的报酬
we will get a one-billion won reward.

162
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,230
- 十亿？
- 十亿？
One billion?

163
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,567
对 十亿 怎么了？嗯？
现在愿意相信他的话了？
That's right.
Do you want to believe his story now?

164
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,776
- 不是…
- 我啊！
- But--
- Tell you what.

165
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:25,072
无论谁找到那个人
我直接把钱分他一半 好吗？
Whoever finds the guy,
I'll give you half the money. Okay?

166
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,533
- 五亿？
- 没错！
- So 500 million?
- That's right!

167
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,368
等一下 那赶紧回去睡吧
Well, what are we waiting for?

168
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,620
赚五亿！
Five hundred million won!

169
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,533

Captain.

170
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,451
哦 你来了？
Hello.

171
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,162
最近过得好吗？
How have you been?

172
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,497
我一直都是那样呗
Same old, same old.

173
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,879
天气好的时候 就抓鱼
天气不好的时候 就抓起酒瓶
When the weather is good, I catch fish.
When it's bad, I catch a buzz.

174
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:26,300
我们朴船长每天喝酒
脸色看起来还是这么好
You still look great for someone
who drinks every day, Captain Park.

175
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,636
废话少说 穿上这个
Save it and put this on.

176
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,013
今天也要出发去找那座神秘的岛
We've got a mystery island to find.

177
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,938
今天我要带你去哪里 黄船长？
Where can I take you today, Captain Hwang?

178
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,232
一年半的时间里
能去看的所有地方都去过了
We've checked pretty much everywhere
over the past year and a half,

179
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,361
你说还想继续找
我都不知道还能带你去哪里
but you want to keep going,
and I don't know where else to take you.

180
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,822
你在哪里 神秘岛？
Where are you, mystery island?

181
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,533
这段时间我们去看过的地方里面
Some places couldn't be checked properly
because of the conditions or tide changes.

182
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,037
因为天气状况 或者没算好潮汐时间
没能过去好好看过的地方

183
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,373
我重新筛选了一下
I've narrowed them down.

184
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,834
我们今天就去这里吧
Let's try here today.

185

哎呀 我为什么
要救这个掉进水里的家伙
Man, why did I have to save a drowning man

187
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:12,012
给自己找这些麻烦？哎呀 我命好苦

I pity myself.

然后递出一张这样的名片
he gives them a card like this.

198
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,387
太远了 看不清

in this weather.

那片水域有漩涡
There are whirlpools in that area.

265

那里就算开着大船
都不一定能安全通过
No one ever really goes there,
not even the big boats.

我那天为什么要把黄警官救出来
Why did I have to pull you
out of the water that day

270
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,256
不赚钱 还冒着生命危险做这种事？
and end up risking my life
doing this shit for nothing?

271
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,884
我一直很感激您
I'm forever grateful.

272
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,594
黄警官 你知道我救你那个地方
Do you know how many islands there are

273
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,971
方圆10公里内有多少个岛吗？
within a 6-mile radius
of where I found you?

274
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,306
有好几百个
There are hundreds.

275
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,141
而且那里的洋流很强
And the currents are strong out there.

276
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:34,728
你抓着那个浮标漂了多远
根本没办法知道了
There's no telling how far
you drifted with that buoy.

277
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,357
好 先不说玩游戏的那个岛
You can't even remember which island
you fell from,

278
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,443
你连中枪后从哪个岛堕海
都完全不记得了
let alone the island
where they play the games.

279
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,737
要怎么找到那里呢？
So how in the world would we find it?

280
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,407
所以还是不要再找了吧
You're right. It's time to stop.

281
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,494
能做的都已经做了
We've done enough.

282
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,210
虽然你这样说
但我知道 你下周还会来 对吧？
You say that now,
but I know you'll be back next week.

283

Thank you for saving my life

一直到现在都在帮我找小岛
and helping me look for the island.

285
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,135
我一定会想办法报答您的恩情
I promise I'll find a way to repay you.

286
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,597
恩情什么啊？
You don't have to do that.

287
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,354
你突然不再来了 我还有点失落
I'm sad to hear that
you won't be coming back.

288
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,606
我会时不时来看看您的
I'll come visit from time to time.

289
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,153
好 有机会跟我一起去抓鱿鱼吧？
All right.
Come and catch squid with me, okay?

290
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,365
现在找到好船员像摘星星一样难
It's so hard to find good crew members
these days.

291
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,159
我给你比警察月薪更高的薪水
I'll pay you more than
what you make as an officer.

292
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,787
能给多少钱？
Oh, how much?

293
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,291
等我们回到港口 一边喝酒一边聊
Well, let's talk about that over a drink
when we get back.

294
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,794
港口就在前面了
There's the port.

295
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,297
防护门即将打开
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

296
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,640
列车即将关门
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

297
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:58,019
- 哎哟 哎
- 哎
There.

298
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,317
哥 这样也太过分了吧
You've got to be kidding me with this.

299
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,195
现在工地的苦力工人
都能好好吃上一顿呢
Even construction workers
get proper food these days.

300
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,698
我们就吃这个 真是的…
This is just… Damn.

301
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,366
你这小子
You little…

302
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,287
喂 大夏天的 你都不知道
自己这样赚钱多么凉快舒服
You're making easy money down here
in the middle of summer.

303
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,747
还说没有好好填饱肚子
Count your blessings.

304
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,209
喂 你这臭小子
那你去外面工地干活啊
You idiot.
Go work at a construction site then.

305
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,632
不过话说
Seriously though.

306
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,011
大哥你真的相信成奇勋说的那些吗？
How much of Seong Gi-hun's story
do you actually believe?

307
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,637
从一号线到机场线
We've been searching every subway station
in the city all summer,

308
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,764
我们的人整个夏天
把所有地方都跑遍了

309
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,266
都没找到呢
but no one's ever seen the guy.

310
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,477
我
Here's the thing.

311
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,189
- 因为好奇 思考了一下
- 嗯
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

312
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,691
成奇勋那小子再怎么有病
Seong Gi-hun may be crazy,

313
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:50,447
也不会为了找一个根本不存在的家伙
浪费几十亿 做到这种地步
but he wouldn't waste billions
looking for someone who doesn't exist.

314
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,949
肯定有什么事情
He's onto something for sure.

315
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:58,205
哥 我们已经在地铁站里跑了两年了
Come on, boss. We've been searching
these stations for the past two years.

316
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,291
不是一天两天 是整整两年
Not days, years. Two whole years.

317
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,296
我老婆跟我说
一定要找到那个混蛋 让我参加游戏
My wife says I should find that bastard,
get myself into the game,

318
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,007
带456亿韩元回家
and bring home 45.6 billion won.

319
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,385
如果真的有人在这里玩打画片
我们应该早就找到…
If someone were playing <i>ddakji </i>down here,
we would've found him--

320
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,360
太好了！
Yes!

321
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,055
喂
Hello?

322
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,099
成社长 找到那个家伙了
<i>We've found the guy. It's him.</i>

323
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,477
确定吗？
Are you sure?

324
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,188
打画片 打耳光 给钱
跟你说的一模一样
<i>The </i>ddakji<i>, slapping, and money.</i>
<i>It's just like you said.</i>

325
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,191
哦 他现在给对方名片了
He's handing over the card now.

326
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,487
请问您在哪里？
Where are you?

327
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,864
在钟阁站 但他要走了
Jonggak Station, but he's leaving.

328
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,991
我马上出发
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

329
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,160
小心跟着他 持续告诉我他的位置
Follow him carefully,
and keep me updated on his location.

330
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,205
在我赶到之前 千万不要跟丢了
<i>Stay on him until I get there.</i>

331
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,082
知道了 随时保持联系
I got it. I'll be in touch.

啊？100张刮刮乐？
I'm sorry? A hundred scratchers?

342
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,834
看来昨晚做了好梦
Good dreams last night?

343
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,242
嗯 他现在进了塔谷公园
Hey. He's gone into Tapgol Park.

344
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,493
我正在赶过去
<i>I'm heading there now.</i>

345
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,954

您看起来很挣扎
过着没有未来的生活

living a life with no future.

350

351
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,583

A gift?

359
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,208

What the hell do you think he's doing?

360
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,710
就是啊
I don't know.

361
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,839
我都快以为他是好人了
Maybe he's a good guy. I'm confused.

362
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,907
（很遗憾！）
SORRY!

363
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,367

364
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,459
（很遗憾！）

365
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,593
哎呀！
Damn it.

366
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,469

喂 他怎么不给我们？
How come he's not giving us one?

369
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,209
就是啊 我昨晚做了个好梦呢
Beats me.
Man, I had a lucky dream last night.

370
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,938
他在干什么？
What is he doing?

371
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,692
哎呀 这么珍贵的东西 为什么扔掉？
Why would you throw away
perfectly good food like that?

372
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,451
我给过您机会 您做出了选择
I gave you a chance,
and you made your choice.

373
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,997
把这些面包扔掉的人不是我
I'm not the one who threw these away.

374

是你们
It was you, ladies and gentlemen.

375
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,263
他这是干什么？
What's wrong with him?

肯定要么是求情 让你放过一马
They'll either beg you to let it slide

381
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,171
要么是抱怨我们躲起来
给市民开罚单抢钱
or complain about us hiding
to give people tickets.

382
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,425
不要太强硬 但也不要听信他们说的
Don't be unkind,
but don't listen to them go on about it.

383
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,094

392
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,152

I'll be there soon.

394
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,406
这家伙真是个疯子
<i>This guy is a total nutcase.</i>

我会随时告诉你位置 快点来！
<i>He's in a cab now.</i>
<i>I'll keep you updated, but hurry!</i>

396
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,453

The fine for speeding is 60,000 won.
Make sure--

398
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,388
怎么这么快？按流程办了吗？
That was quick.
Did you do everything right?

399
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,392
对 他什么都没说
拿着罚单就开车走了
Well, he just took the ticket
and drove off without saying anything.

400
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,603
不是什么可疑的人吧？
核查身份了吗？
That's suspicious. Did you run his ID?

401
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,939
什么都没发现
Nothing came up.

402
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,275
但他是做什么的啊？
I don't know what he does,

403
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,945
车里有很多手机和平板电脑
but he had a lot of cell phones
and tablets in his car.

404
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,577

Hey, we might lose him if we wait.
Let's just get him by ourselves.

415
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,947
- 我们俩吗？
- 对 你害怕吗？
- By ourselves?
- That's right. Are you scared?

416
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,657
我们两个人抓他一个
It's two against one.

417
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,409
你这小子 结婚了 舍不得冒险吗？
Don't be a coward now you're married.

418
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,120
不是因为那个 那家伙感觉有点可怕
It's just that
something seems off with that guy.

419
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,497
而且成社长也说 等他来了再说
Besides, Seong told us
to wait until he gets here.

420
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,626
那万一我们跟丢了呢？
成社长不给我们奖金了怎么办？
But what if we lose him?
What if Seong doesn't give us the money?

421
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,544
宇锡 十亿韩元啊！
Woo-seok. It's a billion won!

422

其中五亿会给我 对吧？
You'll give me half, right?

423
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,552
喂 你信不过我吗？
我还主持了你的婚礼呢
Don't you trust me?
I officiated your wedding, for God's sake.

424
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,642
走
Come on.

425
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,899

454
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,099

I'll place one bullet into a revolver
and close it.

455
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,644

不是新大方 是大方！
I said Daebang Station, you idiot.
Not Sindaebang.

498
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,417
啊 你个笨蛋 要我说几次才能听懂！
Don't make me
keep repeating myself, blockhead.

499
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,253
对 快点叫大家集合 该死的！

would be to thank you for it.

00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,333
让我见见他 我有话要说
Let me meet him. I have something to say.

522
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,463
您跟我说吧 我会转达
Give me the message,
and I'll pass it along.

523
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:53,050
不是能对你这样的小人物下属说的话
It's not something I can discuss
with an underling like you.

524
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,428
利用别人陷入困境的人生
You prey on people
who are hanging by a thread

525
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:59,097
在地铁站耍花招骗他们
and con them at subway stations.

526
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,935

能理解我想说的话吗？

to understand what I'm trying to say.

How do you think I got to where I am now?

529
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,868
你怎么变成了他们的狗
我一点都不关心
I don't care how you became their dog.

530
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,039
把你的主人带过来
Bring me your master.

531
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,132
我年轻的时候在游戏现场
I used to work in the games
when I was younger.

532
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:39,262
将无数像您这样的人的尸体搬走烧掉
I removed and burned the bodies
of countless people like you.

533
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,849
“他们不是人
"These things aren't human."

534
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:48,146
他们只是
在这个世界上毫无用处的垃圾”
"They're just trash,
utterly useless in this world."

535
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,442
我一直这样告诉自己
努力工作了几年
I kept telling myself that
and worked hard for a few years.

536
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,862
然后他们给了我一把枪
Then they gave me a gun.

537
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,742
感觉还不赖
It felt pretty good.

538
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:06,164
感觉好像我的存在第一次得到了认可
Like my existence was acknowledged
for the first time in my life.

539
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,087
不记得那是哪一年了
I don't know which year it was,
but one day,

540
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,134
我正要开枪打一个被游戏淘汰的人
I was about to shoot a man
who had lost a game.

541
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,848
这家伙好像有点眼熟
The guy seemed familiar.

542
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,226
您知道是谁吗？
Guess who it was.

543
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,521
我爸
My dad.

544
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,445
我爸突然站在了我面前
My dad was suddenly
standing right in front of me.

545
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:43,702
我爸泪流满面
那么诚恳地求我饶他一命
He was in tears,
desperately begging me to spare his life.

546
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,833
我朝他的额头正中间开了一枪
这时候我突然明白
I shot him right in the middle
of his forehead, and realized,

547
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,543
“啊
"Ah."

548
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,840
这份工作太适合我了”
"I'm cut out for this job."

549
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,096
不管你在里面开枪
Whether you shoot people in there

550
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,893
还是在外面用赌局骗人
没有什么区别
or con them outside,
it doesn't change anything.

551
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,481
你一直都…
You have always been…

552
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,195
只不过是那些人的狗而已
nothing more than their dog.

553
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,197
成奇勋先生
Mr. Seong.

554
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:27,329
您赢了那个游戏
就以为自己很特别了吗？
Do you think you're special
because you won the game?

555
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,124
你这样的人
Someone like you

556
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,252
永远不会知道…
could never know…

557
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,173
永远无法理解
or understand

558
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,929
我在那里是怎么活着熬出来的
how I made it out of there alive.

559
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,308
玩那个游戏…
And how it feels…

560
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,063
是什么心情
to play the games.

561
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,035
跟我玩个游戏吧
Let's play a game.

562
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:24,928
我相信您在电影里看过
叫俄罗斯轮盘赌
I'm sure you've seen this in the movies.
It's called Russian Roulette.

563
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:29,140
通常把一颗子弹放进枪里 旋转弹仓
Usually, you place one bullet in the gun,
spin the cylinder,

564
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,226
扣动扳机
and pull the trigger.

565
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:37,357
在下一轮之前 再转一次弹仓
And before the next round,
you spin the cylinder again.

566
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,611
把概率重新设置为六分之一
It resets the odds back to 1 in 6.

567
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,073
但我想让这个游戏更严肃一点
But I'd like to make
this game a little more serious.

568
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,952
因为成奇勋先生您很特别
Because you're special, Mr. Seong.

569
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,829
废话少说
Cut to the chase.

570
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:56,751
我们不重新转动弹仓 轮流扣动扳机
We'll take turns pulling the trigger
without spinning the cylinder again.

571
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:00,422
那么六次之内 子弹就会射出
就可以分清胜负了
The bullet will be fired within
six attempts, and the game will be over.

572
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,508
怎么样？
What do you say?

573
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,275
我一直想知道
I've always wondered

574
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,737
您是怎么从那里活着出来的
how you made it out of there alive.

575
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,200
首先打画片的水平就不怎么样
For one thing,
you were even terrible at <i>ddakji</i>.

576
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,038
怎么了？
What's the matter?

577
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,374
现在想法变多了吗？
Is your mind starting to race?

578
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,838
现在您的死亡几率是二分之一
Now your odds of death are 1 in 2.

579
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,882
概率确实很高
That's pretty high indeed.

580
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,261
多了一些害怕的想法也很自然
I'm sure you're afraid.
Lots going through your mind.

581
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:15,181
说不定您现在会这样想
Let me guess
what you're thinking right now.

582
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,102
“枪在我手上
"The gun is in my hand."

583
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,149
去他的游戏规则
只要扣动扳机一次或者两次
"Screw the rules.
Pull the trigger once or twice,

584
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,192
我就能打爆那个人的头”
and I can blow this guy's face off."

585
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,571
怎么样？没错吧？
Isn't that right?

586
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,783
您刚才说想见那个人 能见到的方法
If you want to meet the person
you mentioned earlier,

587
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,160
就在我口袋里
the key is in my pocket.

588
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,121
现在您用那把枪打我 就可以拿走了
You can simply shoot me
with that gun and take it.

589
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,707
只不过那样 您就要承认一件事
But I'll have you admit one thing.

590
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:50,049
你跟其他人一样 都是垃圾
That you're a piece of trash,
just like everyone else.

591
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:57,056
只是因为运气好
从垃圾堆里逃出来的垃圾
A piece of trash who got lucky
and made it out of the dumpster.

592
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:45,396
怎么了？想法变多了吗？
What's the matter?

593
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,605
Is your mind starting to race?

594
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,732
没错
That's right.

595
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,735
去他的规则
Screw the rules.

596
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,114
现在只要扣动一次扳机
Now, with a single pull of the trigger,

597
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,993
你就可以杀了我
you could kill me.

598
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,454
只不过那样…
But…

599
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,708
你就要承认一件事
I'll have you admit one thing.

600
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,463
你只是戴上面具
You put a mask over your face

601
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,133
照主人的吩咐做事
and do whatever your master says.

602
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,137
奔跑、狂吠
You run, bark,

603
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,599
对他们摇尾巴的…
and wag your tail for them.

604
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,855
一只狗而已
You're nothing more than their dog.

605
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:13,187
