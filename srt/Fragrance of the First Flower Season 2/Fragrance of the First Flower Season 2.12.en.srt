1
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,416
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:40,750
ONE YEAR LATER

3
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,708
Don't you think maternity clothes
these days

4
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:55,791
don't even look like maternity clothes?

5
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,541
Pick one of these two.

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,333
They're both so cute.

7
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,958
Can't I get both?

8
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,708
Alright then, both it is.

9
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,625
Hey.

10
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,500
- Hi.
- You're here.

11
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,500
Welcome, welcome.

12
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,000
The baby just woke up.

13
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,791
I brought a low-sugar cake.

14
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,083
- Perfect. I love sweets.
- Thank you.

15
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,208
- And a gift for the baby.
- Thanks.

16
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,750
Just put it over there.

17
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,750
Come on in.

18
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,916
Wanna see the baby?

19
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,375
Oh my gosh.

20
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,333
- So cute.
- Wow.

21
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,583
She keeps staring at you.

22
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,083
Yeah. Want to hold her?

23
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,833
- Can I?
- Of course.

24
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:53,916
Alright.

25
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,500
Hey there.

26
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,416
Hey there.

27
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,958
Hold your hands like this.

28
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:01,916
Good, just like that.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,583
Yeah, support her neck.

30
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,291
- She even looks a bit like you.
- So cute.

31
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,875
- Hi.
- She's so adorable.

32
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,291
- Hello.
- I'm Auntie Ting-Ting.

33
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,208
And this is Auntie Yi-Ming.

34
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,458
Just like Yu-Shan, she's a water sign too.

35
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,041
- Super emotional.
- I am not.

36
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,333
Oh, really?

37
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,041
In the delivery room,

38
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,416
who was crying their eyes out outside?

39
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,500
I just couldn't hold back my tears

40
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,208
seeing you go through so much.

41
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,708
She was in pain for five hours.

42
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,208
Alright, Miss Crybaby.

43
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,083
This little one is a night owl like me,

44
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,458
so she needs someone
to soothe her at night.

45
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,291
Hey, babe,

46
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,250
did you record my labor

47
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,583
and the times you soothed her?

48
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,083
When she misbehaves in the future,
you can play it all back for her.

49
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,916
You can't do that.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,166
I'm kidding.

51
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,500
She's smiling.

52
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,208
She's agreeing with her mom.

53
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,250
- Looks like she really likes you.
- Really?

54
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,833
Yeah, see? She's been smiling
at you this whole time.

55
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,916
Oops.

56
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,666
Yi-Ming Jiang.

57
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,125
Is that so?

58
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,833
Don't you think Jing-Chuan and Yu-Shan
are really happy like this,

59
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,500
with such an adorable baby?

60
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,125
Yeah.

61
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:52,208
Marrying someone you love
is truly a happy thing.

62
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,416
You can be happy with someone you love

63
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,458
without getting married too, though.

64
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,041
True.

65
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,000
But marriage is wonderful too.

66
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,958
It could be about
working together toward shared goals.

67
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,083
Ting-Ting Jhong,

68
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:16,208
do you remember saying once

69
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,375
that you didn't think marriage
was necessary?

70
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,750
- Did I?
- Yeah, you did.

71
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:35,750
But back then, I never thought
I'd be working full-time either.

72
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,875
Ideas change over time.

73
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,458
That's true.

74
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,416
So…

75
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,750
what do you think now?

76
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,541
I think…

77
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,416
marriage

78
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,083
or no marriage,

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,083
it doesn't matter.

80
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,458
What matters most is being happy together,

81
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,666
right?

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,125
Right.

83
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,750
Come on, let's go buy ingredients.

84
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,833
Wait for me.

85
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,208
- Ting-Ting Jhong.
- Ting-Ting Jhong.

86
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,291
What?

87
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,541
- Are you proposing?
- No.

88
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,583
No?

89
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,333
Then why are you looking at rings?
Aren't you?

90
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,666
Yeah.

91
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,125
- Hey.
- Wow, you're bold.

92
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,583
Just looking around.

93
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,250
What do you mean, "Just looking around"?

94
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,791
This isn't something to do casually.
Pick this one.

95
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,750
This one looks better.

96
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,750
No, this one's better.

97
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,250
Definitely this one,

98
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,416
and it's cheaper too.

99
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,708
Is cheaper the point?

100
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,416
No, the main point
is the thought behind it.

101
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,666
So it's okay if it's affordable, right?

102
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,666
Go on, choose this one.
Click "add to cart."

103
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,708
Alright, calm down.

104
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,375
I'm just browsing.

105
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,458
I'm telling you,

106
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,958
the way you propose matters
more than the ring style.

107
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,500
If you don't get it right,

108
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,333
you'll get nagged for life, like my dad.

109
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,625
Do you need help with it?

110
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,958
Do you want flowers, or balloons?

111
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,750
That's so tacky.

112
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,541
Then what? Come up with something.

113
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,125
I've got it.

114
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,083
What?

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,750
How about a street performance?

116
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,541
Then, play your bass,
the thing you're best at,

117
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,083
and in front of everyone,
pull out the ring.

118
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,875
Keel down and propose.

119
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,833
Me and Da-Jiao will grab some sparklers,

120
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,583
and create a dreamy effect with the smoke.

121
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,833
- So romantic.
- Not bad.

122
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,750
I don't think this is a good idea.

123
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,291
Why not?
We'll set it up perfectly for you.

124
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,041
You just seize the moment.

125
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,500
She won't say no.

126
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,041
I still think we need balloons,

127
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,708
just for a little decoration on the side.

128
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,250
Come on, stop teasing me.

129
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,750
What shape? Let's go with heart-shaped.

130
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:38,416
‪PLEASE SELECT A WIDTH

131
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,208
SPECIAL NEEDS

132
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,916
PLEASE SELECT THE HAMMERED TEXTURE

133
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,875
- Is that all that's left?
- It'll work.

134
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,541
- Take a look?
- Yeah, good.

135
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,458
How about the other stuff?
I'll check over there.

136
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,458
Is everyone here yet?

137
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,375
What's this?

138
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,666
We're all set. Got your ring ready?

139
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,500
Stop messing with me.

140
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,125
Oh, come on.

141
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,875
Here she comes.

142
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,458
Good luck. Good luck.

143
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,541
Hey, everyone.

144
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,125
We are Departed. I'm A-Kai, the guitarist,

145
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,041
this is Da-Jiao, our drummer,

146
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,916
and the most talented of Departed,
and our awesome bassist,

147
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,041
Ting-Ting Jhong.

148
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,041
Alright, I'll keep it short.

149
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:56,500
There are moments when music
speaks best to the heart.

150
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,208
Let's start our performance.

151
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,916
Hope you enjoy it.

152
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,666
Excuse us,

153
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,875
we'll take a five-minute break.

154
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,041
Feel free to take a short rest.

155
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,708
We'll be back soon with more great music.

156
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,541
What are you doing?

157
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,750
I'm not proposing here.

158
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,583
What do you mean, not proposing here?

159
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,333
She's not proposing here.

160
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,000
- Alright then…
- So, what now?

161
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:47,958
Just tell her directly.

162
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,625
- Okay, take a rest.
- You just…

163
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,708
Well, everyone,
let's all take a short break.

164
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,916
Excuse us.

165
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,125
Just a little break.

166
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,375
Are we still waiting?

167
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,583
- What's the plan now?
- It's a 5-minute break, didn't you hear?

168
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,708
BREAKFAST IS IN THE RICE COOKER.
SEE YOU LATER.

169
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,500
Mom.

170
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,250
Mom.

171
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,083
- Need a hand?
- No, no, it's fine.

172
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,375
What's up?

173
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,458
Just cutting onions.

174
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,500
Get out, don't get in the way here.

175
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,250
I'm in the way?

176
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,083
Yes, you're in the way.

177
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,833
Yi-Ming is helping here. You can go.

178
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,083
- This is really good.
- Delicious.

179
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,500
The bamboo shoots are so sweet.

180
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,875
They're really tasty.

181
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,083
The neighbor auntie gave me
a bunch of bamboo shoots and veggies.

182
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,458
Remember to take some home later.

183
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,041
- Alright.
- Auntie.

184
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,833
Make sure to keep some for yourself.

185
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,458
I did. She gives me so much
every couple of days.

186
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,916
I can't even finish it all.

187
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,041
That's so nice.

188
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,166
Young lady,

189
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,708
don't just sit there eating.

190
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,750
You keep leaving everything
to poor Yi-Ming.

191
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,083
You need to help out, you know that?

192
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,666
I am helping.

193
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,625
You are?

194
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,416
This whole spread was made by Yi-Ming.

195
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,208
And who told me I was in the way
and to leave earlier?

196
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,625
You are in the way.

197
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,750
Now, are you, as my mom,
just trying to give me a hard time?

198
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,000
Auntie, this fish is so fresh.

199
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,958
- Right? Tasty, huh?
- Right.

200
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,916
Next time,

201
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,333
I'll introduce you to the owner
of the fish stall.

202
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,583
Once he knows you,

203
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,291
he'll save the freshest fish for you.

204
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,708
Sounds great.

205
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:41,000
- Yi-Ming, eat up. Be sure to eat more.
- Okay.

206
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,083
Have you lost weight recently?

207
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,666
Mom, you think everyone looks thin.

208
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,875
No, I don't.

209
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,208
Auntie,

210
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,000
next time it's your turn to cook.

211
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,583
I want to taste your cooking too.

212
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,833
Alright, but you'll have to help.

213
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,500
Of course. You too.

214
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,708
You? Forget it.

215
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,375
No way, come on.

216
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,458
Mom, help me out here.

217
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,458
You?

218
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,250
- Forget it.
- Yep, forget it.

219
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,541
- Hey, you two.
- Forget it.

220
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,083
- It's still here.
- Yeah.

221
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,416
So, what made you want to come here today?

222
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,083
Just… wanted to take a walk.

223
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,666
Memories, you know? Senior.

224
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,000
Hey, look.

225
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:53,833
Yi-Ming,

226
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,208
from the first time I saw you
on the volleyball court,

227
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,500
I liked you. And even now,

228
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,833
I really cherish what we have.

229
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,416
Even though, between the two of us,

230
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,833
I've always been the immature one.

231
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,083
Why would you say that?

232
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,083
But it's true.

233
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:28,375
I used to say I'd take care of you,

234
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,833
and give you a home.

235
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,875
But honestly, I didn't even know
if that's what you really wanted.

236
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,041
I was just using the way
I thought love should be

237
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,333
to ask for a response from you.

238
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,708
Recently, I've learned a lot.

239
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,083
Turns out, loving someone

240
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,333
means letting go of so many expectations

241
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,458
and still feeling happy.

242
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,583
I don't need to become someone special,

243
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,166
and you don't need to do
anything special for me.

244
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,583
But we can both feel
that we're loved by each other.

245
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,291
Will you marry me?

246
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,625
Maybe marriage isn't something
necessary for you,

247
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,791
or it's something
you've already experienced.

248
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:40,083
But I want to do this,
not to prove anything to anyone,

249
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,166
but because I want to keep
walking this path

250
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,458
with you in the days to come.

251
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,500
I will.

252
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,708
"Is this the one you like?"

253
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,916
Let me put it on for you.

254
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,166
Thank you.

255
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,041
Thank you.

256
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,750
Stop working already.

257
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,375
What's up?

258
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:40,958
What are you doing?

259
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,041
It's my turn today.

260
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:45,833
You go rest.

261
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,958
Just take it easy today.

262
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,333
Watch TV, read a book,
or do whatever you like.

263
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,333
Really take a break, alright?

264
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:59,375
<i>Just a bean</i>

265
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,291
<i>You drink yours, I drink mine</i>

266
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:08,041
<i>The same complex taste</i>
<i>But a different love</i>

267
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:12,291
<i>These small differences</i>

268
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:19,791
<i>So ordinary, so beautiful</i>

269
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:23,708
<i>Of course, I'll argue with you</i>

270
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:26,916
<i>But after the silent treatment</i>
<i>We'll be honest again</i>

271
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,458
<i>Of course, I'll let you see</i>

272
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:34,250
<i>All my flaws</i>

273
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,791
<i>And I'll give you</i>

274
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,416
<i>The deepest, most unconditional love</i>

275
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:48,250
<i>As long as you remember my waiting</i>

276
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:54,416
<i>Can you remember?</i>

277
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,750
Excuse me, miss, is it for a gift?

278
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,666
Yes, for my girlfriend.

279
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,458
Take your time choosing.
Let me know if you need help.

280
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,291
- Thanks.
- No problem.

281
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,666
- Miss?
- Yes?

282
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,250
I'd like to see that one.

283
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,708
The one on the left?

284
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,083
Ting-Ting is great with kids.

285
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,375
Yeah, she's very patient with them.

286
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:52,500
Xiao-Zhe really likes her too.

287
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,583
I know this sounds a bit old-fashioned,

288
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,916
and I know you're reserved by nature,

289
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,666
but have you both thought about
the next step?

290
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,125
Marriage and all that?

291
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:12,333
That look says it all.

292
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,208
Yeah.

293
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,250
Have you picked out a name for your kid?

294
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,291
Changing the subject, huh?

295
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:21,625
Feels like…

296
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,333
marriage

297
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,708
or no marriage,

298
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,875
it doesn't really matter.

299
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,458
What matters is

300
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,333
that you're happy together, right?

301
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:41,208
Right.

302
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,750
Come on, let's go buy ingredients.

303
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:54,791
I'm wondering,

304
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,666
if I can marry Ting-Ting?

305
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:07,041
She's the one who showed me
that I can live the life I want.

306
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,250
She taught me to be brave.

307
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,250
Marriage is something
between the two of you.

308
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,791
As long as you're happy,
that's all that matters.

309
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,125
As a mom,

310
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,458
I can finally let go of this burden
on my shoulders.

311
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,666
I'll take care of her.

312
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,541
I'm counting on you.

313
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,875
Mom, need a hand?

314
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,208
No, no, it's fine.

315
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:39,625
What's up?

316
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:41,583
Just cutting onions.

317
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,708
Get out, don't get in the way.

318
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,041
Let me help you.

319
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:32,083
<i>Clothes drying on the small balcony</i>

320
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:36,250
<i>You wear yours, I wear mine</i>

321
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:42,375
<i>Carrying the same scent</i>
<i>To different places</i>

322
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:46,083
<i>Coming back a little different</i>

323
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:50,958
<i>Sitting side by side, sharing our day</i>

324
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:56,666
<i>The same day smells so natural</i>

325
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:03,708
<i>So simple, so easy</i>
