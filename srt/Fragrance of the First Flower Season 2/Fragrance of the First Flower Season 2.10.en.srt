1
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,833
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,375
What's wrong?

3
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,625
If you want to say something, go ahead.

4
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,333
I really like you.

5
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,083
Knowing that there's someone
who understands me, supporting me,

6
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,000
that feeling is very comforting.

7
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,125
But the way I like you
is just as a friend.

8
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,750
Why waste your time on someone

9
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,833
who won't even meet you?

10
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,583
Did you see her the other day?

11
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,166
Yeah, I saw her.

12
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,541
But even if she wasn't around,
I still wouldn't be with you.

13
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,166
Why?

14
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,500
I think you're great.

15
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,750
Honestly, on my way here today,
I felt conflicted.

16
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,166
I don't want to lose you as a friend,

17
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,083
but I know

18
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,333
what I'm about to say will hurt you.

19
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,083
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,625
It's okay.

21
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,333
What about you?

22
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,083
Are you doing alright?

23
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,875
I'm fine.

24
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,041
Let's just leave it

25
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,000
at that for today.

26
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,500
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,916
Mom?

28
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,958
What are you doing back?

29
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,041
It's so late.

30
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,541
You called me yourself,

31
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,541
and I need to give you
your living expenses.

32
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,041
Of course, I had to come see
your grateful expression.

33
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,875
Sending it by transfer
would've been too easy on you.

34
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,666
Hey, kid,

35
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,500
have you been any trouble

36
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,041
to Yi-Ming's family since you moved in?

37
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,708
No, not at all.

38
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,958
Alright, alright.

39
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,000
If everything's fine, get some rest.

40
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,750
You have work tomorrow.
I just don't want you staying up too late.

41
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,958
Oh.

42
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,541
Can I sleep here tonight?

43
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,458
Oh.

44
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,333
- Here?
- Yeah.

45
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,583
Help me stick this on, please.

46
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,208
I can never reach it.

47
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,541
- It hurts right here.
- I'll be gentle.

48
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,208
The bag I bought you
is meant to be used, you know.

49
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,833
Look at it,
sitting there with the tag still on.

50
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,375
I'm out there running my little business.

51
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,333
What do I need such a fancy bag for?

52
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,666
Feeling better?

53
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,875
You should go out shopping sometime.

54
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,916
I've got a stable income now.

55
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,208
It's not much yet,

56
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,500
but it's enough to help you out.

57
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,208
You can take a few days off
from the market stall, right?

58
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,916
How much do you even make in a month?

59
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,708
You've got rent, and food,

60
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,458
if you don't save up a bit,
how can I not worry about you?

61
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,625
I'm doing just fine.
Why are you worrying about me?

62
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,041
Since you were little, I've worried about
whether you've eaten enough,

63
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,666
whether you've slept enough.

64
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,541
When you got older, I worried about

65
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,791
whether you were doing well in school,

66
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,541
whether you pass the exams.

67
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,083
And now that you're an adult,
I still worry about

68
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,500
whether you're making enough money.

69
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,625
- Whether you're too tired.
- I'm good.

70
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,666
Aren't you worrying about
the same things every day?

71
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,250
Whether I'm eaten enough,

72
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,833
and whether I've slept enough.

73
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,500
Ask Yi-Ming.

74
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,250
She's a mother.
She'll understand what I'm talking about.

75
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,208
Who says you have to be a mom
to understand?

76
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,166
You're not a mom.

77
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,500
You don't have a husband or kids.

78
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,833
You live alone,

79
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,708
and just get by in life.

80
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,750
How can you compare to others?

81
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,000
You don't get it.

82
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,791
That's not true. How can you say that?

83
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,250
Okay.

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,916
Right, you young people nowadays,

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,500
are all into this "no marriage" thing.

86
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,791
Alright. Time for bed.

87
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,125
Let me ask you something.

88
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,000
After Dad passed away,
why didn't you ever date again?

89
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,208
Why ask me that all of a sudden? Gosh…

90
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm serious.

91
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:26,291
You have no idea how clingy
and troublesome you were as a kid.

92
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,833
I didn't have time to think about it.

93
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,333
But having another person
would've helped you out, right?

94
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,958
Things aren't that simple.

95
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,583
And besides, there are some things

96
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,833
outsiders can't understand
in just a day or two.

97
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,791
Did you have a fight with Yi-Ming?

98
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,000
No.

99
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,791
No?

100
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,625
Then why are you here tonight?

101
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,250
Living together creates more friction,

102
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,750
even good friends as roommates

103
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,125
need to talk things through.

104
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,833
Mom.

105
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,083
Are you saying I'm nagging again?

106
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,500
- Alright, alright.
- No, no.

107
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,916
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

108
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,083
Yi-Ming isn't just my roommate.

109
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,291
I like her.

110
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,458
I like Yi-Ming. I'm in love with her.

111
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,916
I'm going to sleep now.

112
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,583
Good night.

113
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,458
Excuse me…

114
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,083
Do you really have to sneak around
just to give me something?

115
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,666
Is your cold getting better?

116
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,125
Here, eat this.

117
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,166
Can we stop pretending everything's fine?

118
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,625
I'm sorry.

119
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,250
You know I'm not asking for
an apology, right?

120
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,750
I know.

121
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,708
A lot of times
I haven't really understood you.

122
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,208
I never thought we could be together,

123
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,916
so all I focused on was

124
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,541
trying to protect this relationship.

125
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,500
But I've realized
I can't take care of everything.

126
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,916
You know?

127
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,625
At first, when you told me

128
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,000
you wanted to carry the burden with me,

129
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,333
I thought,

130
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,625
I'm so lucky.

131
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,833
But at the same time, I was really scared.

132
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,250
I was afraid you'd
have to carry my expectations.

133
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,875
I thought that

134
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,000
after the divorce, I'd become braver,

135
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,375
that I wouldn't let you down,

136
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,583
wouldn't let myself down,

137
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,833
and wouldn't let this relationship down.

138
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,833
But in the end, I…
I'm nothing but a coward.

139
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,208
Do you know that I'm also really scared?

140
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,500
I'm afraid that this life is making things
harder for you.

141
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,916
I want you to fully express yourself,

142
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,083
and I want you to trust me completely.

143
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,375
But I'm scared that
I've become a burden to you.

144
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,666
Honestly, I've thought about
giving up too,

145
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,125
but I just can't let you go.

146
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,583
I'm sorry.

147
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,833
I should've trusted you more.

148
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,666
I didn't come here today

149
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,125
to disturb you,

150
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,541
I just wanted to see you.

151
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,375
I wanted to say thank you

152
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,708
for everything you've done for me.

153
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,166
You made that home so warm.

154
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,041
I just want to know
whether you love me or not.

155
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,750
Do you know?

156
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,250
Right now,

157
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,375
just sitting here with you,

158
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,458
I feel really happy.

159
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,541
Can we go home?

160
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,625
But how will you prove

161
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,375
that you won't leave me again?

162
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,416
This is our home.

163
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,416
You don't want me to change,

164
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,458
and I want you to be yourself too.

165
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,541
What's this?

166
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,458
It's something I was going to give you
after the movie last time.

167
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,458
You might not believe me,

168
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,833
but I'll let time prove it.

169
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,208
I won't hurt you again.

170
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,791
Put it on for me.

171
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,833
It looks great.

172
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,250
Good morning.

173
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,875
How did it end up with you?

174
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:21,500
It's A-Kai, right?

175
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,250
Don't be mad at him.

176
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,791
If it weren't for A-Kai,
I'd still be going in circles.

177
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,750
Could it be that the whole…?

178
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,916
Geez.

179
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,916
Ugh, so embarrassing.

180
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,125
Oh, come on. It's no big deal.
I'm the only one who saw it anyway.

181
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,250
Turn to the last page.

182
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,791
The things I want to accomplish
in the future…

183
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,208
Don't read it out loud.

184
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,833
- Just read it silently.
- What's up?

185
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,750
This is my journal.

186
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,250
No matter who writes what in it,

187
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,250
it's mine, right?

188
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,833
Future goals.

189
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,875
Number one.

190
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,416
Express love better.

191
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,083
Why aren't you looking at me?

192
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,125
I wasn't…

193
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:31,791
Why are you dodging me?

194
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,666
Stop reading it.

195
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,708
Number two.

196
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,000
What's wrong? Are you shy?

197
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,791
- Bye.
- Bye.

198
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,208
EXPRESS LOVE BETTER.

199
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,666
TRAVEL ABROAD ONCE A YEAR.

200
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,083
ONE COOKS, ONE DOES THE DISHES.
NO FORCING TO DO THINGS DON'T LIKE.

201
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,333
DON'T GIVE UP DREAMS FOR OTHERS.

202
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,166
Why did you suddenly draw this here?

203
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,583
It says right here,

204
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,791
don't give up on your dreams

205
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,416
because of someone else,
or because you're not brave enough.

206
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,416
You missed one.

207
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:45,416
GIVE XIAO-ZHE MORE LOVE

208
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,083
Hey.

209
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,708
You're back.

210
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,333
Why is there even more stuff now?

211
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,958
It's pretty much the same.

212
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,875
A-Kai said

213
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:22,375
to bring back the stuff I had stored
at his place too.

214
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,166
Isn't it pretty?

215
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:31,791
Where are you going to put it?

216
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:35,208
In the kitchen.
The floor mat there is already old.

217
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:39,416
No. The original one is fine.

218
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,458
This one's really cute though.

219
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:43,750
And I spent so long picking it out.
Feel it, it's super soft.

220
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,333
Took a long time, huh?

221
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,375
Yi-Ming Jiang, don't brush me off.

222
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,166
Hey.

223
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:09,958
One of the rules is,

224
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,166
one person cooks,
the other does the dishes, okay?

225
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,166
And another one is,

226
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,875
don't force each other
to do things they don't like.

227
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:21,125
Ting-Ting Jhong.

228
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,125
Why are you just eating now?

229
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,666
Last time I saw you were almost out,

230
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,083
so I bought some more for you.

231
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,250
You're not eating.

232
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,500
You've gotten so skinny.

233
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,291
I have been.

234
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,000
Yi-Ming's a great cook.

235
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:36,625
Are you hungry?

236
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:41,125
There's beef soup in the fridge,
I can cook some noodles.

237
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,000
No need, I've already eaten.

238
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,875
Mom,

239
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,125
there's something

240
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,041
I've wanted to tell you for a long time,

241
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:09,958
but I was afraid you'd see me differently.

242
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,458
I also didn't want us to become different.

243
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,000
Do you want to sit down?

244
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,458
You're blocking my TV.

245
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,791
The neighbor auntie

246
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,625
gave me some vegetables today.

247
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,000
Take them home later.

248
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:14,875
You're back just in time.

249
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,375
Help me stick this on later.

250
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,166
You little rascal.
