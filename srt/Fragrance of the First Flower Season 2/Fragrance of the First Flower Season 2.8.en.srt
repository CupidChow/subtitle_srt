1
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,333
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,875
I want to move out.

3
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,000
For us to take a break and cool down.

4
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,500
Maybe it's better for us.

5
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,625
Hello, Liu.

6
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,875
Sorry, something came up at home today.

7
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,791
Can I come into the office
this afternoon instead?

8
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,500
Alright.

9
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,000
Thank you. Sorry…

10
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,583
Thanks.

11
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,208
Whatever you need…

12
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,083
Just take it.

13
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,250
I'm going to bed.

14
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:32,291
NING: ARE YOU OKAY?

15
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,875
Zhe,

16
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,083
do you want to show Mommy
how high you can count?

17
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,291
To 100.

18
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,791
Really?

19
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,791
Yeah, really.

20
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,208
That's not all he knows.

21
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,958
He can do addition and subtraction now.

22
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,125
- Zhe, what's five plus five?
- Ten.

23
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,583
And what's ten minus two?

24
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,625
Eight.

25
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,333
Wow, you're so smart.

26
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,083
Have you told Mommy
where you learned that?

27
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,583
From the book Daddy bought
and also from school.

28
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,208
You learned that just like that?

29
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,333
That's amazing.

30
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,458
It's been a long time since the three
of us had dinner together like this.

31
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,166
Zhe,

32
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,208
are you extra happy today
because Mommy is here?

33
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,000
Excuse me,

34
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,625
can I have those two chairs back?

35
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,791
The song is over.

36
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,083
So, what do you think?

37
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,291
I think…

38
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,125
it's pretty good. Not bad at all.

39
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,291
So, what did I change?

40
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,208
You changed that…

41
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,166
uh…

42
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,875
- Where were you?
- Ah.

43
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,541
- What?
- You weren't even listening.

44
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,250
And you said you were.

45
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,291
Alright, I'm sorry, I'll listen again.

46
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,458
No need.

47
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,125
I'll send it to you. Listen to it at home.

48
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,333
Looking at you,
it seems like you've made up your mind.

49
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,250
I moved out.

50
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
Feeling any better?

51
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,583
Yeah, much better.

52
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,541
- Here,
- What's this?

53
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,333
Let's play.

54
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I still have to go to the office later.

55
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,250
We can go over the song details.

56
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,916
I might not have arranged it well,

57
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,666
can you help me check the bass part?

58
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,000
Just a quick game.

59
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,666
OK.

60
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,250
I'm coming.

61
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,083
Yeah, it's pretty good.

62
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,916
May,

63
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,291
the data you asked for is here.

64
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,833
- Okay, thanks.
- I'll leave it here.

65
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,958
Hey, can you help me with something?

66
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,083
Which packaging do you think
is more appealing?

67
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,583
Give me your opinion.

68
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,708
This one, I think.

69
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,708
It has the health department's seal
on the cover,

70
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,458
and the three main points are very clear.

71
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,625
The other one's good too,

72
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,750
but this one grabs my attention more.

73
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,916
Alright, thanks.

74
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,500
I'll think about it some more.

75
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,958
Could you call Jingchuan for me?

76
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,416
We scheduled a meeting for two o'clock,

77
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,208
but she hasn't shown up yet.

78
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,291
- Sure, I'll give her a call.
- Thanks.

79
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,791
- Did you oversleep?
- Yeah.

80
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,791
I saw the data you sent me this morning.

81
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,583
- Let's get started with the meeting.
- Alright.

82
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,708
I'm heading out.

83
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,666
Which of these do you like more?

84
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,416
I'm off.

85
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,416
Thanks. Bye.

86
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,458
I actually fell asleep.

87
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,041
Are you okay?

88
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,000
Not really.

89
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,166
You seem out of it.

90
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,291
How did you notice?

91
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,708
Is it because I was late today?

92
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,583
Damn,

93
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,000
I told myself I'd really focus
at work today.

94
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,125
You did work hard.

95
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,125
You were just a bit more serious
than usual.

96
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,458
Are you alright?

97
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,833
I'm not pregnant.

98
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,375
Does Yushan know?

99
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,500
Yeah, she knows.

100
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,500
She didn't say much, but…

101
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,833
I could tell she was really disappointed.

102
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:05,916
Sit down.

103
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,750
I still remember that moment.

104
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,708
After I took the test,
I was too scared to look,

105
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,666
so I asked her to check for me. And then…

106
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,583
the second her face fell, I knew.
It didn't work.

107
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:24,208
She came over to comfort me, said…

108
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,666
"It's okay. There's always next time."

109
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,333
But I could see in her expression, she was

110
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,791
really, really, incredibly disappointed.

111
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:37,958
I think

112
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,875
her feelings must be complicated too.

113
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,708
She feels heartbroken for you
and disappointed herself.

114
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,333
I know, but…

115
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,291
I'm suffering too.

116
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I kept thinking, can't she

117
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,291
just put her own feelings aside
for a moment,

118
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,458
and comfort me a little more? Or…

119
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,000
say something reassuring, anything?

120
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,083
That's the hardest part, isn't it?

121
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,291
When both people are hurting,

122
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,750
you feel some guilt toward each other.

123
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,291
You might even wonder,

124
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,916
"Is the pain they're feeling my fault?"

125
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,166
Even if I want to apologize,
those words just

126
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,416
get stuck in my throat,
and I can't get them out.

127
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,583
All this time, I've felt like
I've carried more weight than her,

128
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,750
whether physically or emotionally.

129
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,416
Yeah,

130
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,041
I really didn't realize
that she's been hurting too.

131
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,500
Thank you.

132
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,500
Let's try again.

133
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,541
You got this.

134
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:02,875
Let's eat something.

135
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,750
Chicken soup.

136
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,541
You're off work?

137
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,583
Yeah.

138
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,833
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

139
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,208
Hey,

140
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,958
haven't I told you before?

141
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,791
Yimin is dangerous.

142
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,333
I'm the one who suggested it this time,

143
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,250
taking a break.

144
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,375
Why?

145
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,250
Weren't you two just together
for a short time?

146
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,875
I don't know.

147
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,791
After we moved in together,

148
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,916
I started feeling like
she became a stranger,

149
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,000
sometimes like someone I don't even know.

150
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,250
I want to help her,

151
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,375
but it seems like
she's so used to being on her own.

152
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,833
That kind of habit…

153
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,333
It makes me feel defeated,

154
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,333
like I'm unnecessary.

155
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,916
In the end,
I started being really careful,

156
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,375
worried about making her upset.

157
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,958
All I wanted was to know
what she was thinking.

158
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,208
Do you know
why you feel like she's a stranger?

159
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,541
Because…

160
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,833
because that's the gap
between fantasy and reality.

161
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,208
Sure, you've liked her
since high school, but…

162
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,583
you never really dated or lived together.

163
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,458
Maybe what you've been
in love with all this time

164
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,666
was just the version of her you imagined.

165
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,125
Even now, I'm not sure
what I've been holding on to.

166
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,416
It's been so many years already.

167
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,541
You know what hurts the most
in a relationship?

168
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,500
It's when you're fully invested,

169
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,541
but you realize the other person
is always ready to walk away.

170
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,500
If I could, I'd want to be the one

171
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,208
who could leave whenever I wanted too.

172
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,875
If I could, I wouldn't want to keep
holding on either.

173
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,166
Honestly,

174
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,083
I don't know if she really loves me
or just loves the feeling of being loved.

175
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,541
I've told you before.

176
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,166
Being in love is supposed to
make you happy.

177
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,375
So I think

178
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,000
you should find someone
who makes you happy.

179
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,500
I know that,

180
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,375
but I just don't get

181
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:56,083
why I love someone so much
yet keep crying over them.

182
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,000
And with other people,

183
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,125
like Ning,

184
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,125
I can be so relaxed.

185
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,291
Ning?

186
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,041
Which Ning?

187
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,500
The singer-songwriter.

188
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:21,333
The one Bigfoot likes.

189
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,125
Ning.

190
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,416
Ting-Ting Zhong,

191
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,958
you're really something.

192
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,250
You're so annoying.

193
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,000
Alright.

194
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,916
But as your friend,

195
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,666
I just want you to be happy.

196
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,416
Take Ning, for example.

197
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,666
You just said it yourself.

198
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,666
When you're with Ning, you feel relaxed.

199
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,958
And you both share common interests.

200
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,833
It doesn't seem like
there's much to hesitate about.

201
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,291
Just give it a try.

202
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,708
No matter what happens,

203
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,250
Bigfoot and I will always be here for you.

204
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,708
Ting-Ting, a client just called for you.

205
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,625
They want to shoot the promotional video.

206
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,666
That's so sudden. Didn't they say
there was no budget before?

207
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,208
I don't know. Maybe they got
some last-minute funding?

208
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,875
Also, they want the video by next week,

209
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,500
including the interview
with the performing artist,

210
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,041
to be uploaded on YouTube.

211
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,791
I'll reach out right away. Thanks.

212
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,250
Are you alright?

213
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:52,083
You must be exhausted
with all the video work lately.

214
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,166
I'm fine.

215
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,875
Just almost couldn't get the equipment.

216
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,541
I had to go beg the owner
early this morning.

217
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,541
I'm ready.

218
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,791
Okay, then just follow the interview guide
I gave you earlier.

219
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:10,375
You'll introduce yourself to the camera,
greet the audience,

220
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,875
and then perform your original song.

221
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:13,833
OK. Alright.

222
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,416
Hello, everyone. I'm Ning.

223
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,458
I'm really happy to be part of
the Multicultural Festival this time.

224
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,291
Ning, could you share with our audience

225
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,208
three things related to the Hakka culture?

226
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,916
Rice noodles, paper umbrellas,
and thank you.

227
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,166
And what about three elements of love?

228
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:38,000
Shyness, blushing, and a racing heartbeat.

229
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:42,875
We heard you'll be performing
your original song "Found You."

230
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,916
Can you tell us
the inspiration behind this song?

231
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:52,541
"Found You" is about… you know,

232
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,500
have you ever met someone

233
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,666
who feels like

234
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,625
the missing piece in your life?

235
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,875
And finally, you found them.

236
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:07,208
Even though they might not be
exactly what you imagined,

237
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:12,583
you still muster up the courage
to accept everything about them.

238
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,333
Here's… "Found You."

239
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,833
<i>The things</i>

240
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,333
<i>You don't want to say</i>

241
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:53,958
<i>Hidden deep inside</i>

242
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,208
<i>Trust me, give them to me</i>

243
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:05,500
<i>The fears you haven't crossed</i>

244
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,958
<i>Those buried in your heart</i>

245
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,666
<i>Trust me, tell them to me</i>

246
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:21,625
<i>I found you</i>

247
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,250
<i>Oh</i>

248
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:30,458
<i>Found you</i>

249
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,875
<i>I found you</i>

250
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:05,166
Thank you.

251
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,250
Well…

252
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:09,833
I believe love comes in many forms,
and each one is unique,

253
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:12,416
just like our cultures and languages.

254
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,666
I hope everyone will join the event

255
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,291
and come listen to me perform.

256
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:20,833
Is this okay?

257
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:25,750
Is this okay?

258
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,333
Yeah. I… I need to use the restroom.

259
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,458
Are you okay?

260
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,750
Ting-Ting. Sorry,

261
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,750
the background
in that last shot was a bit off.

262
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,916
No problem, I can record it again.

263
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,875
Thank you.
