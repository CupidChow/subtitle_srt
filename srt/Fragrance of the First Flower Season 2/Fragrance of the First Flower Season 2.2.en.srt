00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,666
‪HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,000
Hello, everyone.

3
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,125
We are Departed.

4
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,291
<i>We're pretty mysterious, so…</i>
<i>we don't go live very often.</i>

5
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,416
<i>So…</i>

6
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,166
<i>today we're here to answer</i>
<i>some of your questions.</i>

7
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,583
<i>Alright, let's see…</i>

8
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,333
About the new song…

9
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,458
Yes, we're releasing a new song.

10
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,458
And the story behind this song
is mainly about

11
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,041
two people who love each other,

12
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,500
but unfortunately can't stay together.

13
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,416
I think a lot of people may have
had this kind of experience, right?

14
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,041
It's like… one day, you meet someone,

15
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,375
<i>and they're really special.</i>

16
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,458
<i>Everything they do</i>
<i>seems to draw your every breath.</i>

17
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:09,625
<i>But, for some reason, you have to let go.</i>

18
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,625
<i>It's quite heartbreaking. Yeah.</i>

19
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,750
<i>So, this time, the new song,</i>
<i>"I Love You, But…"</i>

20
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,291
<i>is really meant to convey</i>
<i>this kind of story.</i>

21
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,791
<i>Thank you for your question, Hao.</i>

22
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,250
Ting-Ting, if you met your ex now,

23
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,875
what would you say?

24
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,875
I'd probably say,

25
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,041
"How are you?"

26
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,583
"Long time no see."

27
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:03,791
Wow, old feelings.
So, do you still miss her?

28
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,000
What?! I was kidding.

29
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,708
You miss her, don't you?

30
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,083
Your face is so red.

31
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:10,791
No, it's not, really.

32
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,583
- It is.
- Her face is totally red.

33
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,541
- You don't have to hide it.
- Yeah, for sure.

34
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,500
<i>Next question!</i>

35
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,000
Ting-Ting.

36
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,041
Happy Birthday!

37
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,958
How did you know it was my birthday?

38
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,708
Hurry up, blow out the candles
and make a wish.

39
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,083
- Happy Birthday.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,750
Come on, let's go cut the cake.

41
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,208
Do you want to know what I wished for?

42
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,500
It's okay.

43
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,791
Are you sure you don't want to hear it?

44
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,500
Come on, let's go eat that pudding cake!

45
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,625
Hey, Ting-Ting Jhong.

46
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,708
- It's so good!
- You…

47
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,958
Ting-Ting Jhong!

48
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,166
LEON FLORIST

49
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,333
Hey, Ting-Ting Jhong.

50
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,250
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

51
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,375
What are you looking at?

52
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,666
The music sheets.

53
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,125
Everything alright?

54
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,166
Do you need anything?

55
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:53,958
I've got everything prepared.

56
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,875
There's a new product meeting in a bit,
you can sit in on it.

57
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:57,791
Okay.

58
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,666
If you have any questions,
just let me know.

59
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:15,541
We've got GL-104 L. reuteri
and F-1 L. rhamnosus…

60
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,583
- Next, we…
- Wait a second.

61
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:21,083
I feel like it's lacking
a bit of innovation.

62
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,666
For something our brand is launching,

63
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,000
the selling point
for our first children's probiotic

64
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,583
isn't strong enough.

65
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,250
What do you think, earth sign?

66
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,541
You're a mom too.

67
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,083
How would you choose for your child?

68
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,375
Her name is Yi-Ming, by the way.

69
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,541
I know.

70
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,958
I have an idea,
but I'm not sure if it's suitable.

71
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,833
Let's hear it.

72
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,500
My child has high-functioning autism.

73
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,208
In recent years, there's been
research suggesting gut health improvement

74
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,291
can positively affect
a child's brain development.

75
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,666
I know some people might think,

76
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,250
autism isn't something
that can be cured through gut health.

77
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,333
But even a small improvement

78
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:05,458
is something we parents
are willing to try.

79
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,541
Maybe we could consider
going in that direction.

80
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,083
Ma'am, here's your meal,

81
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,791
the Parmesan ham open sandwich…

82
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,041
Thank you.

83
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,041
- And hot mango-berry fruit tea.
- Thank you.

84
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,166
Ma'am, here's your meal,

85
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,000
the Parmesan ham open sandwich…

86
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,333
and hot mango-berry fruit tea.

87
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,541
Thank you.

88
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,625
I think what you said in the meeting
was really good.

89
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,375
Thanks.

90
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,208
I don't know much about autism myself,

91
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,125
but I admire how confidently
you spoke about it.

92
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,791
It's certainly not easy,

93
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,958
but for parents,
all children are the same.

94
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,666
Sorry, my wife needs to give me something.

95
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:08,875
Wife?

96
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,750
She's here.

97
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,291
This is my wife, Yu-Shan.

98
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:23,416
And this is our new R&D assistant,
the earth sign,

99
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,708
Yi-Ming Jiang.

100
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,416
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you too.

101
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
If you forget again,
I won't bring it next time.

102
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,208
Alright, I'm sorry.

103
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,791
- Want some tea?
- Sure.

104
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,416
Next time I'll cover your taxi fare.

105
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,750
It only takes ten minutes
to walk to the office.

106
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,625
You say you would,
but I wouldn't even call a cab.

107
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,000
Come on, it's my first day,
give me some face here.

108
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,250
She even forgot about her dinner
with clients tonight,

109
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,083
so her wife had to bring her a shirt.

110
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,791
Could a boss be more clueless?

111
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,958
What do you think? Cool, right?

112
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,375
My friend recommended it yesterday.

113
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,583
I think the way this Hakka song
is sung is really nice.

114
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,333
I quite like this singer.

123
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,333
Hello?

124
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,291
Hello?

125
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,375
Hello, can you hear me?

126
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,416
Hello?

127
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,208
Yeah, I can hear you now.

128
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,208
Yes, that's me.

129
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,958
Really?

130
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,583
Of course, no problem at all!

131
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,833
Okay.

132
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,625
Sure, no problem.

133
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,958
We'll get back to you
about the cost tomorrow.

134
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you so much.

135
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,291
Thanks again.

136
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,541
Okay, bye.

137
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,250
It's the music festival.

138
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,625
We're playing it?

139
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,833
And we get paid.

140
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,250
Thirty thousand.

141
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,708
No way!

142
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,458
- We're finally making money.
- Yeah.

143
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,416
I thought this gig was canceled.

144
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,833
Yeah, me too.

145
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,791
The organizers said
they'll send the agreement next week.

146
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,708
Then we just need to provide the setlist.

147
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,791
We really need to prepare.

148
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,458
Hey, lots of bands
get famous at music festivals.

149
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,083
Then their fan base grows a lot.

150
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,250
Right.

151
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,333
We need to really promote it.

152
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,166
Mom.

153
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,750
You're such a brat!

154
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,791
Seriously.

155
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,708
Look!

156
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,791
Oh dear, why waste money?

157
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,333
When have you ever seen me
carry a bag like this?

158
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,166
It suits you, look.

159
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,791
Your apron is pink too.

160
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,000
You've lost weight again?

161
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,458
About the same.

162
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,708
Your dark circles are so prominent.

163
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,916
Been staying up late again?

164
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,541
Oh, stop working so many side jobs, okay?

165
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,583
Alright, alright.

166
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,375
That bag… living expenses…

167
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,875
Nonsense.

168
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,333
I'll put it aside for you.

169
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,625
I tell you to save money,
and you buy me a bag.

170
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,000
What's the point of saving?

171
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,625
Being happy now is most important!

172
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,958
Happy now?

173
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,041
Who's gonna take care of you
when you're old?

174
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,375
You, huh.

175
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,875
So you need to outlive me.

176
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,125
Nonsense. Seriously.

177
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,833
You're exhausting your mom.

178
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,125
How could I dare?

179
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,458
Aren't you about to head out
to your stall?

180
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,500
I'll get going then.

181
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,583
Wait.

182
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,125
Hold on, hold on.

183
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,458
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

184
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,708
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

185
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:12,708
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

186
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:16,458
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to me</i>

187
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,041
Make a wish.

188
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,750
How can I make a wish without candles?

189
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,208
Put your hands together.

190
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,541
Wish with all your heart.

191
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,375
Alright.

192
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,125
Let's wish that our Ting-Ting

193
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,041
finds a good match at 30.

194
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:42,541
This person will be tall, handsome,
and make a lot of money.

195
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,541
And she'll live happily ever after.

196
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,708
You're so funny.

197
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,000
Who's the birthday girl here?
Why are you making wishes for me?

198
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,208
I know what your heart wishes for.

199
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,291
Anyway, wishing with all your heart
makes it come true, right?

200
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,541
Come on…

201
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,208
Finish it all,
and your wish will come true.

202
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:03,916
Thank you.

203
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,958
Here they come.

204
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,000
- Hello.
- Mom.

205
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,791
- Xiao-Zhe.
- Come in.

206
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,375
Let's go.

207
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,208
Look.

208
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,166
What's this?

209
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,916
A car backpack.

210
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,916
Once you start school,
you can take this new backpack.

211
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,916
Going to school, huh?

212
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,041
Do you want to put things inside?

213
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,833
You'll need to bring a sketchbook

214
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,416
and a pencil case for school.

215
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,500
Didn't we agree to go to prep class first?

216
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,750
After finishing prep class, in a blink,

217
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,041
we'll be in first grade.

218
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,208
- Right?
- Yeah.

219
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,083
Wanna try it on?

220
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,125
How does it look?

221
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,833
Let me tell you something.

222
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,375
Mommy recently found a new job.

223
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,125
A new job?

224
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,958
I'm just like you, going to a new place.

225
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,041
Can you wish Mommy luck?

226
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,000
Good luck.

227
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,625
Can I give you a hug?

228
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,625
He's asleep. I have to go now.

229
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,791
Oh, okay.

230
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,375
- Is that…
- I know, it's your mom's.

231
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,833
I've seen her wear it before.

232
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,416
Yeah.

233
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,166
My mom wanted me to tell you that
it's mango season right now,

234
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,250
and she'll bring some over next time.

235
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,375
Oh, that's so kind of her.

236
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,000
What are you guys having for dinner?

237
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,833
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

238
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,333
If you ever need anything last-minute,
just call me. Really.

239
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:40,958
It's okay.

240
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,208
But you…

241
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,500
Did you find a new job?

242
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,875
Yeah, research assistant.

243
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,833
Really? I think it suits you perfectly.

244
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,458
Honestly, since I moved back to Taipei,
things have been much better.

245
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:58,291
At least my mom has time
to help take care of Xiao-Zhe,

246
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,791
so I can play basketball
and grab a meal with friends.

247
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,750
I'm really thankful to your mom.

248
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,833
If you have any problems
with the place you're staying,

249
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:06,750
call me anytime.

250
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,750
My landlord's really nice.

251
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,875
He always takes care of things.

252
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,375
I'm heading out now.

253
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,791
Bye-bye.

254
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:42,916
JUNE 17TH

255
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,541
No thanks, I'm good.

256
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:03,916
TAIPEI PINGHE HIGH SCHOOL

257
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,083
It's too long.

258
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,041
I'm so exhausted.

259
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,458
It's good to work on your stamina, though.

260
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,791
Yeah, you've gotta build up
your endurance.

261
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,166
Gotta work on it.

262
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,958
My stamina's terrible.

263
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,250
Don't you always feel super hungry
after a game?

264
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,916
What about eating?

265
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,250
No.

266
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,458
Next time, I'm not throwing you
a birthday party.

267
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,750
How could you say that?

268
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,333
You know, my birthday wish just now

269
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,208
was for you to throw me a party
every year.

270
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,583
You're so childish.

271
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,208
No way! Too late.

272
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,833
I already made the wish.

273
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,125
We might not even stay in touch.

274
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,166
How could that be?

275
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,041
I don't care.

276
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,791
If you don't agree,

277
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,041
I'm going home like this.

278
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,583
What are you doing?

279
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,208
Please.

280
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:46,583
It's not like you don't know
my dad's making me study abroad soon.

281
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,250
Well, then… how about we make a promise?

282
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,791
On my 30th birthday,
let's meet back at our secret spot.

283
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,500
That way, we won't worry
if our phone numbers change.

284
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,916
Alright,

285
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,250
- You're so annoying. Let go.
- No!

286
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,375
- Come on.
- Please.

287
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,750
- Let go!
- No!

288
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,375
Fine, I'll agree to it.

289
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,458
Really?

290
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,041
Can you let go now?

291
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,625
I didn't say that agreeing
meant I'd let go.

292
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,125
Ting-Ting Jhong,
you're totally messing with me.

293
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,125
Let go.

294
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,375
What's the matter, Yi-Ming Jiang?

295
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,916
I already agreed.

296
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's great.

297
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,666
Your new hairstyle looks really nice.

298
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,041
Oh… thanks.

299
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,083
It felt strange at first,

300
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,250
but I wanted a change.

301
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,166
It really suits you.

302
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,750
Your band's music is really good.

303
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,125
You came that day, didn't you?

304
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,083
I didn't know you could play bass.

305
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,500
Did you learn it later?

306
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,916
I learned it when I joined
the music club in college.

307
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,708
Kept practicing and ended up enjoying it,

308
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,208
so we… formed a band.

309
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,708
That's awesome,

310
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,916
getting back into something from college.

311
00:23:58,875 --> 00:23:59,833
Yeah.

312
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,666
How've you been?

313
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,750
I'm doing alright.

314
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,416
And… how's Xiao-Zhe?

315
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,416
Xiao-Zhe? He's doing fine.

316
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,541
He's living with his dad now.

317
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,958
I got divorced.

318
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:06,791
How are you holding up?

319
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,750
Happy Birthday.

320
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,208
Even though I didn't prepare
anything today, I…

321
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:15,083
I hadn't forgotten our promise.

322
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,958
How can you not bring a gift?

323
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,833
At least treat me to a drink.

324
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:35,833
Sure.

325
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:39,208
I know a drink store nearby
that's pretty good.

326
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,250
But…

327
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,625
we'll have to run to make it in time.

328
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,208
Let's go.

329
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:58,416
Hey, let me tell you,

330
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,625
I was so nervous
on the day of my interview.

331
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:05,375
I thought the person sitting
in the chair was the boss,

332
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,208
but he turned out to be an engineer.

333
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,000
So I introduced myself to him.

334
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:15,583
It was so embarrassing.

335
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,000
But I admire you.

336
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,083
Someone once asked if
I wanted to do a planning job,

337
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,291
and I immediately said
I couldn't handle office work.

338
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,916
I can't imagine you in an office either.

339
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,916
Right?

340
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:31,208
But I really feel so lucky,

341
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,791
because I actually got the job that day.

342
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:35,791
Congrats!

343
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,541
You still like drinking Yakult green tea,
huh?

344
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,125
I don't drink it as much now, though.

345
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,625
My car's just up ahead.

346
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,708
Walk with me a little longer?

347
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,250
Sure.

348
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,666
I've moved out.

349
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,291
You should come over for dinner next time.

350
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,125
Maybe another time.

351
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:07,541
My ride's here.

352
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:36,291
The volleyball team is having a reunion,
you should join us.

353
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,208
If my schedule works out.

354
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:49,041
Let's stay in touch.

355
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,250
Gonna go now.

356
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,333
Take care.

357
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,666
Happy Birthday.

358
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,708
Thank you.
