1
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,625
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,208
So, your mom still
went to the market today?

3
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,125
Yeah.

4
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,791
Did she say anything?

5
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,916
Nothing specific.

6
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,833
Just… gave me a bag
of vegetables to bring back.

7
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,041
Maybe she wants
you to cook a good meal for me?

8
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,041
Are you getting a late-night snack?

9
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,458
Yeah, sure.

10
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:54,541
Then I want noodles,
half-cooked egg, like last time. Thanks.

11
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,583
Got it.

12
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,916
SU-SU TRADITIONAL SHALLOT OIL

13
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,083
Coming up.

14
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:20,833
Careful, it's hot.

15
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,083
Thanks.

16
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,291
I was thinking…

17
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:36,000
Maybe next time, I could
cook something for your mom?

18
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,916
Sounds great.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,916
Here's the venue for our show.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,583
Have you performed here before?

21
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,500
Nope.

22
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,041
We're just gonna do a quick sound check.

23
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,208
Sure.

24
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,041
Ting, the singer's here.

25
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,041
Could you help me
with the sound check later?

26
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,458
Okay? Thank you.

27
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,000
Right this way.

28
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,791
Here's the small stage
for tomorrow's show.

29
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,708
The setup is all ready for you.

30
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,125
You wanna sit and sing?
Or do you want to stand?

31
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,708
I'll sing sitting.

32
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,666
Alright,

33
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,666
shall we sound check?

34
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,916
Yeah, sound check first.

35
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,958
You don't seem to care at all.

36
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,708
I do care, okay?

37
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,500
You're really important to me as a friend.

38
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,750
But I can't show it now, can I?

39
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:57,958
What, you want me to cry?

40
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,375
Might be better if you did.

41
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,000
At least look a little… sad.

42
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,916
Alright, I get it. Go do your thing.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,458
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

44
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,208
Okay, just let me know if you need help.

45
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,166
Alright.

46
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,458
<i>Hey, hey…</i>

47
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,875
Could you add
a bit more reverb to that mic?

48
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,458
Got it.

49
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,750
Oh, and a few days ago,
Yi-Ming Jiang came to see me.

50
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,125
What for?

51
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,208
She was funny too.
She brought chicken soup as a bribe.

52
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,291
What?

53
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,791
She wanted me to convince you
to start a band again.

54
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,500
So, what did you say?

55
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,666
Do I even need to say anything?

56
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,541
It's not like you ever left the band.

57
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,500
MULTICULTURAL FESTIVAL.

58
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,166
Thank you, everyone,
for joining our Multicultural Festival.

59
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,000
Our event is about to start,
so please move closer to the stage.

60
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,583
Let's all head forward, thank you.

61
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,541
Please move forward. Thanks.

62
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,666
Okay.

63
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,166
Hello, please move.

64
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

65
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,916
Hi, please move forward.

66
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,083
The opening act is starting soon.

67
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,041
Our singer today will be
performing an original song,

68
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,541
"Found You." Let's welcome Xiao-Ning.

69
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,625
MULTICULTURAL FESTIVAL.

70
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,916
Hello, everyone. I'm Xiao-Ning.

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,666
I'm so happy to be here performing today.

72
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,208
Now, here's my original song,

73
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,333
"Found You."

74
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,416
Thank you.

75
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,833
<i>Those things</i>

76
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,250
<i>You never said</i>

77
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,708
<i>Deep inside your heart</i>

78
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:24,041
<i>Just trust and tell me</i>

79
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,833
<i>Those fears</i>

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,208
<i>You've never crossed</i>

81
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,875
<i>Trust and let me take them</i>

82
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,291
<i>I found you</i>

83
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,041
<i>Found you</i>

84
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:02,333
<i>I found you</i>

85
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,791
Hey,

86
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,041
you're here.

87
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,750
This event turned out really well.

88
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,875
I was just thinking,
maybe we could add music

89
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:29,166
to our new product launch
and make it a crossover event.

90
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,916
Excuse me, ma'am, could you please
not talk business even on the weekend?

91
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,500
I've thought of that.

92
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,500
I'll take some photos
to discuss it with you later.

93
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,291
See, Yi-Ming Jiang gets me.

94
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,750
- You all made it too.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,500
The event's a big success.

96
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,416
Thank you.

97
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,750
Oh, I haven't introduced you.

98
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,500
This is my girlfriend, Ting-Ting.

99
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,125
Did you think I couldn't tell?

100
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:15,250
<i>The things you fought</i>

101
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,208
<i>So hard to protect</i>

102
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:25,958
<i>Let them turn into a beautiful dream</i>

103
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,458
<i>I found you</i>

104
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:37,083
<i>Found you</i>

105
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,916
<i>I found you</i>

106
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:05,541
<i>Just trust and let me in</i>

107
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:12,583
<i>Just trust and tell me</i>

108
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,750
<i>Let it turn into a beautiful dream</i>

109
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:28,041
<i>I found you</i>

110
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,333
Thank you.

111
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,666
Xiao-Zhe,

112
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,250
remember Auntie Ting-Ting?

113
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,625
Hi, Xiao-Zhe.

114
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,583
Xiao-Zhe, look,

115
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,083
it's Auntie Ting-Ting's scooter.

116
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,458
Its name is Little Green.
Would you like to meet Little Green?

117
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,125
If you like it, you can even touch it.

118
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,750
Xiao-Zhe.

119
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,916
Hold on. Auntie Ting-Ting,
can you come with us to class?

120
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,208
If you don't feel like it,
you can tell Mom.

121
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,458
Say, "Mom, I don't want to,"

122
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,958
or "Mom, I need to think about it."

123
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,750
Xiao-Zhe, do you want to
play with Little Green right now?

124
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,375
Then, maybe Auntie Ting-Ting
can go with Xiao-Zhe to class later?

125
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,791
Are you scared?

126
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,791
No.

127
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,250
We'll be safe, okay?

128
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,125
- I'll protect you.
- Alright.

129
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,375
How about holding on a little tighter?

130
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,458
Is this okay? Not too fast?

131
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,375
Nope.

132
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,083
Good.

133
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,625
Is it fun?

134
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,333
- Yeah, it's fun.
- Do you want to go a bit faster?

135
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,250
Yes.

136
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,250
- Okay.
- Even faster.

137
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,000
- Let's cheer Mom on together, okay?
- Alright.

138
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,166
- Go.
- Go.

139
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,416
- Come on.
- Come on.

140
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,541
- Come on.
- Come on.

141
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,208
Hey.

142
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,000
- Hi.
- Xiao-Ning.

143
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,041
Hey, Da-Jiao. Hey there.

144
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,625
Finally meeting in person.

145
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,625
Wow, your face is all red.

146
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,875
- See, I told you Da-Jiao's a fan of you.
- Am I?

147
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,333
Well, I'm a fan of you guys too.

148
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,583
Brought you some drinks.

149
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,666
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Xiao-Ning.

150
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,666
- Thank you.
- No problem.

151
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,125
- Let's do it again, shall we?
- Come on,

152
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,583
- One more time.
- Come on.

153
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,666
Alright.

154
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,666
Hey.

155
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,708
You're really not going in?

156
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,916
Today's all about Xiao-Zhe.

157
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,750
It's most important
that his mom and dad are with him.

158
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,041
Tell him happy birthday for me.

159
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,458
Will do.

160
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,458
- Alright.
- See you.

161
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,875
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

162
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,375
- Happy Birthday.
- Happy Birthday.

163
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,333
Make a wish.

164
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,500
You can say it out loud if you want.

165
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,000
Wanna ride Little Green.

166
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,958
Little Green? What's Little Green?

167
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,333
Ting-Ting's scooter.

168
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,333
Oh.

169
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,833
Xiao-Zhe, want to make
a wish that Dad can help come true?

170
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,000
Go camping with the teddy bear family,
build a fire, and barbecue.

171
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,625
You mean the bear camping book?

172
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:45,041
No problem. Next week,
our whole family will go camping together.

173
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,708
Auntie Ting-Ting has to come too.

174
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,125
Xiao-Zhe, how about Mom
helps you blow out the candles?

175
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,541
Here we go.

176
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,916
One, two, three!

177
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,166
Happy Birthday. You're growing up.

178
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,083
There's something I need to tell you.
Not sure if you'll find it strange.

179
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,958
What is it?

180
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,000
Can you believe it?

181
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,708
My mom actually set me up on a blind date.

182
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,583
I mean, seriously, what era are we in?

183
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,166
She's still worried about me?

184
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,875
You don't want to go, do you?

185
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,000
Do you think I should?

186
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,375
Are you asking for my opinion?

187
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,625
What else?

188
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:59,833
I think it's fine to just meet someone.

189
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,583
But my standards
aren't that low, you know?

190
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,791
Do I really need to go this far?

191
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,875
Maybe their standards aren't low either,
and they're still going on blind dates.

192
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,791
You think?

193
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,291
Let me tell you,
your mom's the proactive type.

194
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:22,375
If you don't go, she'll probably bring
them straight to your house to meet you.

195
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,541
True.

196
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,541
You do get her.

197
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,458
I think it's fine to
just make a friend, really.

198
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,250
I'll think about it.

199
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,750
Ren-Xiu,

200
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,750
about the camping, if…

201
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,916
if you don't want her to
come along, I totally understand.

202
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,416
Just let me know,

203
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,958
and I'll tell Xiao-Zhe.

204
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,041
Don't worry,

205
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,958
I'll check with
the suppliers about the prices.

206
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:26,916
Yeah.

207
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,458
And that proposal info…

208
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm out right now.

209
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,333
No worries, go ahead.

210
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,666
Sure, sure.

211
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,708
Alright.

212
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,541
Yeah,

213
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,583
I got it.

214
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,333
Okay.

215
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,958
I'll adjust it later and email you.

216
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,416
Yeah. Thanks. Okay, bye.

217
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,583
What?

218
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,791
You look really good when you're focused.

219
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,375
I ordered for you.

220
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,333
Thanks.

221
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,916
Yesterday, when Xiao-Zhe made his wish,
he said he wanted to go camping,

222
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,708
and he hoped Auntie Ting-Ting could come.

223
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,333
Really?

224
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,750
Of course, I'd love to go.
I went a few times in college,

225
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,875
and there are some nice spots
I could look up.

226
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,500
Ren-Xiu's going too.

227
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,041
Oh.

228
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,458
But… is he okay with that?

229
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,791
He was a bit hesitant at first,
but he said he doesn't mind.

230
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,750
- If you're not comfortable going…
- I want to go.

231
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,208
If we're together, we've got to face
Ren-Xiu and Xiao-Zhe at some point.

232
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,708
Let's give it a try.

233
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:06,041
If no one takes a step forward,
we're just going to stay stuck.

234
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,541
I'm sure Ren-Xiu feels the same way.

235
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,166
What?

236
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,333
Nothing.

237
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,166
Why are you smiling?

238
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,666
Thank you.

239
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,000
Are you thinking that I looked really good

240
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,541
saying that just now?

241
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,583
It's hot.

242
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,208
It really is hot.

243
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,666
Dummy.

244
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,375
Got everything?

245
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,666
Yes, don't worry.

246
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,416
Don't be so nervous.

247
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,750
I'm not nervous.

248
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,416
You're the one who's nervous.
Don't be nervous.

249
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,833
They're here.

250
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,416
Let me take your stuff.
You guys get in the car.

251
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:48,708
Thanks.

252
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,125
Thank you.

253
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,166
Hello, Xiao-Zhe.

254
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,666
We're going out to play soon.

255
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,416
You sit in the back
with Xiao-Zhe. I'll sit up front.

256
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,291
Alright.

257
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,000
The GPS is acting weird.

258
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,291
Let me check too.

259
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,458
Turn right at the next intersection.

260
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:50,916
But,

261
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,666
it says it's the one after.

262
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,375
But,

263
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,500
the GPS says…

264
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,458
It's the one right up ahead.

265
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:07,708
This one right here.

266
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,208
Just turn right here.

267
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,500
It's okay.

268
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,083
The next route is actually faster.
No need for the detour.

269
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,291
True, GPS isn't always accurate.

270
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,083
Here we go.

271
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,500
- Careful.
- Slowly.

272
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,583
Yeah.

273
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,791
Our campsite should be over there.

274
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,208
- Oh.
- Okay.

275
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,666
Yi-Ming, do you want to take
Xiao-Zhe for a little walk nearby?

276
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,166
I can set up the tent.

277
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,750
Are you sure?

278
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,000
No problem.
I'll just drop off the stuff first.

279
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,916
Well, come on.
Let's go have a look around.

280
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:18,875
Need help?

281
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,208
Sure, thanks.

282
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,958
You probably need to tie a knot here,

283
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,208
so it opens up more.

284
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,458
Pull it in that direction.

285
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,583
Can you pass me a tent peg?

286
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:34,708
Tent peg, got it.

287
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,250
Right about here.

288
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:44,833
- Let's try it.
- Good.

289
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:45,750
I think I remember…

290
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,750
Have you set up a tent before?

291
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,625
My last time…
was probably back in college,

292
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,166
but I've pretty much forgotten everything.

293
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,166
How about you? Do you go camping often?

294
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,375
Went a few times in college,

295
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,500
but usually, I'd just get
someone else to set up the tent.

296
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,416
Same here.

297
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,125
- Here, hook this on.
- Thanks.

298
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,541
Is it fun?

299
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,041
- Let me check on my side.
- Alright.

300
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,916
Hey, they're done setting it up.

301
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,291
This is our tent.

302
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,125
- Does it look okay?
- Yeah.

303
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,833
Looks great.

304
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:56,083
Do you like it?

305
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,708
How about we draw something on our hands?

306
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,500
Let me see your hand.

307
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,583
Let's draw it together, okay?

308
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,916
Let's draw a superhero hand.

309
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,416
Alright.

310
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
How about some nail polish?

311
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Lately, Xiao-Zhe
doesn't like eating broccoli.

312
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,500
What's with that look?

313
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:56,416
You never even knew
what Xiao-Zhe used to like

314
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,416
or not like eating.

315
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,083
Even though my mom
takes care of him most of the time,

316
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:06,000
I'd say I've been
a pretty responsible dad.

317
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:09,916
Thank you, though.

318
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,666
You too.

319
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,833
You mean this? No.

320
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,666
I wasn't talking about making this bento.

321
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,833
I mean, from the time
Xiao-Zhe was born till now.

322
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,041
Back then, I was so focused on work,

323
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:32,541
I didn't realize how hard it was
for you to take care of Xiao-Zhe alone,

324
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,875
and how much you went through.

325
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,666
But I think things are really nice now.

326
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:49,083
Xiao-Zhe… he talks to me,
and asks me to tell him stories.

327
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:51,791
We're pretty close now.
That makes me really happy.

328
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,208
Meal time.

329
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,458
Xiao-Zhe, shall we have dinner?

330
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,708
Two red bell peppers,

331
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,125
and one yellow one,

332
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,708
and one piece of meat.

333
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,458
Is that okay?

334
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:31,250
Careful, it's hot. Eat slowly, okay?

335
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,083
Take it easy, blow on it.

336
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,333
Alright.

337
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:40,583
Okay, take it slow.

338
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:43,333
Make sure you eat your radish,

339
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,416
finish it all, okay?

340
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,125
Ting-Ting, this kimchi's
pretty good. Try some.

341
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,250
Thanks.

342
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:54,750
- Want a bit?
- Sure.

343
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,083
You can add a bit of salt
to the meat, it's pretty good.

344
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,916
Alright, thanks.

345
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,500
Alright, time for bed.

346
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,541
Sweetie,

347
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,916
what are you drawing?

348
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,666
Camping.

349
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,250
Camping, huh? You're drawing

350
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,750
our family camping?

351
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,208
Did you have fun playing with
Auntie Ting-Ting today, Xiao-Zhe?

352
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,291
Yeah, I had fun.

353
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:17,416
Do you like Auntie Ting-Ting?

354
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,083
I do.

355
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,416
Mommy likes Auntie Ting-Ting too.

356
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,000
Well, do you think Auntie Ting-Ting
can become part of our family?

357
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,125
Today,

358
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:09,875
the weather was really nice.

359
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,833
It was a pretty good day.

360
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,333
Oh, right.

361
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:25,083
I heard from Yi-Ming
that you work at a PR company?

362
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:26,958
Yeah.

363
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,291
What do you do there?

364
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:32,083
Well… I help organize events,

365
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,750
to build up
the clients' image and all that.

366
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:38,750
You're an engineer, right?

367
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:41,916
Yeah. Such a boring job.

368
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,166
I think engineers are amazing.

369
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,958
I'm terrible at science and math.

370
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:06,916
Hey, Ren-Xiu…

371
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,416
I…

372
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,791
What's up? If you've got
something to say, just say it.

373
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,875
Actually, I've been
wanting to apologize to you.

374
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:44,416
I know it doesn't really
make up for anything, but…

375
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,708
I'm sorry.

376
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,083
You know, I'm
a science-and-math kind of guy.

377
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,083
It's all about logic.

378
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,541
It's "one plus one equals two."

379
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,916
So, when Yi-Ming told
me she wanted a divorce,

380
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,333
I couldn't understand why.

381
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:22,250
To me, it just didn't make sense.

382
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,041
But after we split,

383
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:30,708
I finally realized…

384
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,166
marriage isn't like science.

385
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,083
It's not as simple
as one plus one equals two.

386
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,083
Recently,

387
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:49,041
I've seen how much Yi-Ming has changed.

388
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,166
It was my lack of understanding

389
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,291
that led us to where we are now.

390
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:01,000
Honestly, we had issues all along.

391
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,125
Even though we're not together anymore,

392
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,416
I just want you to know…

393
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,333
no matter what,

394
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,625
she'll always be
the family I cherish most.

395
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Thank you.

396
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:51,666
Did you know, I used to be a guitarist
in high school?

397
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:54,708
Really?

398
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,666
And our bassist was a girl too.

399
00:33:58,833 --> 00:33:59,958
Where is she now?

400
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,833
Everyone just slacked off.
We didn't keep going.

401
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,875
Whoa, you guys drank this much already?

402
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,125
It's fine.

403
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:12,958
Now we have three people.

404
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14,833
- Let's play cards.
- Alright.

405
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:16,500
Sure.

406
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,583
- Loser drinks, okay?
- Okay.

407
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,708
Here's half a card for you, half for you.

408
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,166
Are you doing okay today?

409
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,916
I'm great.

410
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,291
Don't you think I did pretty well today?

411
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:58,291
Not bad.

412
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,541
I think we could go camping more often.

413
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,833
I'm getting better at setting up the tent.

414
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,958
Let me show you something.

415
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,750
Is this me?

416
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,375
You're really good at drawing.

417
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:54,666
I'm glad I came.
