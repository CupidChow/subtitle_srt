1
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,333
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:31,750
Are you okay?

3
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,958
Ting-Ting, sorry,

4
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,000
the background
in that last shot was a bit off.

5
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,333
No problem, I can record it again.

6
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,375
Thanks.

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
What can I do for you?

8
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,083
I'm fine, thanks.

9
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,250
Or… wanna go to an izakaya later?

10
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,958
You can ask your bandmates to join too?

11
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,166
I'd love to meet them.

12
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,708
Maybe next time.

13
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,583
Xiao-Ning, can
you help me check the lighting?

14
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,208
Thanks.

15
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,666
On my way.

16
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,500
Yeah, we're hoping
for a better collaboration plan.

17
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,625
To make this event
more diverse and exciting.

18
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,875
Oh, really? Great.

19
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,666
Hold on. I'll send you
the event proposal right away.

20
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,833
Thank you so much.

21
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:22,000
No problem. Thanks a lot. Okay, bye.

22
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,541
Hey, Kai,

23
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,291
who takes a sick day
but still works like this?

24
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,333
Do you have any cold meds left?

25
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,708
You're sick, please see a doctor, okay?

26
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,333
No time.

27
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,375
Wait a sec, you didn't just eat
this bread all day, did you?

28
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:50,333
Please, if you're gonna die,
do it outside, alright?

29
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,333
Fine, okay.

30
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,916
Okay, my foot.

31
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,791
Hey, this is all I've got left.

32
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,000
- Have them if you want.
- Thanks.

33
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,458
Maybe it'll stop
the pain in your heart too.

34
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,208
It's just a small event,

35
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,250
but you're acting like
it's a huge concert or something.

36
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,791
INTRO TO SPECIAL ED LEARNING.

37
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,125
You're so dramatic, Ting-Ting Jhong.

38
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,333
What are you doing?

39
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,750
Nothing, just looking for something.

40
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,416
Don't mess up my files.

41
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,541
Xiao-Zhe is relatively
stable emotionally today.

42
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,208
He's doing quite well.

43
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,125
I talked to him about
non-car-related stuff, and he responded.

44
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,666
We've been spending
more time with him lately.

45
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,875
His calm-down time
has gone from 30 minutes to 15.

46
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:46,291
But, the teacher told me
since he just started first grade,

47
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,250
he really interacts
less with his classmates.

48
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,541
So I was wondering,
is there anything we should watch out for?

49
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,166
Or anything we can do for him?

50
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,458
Just let us know,
we'll do our best to help.

51
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,458
The fact that it's down
to 15 minutes is great.

52
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,583
It means this kind of
communication is effective.

53
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,416
Xiao-Zhe is also understanding you.

54
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,166
As for elementary school,
because it's a new environment,

55
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,416
not only does Xiao-Zhe need to learn,

56
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,833
but his classmates also need
to learn how to interact with him.

57
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,666
I think you can observe a little more.

58
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,500
It takes some time to
adjust to a new environment.

59
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:19,875
Okay.

60
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,291
Yeah, don't be so nervous.

61
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,875
His condition before

62
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,541
really made me feel guilty.

63
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,708
Mom, I still need to remind you,

64
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,041
you have to take good care of yourself.

65
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,458
Dad, you too.

66
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,583
It's not that when
the kid is fine, you're fine.

67
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,333
It's when you're fine
that the kid will be fine.

68
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,000
This Sunday,
let's take Xiao-Zhe out for a walk.

69
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:05,125
Make some sushi and sandwiches,
and go for a picnic.

70
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,208
Yi-Ming.

71
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:12,916
Huh?

72
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,083
What are you thinking about?
You didn't hear what I just said?

73
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,083
I was thinking about work.

74
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,125
I just said, this Sunday,
we'll take Xiao-Zhe out for a walk.

75
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,541
What do you think?

76
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,750
Yeah, sure.

77
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,208
You agreed so quickly.

78
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,166
Do you always have time on weekends now?

79
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,291
It's Xiao-Zhe.
He is always my top priority.

80
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,958
Of course.

81
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,125
But ever since that incident,
I've felt like you've been unhappy.

82
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,791
You heard what the therapist just said,

83
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,583
when the parents are well,
the kid will be well too, right?

84
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,291
I'm fine.

85
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,791
You used to always say
that communication was important,

86
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,125
but I feel like
you're the one in this family

87
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,333
who hates speaking your mind the most.

88
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,791
It's fine if you don't talk,
but you're so honest,

89
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,416
all your emotions
are written on your face,

90
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,666
it makes everyone
around you feel bad for you.

91
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,750
You often say I don't understand you,

92
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,000
but I think more often,

93
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,750
you don't give the people around you
a chance to understand you.

94
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,083
Mr. Chen.

95
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,416
Ms. Jiang, good evening.
You had a visitor earlier.

96
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,791
Thank you.

97
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,458
- Hello.
- Hello.

98
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,541
- You are?
- I'm Ting-Ting's friend.

99
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,125
From the band.

100
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,750
You've probably seen me.

101
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,833
You… do you need something from me?

102
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,208
Let's talk over there.

103
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,708
And this is…?

104
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,375
Whatever relationship you have,

105
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,333
I don't think I have
the right to say anything.

106
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,583
But as her friend,

107
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,916
I really don't want to
see her like this anymore.

108
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,083
- Thank you.
- Hey, no need to thank me.

109
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,791
I'm not here to say nice things.

110
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,166
You'll see for yourself anyway.

111
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,333
She worked so hard just to be with you.

112
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,750
If you're not sincere,

113
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,250
or if you feel like
you're not a good match,

114
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,750
and you want to break up,

115
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,375
be harsh when you tell her.

116
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,125
She's super stubborn.

117
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,958
The type that won't cry
until she sees the coffin.

118
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,625
Ting-Ting…

119
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,416
How is she?

120
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,625
She's so exhausted she got sick,
and still won't stop.

121
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,250
She bought a bunch of
autism books and is studying them.

122
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,416
Is that okay? Let me think…

123
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,833
She should be fine.

124
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,708
It's busier
because of the event right now.

125
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,416
Once the event is over, it'll get better.

126
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,791
Yeah.

127
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,083
Hang in there.

128
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,375
Don't collapse
before the event even starts, okay?

129
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,375
- Don't worry, it'll be fine.
- Get some rest early.

130
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,000
- Bye.
- You too, bye.

131
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,333
AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER

132
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,541
On the higher-functioning side
of the spectrum,

133
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,416
their verbal skills are usually better.

134
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,541
Their stereotypical behaviors are less,
and not very noticeable.

135
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,708
Most of the time, you can't really tell.

136
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,541
But that doesn't mean
they don't have difficulties.

137
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:54,166
Their challenges include communication
social interaction, behavior patterns…

138
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,125
Yi-Ming, when I was at your place before,

139
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,333
I thought that corner
would be perfect for flowers.

140
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,625
Even though they haven't bloomed yet,

141
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,291
when they do,
the petals will change colors.

142
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,666
They'll look like butterflies.
Very beautiful.

143
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,333
But remember to
water only when the soil is dry.

144
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,791
You know about growing flowers now?

145
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,708
Uh.

146
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,666
Hello, sorry to bother you.

147
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,208
Sorry,

148
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,708
could you give her this chicken soup?

149
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,375
Oh.

150
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,250
It's nothing.

151
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,833
You can say it's not from me,
just say it was a delivery.

152
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,541
I know she has a cold,
so I'm a bit worried.

153
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:05,791
She probably won't see a doctor.
So, I put some medicine in the bag.

154
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,958
Please help me with this.

155
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:10,708
Thank you.

156
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,375
You came to see Ting-Ting?

157
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,625
Yeah, she's resting, so I didn't go in.

158
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,958
Why didn't you go in?

159
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:57,458
I figured since she's resting,
she's probably not feeling well.

160
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,791
That's the difference between you and me.

161
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,875
If it was me, I'd definitely see her.

162
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,041
If she was unhappy,
I'd find a way to make her laugh.

163
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,291
If there was a misunderstanding,
I'd clear it up immediately.

164
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,041
I want to make her happy.

165
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,875
I want her to be happy too.

166
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,458
Ting-Ting Jhong, wake up.

167
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,791
- Hi.
- Hi, Kai.

168
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,208
- Xiao-Ning, come in.
- Sorry to bother you.

169
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,500
- Sorry.
- No worries.

170
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,333
Are you feeling better?

171
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,541
Much better, thank you.

172
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,791
I brought some food.

173
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,708
Figured you guys might not have eaten yet.

174
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,583
Sorry for any trouble caused,
bringing lunch on our first meeting.

175
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,625
I bought a lot, and some dishes too.

176
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,125
Wow, such a variety.

177
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,458
You're like Ting-Ting's little angel.

178
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,791
No, no, I'm a fan of you guys too.

179
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:19,875
I've always wanted
to meet you and Da-Jiao.

180
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:20,875
Oh, come on.

181
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,500
Hey, I have utensils, I'll go grab them.

182
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,541
Okay.

183
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,875
It's all the stuff you like.

184
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,541
Thanks.

185
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,291
Da-Jiao's gonna be so mad.

186
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,041
Xiao-Ning, let's take a photo later.

187
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,125
I'm gonna show it off to Da-Jiao.

188
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,125
- Sure.
- You're so childish.

189
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,958
Where's the chicken soup from?
Smells so good.

190
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,125
It tastes amazing.

191
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,625
If it's good, have more.

192
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,916
Eat up.

193
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,166
I want to eat in the room.
You guys take your time chatting.

194
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,750
Talk as long as you like.

195
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,791
What? Eat with us.

196
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,083
Ah, I'm a loner.
I just want to eat in the room.

197
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,958
Xiao-Ning, we've got drinks in the fridge.

198
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,000
- Help yourself, okay?
- Alright.

199
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,375
Eat more veggies.

200
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,333
Here.

201
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,625
Don't just drink soup.

202
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,208
I bought all this food for you.

203
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,333
You eat more too.

204
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,375
I'm just worried you won't get full.

205
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,708
READY TO SERVE

206
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,333
JUNE SCHEDULE

207
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,708
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

208
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,708
How do you forget someone like you?

209
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,458
After the overpass,
I kept thinking about what you said.

210
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,625
You obviously liked me too,

211
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,583
so why did you still leave?

212
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,958
I couldn't find an answer…

213
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,750
It's true.

214
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,333
…but I found a way to make myself happy.

215
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,375
- Hey.
- Hi.

216
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,416
Cheerleader sweetie.

217
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,916
What's up?

218
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,708
Check this out,
something I've been playing lately.

219
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,333
Wow.

220
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,166
What do you think?

221
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,666
Come jam with us sometime.

222
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,250
Me and Da-Jiao
still hit up the practice room sometimes.

223
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,666
Sounds good.

224
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,625
If I have a melody and just hum it,
can you help me arrange it on guitar?

225
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,333
Duh, of course.

226
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,291
Hey, should we start a band together?

227
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,833
Writing songs helps let go of a lot.

228
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,333
Just write it all down…

229
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,250
Da-Jiao.

230
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,541
…and it becomes part of the past.

231
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,708
You're serious, huh?

232
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,625
Of course. Let's give it a try.

233
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,083
So what should we call the band?

234
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,041
I've got it.

235
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,625
We'll call it, Young Heart Departed.

236
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,291
Young Heart Departed.
That's too hard to pronounce.

237
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,875
How about just

238
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,333
Departed?

239
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,291
Sounds good.

240
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,791
We're not that young anymore anyway.

241
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,125
Yeah, it's much easier to say.

242
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,125
- Good to go?
- Yep.
Alright, let's start practicing then.

243
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,708
Sure, let's go.

244
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:42,208
Every time we practice,
I imagine that maybe one day,

245
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,083
during a performance,
I might see you again.

246
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,125
I hope by then, I'll
have moved on from you.

247
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,500
DEVOTION, JOY, ETERNAL LOVE

248
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,458
Excuse me, in the past few days,
did a girl

249
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,875
buy this bouquet from you?

250
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,708
The packaging looks something like this.

251
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,916
I think I remember.

252
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,250
Yes, a lady bought the last one.

253
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,916
Do you remember what she looked like?

254
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,208
Can you recall?

255
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:29,041
She was slim, about this tall,

256
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,208
with a ponytail.

257
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,833
I'm really useless, huh?

258
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,125
Thank you.

259
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,000
I promised to forget you,

260
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,041
but knowing it might have been you,

261
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,791
I was so happy.

262
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,916
Yet at the same time, I was scared.

263
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,125
Will this encounter

264
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,500
be different?

265
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,166
I wish time could freeze at this moment.

266
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:34,166
Just this moment,
with you by my side, is enough.

267
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,750
You probably won't believe it,
but because of you,

268
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,916
my life has a new purpose.

269
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,250
Hello, Liu-Jie?

270
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,291
Hi, it's Ting-Ting.

271
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,958
Because of you,

272
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,208
there are more things I want to do.

273
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,125
…still recruiting for event planners?

274
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,875
Yes, I'm interested. I also want to ask…

275
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,833
AUTISM EDUCATION AWARENESS

276
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,291
I want to become someone you can rely on.

277
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,916
Baby,

278
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,666
have you had dinner?

279
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:36,041
Even though I know
I'll probably never be your top priority…

280
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:37,666
What's for dinner?

281
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,333
…just being by your side,
seeing you smile,

282
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,958
makes me content.

283
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,333
Your delivery. Please sign here.

284
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,333
Thank you.

285
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:01,833
Thank you for your hard work, thanks.

286
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:17,125
Hey, what kind of home
do you want in the future?

287
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,625
I'm not sure,

288
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:25,583
but

289
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,833
I think I'd like a high stool
in the house.

290
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,625
Alright,

291
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:34,875
then we'll put a high stool
by the window in our home.

292
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,416
Am I…

293
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,875
being too naive?

294
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,125
TING-TING

295
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:22,583
I'M SORRY…

296
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:40,750
THE FLOWERS BLOOMED,
I WISH YOU COULD SEE THEM TOO

297
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,041
- You're here.
- Hi.

298
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,666
That bag in your hand, is it for me?

299
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,791
Oh, yeah.

300
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,250
Thank you for driving me home
the other day,

301
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,000
and for helping Kai buy lunch.

302
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,041
It was nothing.

303
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:34,750
What's wrong?

304
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,000
If you want to say something, go ahead.

305
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:47,708
I really like you.
