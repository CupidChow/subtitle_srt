1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,583
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,708
Has everyone else arrived?

3
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,875
Yeah.

4
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,250
Let's go.

5
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,750
- She's very capable. Why…
- Yeah.

6
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,875
- Hi, junior.
- Hello.

7
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,958
It's been so long, Ting-Ting.

8
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,000
- We saved a seat next to Yi-Ming for you.
- Long time no see.

9
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,416
I remember you two were really close.

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,833
- Thanks.
- Scoot over a bit.

11
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,458
It's rare to have a junior visit.

12
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,000
Wow, you haven't changed at all.

13
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,458
- I know, right? It's crazy.
- Yes.

14
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,958
You still have that youthful vibe.

15
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,875
Let me tell you, a while ago,
I played ball with my niece.

16
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,208
We barely played for 30 minutes,

17
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,458
and the next day,
I couldn't even get out of bed.

18
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,541
I get it…

19
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,250
- Muscle soreness?
- You probably didn't warm up.

20
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,166
- I did!
- It's just that age is catching up.

21
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,333
The body's getting worse,

22
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,375
the metabolism too.

23
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,125
Now, even when I drink, I feel so guilty.

24
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,291
Come on, you're so slim. Guilty?

25
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,958
- Look at my belly.
- Oh, wow.

26
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,458
I think Ting-Ting has
maintained herself the best.

27
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,833
Exactly.

28
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,791
Why are you comparing yourself to her?

29
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,833
She's just a few years younger than us.

30
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,875
Hey, Ting-Ting, how old are you?
I just turned 30.

31
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,750
Just turned.

32
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,666
So young.

33
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,416
Here… Cheers to you.

34
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,166
Congrats!

35
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,041
Welcome to the world of 30-year-old women.

36
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,333
It's boring. Why are you scaring her?

37
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,958
Hey, I'm just giving her a heads-up.

38
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,750
- Bad senior.
- True.

39
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,833
Yi-Ming, how's your son doing lately?

40
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:20,958
Who's he with now?

41
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,041
Oh, he's living with his dad.

42
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,916
Has your ex-husband tried to win you back?

43
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,916
No, I was just thinking…

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,083
I saw my friend the other day,
she got divorced from her husband…

45
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,958
A year later,
they decided to get back together

46
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,833
and re-register their marriage.

47
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,791
I don't think we will.

48
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,625
We're just friends now.

49
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,500
Our personalities don't really match.

50
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,833
But what if he's willing to change?

51
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,708
Like, he's willing to put in
more effort for the child?

52
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,458
Senior, can I order another bottle?

53
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,583
Of course.

54
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,500
Sure, go ahead.

55
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,500
Waiter, can we get another bottle here?

56
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,500
Here… Junior, drink mine first.

57
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,750
Drink up.

58
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,916
Thanks.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,166
Hey…

60
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,250
Eat something before you drink.

61
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,625
Senior, a toast to you.

62
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,333
Do you have any wine left?

63
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,583
- Let me pour for you.
- Just a little.

64
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,875
Wow, look at you pouring like a pro.

65
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,000
- Impressive.
- Not bad at all.

66
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,500
Absolutely.

67
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,375
Are you okay?

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,958
I'm fine.

69
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,166
Where is everyone else?

70
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,375
They all took the metro together.

71
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,208
How did you get here?

72
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,375
I rode my scooter.

73
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,833
It's parked in the alley next door.

74
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,250
You've been drinking, don't ride.

75
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,041
I'll call a car and take you home.

76
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,708
This dinner was full of your batchmates.

77
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,375
I'm the only junior here.

78
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,291
I didn't really know what to talk about.

79
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,250
Why did you even

80
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,125
invite me?

81
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,750
We're all from the volleyball team, right?

82
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,916
People mention you from time to time.

83
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,250
How often?

84
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,083
One of them couldn't
even remember my name.

85
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:53,958
Really?

86
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,416
It's just more lively with more people.

87
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:07,958
Forget it.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,250
Just drop me off here.

89
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,875
I'll take the bus home.

90
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,208
- Don't be like that.
- What's up with you?

91
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,833
You've been drinking a lot.

92
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,125
If you're just going to pop in
and out like this,

93
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,000
then let's just stop here.

94
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,750
Thanks for remembering my birthday.

95
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,333
I didn't mean it like that.

96
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,583
Do you know I still think
about that day on the overpass a lot?

97
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,625
I know.

98
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,208
At that time,

99
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,833
I wasn't ready yet.

100
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,875
And now?

101
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,750
I…

102
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,875
I don't really know what to say.

103
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,583
But…

104
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,666
But seeing you again, I'm really happy.

105
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,000
You,

106
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,541
wanted to see me?

107
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,208
Yeah.

108
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,375
So, how happy?

109
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,791
You're so annoying.

110
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,666
You said I could visit
your place when you're free.

111
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,041
Does that still stand?

112
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,166
Just leave your shoes outside.

113
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,083
There are slippers here.

114
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,583
Want some tea?
It'll help with the alcohol.

115
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,583
Anything's fine.

116
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,000
Alright, give me a moment.

117
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,708
I didn't see you drink much earlier,

118
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,708
but you've got quite
a few bottles at home.

119
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,583
I only drink a little on weekends.

120
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,583
It just so happens it's the weekend.

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,208
Haven't you had enough?

122
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,583
Weren't you trying to sober up?

123
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,166
Will this work?

124
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,208
I've got glasses.

125
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,041
Here.

126
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,750
I'll grab some snacks and nuts.

127
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,000
Should I pour you a glass too?

128
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,375
Oh, sure.

129
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,458
Here you go.

130
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,583
Thanks.

131
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,708
Thanks.

132
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,625
You okay?

133
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,333
This is really strong.

134
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,708
You didn't think
the sake was strong, but this is?

135
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:35,875
Guess you're not
much of a drinker after all.

136
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,708
It's just too spicy.

137
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,666
Oh, okay.

138
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,250
Do you always drink alone at home?

139
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,416
Yeah.

140
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,666
Ever since I moved out,

141
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,666
I've had more time alone.

142
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,500
The last time I went to the supermarket,

143
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,125
I picked up a bottle.

144
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,291
I think it was some kind of holiday.

145
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:16,000
At that time,
there were fireworks outside,

146
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:21,541
and I just sat alone at home,
quietly drinking whiskey.

147
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,666
I'm always by myself too.

148
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,666
Which one do you want?

149
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,166
That one.

150
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,083
- This one?
- Yeah.

151
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,833
Thanks.

152
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,625
So, after drinking,

153
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,458
did you feel like more of an adult?

154
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,500
Do you remember
when we were in high school,

155
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,291
and we snuck whiskey at your place?

156
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,583
Of course, I remember.

157
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,250
You're still wearing my mom's clothes?

158
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,250
I just noticed
your bracelet, it's so cute.

159
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,375
You like it?

160
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,791
You're up?

161
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:55,875
Yeah.

162
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,125
Good morning.

163
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,791
Good morning.

164
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,875
Do you want some coffee?

165
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,666
I have to go work at the cafe later.

166
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,583
Oh right, I forgot you have to work.
Let me pack this up for you.

167
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,583
Just throw it in a plastic bag.

168
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,541
Thanks.

169
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,750
I just threw everything together.

170
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,916
It looks pretty fancy to me.

171
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,333
Thanks.

172
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,208
I'll return the container later.

173
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,500
Alright.

174
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,500
Ting-Ting,

175
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,000
you should come over
for dinner again this weekend.

176
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,000
Sure, let's plan it.

177
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,041
Thanks.

178
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,125
Take care.

179
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,791
- I think that went pretty well.
- Yeah, it did.

180
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:06,875
Let's take a break
and practice again later.

181
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,666
- Alright.
- Sure.

182
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,375
I think there's
a reservation for today, and…

183
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,041
- NO PROBLEM, I'LL BE ON TIME.
- BEAUTIFUL, SEE YOU NEXT TIME

184
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,875
No way, I need a break.

185
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,166
Hey, Da-Jiao,

186
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,666
is it your hands
or your eyes that are the problem?

187
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,416
Why do you keep messing up?

188
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,708
The feel just isn't right.

189
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,208
Then why don't you ask yourself
why you wrote the song like that?

190
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,375
The feel is off.

191
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,666
Oh my god.
Why is Yi-Ming Jiang showing up again?

192
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,541
We're…
The volleyball team is having a dinner.

193
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,333
She's the captain, so she's
in charge of gathering everyone.

194
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,083
And why are you being so sneaky?

195
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,500
You're the sneaky one.

196
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,458
Alright, it's about time. Let's pack up.

197
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,166
You better be serious about this,
Ting-Ting Jhong.

198
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,541
I am. Let's clean up quickly.

199
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,083
Otherwise, you'll have to pay overtime.

200
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,875
When are we meeting again?

201
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,041
Uh, well…

202
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,166
My schedule is packed next week.

203
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,958
And I can't do this weekend either.

204
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,166
Why not?

205
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,708
Ting-Ting Jhong, didn't you say
the music festival was important?

206
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,500
Shouldn't you be
spending more time practicing?

207
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,416
Yeah, that's true.

208
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,500
But…

209
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,416
This weekend I just… might have…

210
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,000
Might what?

211
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,708
Oh, come on, it's just one weekend.

212
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,333
We can practice on Monday night.

213
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,208
Who was it last time,

214
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,541
singing breakup songs all night at KTV?

215
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,666
Now whenever I see you,
that's all I can hear in my head.

216
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,208
That was Da-Jiao, right?

217
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,666
- No way.
- Why blame me?

218
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,375
- I've got pictures.
- Come on, show her.

219
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,875
- Let's do it.
- Don't mess around.

220
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,750
- See for yourself.
- Hey!

221
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,833
When people are heartbroken,
they sing the same song maybe five times.

222
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,125
But you, crazy woman,
hogged the mic the whole night,

223
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,000
sang until your voice was gone,
and even threw up.

224
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,958
It was just that one time, okay?

225
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,166
Why don't you ever learn?

226
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,750
It's not like we're
doing anything special.

227
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,291
We just "might" meet this weekend.

228
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,250
Actually, "maybe" we'll meet.

229
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,958
Alright then, go meet up.

230
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,666
Let's hope it doesn't end like last time.

231
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,833
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

232
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,875
This time she was
the one who asked me out.

233
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,583
I was hesitant, though.

234
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,291
You know,
I'm not trying to jinx you, right?

235
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,208
Yeah, I know. I just…

236
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,666
SO, SEE YOU THIS WEEKEND THEN

237
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,375
Come on.

238
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,833
What? Don't ask me, I'm not your mom.

239
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,791
Let's plan the next band practice
for next week, okay?

240
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,333
Alright. See you next time. Bye.

241
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,458
Bye-bye.

242
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,125
I brought you a gift.

243
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,333
Oh, thanks.

244
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,166
Do you need help carrying it?

245
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,375
I'm fine.

246
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,791
Don't you like this one?

247
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,416
It's on sale. Want to get it?

248
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,333
Nah, if it's on sale,
it might not be fresh.

249
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,375
Well… What about baby corn?

250
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,833
- Sure.
- Okay.

251
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,416
Hey, can you grab me some basil?

252
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,625
Alright.

253
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,500
This one's too old.

254
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,875
Let's get a different one.

255
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,333
Salt.

256
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,125
Why are you laughing?

257
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,458
You really haven't changed at all!

258
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:20,958
Huh?

259
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,416
The total is $1,641.

260
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,291
Cash or card?

261
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,375
Card, I got it.

262
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,000
Thanks.

263
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,916
My friend said there's
a nice restaurant nearby.

264
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,666
My band has a gig next month.

265
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,833
Once I get paid, I'll treat you.

266
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,791
Sure.

267
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,166
You're performing?

268
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,291
That's awesome.

269
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,541
It's no big deal,

270
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,166
just a small stage at a music festival.

271
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,250
That's still great.

272
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,166
Do you want to come listen?

273
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,041
Can I?

274
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,416
That sounds fun. I…

275
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,666
I don't think I've ever
been to a music festival.

276
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,583
It's basically like a regular concert.

277
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:17,291
Lots of different bands performing.

278
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,958
You can grab a beer and listen all day.

279
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,583
If you like a band, you stay.

280
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,666
If not, you move to a different stage.

281
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,916
Sounds good, I'll go.

282
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,041
The festival's on a weekend, right?

283
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,166
Yeah, I'll let you know
once it's confirmed.

284
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,583
Yi-Ming,

285
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,791
the last time I was at your place,

286
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,750
I thought that corner
would be perfect for flowers.

287
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,083
The flowers haven't bloomed yet,

288
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,875
but when they do,
the petals will change color.

289
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,750
They'll look like butterflies.
Really pretty.

290
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,500
But remember,
water it only when the soil is dry.

291
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,791
You know how to grow flowers now?

292
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,083
I don't, the store owner taught me.

293
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,416
I'll put it out on the balcony for you.

294
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,791
- Thanks.
- No problem.

295
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,958
- I'll grab the cutlery for you.
- Oh, it's over there.

296
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,041
Got it.

297
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,666
Wow, impressive.

298
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,125
Alright, let's eat.

299
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,583
How about we take a photo?

300
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:55,791
Here, you hold this.

301
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,791
- Alright, wash your hands and let's eat.
- Okay, okay.

302
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:22,833
<i>I'm downstairs.</i>

303
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,000
Huh? You… Why are you here?

304
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,208
- Where's Xiao-Zhe?
<i>- I brought something for you.</i>

305
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,000
Oh, I'm just in the middle of cooking.

306
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,958
How about… you leave it at the front desk,
and I'll grab it later?

307
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,000
<i>No need, I'll bring it up to you.</i>

308
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,333
I'll just go to the room
and won't make a sound.

309
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,625
Xiao-Zhe drew this,
he wanted me to bring it to you.

310
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,875
Thank you, and sorry
you had to make the trip.

311
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,416
No worries. And this too.

312
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,875
My mom is helping me watch Xiao-Zhe.

313
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:41,041
She said the mangoes at home would go bad,
so she asked me to bring them over to you.

314
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,875
Thanks.

315
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,125
You…

316
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,500
Do you have a guest?

317
00:26:56,875 --> 00:27:00,208
So, will you be attending
Xiao-Zhe's parent-teacher meeting?

318
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,458
Yeah, I've already taken the day off.

319
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,958
Let's meet up.

320
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,875
How about I give you a ride?
It's been raining a lot lately.

321
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,166
You don't have a car,
and I don't want you to get soaked.

322
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,583
What if you get caught in the rain?

323
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,750
Thanks, but really, there's no need.

324
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,416
Is Xiao-Zhe with your mom?

325
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,583
Well… maybe you should head back,
so you don't keep her waiting.

326
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,583
Don't you really care?

327
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,000
Care about what?

328
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,041
You saw Xiao-Zhe's drawing.

329
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,375
Don't you understand?

330
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,458
The teacher told me

331
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,000
he wasn't talking much
at school for a while.

332
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,083
He wasn't eating
his lunch for some time either.

333
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,458
When I asked him why,

334
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,458
he said the school lunch
didn't taste good,

335
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,416
only the food mom makes is good.

336
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,375
I know.

337
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,541
You know?

338
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,375
If you really knew,

339
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,083
I'd hope you'd think about this carefully.

340
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,250
If you're still in contact with her,

341
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,791
she should think it over too.

342
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,041
How long do you think
a fling like this can last?

343
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,333
What are you even talking about?

344
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,500
What do you mean,
"What am I talking about?"

345
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,083
I still don't know
how to explain to Xiao-Zhe

346
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,208
why his parents can't live together.

347
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,791
How am I supposed to explain that to him?

348
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,458
Don't you think this is unfair to him?

349
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,791
That's a bit much.

350
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:25,125
Who's being excessive?

351
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:36,916
Forget it.

352
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:40,833
Xiao-Zhe is probably
about to wake up from his nap.

353
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,666
I promised I'd take him to the park.

354
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,041
I'll head out.

355
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,166
Are you okay?

356
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,625
I'll reheat this.

357
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:29,791
No need.

358
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,041
Don't trouble yourself.

359
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,583
Do you want me to stay with you?

360
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:47,375
Or… do you need some time alone?

361
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,291
I'll head out then.

362
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:02,958
We can meet up another time.

363
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:11,166
Let me know if you need anything.
