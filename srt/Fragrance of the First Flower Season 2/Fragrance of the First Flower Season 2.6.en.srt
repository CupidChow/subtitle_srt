1
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,208
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,416
Is Zhe okay?

3
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,833
Yeah, he's fine.

4
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,666
Are you cooking?

5
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,458
Oh, yeah.

6
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,791
Could you open the window
to let the smell out?

7
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,208
Are you hungry? I made breakfast for you.

8
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,416
I'm a bit tired. I'm going to rest.

9
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,500
He kept saying it was eight o'clock,

10
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,875
and when I told him to wait a bit,
he wouldn't.

11
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,125
I really don't know what to do.

12
00:02:54,208 --> 00:03:00,083
- Mommy didn't answer the phone…
- Alright, alright.

13
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,583
Mommy will definitely remember next time.

14
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,500
- I assure you.
- Mommy didn't answer the phone

15
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,416
- I promise I won't lie to you, okay?
- Mommy didn't answer the phone

16
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,208
I won't forget again, I swear.

17
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,000
<i>Alright…</i>

18
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,541
Richard, don't forget to send me
the quote, okay?

19
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,791
Oh, sure.

20
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,875
Xiaojuan,
is there anything else I can help with?

21
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,125
It's fine, focus on your work.

22
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,166
- Thanks!
- Okay.

23
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,625
- Hi.
- Hello.

24
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,500
Sorry about that.

25
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,208
Yeah, it's our mistake this time.

26
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,416
I'll get back to you right away.
Okay, sounds good.

27
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,291
Would you like me to pour you a cup?

28
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,291
Sorry, that's actually my cup.

29
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,541
Oh, sorry about that. Well.

30
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,083
No worries. You can use any
of the cups here next time.

31
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,250
Or I can switch it for you now.

32
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,125
No, it's fine, just put it back
after you wash it.

33
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,666
Okay, sorry. Thanks.

34
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,583
- Ms. Liu.
- Hey.

35
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,291
Our boss really loves coffee.

36
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,416
He always brings back
a ton of high-end coffee beans,

37
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,416
so feel free to help yourself.

38
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,583
Want me to pour you a cup?

39
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,833
If I have another,
I won't be sleeping tonight.

40
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,166
About that singer you mentioned,

41
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,500
- Ning, right?
- Yeah.

42
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,458
You can go ahead and contact her.

43
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,750
- Check her availability and interest.
- Got it.

44
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,000
- No problem.
- Okay.

45
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:30,958
HELLO, I HAVE
A WORK-RELATED QUESTION FOR YOU.

46
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,625
- Hi.
- Hey.

47
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,166
Were you still sleeping?

48
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,375
I didn't sleep all night. Come on in.

49
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,375
- Just leave your shoes outside.
- Okay.

50
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,875
Wow, your studio is amazing!

51
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:19,958
Not bad.

52
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,916
You've got quite the vinyl collection.

53
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,208
You know, my bandmates and I always
fantasize about having a studio like this.

54
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,083
If you like it,
you're welcome to come anytime.

55
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,291
It's free. Free of charge.

56
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,083
Really?

57
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,208
Consider it a thank you
for referring me for the gig.

58
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,666
No worries.

59
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,916
But it's not a huge stage
or anything, right?

60
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,125
As long as there's money, that's good.

61
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,708
Of course.

62
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,958
If you're interested,
you can send us your rate.

63
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,875
Having fun is the most important thing.

64
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,541
I only took the job because you…
recommended it.

65
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,125
But I took a look at the event
description you sent me.

66
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,916
For the music part,
I might tweak the arrangement a bit.

67
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,375
I'll make some coffee. Do you want some?

68
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,416
Sure.

69
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,166
Sounds like a plan then.

70
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,125
Now, where's the contract?

71
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,458
No problem.

72
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,625
How did you get this? I bought one too.

73
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,916
That means you've got great taste.

74
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Thanks.

75
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,833
Are you free tonight?

76
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,500
Want to grab dinner?

77
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,833
I've already got plans for tonight,
maybe next time.

78
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,541
A date?

79
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,500
Is it with your bandmate?

80
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,291
Hey, how about spaghetti
for dinner tonight?

81
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,583
I've already bought all the ingredients.

82
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,375
Let me tell you,

83
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,708
you won't believe
how crazy my first day at work was.

84
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,208
Hello?

85
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,208
Hello, are you busy?

86
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,833
<i>I won't be home tonight.</i>

87
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,541
<i>I'm staying at Renxiu's place.</i>

88
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,625
That's fine. Is Zhe doing okay?

89
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,041
Hello? Are you still there?

90
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,125
Hello?

91
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,750
<i>I've got to get back to work.</i>

92
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,583
<i>- I'll talk to you later.</i>
- Well…

93
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,375
The city bears, on their birthday,

94
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,291
decided to go camping in the mountains.

95
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,375
Wow, it's so beautiful here.

96
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,333
Let's camp here tonight.

97
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,708
- Welcome, come on in.
- Okay.

98
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,333
Little one, are you bored?

99
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,916
Sorry, my son doesn't talk much.

100
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,250
No worries.

101
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,958
Feel free to take a look at
the information.

102
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,041
Hey, little one, if you're bored,
how about drawing with this?

103
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,791
Thank you.

104
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,958
If it's more convenient for you,

105
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,416
we also offer remote digital financial
services for online consultations.

106
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,083
Zhe,

107
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,000
Mom and Dad just need to talk
for a little while.

108
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,083
We'll be done soon, okay?

109
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,791
I wanted to check,

110
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,375
have you planned for
an education fund before?

111
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:14,875
- No, we haven't.
- No.

112
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:15,875
I see.

113
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,083
Here's the thing.

114
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,166
We had a joint savings account before,

115
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,750
mainly for covering
our son's living expenses.

116
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,500
But now that we're divorced,

117
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,041
there might be some extra-curricular
classes he needs to pay for.

118
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,000
Got it.

119
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:31,583
We'd like to plan for
his educational expenses.

120
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,750
Understood.

121
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,916
Hey, Liu, sorry for the delay.

122
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,708
I'm near the MRT station.

123
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,333
Where's that café you mentioned?

124
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,541
Thanks again for your help today.
No problem.

125
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,583
Let's go.

126
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,208
Yeah.

127
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,250
Alright. Alright, see you soon.

128
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,583
Bye.

129
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:02,666
KAI MISSED CALL

130
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,541
Sorry, sorry.

131
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,875
I worked overtime and lost track of time.

132
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,041
So, is your new job at a big company
or something?

133
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,666
Why has it taken two weeks
just to schedule a practice session?

134
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,625
We finally got a time,
and you still forgot.

135
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,416
I'm really sorry.

136
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,458
How about I treat you all
to a late-night snack?

137
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,208
Food, huh?

138
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,916
- Alright, let's go.
- No need, Bigfoot.

139
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,708
You've got work tomorrow, right?

140
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,875
You've got your new life now.

141
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,333
You're not like us anymore.

142
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,250
I promise it won't happen again.

143
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,583
So when should we schedule next?

144
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,291
How about the weekend?
We can practice two days straight

145
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,916
and make up for the time you missed.

146
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,541
But you probably don't want to

147
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,583
because you want to be with Yi-Ming Jiang.

148
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,833
It's really because of work,
it has nothing to do with Yi-Ming.

149
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,958
- Weekend practice is fine.
- I get that you're busy with work.

150
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,250
We all need to make money.

151
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,291
But you can't do weekdays,

152
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,708
and on weekends,
you can't practice all day either.

153
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,125
We need to book you in advance
just to meet up.

154
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,500
Sorry… But aren't you…

155
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,166
getting too hard to schedule with?

156
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,166
I'm honestly doing
my best to coordinate my time.

157
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,541
You were the one who wanted

158
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,666
to form a band in the first place.

159
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,833
Now, with this on-and-off attitude,

160
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,583
I'm not into it anymore.

161
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,625
Wait until you've thought it through.

162
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,208
He's still upset.

163
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,083
That canceled performance
really disappointed him,

164
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,166
and now with you changing jobs,

165
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,708
he feels like it's out of character
for you.

166
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,916
Just wait for him to cool off.

167
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,166
This is good.

168
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,083
Sorry to interrupt,

169
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,833
I've been listening to your music,
could I get an autograph?

170
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,500
- Of course.
- Thank you.

171
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,500
Thanks so much.

172
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,166
What about you? Want an autograph too?

173
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,041
Thanks, but I'm good.

174
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,500
So… are you going to apologize to Kai?

175
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,500
I'll do it later.

176
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,208
Knowing his personality,

177
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,458
he won't listen to anything
I say right now.

178
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,083
It's just frustrating.

179
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,750
Work has been so busy with the event,
and now this happens.

180
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,250
How's your new job going?

181
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,791
Not exactly what I imagined.

182
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,500
What do you mean?

183
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,416
Even though I juggled two
or three jobs at once,

184
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,000
at least I had a lot of freedom.

185
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,916
I got to meet different people every day,
and face new challenges.

186
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,625
It was stressful sometimes,
but at least it was never boring.

187
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,833
Now, it's just sitting in the office,

188
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,958
seeing the same people every day,
doing almost the same tasks.

189
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,541
Meetings are full of finger-pointing.

190
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,750
Everyone's in little cliques.
It's exhausting.

191
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,208
But you've only been there a short time.

192
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,208
It feels like it's been a year already.

193
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,500
If you really don't like it, why not quit?

194
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,708
No,

195
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,666
I don't want my girlfriend to think
I'm just… all talk.

196
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,083
So you're staying

197
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,875
in a job you don't like for love?

198
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,416
Is that necessary?

199
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,458
I wouldn't call it a sacrifice.

200
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,750
Part of it is for her,

201
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,958
but part of it is for me, too. I'm 30 now.

202
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,458
I want to see how far I can go.

203
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,666
And besides, my mom's getting older.

204
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,541
If she can't work later,
I'll have to support her.

205
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,958
I can't rely on part-time jobs to do that.

206
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,375
I want my family to feel secure too.

207
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,208
You're thinking of everyone else.

208
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,625
What about you?

209
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,083
They're people I really care about.

210
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,041
Here's to you.

211
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,958
To me?

212
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,625
To your kind and thoughtful heart.

213
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,916
Thank you.

214
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,083
And I'll toast to you.

215
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,291
What for?

216
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,208
To…

217
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,875
Even though we haven't known
each other for long,

218
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,708
you always manage to encourage me
without even trying.

219
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,250
So…

220
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,625
does that mean
I'm pretty important to you?

221
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:01,708
And then, I ended up using
my coworker's cup

222
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,291
and even asked her if she wanted coffee.

223
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,625
- How embarrassing.
- Yeah, super embarrassing.

224
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,166
I've never done anything that awkward
at my part-time jobs before.

225
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,000
- You're so adorable.
- Really?

226
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:21,125
Kai always says
I'm scary after I've had a drink.

227
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,041
Not at all.

228
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,333
I think you're more smiley when you drink.

229
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,791
- You look beautiful when you smile.
- Thank you.

230
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,500
Ting-Ting,

231
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,875
I…

232
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:51,041
don't just want to be someone
who encourages you

233
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,750
or a close friend.

234
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,125
I'm serious about this.

235
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,166
I already have a girlfriend.

236
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,041
I know,

237
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,791
but I still hope you'll consider it.

238
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,583
I won't put any pressure on you.

239
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,333
I could play music with you,

240
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,250
travel with you,

241
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,958
do whatever you want to do.

242
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,125
I want to be there for you.

243
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,000
You're back.
I didn't hear you come in earlier.

244
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,041
Were you busy?

245
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,333
Did you drink?

246
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,166
You didn't ride your scooter back,
did you?

247
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,666
No, I didn't.

248
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,208
Are you free now?

249
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:14,500
I need to finish this report
and send it to my colleague before ten.

250
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,833
How about we see a movie tomorrow
since we have the day off?

251
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,625
I saw one that looks really good today.

252
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:31,916
Tomorrow?

253
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,208
I can't. I'm taking Zhe to the park.

254
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,500
I could come along.

255
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,333
Maybe next time.

256
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,208
I told Zhe it'd just be the two of us.

257
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,208
But I haven't seen him in a while either.

258
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,458
I'll just hang out nearby.

259
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,041
What time are you meeting?

260
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,125
Four o'clock. Four in the afternoon.

261
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:27,833
I can swing by after picking up
a package in the morning.

262
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,666
It's fine, you don't have to.

263
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:33,791
I'm not busy.

264
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll go take a shower.

265
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,250
NING CALLING

266
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,500
NING MISSED CALL

267
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,708
TAKE YOUR TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.

268
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:18,875
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU. GOOD NIGHT.

269
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:40,000
The wheel is missing.
The wheel is missing.

270
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,958
Zhe, Mom already checked the park,

271
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,375
it's not here.

272
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:45,750
Maybe it didn't fall here.

273
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:48,916
It could be at home.
Let's go home and check, okay?

274
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,750
Zhe, Zhe,

275
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,750
Zhe, let's go home and check, okay?

276
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:54,916
Let's go home and check.

277
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,750
Alright, come on.
You're going to hit someone.

278
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,125
Sit here and calm down for ten minutes.

279
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,625
The wheel is missing.

280
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,875
The wheel is missing.

281
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,041
Excuse me, did he hit you just now?

282
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,291
Did he hit you?

283
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,708
Are you alright? Sorry about that.

284
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:10,333
It might be safer

285
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,333
if you play over there.

286
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,416
Zhe, it's really hot here.
Let's go over there.

287
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,041
- The wheel is missing.
- Zhe.

288
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,375
- The wheel is missing.
- Alright. Zhe.

289
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,125
I told you not to come.

290
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,208
It's fine.

291
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,083
- The wheel is missing.
- Alright, it's okay.

292
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:29,708
Mommy is here.

293
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,875
- The wheel is missing.
- It's alright.

294
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:41,541
This…

295
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,333
never mind.

296
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:04,333
Why didn't you tell me
Zhe hasn't been doing well lately?

297
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,750
I didn't know how to say it.

298
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,083
Why not?

299
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,333
I'm really tired right now.
Can we not discuss this?

300
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:24,583
If you need help with anything,
you can tell me, you know?

301
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:32,791
I told you not to come today.

302
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,458
You always leave things unsaid.
You've been like this from the start.

303
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:41,666
Didn't I tell you that
you can talk to me about anything?

304
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,208
I want to share
these responsibilities with you,

305
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:50,708
but you don't tell me anything.

306
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,416
I don't know what to do.

307
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,791
Zhe isn't your responsibility.

308
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,708
You don't have to help me with this.

309
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,666
I don't understand.

310
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:12,791
I'm your girlfriend. Why do you
always treat me like an outsider?

311
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,250
I'm not treating you like an outsider.

312
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,500
Do you think I haven't noticed?

313
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,083
You don't even have the courage
to introduce me properly to others.

314
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,916
We're together.

315
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,875
Why do I have to explain our relationship
to everyone?

316
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,000
Is that really so important?

317
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:37,958
Yes, it's important.

318
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:40,625
We love each other.
There's nothing wrong with that.

319
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,333
Why do we have to hide?

320
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,916
When you were with Renxiu,

321
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,958
did you feel weird holding hands
in public?

322
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,541
I…

323
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,833
I don't get why you're comparing this.

324
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,208
In the end,
are you ashamed of our relationship?

325
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,083
That's not how I feel.

326
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:08,166
But your actions say otherwise.

327
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:10,291
Fine.

328
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,583
In front of others,

329
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,333
acknowledging it
might not be important to you,

330
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:14,958
but aren't two people in a relationship

331
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,750
supposed to support each other
and grow together?

332
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,333
I'm willing to do anything for you,
to make you part of my future,

333
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,666
why do you keep pushing me away?

334
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,875
Ting-Ting Zhong,
you're getting emotional right now.

335
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,791
This is really frustrating.

336
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,208
These things aren't even your concern.

337
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,416
Yi-Ming Jiang,

338
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,916
didn't we agree to face things together?

339
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,416
Didn't you promise me?

340
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,291
I've been working so hard
to find a full-time job,

341
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,875
all because I want to

342
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:00,083
make myself stronger,
to be someone you can rely on.

343
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:03,166
I want to ease your burdens.

344
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,375
And that barstool.

345
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,000
I know how much you liked it,
so I secretly ordered it,

346
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,333
hoping to surprise you.

347
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,625
I've done all this,

348
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,958
just hoping
we can have a good future together.

349
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,666
Now you're saying
it's none of my business?

350
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,750
What do I mean to you, then?

351
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,000
Do we really have to talk
about this right now?

352
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,125
Why can't we address our problems?

353
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:28,750
You want to talk?

354
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,000
You can't afford the barstools.

355
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,958
You hate working full-time.

356
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,500
Now you're taking all
your frustrations out on me,

357
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,250
claiming it's for my sake.
I never asked for that.

358
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,250
I never pressured you.

359
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,291
You talk about sharing responsibilities,

360
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,208
but you're putting a lot of
pressure on me. Do you realize that?

361
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,041
You want to talk? Fine.

362
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:57,041
Are you sure you've told me everything?

363
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,000
That you're not hiding anything from me?

364
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:11,291
So, everything I've done for you
is just a burden?

365
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:14,875
Is that what you're saying?

366
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,166
Get on.

367
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,708
Are you ready?
