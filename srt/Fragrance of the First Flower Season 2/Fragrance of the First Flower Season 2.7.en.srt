1
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,375
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,250
TAKE YOUR TIME,
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU. GOOD NIGHT.

3
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,166
THE SONG IS FIXED. WANT TO LISTEN?

4
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,208
TING-TING

5
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,791
Hey,

6
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,458
What's wrong?

7
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,958
Where are you?

8
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,208
Get on.

9
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,583
Are you buckled up?

10
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,583
You really like her that much?

11
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,375
I like her so much…

12
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,291
That's probably why
things are like this now.

13
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,958
Have you known her for a long time?

14
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,875
We met in high school.

15
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,791
Since the moment I met her,

16
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,583
she has always been special to me.

17
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,458
So when we met again,

18
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,083
I was really happy.

19
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,333
But we are totally different.

20
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,541
She's rational,

21
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,833
careful with everything she does.

22
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,708
As for me, well,

23
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,666
you know…

24
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,541
I'm more impulsive.

25
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,791
I think if you love someone,
you should be together, right?

26
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,083
At first, I didn't
think it was a big deal.

27
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,208
I even thought if I tried harder,
I could make up for her passiveness.

28
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,541
But no matter what I do, it seems wrong.

29
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,916
I bought her gifts she didn't like,

30
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,125
tried to spend time with
her son, and messed that up too.

31
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,208
The more I try to get close to her,

32
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,875
the more she pulls away.

33
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,541
I feel like such a failure.

34
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,291
I keep saying I love her,

35
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,041
but today I realized,

36
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,375
in her eyes,
maybe I don't understand her at all.

37
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,916
I've probably been
pressuring her too much.

38
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,166
Ting-Ting,

39
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,208
I completely understand

40
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,708
what it's like
to want someone to be happy.

41
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,958
But sometimes, the more you try,

42
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,166
the harder it gets.

43
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,041
And the other person
might not even feel it.

44
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,333
You might think you're
loving her the wrong way,

45
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,875
but it's not all on you.

46
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,625
If she doesn't notice your efforts,

47
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,000
or gently tell you what's wrong,

48
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,000
it means she doesn't
understand you either.

49
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,666
I don't know her,

50
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,250
but from what I see,

51
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,416
you deserve to be treated well.

52
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,125
I don't want you thinking like this.

53
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,166
What you need to ask yourself now is,

54
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,583
are you happy

55
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:27,958
in this relationship?

56
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,375
I am happy.

57
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,708
We have so many happy memories.

58
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,625
Then why are you so sad now?

59
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,541
Whenever I'm feeling down,
I come here to look at the night view.

60
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,375
All those messy feelings and noises,

61
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,708
they get smaller and smaller.

62
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,500
And I feel calm again.

63
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,000
I thought you never got upset.

64
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,791
Please,

65
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,125
I'm human too.

66
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,958
I have plenty of bad days.

67
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,416
Don't you think
what I just said was pretty touching?

68
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,666
Thank you.

69
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,625
Silly,

70
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,375
as long as you're happy,
that's what matters.

71
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,625
You're back.

72
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,791
Go to bed.

73
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:05,875
Don't be like this.

74
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,291
Good morning.

75
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,458
Good morning.

76
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,750
Breakfast.

77
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,958
Thanks.

78
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,208
Last night, I…

79
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,500
I took the morning off.

80
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,416
I'm taking Zhe to his follow-up now.

81
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,166
Oh.

82
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,375
Should we find some time to talk?

83
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,666
Let's talk later.

84
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,500
I might be working late tonight.

85
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,666
- Then maybe…
- Renxiu is here.

86
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll head down.

87
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,791
Make sure you have breakfast, okay?

88
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,416
Watch the stairs.

89
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,416
So based on your performance needs,

90
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,750
we can place four monitor speakers.

91
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,916
You need to check with the performers
if they have any special requirements

92
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,250
and let us know.

93
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,458
As for the outdoor speakers,
I'll place four.

94
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,333
Does that work, Kai?

95
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,625
Sounds good.

96
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,791
You'll send us a new layout, right?

97
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,708
Yes, we'll also send you an updated quote.

98
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,666
Here's the new schedule,
let's go over it to confirm.

99
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,625
It's more convenient
with the table set up there, right?

100
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,000
- Got it.
- Oh, Kai, I almost forgot.

101
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,000
Didn't you need
to confirm the number of microphones?

102
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,541
Who should we check that with?

103
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,291
Leave it to Ting-Ting.

104
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,666
Also, coordinate with the sound engineer
about the rehearsal.

105
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,500
I'll head up to check the schedule.
It'll be faster if we split the tasks.

106
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,958
- OK.
- OK.

107
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:09,958
Thanks.

108
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,333
Actually, there aren't many changes
to the new schedule,

109
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,041
just a bit of time crunch for some people.

110
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,500
How's it going, Miss Zhong? Need any help?

111
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,458
All your favorites.

112
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,750
Why did you approach
my company for this job?

113
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,875
The company mentioned
an event, and I thought of you all.

114
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,666
Oh, thanks.

115
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,625
So now you can
introduce us to new projects?

116
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,875
How many microphones do we need?

117
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,458
Just because I work at a company

118
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,416
now doesn't mean
I don't care about Departed.

119
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,833
When the performance got canceled,

120
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,916
seeing you and Bigfoot so disappointed

121
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,500
really hit me too.

122
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,250
I was the one who pulled you all
into forming the band,

123
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,875
but… we haven't achieved anything.

124
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,125
It's not like I want to give up,

125
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,958
I just need more time

126
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,583
to figure out the best way forward.

127
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,708
If you don't want to
talk about it now, that's okay.

128
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,208
Four microphones,

129
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,708
one for the host, one for the performer,
and two spares for you.

130
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,208
- I'm back.
- You're back?

131
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,333
Finally.

132
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,166
I brought something delicious
for everyone.

133
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,958
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks, boss.

134
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,916
Are you free tonight?
Help me pick out a gift.

135
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,208
So, how long after the implantation
can you test for pregnancy?

136
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,916
In a few days, we should know the result.

137
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,916
Are you nervous?

138
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,250
I think it'll work out.

139
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,458
Stay calm.

140
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,000
Yushan is really looking forward to it.

141
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,291
I'm thinking that on the day we find out,

142
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,666
I'll prepare a romantic candlelight dinner

143
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,250
and give her a gift.

144
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,208
Hello, how can I assist you today?

145
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,916
Does this come in different sizes?

146
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,083
Yes, it does.
Are you buying this for yourself?

147
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,625
Oh no, for my wife.

148
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:19,125
She's 165cm tall, 47 kg,
with a small frame.

149
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,500
Alright, let me check if we have it
in stock and get a new one for you.

150
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,083
- Please wait a moment.
- Okay, thank you.

151
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,875
You're such a model wife.

152
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,125
Right? Take notes.

153
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,791
I had a great time having dinner
at your place the other day.

154
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,000
Maybe next time,

155
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,583
we can take you two out to a restaurant?

156
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,500
Hmm.

157
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,583
Sure.

158
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,041
Sure?

159
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,583
What's wrong?

160
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:02,375
Lately… things have…
been a bit tense between us.

161
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,291
Why?

162
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,083
Because my son
needs to adjust to school life,

163
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,291
and I've been hoping
she could give me a little space.

164
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,125
A few things happened in between,

165
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,250
and now it's harder

166
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,208
to communicate with her.

167
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,250
She even said I should
consider the future more.

168
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,458
What did you say to her?

169
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,375
I didn't know how to respond.

170
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,791
Well. When you first started dating,

171
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,458
did it matter to you
whether it was acknowledged?

172
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,833
Of course, I cared a lot.

173
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,416
I really wanted to know

174
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,333
what kind of place I held in her heart.

175
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,208
But everyone cares about different things.

176
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,791
Give yourself some time.

177
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,500
How about this?
You pick out a gift for her,

178
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,666
and when the moment is just right,
with the perfect mood and lighting,

179
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,208
give it to her.

180
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,291
At the end of the day,
the most important thing

181
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,500
is respect and communication.

182
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:13,708
It'll get better.

183
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,416
Excuse me, your item is packed.

184
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,791
Will you be paying by card or cash?

185
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:19,958
Card.

186
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,458
Alright, please wait a moment.

187
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,250
You're back.

188
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,250
Sorry,

189
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,833
Jingchuan called me
for something last minute tonight.

190
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,833
Have you eaten?

191
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:35,791
Yeah.

192
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:44,583
How about tomorrow after work,
we go watch that movie?

193
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,750
The one you've been wanting to see?

194
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,625
Sure. Should we meet earlier
and grab dinner first?

195
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,291
Hmm.

196
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,916
Go take a shower. Good night.

197
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,375
Hello, I'd like to make a reservation.

198
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:53,041
Two seats by the window for 6:30 tonight.

199
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,291
My last name is Jiang.

200
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,041
Alright, thank you.

201
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,916
Now, this space is the venue
we're planning to collaborate with.

202
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:13,666
This is the current stage layout.

203
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,875
Although the stage isn't very large,

204
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:20,250
this venue overall
meets the requirements for our event.

205
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,166
I need to resolve the issue we had
last time with the audience leaving.

206
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,791
We can't have the same problem this time.

207
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,208
This time we will…

208
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,375
WE'RE MEETING AT 6:30 TONIGHT.

209
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:29,541
DON'T BE LATE!

210
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,333
- …to guide audience movement.
- We will improve it.

211
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:33,416
Right.

212
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,250
We have also made arrangements to…

213
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,041
Sorry, I had meetings all day.

214
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,875
I didn't expect to be this late. Let's go.

215
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,583
We don't need to go in anymore.

216
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,333
They couldn't hold
the reservation this long.

217
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,125
Why didn't you just go in and wait for me?

218
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,541
They insisted everyone had to be there.

219
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,375
How about we head to the alley next door?

220
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,500
There are quite a few
food stalls there, no waiting.

221
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:23,833
Or would you prefer something else?

222
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,583
No, it's fine. Let's go.

223
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,208
It's no problem,
I can check for nearby restaurants.

224
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,666
No need, really. Let's just go.

225
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,875
I don't want you to force yourself.

226
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,791
I'm not forcing myself.
Where are the food stalls?

227
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,875
Over there? Let's go.

228
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:41,833
Oh.

229
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,541
Hello. What movie
would you like to see today?

230
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,916
Hello, I'd like two tickets
for the 8:55 showing of <i>The Storm.</i>

231
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,166
For 8:55?

232
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,750
That show is sold out.
The earliest available is 11:30 p.m.

233
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:28,250
- That late?
- How about the 9:15 one?

234
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,208
Sure.

235
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,500
9:15… That's sold out too.

236
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:35,708
Let me check.
There's a 9:30 for <i>The Phantom.</i>

237
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,125
Forget it, you don't
even like horror movies.

238
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,500
It's fine.
If you want to watch it, we can.

239
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,625
I'm really okay.
It's not even the movie I wanted to see.

240
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,750
Then let's just take the 11:30 one.

241
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,541
That's too late. We have work tomorrow.

242
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,708
It's okay.

243
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,041
- Two tickets, please.
- Forget it.

244
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,333
Yi-Ming,

245
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,166
do you two want to discuss first?

246
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,958
I'll help the next customer
in the meantime.

247
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,250
- Sorry about that.
- Sorry about that.

248
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,208
No problem.

249
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,791
Hello, what movie
would you like to see today?

250
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,833
If there's nothing to
watch, then just forget it.

251
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,250
We can go home.

252
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,041
But you've been wanting to watch a movie.

253
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,541
But there are no showings.

254
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:18,583
We can just watch the last one, at 11:30.

255
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,708
And in the meantime, we can sit at a café.

256
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,041
But we have work tomorrow.

257
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:27,458
I really don't want to anymore.

258
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,625
If you're going to keep acting
like nothing's wrong, then fine.

259
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,708
Ting-Ting Zhong.

260
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:49,916
I'm sorry.

261
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,958
I should be the one apologizing,

262
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:14,291
but right now, I honestly don't know
what to do to make you happy.

263
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,375
Are you in love with someone else?

264
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:32,458
What are you talking about?

265
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,791
After that big fight,

266
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,416
I've been thinking nonstop.

267
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,291
You should find
someone who truly understands you.

268
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,208
You'd be happier that way.

269
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,500
Why are you thinking like this?

270
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,750
You say I never speak up,

271
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:57,041
but I'm just really dumb. I honestly
don't know how to talk about it.

272
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,583
Then I start wondering,

273
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,541
maybe I don't even know how to love.

274
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,333
Maybe I wasn't ready
for this relationship at all.

275
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
What do you mean you weren't ready?

276
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:18,791
Or are you hoping I fall in love
with someone else, so it's easier for you?

277
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,500
Why are you saying things like that?

278
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,833
Then who was the one
avoiding the conversation?

279
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:29,208
I wasn't avoiding it. I just thought
maybe if you didn't love me,

280
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,708
you'd be happier.

281
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,541
You've already taken the first step.

282
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,208
Why give up now?

283
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,291
It's been so many years.

284
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,125
Do you know how hard I've worked
to try to make things different this time?

285
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,583
Have I not tried hard too?

286
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:02,625
Have I not put in the effort?
I've tried so hard.

287
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:08,625
Then why does your fear
negate my entire existence?

288
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,541
Or do you regret it?

289
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,958
Are you planning to disappear again?
