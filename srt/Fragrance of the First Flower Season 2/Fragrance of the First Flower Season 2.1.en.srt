1
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,333
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,166
RESUME

3
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,333
BUS STOP

4
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,416
Hello. Your delivery has arrived.

5
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,416
Oh, great.

6
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,583
Thanks.

7
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,208
- Let's have breakfast first.
- Sure.

8
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,916
- Dig in.
- Dig in.

9
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,375
I've been tracking the views
on every post.

10
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,250
The shares weren't that great yesterday.

11
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,541
We need to think about
how to get more people to know us.

12
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,250
And increase our fans' engagement.

13
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,083
Kai-Chi Zhang. You keep saying
you'll write a new song,

14
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,250
but is it done yet?

15
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,833
And you even stole my breakfast.

16
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,250
Where's the song?

17
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,833
- Where's the song?
- Where's the song?

18
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,375
I'm out here hustling for gigs,
managing our social media part-time,

19
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,958
and now you're asking me to write songs?

20
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,375
Well, you are…
The leader, the soul of the band, right?

21
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,958
Everyone knows half of our fans are here
because of you.

22
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,916
The former cheerleading star…

23
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,083
<i>The sweet charmer, Ting-Ting.</i>

24
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:57,791
We're doomed.

25
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,916
Alright, I'm just kidding.

26
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,708
Actually, I recently finished a demo.

27
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,458
That's the best thing
I've heard in a while.

28
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,625
If we're lucky enough
to perform at the music festival,

29
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,333
we could debut that song.

30
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,833
- A-Kai.
- A-Kai.

31
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,791
Uh, sorry, I'll
reluctantly accept Ting-Ting's thanks.

32
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,458
But you, Da-Jiao, don't need to.
Why don't you go practice the drums?

33
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,666
Practice drums?

34
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,625
Who was offbeat just now?

35
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,541
Was it me?

36
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,250
- What?
- Bring your sheet music.

37
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,541
- Where was I offbeat?
- Come on.

38
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm telling you, my strumming speed
is so fast you can't even see it.

39
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,083
Oh yeah? I can hit ten beats per second.

40
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,250
- Seriously?
- Can you do that?

41
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,333
- Wow, the drummer strikes back.
- Can you do that?

42
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,000
The only reason I was
offbeat was because of the bass…

43
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,000
Hey, where are you going?

44
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,250
I'm covering for the cheer squad.

45
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,625
- Didn't you quit?
- Yeah.

46
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,708
One of the juniors caught a cold,
so I'm helping out.

47
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,208
- Alright.
- Don't be late for tomorrow's gig.

48
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,958
- Bye.
- Hey, Ting-Ting Jhong.

49
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,416
For you.

50
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,416
Stay safe on the roads.

51
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,541
Okay, bye-bye.

52
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,250
Miss Jiang. Thank you
for coming in for the interview today.

53
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,125
We'll let you know if there's any news.

54
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,833
Thank you.

55
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you.

56
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,958
Thank you for helping out today.

57
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,708
We couldn't have managed without you.

58
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,000
No problem.
Haven't seen you guys in a while either.

59
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,000
Let me know if you need help
in the future. I can do photo shoots too.

60
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,208
Alright, last time
the client asked about you.

61
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,208
- Really?
- Yeah.

62
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,583
- I'm gonna count on you then.
- Okay, thanks.

63
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,500
- Thank you.
- Bye.

64
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,541
Bye.

65
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,291
‪COURT

66
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,750
Almost late.

67
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,958
Made it just in time. No worries.

68
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,500
I'll go deliver table three's order first.

69
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,750
Oh, okay.

70
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:48,750
<i>Hold on a sec.</i>

71
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,208
<i>Xiao-Zhe, your mom's calling.</i>

72
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,916
Sweetie, how are you today?

73
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,500
<i>This is the red fire truck Grandma bought.</i>

74
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,333
Wow, really? It's so pretty.

75
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,541
Did you thank Grandma?

76
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,333
<i>This is a new red fire truck</i>

77
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,291
Where's your police car?

78
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,833
<i>Here.</i>

79
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,041
<i>You can't mix fire trucks</i>
<i>and police cars together.</i>

80
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,291
<i>They're different.</i>

81
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,833
Yes, they're different vehicles.

82
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,250
Did you eat enough for dinner?

83
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,500
Did you eat a lot?

84
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,916
Eating a lot helps
you grow tall, you know.

85
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,625
If you need anything,
you can call Mommy, alright?

86
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,916
Mommy's going to eat now.

87
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,791
I'll call you tomorrow.

88
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,708
Yi-Ming. Yi-Ming Jiang.

89
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,333
What exactly do you want?

90
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,041
I'm sorry.

91
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,791
So, are you going to leave me again?

92
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,041
Your qualifications match pretty well.

93
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,208
For the R&D assistant position,
it's just that

94
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,791
you have a bit less work experience.

95
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,666
But that's okay.

96
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,625
As long as you're willing to learn,
it's not a big issue.

97
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,583
As for the job itself,
it's pretty much what I just explained.

98
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,750
Do you have any questions?

99
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,333
No questions, everything's clear.

100
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,541
Good.

101
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,958
That's pretty much it from my side.

102
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,625
In a bit, I'll need you
to have a second interview with the boss.

103
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,375
Just wait a moment,
I'll arrange it for you.

104
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,416
- Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

105
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,875
- Chen-Chen, don't run around.
- Careful.

106
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,041
- Sorry about that.
- No worries.

107
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,500
Keep doing this
and I will have to kick you out.

108
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,083
No worries. You're too cute, aren't you?

109
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,250
Sorry, here's your turmeric rice
with chicken thigh.

110
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,208
Thank you.

111
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,958
- Is your name Chen-Chen?
- Yeah.

112
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,208
Big sis has a little gift for you, okay?

113
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

114
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,166
Is this your first time here?

115
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,625
Yes.

116
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,958
Do you like flowers?

117
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,916
- I do.
- You do?

118
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,250
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Yes!

119
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,291
Alright, here you go.

120
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,375
Thank you, big sis!

121
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,833
You're welcome.

122
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,125
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

123
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,041
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes.

124
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,291
- Here you go.
- You okay?

125
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,333
- This is the salad Xiao-Juan ordered.
- Thank you.

126
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,541
- Dressing on the side.
- Thanks.

127
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,375
This is the seasonal
veggie pasta Liu Jie ordered.

128
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,791
- Thank you.
- And this for our new friend.

129
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,416
- The pesto chicken thigh pasta.
- Thanks.

130
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,125
Your half-sugar, less-ice milk tea
will be brought over in a bit.

131
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,666
Okay, thanks!

132
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,583
You know, you should stop being a waitress

133
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,791
and come work at our company.

134
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,416
Liu Jie, don't say that.

135
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,041
It's hard to be a waitress these days.

136
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,750
They are in demand.

137
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,458
I'm serious.

138
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,708
Our department needs an event planner.

139
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,333
You're so quick on your feet.

140
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,625
No way. I can't sit still in an office.

141
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,250
Unless you'd let me sleep in
and come to work whenever I wake up?

142
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,458
Dream on.

143
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,208
Then, sorry.

144
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,833
Alright, if you want a refill,
just let me know.

145
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,416
- Okay, thanks.
- Enjoy.

146
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,583
Thank you.

147
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,458
DON'T BE LATE FOR BAND PRACTICE LATER

148
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,833
OKAY

149
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:02,833
Ting-Ting.

150
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:04,958
Coming.

151
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,583
Over here. Take a seat for a moment.

152
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,541
Okay.

153
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,958
Hello, boss. I'm Yi-Ming Jiang.

154
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,125
So, you're Yi-Ming Jiang, right?

155
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,541
Boss, I've set up the internet connection.
Let me know if you need anything else.

156
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,041
Alright, thanks.

157
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,291
- Hello.
- Hello.

158
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,500
Just call me Jing-Chuan.

159
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,541
I've got another meeting in a bit,
so have a seat.

160
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,541
- Have you heard of our company before?
- Yes.

161
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,166
Our company has only been
officially established for a year.

162
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,833
Currently, we only have
one type of probiotic on the market.

163
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,708
But this year, we plan to
open three more production lines,

164
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,958
so we're actively looking for
research assistants.

165
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,791
I see that your qualifications match well,
but after graduation,

166
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,875
you didn't continue working
and instead did some part-time jobs.

167
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,166
I originally planned

168
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,875
to go to the US with my husband
for further studies after graduation,

169
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,250
but after having a child,

170
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,375
I shifted my focus to family.

171
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,625
So why are you
looking to return to work now?

172
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,458
My child started first grade this year,

173
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,041
so with him in school
during the day, I have more time.

174
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,166
I also feel ready to
re-enter the workforce.

175
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:27,208
Why do you think our company
should hire you,

176
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,000
someone without recent experience,
and a mother at that?

177
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,208
Although I'm a mother,
it doesn't mean I haven't been working.

178
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,250
Those years weren't for nothing.

179
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,625
Back in school,
I also worked on similar projects.

180
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,333
I understand that in the past two years,

181
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,083
there's been a huge market opportunity
for health supplements,

182
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,125
especially probiotics.

183
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,958
People who make purchases
are usually the children of parents,

184
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,083
and mothers of small children, like me.

185
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,208
So, I believe having a mother

186
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,916
as a product development assistant
could be a valuable advantage

187
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
for the company.

188
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,666
- You've prepared.
- Yes.

189
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,083
What's your zodiac sign?

190
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,083
Is that part of the consideration too?

191
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,083
I'm a Capricorn.

192
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,750
Great!
The R&D department needs an earth sign

193
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,833
to balance out all the fire signs.

194
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,583
Alright, I've got
another meeting to attend.

195
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,333
As for salary and benefits,
I'll have someone follow up with you.

196
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,333
Looking forward to working with you.

197
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,625
Thank you.

198
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,458
Hey, sorry.

199
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,000
- Are you okay?
- I'm alright.

200
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,333
The café was busier today.

201
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,833
- You must be tired.
- Not too bad, I'm okay.

202
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,916
- Hey, let me help you.
- Hold on a sec.

203
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:38,791
- Where do you want to put it?
- Put it…

204
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,875
- Put it over there.
- Over there? Okay.

205
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,000
- Be careful.
- Alright.

206
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,375
- Oh right, just there. Yes.
- Here?

207
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,375
Hi, everyone. We are Departed.

208
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,541
I'm A-Kai, the guitarist.

209
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,500
Our drummer, Da-Jiao,
and our bassist, Ting-Ting Jhong.

210
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,375
Alright, so today, it's our first time
stepping out of the practice room

211
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,833
to meet everyone.

212
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,500
This is because we might
have a more formal performance coming up.

213
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,666
So today is kind of
like a trial show for us.

214
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,583
Next, we're going to perform a song
about first love.

215
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,333
Here's "I Love You, But…" Thank you.

216
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,666
<i>That fearless wind</i>

217
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,000
<i>Blows through us</i>

218
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,375
<i>Mocking</i>

219
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:54,291
<i>That centimeter distance?</i>

220
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,708
<i>Who could have known?</i>

221
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,208
<i>Who could have known?</i>

222
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:09,708
<i>It would be unforgettable forever</i>

223
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:29,583
<i>I can no longer</i>

224
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>Hold my breath</i>

225
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,000
<i>It's a desire to live</i>

226
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:39,541
<i>I have to get closer to you</i>

227
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:44,750
<i>Even if blooming</i>

228
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,250
<i>Eventually leads to withering</i>

229
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:52,125
<i>How can I deny</i>

230
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:58,833
<i>That this was the day</i>
<i>I truly came to know the world?</i>

231
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,083
Thank you, everyone.

232
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,666
Thank you.

233
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,250
- Da-Jiao, here's yours.
- Thanks.

234
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,333
Ting-Ting Jhong,

235
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,291
for you.

236
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,291
Thanks.

237
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,625
Hey, what happened earlier?

238
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,833
Nothing, really.
I thought I saw an old friend,

239
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,083
but I must've been mistaken.

240
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,666
From the look on your face,
I thought something was up.

241
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,125
Hey, a fan gave us flowers!

242
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,333
So romantic.

243
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,666
No way.

244
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,833
What kind of flowers are these?

245
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,666
White roses, maybe?

246
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,375
Obviously not.

247
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,666
They're gardenias.

248
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,208
That's a rare choice.

249
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,333
Here, take them.

250
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,041
I'll put this inside.

251
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,416
DEVOTION, JOY, ETERNAL LOVE

252
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,625
