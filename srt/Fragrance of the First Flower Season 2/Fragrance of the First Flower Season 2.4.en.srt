1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,458
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,666
YI-MING: WANT TO TALK?

3
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,625
BEAUTIFUL, SEE YOU NEXT TIME.
HOW ABOUT THIS WEEKEND? WANT TO TALK?

4
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,500
Slippers are over here.

5
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,166
Thanks.

6
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,541
I have work tomorrow,
so I won't stay long.

7
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,791
Alright, then…
Do you want to sit for a bit?

8
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,833
Have you eaten?

9
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,125
I'll pour you some water, okay?

10
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,541
No need to trouble yourself.
Just sit down.

11
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,750
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,166
You shouldn't have had to hear that.

13
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,458
He didn't mean it.

14
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,041
I'm not upset about what he said.

15
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,416
I even understand why he's so angry.

16
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,166
I just never thought--

17
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,500
and didn't want-- Xiao-Zhe
to get hurt because of me.

18
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,958
I'm the one who chose to get divorced.

19
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,541
It has nothing to do with you.

20
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,541
But if I want to…
keep working on this relationship,

21
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,500
I need to face it, right?

22
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,750
I've been thinking
a lot these past two days.

23
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,000
I know you love Zhe,
and don't want him to get hurt.

24
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,833
I feel the same way.

25
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,291
I want to face this with you.

26
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,750
I want Zhe to feel not
like he's lost his mom's love,

27
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,125
but that he has even
more love than others.

28
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,125
Stay, okay?

29
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,333
If I face this with you, will you?

30
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,125
Then you can't run away this time.

31
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,958
Zhong Ting-Ting.

32
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,708
Thank you.

33
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,583
I should be the one thanking you.

34
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,583
Thank you for not forgetting
our birthday promise.

35
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,708
Do you want some water?

36
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,125
- I'll leave it here for you.
- Sure.

37
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,708
Shall we mark today's date?

38
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:10,958
Yeah.

39
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:17,666
You're not… making me sleep
on the couch this time, are you?

40
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,583
Of course not.

41
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,250
SHALL WE HAVE THIS FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

42
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,250
SURE.

43
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,750
- Smells so good.
- You're back.

44
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,125
Yeah.

45
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,666
When I saw the photo
you sent me earlier today,

46
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,291
I started craving it right away.

47
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,125
Here, coffee.

48
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,583
You made this just for me?

49
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,000
Get out.

50
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,458
Out you go. Get out.

51
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,541
Thanks.

52
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,041
Isn't it cute?

53
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,083
Are you going to set everything up?

54
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,916
I'll see how it looks first.

55
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,208
You've got a lot of stuff.

56
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,833
It's not that much.

57
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,708
I'll help you move these inside.

58
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,041
Sure, thanks.

59
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,500
Look, I bought these earlier.
Aren't they cute?

60
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:10,958
Hmm…

61
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,041
And this one,

62
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,666
handmade.

63
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,166
What do you think?
The colors are pretty, right?

64
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,416
Hmm… not bad.

65
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,416
I think it'll look nice on the couch.

66
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,000
Where should I put those things?

67
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,458
- Just leave them there for now.
- Okay.

68
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,666
Where's this from?

69
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,708
Prague.

70
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,416
Did you have fun?

71
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,916
I haven't been there, but I'd love to go.

72
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,958
Well, if we start saving now,
where would you like to go next year?

73
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,750
Next year?

74
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,291
This 2,000 dollars
is our first travel fund.

75
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,125
If we both save

76
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,041
100 dollars starting tomorrow,

77
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,958
we'll have over 70,000 by next year.

78
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,958
So where do you want to go first?

79
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,833
Hmm…

80
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,041
Japan?

81
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,375
Sure.

82
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,291
Let's go to… Hokkaido next year.

83
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,500
Sounds great.

84
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,041
Wow… Hokkaido.

85
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,625
I bet it's really cold there.

86
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,166
No worries, I've got this,

87
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,875
it's so warm.

88
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,333
Just imagine, Hokkaido's freezing cold,

89
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,041
everything covered in snow.

90
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,541
It goes perfectly.

91
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,208
It suits you perfectly.

92
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,583
- Really?
- Yeah.

93
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,291
I could buy you one just like it.

94
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,750
It's fine, I already have one.

95
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,625
Or we could share it together,

96
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,958
since Hokkaido is so cold, right?

97
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,250
Zhe,

98
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,875
the teacher said that

99
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:40,958
you haven't been eating at school.

100
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,541
<i>I did eat.</i>

101
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,166
Then… Did mommy get it wrong?

102
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,916
Actually, Zhe did eat, but…
only a little bit.

103
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,250
Is there something you don't like?

104
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,041
You can tell mommy.

105
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,000
I can talk to the teacher for you.

106
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,250
<i>The teacher said we can bring</i>
<i>two toys to school tomorrow.</i>

107
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,208
What do you want to bring?

108
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,250
HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM

109
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,583
How about

110
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,750
your fire truck and police car?

111
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,416
You can play with your classmates.

112
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,125
You can even trade toys, right?

113
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:26,041
Maybe you'll meet a friend
who loves cars just like you.

114
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,833
Good morning.

115
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,458
- Good morning, boss.
- Morning.

116
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,958
Was that your friend just now?

117
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,166
She's my junior.

118
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,416
Junior, huh.

119
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,916
She's pretty cute.

120
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,000
Too bad you're married.

121
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,291
I'm married, but I'm also divorced.

122
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,833
Figures, you're an Earth sign.

123
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,166
Always efficient.

124
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,583
There's only one of these left.

125
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,250
Alright, thanks.

126
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,291
Hello?

127
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,875
Yes, this is me.

128
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,250
What?

129
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,208
But… I thought everything
was already settled?

130
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,541
Can I come over right now?

131
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:13,125
Hello, I'm a member of Departed.
I just spoke with you earlier.

132
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,250
Hello.

133
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,541
I wanted to ask,

134
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,375
we were originally
on the performance list.

135
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,291
Why were we suddenly replaced?

136
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,250
We already informed you over the phone.

137
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,208
There was a lineup change.
It was a decision from above.

138
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,208
A lineup change?

139
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,583
But I received a notification
about signing a contract.

140
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,291
Why did it change all of a sudden?

141
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,041
After an internal discussion,
we made a new decision.

142
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,833
We're really sorry.

143
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,291
But you should've told us earlier.

144
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,875
We've been preparing
for this performance for a long time.

145
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,708
Isn't this disrespectful?

146
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,250
Apologies, but the organizer reserves

147
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,583
the right to make changes
to the performance lineup,

148
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,333
especially before
any contracts are signed.

149
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,041
If there's a more popular band,

150
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,458
of course, we're going to choose them.

151
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,291
Before asking for respect,

152
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,625
maybe think about how to improve
your band first.

153
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,416
That might be more practical.

154
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,166
Sorry, I have to go. I'm busy.

155
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,041
MISSED CALL FROM KAI

156
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,083
CALLING KAI

157
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,083
<i>Zhong Ting-Ting, where are you?</i>

158
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,291
Hello?

159
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,416
<i>Where are you?</i>

160
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,250
So, uh… the performance got canceled.

161
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,750
<i>What? Why?</i>

162
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,500
We're back at square one, Big Foot.

163
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,750
No need to rush practice anymore,

164
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,666
since the gig's off.

165
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,541
Didn't you say
they were really interested in us?

166
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,000
Now it's canceled?

167
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,833
Alright, time's almost up.

168
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:13,958
Let's go grab something to eat.

169
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,833
Are you home?

170
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,083
Yeah…

171
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,083
What's wrong?

172
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,166
Our performance got canceled.

173
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,125
Canceled?

174
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,416
Did you call the organizers?

175
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,916
Yeah, but the contact person
brushed us off with a few words,

176
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,541
saying they found a better band.

177
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,541
They canceled on us so close to the date.

178
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,041
Kai and the others are super disappointed.

179
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,625
Maybe you should look for
other performance opportunities?

180
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,833
There might be something even better.

181
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,791
We'll see.

182
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,875
I was really looking forward
to treating you to a big meal

183
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,333
after the opening performance.

184
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,041
It's okay.
We can have that big meal anytime.

185
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,875
Hey.

186
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,166
You know your work
is always a bit unpredictable.

187
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,291
Hey, I didn't mean anything by that.

188
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,000
It's fine, that's just the reality.

189
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,041
Do you want to go for a run?

190
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,208
I heard running is a great way to vent
and sweat it out.

191
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,833
Running in the summer feels really nice.

192
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,333
Ting-Ting,

193
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,250
listening to music while running
is super relaxing.

194
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,458
You should try it.

195
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,166
Are you guys done with practice?

196
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm the one who booked the room next.

197
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,541
I'm almost done packing. Sorry about that.

198
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,541
Hey… you forgot about me.

199
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,125
This…

200
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,791
You're the one who snatched the strap
from me the other day.

201
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,083
I thought you were going to
let me have it.

202
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:46,750
Sorry about that.

203
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,166
It's fine. It doesn't really matter now.

204
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:51,833
Why's that?

205
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,333
We were supposed to perform
at a music festival,

206
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,500
but now the show's canceled,

207
00:22:58,583 --> 00:22:59,875
so I don't need to change
the strap anymore.

208
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,458
I'm heading out.

209
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,666
I actually listen to your songs.

210
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,458
I can even play them.

211
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,166
You really listen to our songs?

212
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,958
Yeah, I've been following you guys.

213
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,500
I'm Ning.

214
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,041
I know who you are.

215
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,416
Really?

216
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,458
I've listened to your music too,
and I really like it.

217
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,208
So… Do you want to stay a bit longer?

218
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,333
I can play the song I'm currently writing.

219
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,166
Sure.

220
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:00,708
Here goes.

221
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,041
That's it for now.

222
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,125
I haven't finished the lyrics yet.

223
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,875
So I'm the first person to hear this song?

224
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,583
Yep.

225
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,666
So, what do you think? Any feedback?

226
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,250
I think it's pretty good.

227
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,208
When you finish it,
you've got to let me hear it.

228
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:14,916
Sure.

229
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,000
Thanks for listening.

230
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,875
No problem. It's nothing.

231
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,125
You seem pretty close with the boss.

232
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:36,708
I've been coming here since high school.

233
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,541
Your band's poster looks great.

234
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,041
Thanks.

235
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,708
It's no big deal, really.

236
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:54,208
I've had shows canceled before too,

237
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,458
and the person who replaced me
only got in through connections.

238
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,333
It was so unfair.

239
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:01,458
At one point, I didn't even
want to play music anymore.

240
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:06,125
What made you… want to keep going?

241
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,666
The joy of playing music, I guess.

242
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,333
I feel really free when I'm playing music,

243
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:20,875
like I don't need
to explain anything to anyone.

244
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,791
Of course, there are still
a lot of setbacks and frustrations,

245
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:28,416
But… that joy is irreplaceable.

246
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,833
Besides,

247
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:34,666
if you're not happy,
it's hard to keep going, right?

248
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,708
Caring too much about
what others think is exhausting.

249
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,625
That's what I thought at first too.

250
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:49,125
So after the show got canceled,
I kept telling myself it was no big deal.

251
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:51,958
But…

252
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:53,958
maybe the more I suppress my feelings,
the worse I feel.

253
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,583
Thinking about it… if there's no audience,

254
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:04,541
does it mean no one will hear these songs?

255
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,541
It feels like it's all pointless.

256
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,083
Maybe I should just
spend more time working,

257
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:13,666
like the rest of the people,
or with family,

258
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:16,416
at least then I'd feel a bit more useful.

259
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,041
Who says no one's listening?

260
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:22,000
I heard it. I can even play it.

261
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,416
I did alright just now, right?

262
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,041
Of course.

263
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:27,916
You were great.

264
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,291
Don't overthink it.

265
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:32,666
Thanks.

266
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,250
Which direction is your place?

267
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,583
That way, just ahead.

268
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,958
It's fine, only ten minutes.

269
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,958
Be careful on your way home.

270
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,541
Wait…

271
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:58,250
You said… this is your lucky color.

272
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:00,708
Take it.

273
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,166
No matter what,

274
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,375
I'm still looking forward
to your next performance.

275
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,583
- Thanks.
- No problem.

276
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:19,166
- Let's hang out again.
- Sure.

277
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,750
- Get some rest.
- You too.

278
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:23,791
Bye.

279
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:24,875
Thanks again.
