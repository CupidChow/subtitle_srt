1
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,750
HOW CAN I FORGET YOU?

2
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,208
A little bit.

3
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,333
TODAY'S CHAT WAS REALLY FUN.

4
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,791
I THOUGHT SO TOO.

5
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,791
Did you run into
a friend downstairs today?

6
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:02,875
You saw?

7
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,916
I just met her today.

8
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,708
She's quite interesting.

9
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,666
She's a singer-songwriter.

10
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,000
I think she's awesome.

11
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,708
Talking to her was really fun.

12
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,166
She also often goes to
the place where we rehearse.

13
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,500
You're still looking
at this stuff before bed?

14
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,125
Aren't you tired?

15
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,333
Can't help it.

16
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,250
It's been a while
since I worked so intensely.

17
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,125
I need to catch up.

18
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,583
I really think you're brave.

19
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,291
What do you mean by brave?

20
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,416
Well…

21
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,458
You chose this life.

22
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,458
It seems like you've
taken on a lot more responsibility.

23
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,208
Aren't you tired?

24
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,000
Maybe. I guess I just accept it.

25
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,083
Back then,

26
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,583
I found a place on my own,
and moved by myself.

27
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,875
It took me a year before I dared
tell my parents about my divorce.

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,166
But when I think about it,

29
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,583
if I hadn't gotten
married and had a child,

30
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,833
I wouldn't have Zhe.

31
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,416
So there's no point in regretting it.

32
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,958
Now, I just hope he can
grow up safe and healthy.

33
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,041
And also,

34
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,083
I have you now too.

35
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,958
Do you feel like life has a lot of rules,

36
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,041
like everything
has to follow a certain order?

37
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,083
I don't think about it that way.

38
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:40,083
Life needs a bit of
sacrifice and compromise.

39
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,375
Besides, I was pretty happy
during that time.

40
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,708
As long as you know

41
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,458
what's important to you,

42
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:52,708
and… try your best to
make the people you care about happy,

43
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,041
that's enough.

44
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,416
Boss, here's the lab data
and progress report.

45
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,208
Alright, just leave it here.

46
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,458
How's everything going?

47
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,291
We might need to
adjust the components for now.

48
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,791
The strain combination

49
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,250
doesn't seem to be working that well.

50
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,125
I'm going crazy with all these
herbal tonics.

51
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,125
You're taking tonics?

52
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,708
Yeah…

53
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,625
I'm curious, was your pregnancy natural?

54
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,708
- Why do you ask?
- Just lucky, I guess.

55
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,208
Oh no, I'm prepping for pregnancy.

56
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,416
I'm going abroad soon
for an IVF procedure.

57
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,125
And Yushan bought a ton
of Chinese medicine for me.

58
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,041
She said it's to nourish my body,
but the taste…

59
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,791
Some of it's actually quite good.

60
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,625
If you have time, you could…
come over to my place next time,

61
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,750
and I can cook some warm,
nourishing dishes for you to try.

62
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,750
Really?

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That sounds great.

64
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,375
Thanks.

65
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,083
Alright, perfect.

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,250
Okay. Let me check the photos.

67
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,208
Okay.

68
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,250
Alright, let's change to the next outfit.

69
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,958
Why are you looking at job websites?

70
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,541
Are you job hunting?

71
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,083
Nah, just browsing.

72
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,250
What are you going to wear next?

73
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,083
How about this one?

74
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,291
Alright.

75
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,291
Anything else you need help with?

76
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,000
Nope. Did you vacuum the floor already?

77
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,000
Of course.

78
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,958
Did you switch the attachment
for dust mites on the couch?

79
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,041
Yep, everything's clean.

80
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,541
The mattress is vacuumed too.

81
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,500
It smells so good.

82
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,125
Don't sneak a bite.

83
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,041
It's fine.

84
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,958
What do you mean, "It's fine"?

85
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,250
They're here.

86
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,583
I'll go grab the utensils.

87
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,958
- Welcome.
- Hi.

88
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,541
Come on in. Here are some slippers.

89
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,833
Thanks.

90
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,166
- I'll get it.
- Okay, thank you.

91
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,166
That's a lot of food.

92
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,083
- Hello.
- Hi.

93
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,708
This is my boss, Jingchuan,
and her wife, Yushan.

94
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,833
- Hello.
- And this is…

95
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,000
Ting-Ting.

96
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,666
- Hi.
- Hello.

97
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,041
- Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,416
- This…
- Come on.

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,958
- For you.
- Thank you. Please, take a seat.

100
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,375
- I'll handle this
- Okay.

101
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,541
Thank you.

102
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,708
- There's so much food.
- Yeah.

103
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,416
Now I'm starving. Thanks.

104
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,833
So, you mentioned these dishes,
are the recipes online?

105
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,583
Yes, I'll organize them
and send them to you.

106
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,416
- Sure, thank you.
- No problem.

107
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,166
She's super picky.

108
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,875
I cook something
different for her every week,

109
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,916
so she doesn't get bored of it.

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,291
You're amazing, honey.

111
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,583
I'm curious, how did you two
decide who would carry the baby?

112
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,125
Well, when we first got together,

113
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,541
she told me she didn't want to be a mom,

114
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,041
but I really wanted kids.

115
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,750
And since my body
isn't suitable for pregnancy,

116
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,000
she made the decision to carry.

117
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:25,541
That's so cool of you.

118
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,083
Right?

119
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,041
Let me tell you,
after I got the ovulation shots

120
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,750
and had to go for egg retrieval,

121
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,291
it hurt, so I walked really slowly.

122
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,958
Have you seen those egg trucks?

123
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,791
The ones that drive
super slow to transport eggs?

124
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,750
That was me, an egg truck in human form.

125
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,000
Wow.

126
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,875
You're leaving
for abroad next week, right?

127
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,208
Here's to wishing you guys all the best!

128
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,333
Thank you.

129
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,541
Once it's successful, after ten months,

130
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,916
I can finally reunite with alcohol again.

131
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,000
Wait, but you still
have to breastfeed, right?

132
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,083
- A little alcohol should be fine, right?
- What do you mean "fine"?

133
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,541
Breastfeeding directly affects the baby,

134
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,833
doesn't it, Yi-Ming?

135
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,250
She's just overthinking things.

136
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,208
Let me tell you,
the baby's not even born yet,

137
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,041
and she's already
planning to buy an education fund.

138
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,541
Hey, the earlier you prepare
for your kid, the better, right?

139
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,083
But it's too soon, isn't it?

140
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,416
Right, Yi-Ming?

141
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,166
I think

142
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,041
it's a bit early, but honestly,

143
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,416
starting early isn't a bad idea.

144
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,875
See? Yi-Ming says it's okay
to start researching early.

145
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,166
Yes, but you're
already planning to buy it.

146
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,416
Honey.

147
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,125
I'm just researching.

148
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,250
We still have dessert.

149
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,208
- I'll go get it.
- Thanks.

150
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,708
- Thanks.
- No problem.

151
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,416
Yi-Ming said you were her junior.

152
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,041
Is that from college?

153
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,416
No, we met in high school
on the volleyball team.

154
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,333
She was the team captain.

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,458
- Captain?
- I can't tell at all.

156
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,583
What are you talking
about, Ting-Ting Jhong?

157
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,791
Nothing.

158
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,375
And she was the star of the team.

159
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,833
All the juniors admired her.

160
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,208
So Earth signs are popular in school, huh?

161
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,083
Wow.

162
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,250
Come on, let's eat.

163
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,958
Senior, can we play
volleyball together sometime?

164
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:42,916
Boss…

165
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,000
Your bosses are really adorable.

166
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,541
And your boss is
totally wife-obsessed, right?

167
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,916
Totally.

168
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,875
Let me tell you, the way she is at work

169
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,958
and the way she is around her wife,

170
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,375
are completely different.

171
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,791
I can't imagine her being a mom right now.

172
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,083
They say they want two kids,
a boy and a girl,

173
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,666
a family of four.

174
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,791
That's so cool.

175
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,250
What about you?

176
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,333
What kind of life
do you want in the future?

177
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,083
The future?

178
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,208
For now, I'm just focused
on saving more money for Zhe.

179
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,958
What Yushan mentioned
about the education fund

180
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,000
sounds like a good idea.

181
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,125
I should look into it too.

182
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,250
And what about me?

183
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,833
Am I not in your future plans at all?

184
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,125
You? The future?

185
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,041
How far would that be?

186
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,083
Like…

187
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,083
Ten or 20 years from now?

188
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,666
Ten? Twenty years?

189
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,750
I don't even know where you'll be then!

190
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,000
Maybe you'll be traveling the world,

191
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,000
living in another country.

192
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,583
If I decide to do that,
I'd plan to take you with me, of course.

193
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,458
Alright… I really haven't
thought that far ahead yet.

194
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:20,958
It's fine.

195
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,666
I'm going to water the plants.

196
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,625
Hey…

197
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,708
Wait.

198
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,125
What…?

199
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:44,916
Here, take this.

200
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,875
Be careful, okay?

201
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,875
See you tonight.

202
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,625
<i>The number you've dialed…</i>

203
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:13,166
THE THERMOS OF CHICKEN SOUP IS FOR YOU.

204
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,500
HAVE YOU LEFT YET?

205
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,083
Yi-Ming, the boss asked you
to join the next meeting.

206
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,875
The lab team will be there too.

207
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,791
Okay, thank you.

208
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,416
- Ms. Liu.
- Have a seat.

209
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,416
Why so formal?

210
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
It's just a quick run-through
of the interview process.

211
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,791
I still want to make a good impression.

212
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,541
Our company recently took on a PR project,

213
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,625
and we're thinking of using music

214
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,833
to express
the value of cultural diversity.

215
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,833
We're looking for suitable artists.

216
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,625
There's a Hakka singer-songwriter
named Ning.

217
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,083
She's really talented and unique,

218
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,666
and quite popular with young people.
I think she'd be a good fit.

219
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,666
Right, you're in a band, right?

220
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,500
Yeah.

221
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,625
I knew it.

222
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,666
You're the perfect fit for this.

223
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,750
Alright, I'll leave this event to you.
When can you start?

224
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,166
So, I got the job?

225
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,708
You did.

226
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,833
But we have a three-month trial period.

227
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,125
Thank you, Ms. Liu.

228
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,416

231
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,166
Hello, hi.
I'm looking for Ting-Ting Jhong.

232
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,833
She's on sick leave?

233
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,041
Alright, thank you.

234
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,333
YI-MING, MISSED CALL

235
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,166
Why did you get off work so early today?

236
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,500
Your café boss said you called in sick.

237
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,083
Oh… I'm not actually feeling unwell.

238
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,791
Then why did you take the day off?

239
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,750
Well…

240
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,875
I skipped work for a job interview.

241
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,833
I'm trying to find a full-time job.

242
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,000
Why didn't you tell me?

243
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,541
I was going to… tell you after I got it.

244
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,875
That's so sudden.

245
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,541
It's not that big a deal.

246
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,458
Sorry, for making you worry.

247
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,791
Hey… but I got the job.

248
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,125
Now when we go
grocery shopping, I'll cover the bill.

249
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,666
Don't brush me off like that.

250
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,291
I'm not!

251
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,291
Hey.

252
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,125
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard,
doing something you don't enjoy?

253
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,875
I'm not pushing myself.

254
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,458
Alright, fine.

255
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,541
What's the job?

256
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:35,458
It's an event PR role, and this time,
it's related to music.

257
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,041
The supervisor said she really liked me
and kept asking me to interview,

258
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,208
so I went for it
since she seemed so sincere.

259
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,875
Basically,
they headhunted me from the café.

260
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,375
That's amazing,
and it suits you perfectly.

261
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,125
What about you?

262
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,083
You're back home early,

263
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,791
skipping work like me?

264
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,125
How could I skip work? I left early.

265
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:06,166
I have paid time off, unlike you.

266
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,625
The goody-two-shoes leaving early?

267
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,750
Were you that worried about me?

268
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,541
Alright.

269
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,208
How about we go out
for dinner to celebrate? My treat.

270
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,958
We'll go to the place
you wanted to eat last time.

271
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,666
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

272
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,166
Here comes your favorite.

273
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,333
The dessert.

274
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,875
Let's take a picture together.

275
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,166
- I want to eat…
- Hold on.

276
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,458
Let's try a different pose.

277
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,333
Your expression is always the same.

278
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,125
I'm just a bit boring, okay?

279
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,500
No way…

280
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,958
You were so cool when
you played volleyball in high school.

281
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,333
Everyone was cheering for you.

282
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,958
I thought you were
really interesting at the time.

283
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,000
Do you think working
has made us carry more burdens,

284
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,458
forcing us to meet society's expectations?

285
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,458
I sometimes miss
the way you were back then.

286
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,875
Life was simpler when we were kids.

287
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:34,208
And back then, even the little things
could make us so happy.

288
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,083
Do you want to bring
back the old Yi-Ming Jiang?

289
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,916
Hey… what are you up to?

290
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,333
You'll see in a second.

291
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,125
Do you guys want to join us?
We could play two-on-two.

292
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,750
Sure.

293
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,583
Three!

294
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,708
Don't mind.

295
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,041
Come on.

296
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,333
Yes!

297
00:22:58,583 --> 00:22:59,625
Nice one.

298
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:00,541
‪Don't mind.

299
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,208
Nice shot.

300
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:13,625
Two.

301
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,333
Nice shot.

302
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,375
Wait.

303
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,375
Looks like it's going to rain.

304
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,125
Didn't expect it to
actually start raining.

305
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,916
Hey…

306
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,541
There's something I've always wanted to do
but never did.

307
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,416
What is it?

308
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,166
Yi-Ming Jiang.

309
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,333
Wait for me.

310
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,041
We're soaking wet.

311
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:24,833
I'll grab some towels.

312
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,041
- What's wrong?
- It's eight o'clock.

313
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,958
<i>Why didn't you answer the phone?</i>

314
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,250
Sorry, my phone ran out of battery.

315
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,625
<i>He's really upset, can't calm him down.</i>

316
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,333
What is he doing now?

317
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:04,625
<i>Zhe, Mommy's calling.</i>

318
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:05,833
<i>Do you want to talk on the phone?</i>

319
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,791
<i>- Mommy didn't pick up.</i>
<i>- Zhe.</i>

320
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:09,291
- I'm heading over right now.
<i>- Apologize.</i>

321
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,583
- What happened? Is everything okay?
- I'm going to Zhe's place.

322
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:13,541
So suddenly?

323
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,083
- How about I drive you there?
- No need.

324
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,333
It'll be quicker. Hold on a second.

325
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,500
Jiang…
