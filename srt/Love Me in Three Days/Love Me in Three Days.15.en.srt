3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm home.

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,000
Leave now.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Did you forget anything?

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,960
No way. I won't kiss you.

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,560
You're lucky that I don't beat you up.

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,160
I've helped you so much.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,360
Shouldn't you return the favour?

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Don't get near me.

11
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,900
Leave.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,040
Since my mother is not home yet,
get changed and leave.

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,720
It's yours?

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
Pervert.

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,600
Didn't you give it to me?

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,760
Quickly get changed.

17
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
You...

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,240
Maybe you shouldn't tuck in.

19
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,520
Don't spread your legs.

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,320
Your nose is bleeding.

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,920
What?

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,480
Quickly get some tissue paper for me.

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Come on.

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,720
Get closer.

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
You lied to me!

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,680
Let me kiss you.

27
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
No!

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,920
Why it's him again? So annoying!

29
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,320
It's still better than your face.

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Help me transform back.

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,860
Fine.

32
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,840
No way.

33
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,040
I can't kiss you.

34
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,440
Wait for three days
and transform back by yourself.

35
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,640
Don't come with me.

36
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,800
My mother is back?

37
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
Surprise!

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,640
No, you're at home?
Why didn't you open the door?

39
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,160
Why are you here?

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
I'm here to apologise to you.

41
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,880
I had something on earlier

42
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
and I can't go to the banquet with you.

43
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,520
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,360
Apology accepted.

45
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,960
You can go home now.

46
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,920
Come on. I hardly drop by.

47
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,680
What? You don't want to chat with me?

48
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,840
No.

49
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,600
That's more like it.

50
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,360
What?

51
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,080
Why not we go to the kitchen?

52
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,640
I'll cook something nice for you.

53
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,200
Try my dishes.

54
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,560
You know me well.

55
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
I didn't eat much today. I'm hungry.

56
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,680
I'm so hungry.

57
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,280
I must tease my brother.

58
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
He's too much.

59
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,040
My mother was trying to hold him up.

60
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,640
He came to take revenge at night.

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,680
The investor was all fake.

62
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,400
I'm so upset.

63
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,920
This way.

64
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,000
There's a lot of food here.

65
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,680
Stay here.

66
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,360
I'll go get something.

67
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,040
You're here. Let's go.

68
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,680
Leave now.

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,400
Hurry.

70
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,240
