=Episode 12=

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,800
No, Yifan.

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,680
Take it as I'm begging you, okay?

5
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,160
You've watched the news.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,080
So many bad news about me.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,360
Shadow World is my last resort.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,520
It's just 20 million.
Can't you help me?

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,080
Yan,

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,200
tell me about the data for

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,040
last year's movie, Perfect Love.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,600
Perfect Love.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,320
The total investment was 30 million.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,360
It didn't pass
the first round appraisal.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,240
We didn't get the bonus
from selling the tickets.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,920
Only seven million.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,080
We aired it online for the second round.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,480
We only took back half a million.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,440
It was a total failure...

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Enough, stop it.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,760
It was a total failure at its best.

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,400
Yifan, just tell me.

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,160
Are you helping me or not?

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,440
20 million is not as expensive
as the land you bought.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
I'm talking to you.

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,000
Let alone 20 million,

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,640
I won't even give you two million.

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,640
I...

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,760
Don't waste the coffee.

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,880
No, is it that hard to help me out?

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,680
You really want to see me fail?

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
Luoluo.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
You've frightened me.

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Luoluo.

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,560
I've been waiting for you.
Where were you?

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,640
What?

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,000
Didn't I ask you to find out
about my brother's secret?

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
How did it go?

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,680
Why suddenly are you asking that?

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,560
I'm anxious.

41
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Look at me.

42
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
I haven't filmed any movie in a year.

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,640
I know you want to watch
my movie, right?

44
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,440
That's true,

45
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,280
but...

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
No excuse.

47
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,680
If you think you're not motivated,

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,560
we can go out more often.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,640
I'll cheer for you, okay?

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,720
Why are you everywhere?

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,920
Can you stop being so domineering?

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,680
What are you doing?

53
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Are you an idiot?

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,760
What did I do?

55
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,160
Can't you tell that he's using you
with the date?

56
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,160
You can't even tell that
he's using you.

57
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,080
You're using me, too.

58
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,920
I'd rather be used by my idol
than being used by you.

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,480
What did you say?

60
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,880
Tell me. How am I using you?

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,480
Am I not a tool for you to transform?

62
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,640
What?

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Did I say it wrong?

64
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,080
No, I was wrong, okay?

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
Since you know you're wrong,
why won't you let me go?

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,080
Go.

67
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Go and look for your idol.

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,440
I don't need a tool anyway.

69
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Fine.

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,160
A tool.

71
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,240
Well...

72
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
Mr. Shan,

73
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,840
does Luoluo mean

74
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,560
leaving the office

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,760
or leaving the company?

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
What do you think?

77
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Please enjoy.

78
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Thank you.

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
I don't know what you like to eat.

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,840
So, I've ordered everything.

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
Just eat whatever you like.

82
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,880
You've ordered so much.

83
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
You're doing me a big favour.

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,840
This meal is nothing compared to that.

85
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,320
Stop staring and start eating.

86
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,320
One day of salary is gone.

87
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,800
One week of salary is gone.

88
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,000
Actually, when I'm in a bad mood,

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,800
I like to eat as well.

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,600
Eating makes us feel happy.

91
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Why are you not drinking?

92
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm protecting my throat
so I can't drink.

93
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,160
Actually, I need to compliment
your brother for this.

94
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,240
He likes to drink a little just like me.

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,440
Don't you hate him?

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,160
I do.

97
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,240
That's the only thing good about him.

98
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,920
Unlike you. You're gentle

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,040
and thoughtful.

100
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,280
Okay, stop talking about him.

101
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,960
Just eat and be happy.

102
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,160
It's all yours.

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,960
Tell me more about my strength.

104
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,120
If you like the food here, why don't
we come here more often?

105
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,800
Okay.

106
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Shan Yifan, this looks nice.

107
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,720
Luoluo, what did you call me?

108
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,960
No worries.

109
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,880
I must've heard it wrong.

110
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Let's go.

111
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,200
I want to take a look around.

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,320
Sure, go ahead.

113
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,760
I'll get the car.
We'll go to the golf club later.

114
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,560
Why did I call him the wrong name?

115
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,000
Stop calling his name.

116
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,840
Stop thinking about him.

117
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,600
Hello.

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,480
(Luoluo, Mr. Shan is about to transform.)

119
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
(Ms. Zhou is coming.)

120
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,120
(What should we do?)

121
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
I...

122
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,840
I'll be there right away.

123
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,880
Hurry!

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,320
You'll go there first.

125
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
I'll try to hold Ms. Zhou.

126
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,680
Mr. Shan's waiting for you. Go now.

127
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,800
Shan Yifan.

128
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,840
Didn't you refuse to become a tool?

129
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,880
Why did you come back?

130
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,000
What are you doing? She's coming.

131
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,240
Will you leave?

132
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,640
Why are you talking about this now?

133
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,120
Do you still like him?

134
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,960
Okay, I surrender.

135
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm willing to become your tool.

136
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,200
I don't like him.

137
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm not leaving either.

138
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm just taking him as my idol, okay?

139
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I've sent Ms. Zhou away.

140
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,440
You lied to me.

141
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,160
