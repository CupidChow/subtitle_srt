3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,440
(This is ridiculous.)

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,840
(I just said we're not meeting in
private anymore and we're here again.)

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,120
(Why did it happen this way?)

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,240
(Who is helping me out from
this awkward scene?)

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,120
Come on! It's boiling. Let's eat!

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,920
Here, Luoluo.
Here's a piece of meat for you.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,600
Be careful.

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,760
Here, Xuewei. Be careful. It's hot.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,120
Thank you.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,840
Stop looking at your phone.
Eat something.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,960
Come on.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,360
It's tasty.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,400
Yifan.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,160
Yifan.

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,320
Regarding the movie...

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,280
Eat now.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,560
What do you want to eat?

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,680
Buy it if you want to eat.

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,760
There's this...

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,680
There's white fur on you.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,400
Yifan.

24
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,320
What are you doing?

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,680
Are you feeling cold?
You're wearing so little.

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,040
Yifan, I know you care about me.

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,120
Yifan, Xuewei,

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,880
you're also in the supermarket.

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
Only you can come but not us?

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,080
Carry on.

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,240
Chenxing, let's go home.

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,560
I'll cook hot pot for you.

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,320
Let's go.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,080
Chenxing.

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,880
What's the matter?

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
Why not we eat together?

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,760
I think Shadow World

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,880
is a good project.

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,280
Really?

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,760
Sure, let's eat together.

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,800
What?

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,160
Yifan.

43
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,240
Eat this.

44
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,720
Chenxing, eat the rumen.

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,680
Okay.

46
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,600
Let me feed you.

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
Is it tasty?

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,960
You're feeding me.
Of course it's nice.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,320
Then eat more.

50
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,400
Give this to me.

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,640
Luoluo gets it for me.
You should pick another one.

52
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,920
Rumen is not tasty.

53
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,040
Yifan, eat the meatball.

54
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,200
The meatball is only the side dish
in hotpot.

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,840
Rumen is the first choice.

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,400
Rumen is the first choice,
but everyone is eating it

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,800
as it's fresh.

58
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,520
I don't care what others think.

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,960
Someone likes it after all.

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,080
But in hot pot,

61
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,120
the one that can last until
the end is the meatball.

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
What does the duration have
to do with anything?

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,840
I like to eat rumen.

64
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,040
It only takes seven to eight seconds to cook.
It's flavourful, spicy and quick.

65
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,600
It's heavenly.

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,040
Luoluo, you're right.

67
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,840
Yifan, if you don't want to eat it,
I'll eat it all.

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,200
Who said I don't like to eat this?

69
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,000
But you can't finish

70
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,280
all the rumen and meatballs alone.

71
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,080
Forget it.

72
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,360
What's all about these rumen
and meatballs?

73
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Yifan,

74
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,640
do you remember when we were in France?

75
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,720
When I was sick,

76
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
you bought me some premium foie gras.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,440
Also, we were in Japan

78
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,680
eating Kobe beef  for my birthday.

79
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,200
When I was graduating in Italy,

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,920
you bought me black truffle.

81
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,040
Yifan,

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,760
I'm so happy.

83
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,000
You were there for me in

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,400
every important moment of my life.

85
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,600
(Is she trying to tell me)

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,920
(you're sharing a lot of memories?)

87
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,040
Miss Xia, you haven't been able
to try these delicacies, have you?

88
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,360
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,920
Miss Xia, you've never been overseas,
have you?

90
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,640
Xuewei,

91
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,920
did you forget that Chenxing
was there as well?

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

93
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,800
Everyone has his or her past.

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,000
I have one person who will be there

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,120
to comfort me when I'm scared.

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
He'd help me, care for me

97
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,480
and encourage me when I'm in trouble.

98
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,200
Xuewei, is there anyone
doing this for you?

99
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,640
That's right.

100
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,360
I love all my fans, especially Luoluo.

101
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,240
So, you're talking about Chenxing.

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,720
- No.
- No.

103
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,240
You're eating.

104
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,680
Excuse me. Can I say something?

105
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,560
Go ahead.

106
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,800
Actually, it's nothing much.

107
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,080
Ms. Zhou asked me to give
an invitation card to Luoluo.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,160
Whose invitation card is this?

109
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,840
Well...

110
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
It's Miss Xuewei's and yours.

111
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,920
I've almost forgotten.

112
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,120
We're having a meal here

113
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,400
for another matter.

114
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,400
Yifan and I are getting married.

115
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,160
