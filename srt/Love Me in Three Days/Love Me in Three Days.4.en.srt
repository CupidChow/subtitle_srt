3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,040
Luo!

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,840
Yes!

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,240
You're leaving without eating.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,960
I'm running late, mom.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,580
(Vehicles entrance and exit
Strictly no parking here)

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,680
Newbie.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,720
Get me a cup of coffee.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,440
Me?

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,840
Yes, you.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
Okay.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,120
Here you go.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,240
This is 90 degree. Change it.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,040
Sure.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,440
Here.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
Try it.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
Are you trying to burn me to death?

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,080
This is only 50 degree.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,440
You won't be burnt.

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,920
Are you questioning me?

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,960
I'm not.

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,880
You're fired. Get lost.

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,920
Mr. Fang, you're so arrogant.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,040
It's early in the morning.

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Who are you asking to get lost?

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,760
Mr. Shan.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,160
Fang Ning.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
Xia Luoluo is my secretary.

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,680
You can tell me

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,200
if you're not satisfied with her.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,280
No, I'm satisfied.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,040
I'm satisfied.

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,800
The temperature is just fine.

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,280
Miss Xia knows that my hands are cold

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,080
so she made it hot for me.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,400
She's thoughtful.

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Ms. Zhou is coming today.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,520
Stop causing trouble.

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,240
Did I?

41
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,900
(Xinge Group)

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Ms. Zhou,

43
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,080
there's this new female staff.

44
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,680
You don't know

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,680
how arrogant she is
with Shan Yifan supporting her.

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,440
Maybe she won't even respect you.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,040
No worries.

48
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,160
She's my people.

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,640
Your people?

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,960
You've never said that before.

51
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,020
(Xinge Group)

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,520
Chenxing, you're here.

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,280
Ms. Zhou, are you looking for me?

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,200
See? I told you.

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,640
All right. I'm leaving now.

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,720
Bye.

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Mr. Shan only has Yan by his side.

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,080
He has never hired any secretary.

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,720
Let alone a female secretary.

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,960
How did you move Mr. Shan?

61
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,160
This is a tough question.

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Chenxing said

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,400
you're our people.

64
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
What can you do for us?

65
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,040
This is a tough question

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,800
as well.

67
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,000
Xia Luoluo,

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,720
it's fine that you looked down on me.

69
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,240
How could you just ignore Ms. Zhou?

70
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,120
Are you looking down on Ms. Zhou?

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,400
I'm not.

72
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,640
No.

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,760
Let me pick up this call.

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,600
Hello.

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,360
(Come to the office.)

77
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,200
(Mr. Shan is about to transform.)

78
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,040
(He needs you.)

79
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,880
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,600
I need to go now.

81
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:45,960
Bye.

82
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,640
Xia Luo...

83
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,480
Ms. Zhou,

84
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,720
did you see that?

85
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,680
She doesn't respect you.

86
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,040
I think Chenxing

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
doesn't know her well.

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,080
She's not that simple.

89
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,560
I think she's trouble.

90
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,800
When I find out Shan Yifan's secret,

91
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,160
he will not be the CEO anymore.

92
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,080
Chenxing, come to Shan Yifan's office.

93
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
You'll then see his secret.

94
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,720
(Chenxing, come to Shan Yifan's office.)

95
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,840
(You'll then see his secret.)

96
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,400
You're here.

97
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,600
Where should I be then?

98
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,560
You're Shan Yifan?

99
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,120

Chenxing, what's your
relationship with her?

103
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,200
It's none of your business.

104
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,800
