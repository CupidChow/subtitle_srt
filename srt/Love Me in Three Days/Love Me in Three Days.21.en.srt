3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,480
Mr. Shan, why?

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,840
You don't even want to shake hands
with me as a gesture?

5
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,600
Well, Ms. Zhou.

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,040
Regarding Mr. Shan's matter,
what's going on actually?

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,800
Let's not hurry.

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,560
You'll see it very soon.

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,480
Mr. Shan's in a hurry.
If you want to be...

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,320
What are you doing?

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,120
You...

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,440
Bi Xuewei,

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,160
you don't even know you've been used.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,840
Think about you're helping him

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,520
or jeopardising him now.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Move aside!

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,960
What's going on?

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,600
I don't need you to announce

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,280
my marriage, Ms. Zhou.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,120
Everyone,

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,320
Miss Xia Luoluo and I

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,000
are getting married.

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,000
She doesn't deserve Shan family!

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,320
Let me tell you.

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,080
You can't simply marry anyone

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,640
as the CEO.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,240
Well,

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
you don't have to worry about this.

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,960
Let's go.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,560
Are you still troubled by Zhou Hongmei?

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,840
No.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,080
She's not worth it.

33
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,040
Is it because of me?

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,640
Wait for me here.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,800
I know.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,000
No worries.
I'll think of a way to solve it.

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,600
It's okay.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,320
(We're getting married anyway.)

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,080
(Let me try this out.)

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,480
Luoluo, you're really beautiful.

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,360
You're the bride of my dream.

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,080
Luoluo.

43
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,520
Luo...

44
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
What? Am I not pretty?

45
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,080
Get changed first.

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
We'll go somewhere else.

47
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,320
He's escaped it one more time.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,640
Madam Zhou.

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,880
Is exposing Yifan's secret
of his transformation

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,480
going to benefit him?

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,120
Why are you asking this?

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
I'm just...

53
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't listen to them.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm a member of Shan family.

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,200
Why would I jeopardise him?

56
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,040
(Why did he react like that
when he saw me in the wedding dress?)

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,360
(Why was she wearing the wedding dress?)

58
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,920
(Is he not expecting or)

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,640
(he doesn't want to marry me?)

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,400
(I wanted to give her a surprise)

61
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,600
(when I'm proposing to her.)

62
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,000
(He just had to say that
to Zhou Hongmei.)

63
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,640
(Why did I take it seriously?)

64
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,520
(I need to find another way then.)

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,800
(Zhou Hongmei was right.)

66
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,000
(Why would he marry me?)

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,120
What's wrong?

68
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,040
What do you want to eat later?

69
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,160
I'm not eating.

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,600
You can find anyone else
to eat with you.
