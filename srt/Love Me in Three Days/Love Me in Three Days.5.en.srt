00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,780
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,680
Babe, I'm counting on you.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,640
You must record how he transforms.

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,440
Mr. Shan.

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm coming in.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,480
(I'm so lucky.)

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,040
What are you doing?

9
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,480
Why are you not wearing
your clothes properly?

10
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,880
Why should I do that at home?

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,480
Immoral.

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,280
What did you say?

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,560
Did you bring what I asked you to bring?

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,400
Yes.

15
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,080
What were you doing
in the past one hour?

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,440
What took you so long?

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,400
I rode an electric bike here

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,520
after working hour

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,600
to deliver the document to my boss

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,960
and it's pathetic enough.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,240
How dare you say I was slow?

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,640
The document!

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,120
Here.

24
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,920
You must hold his hand for
more than five seconds.

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,960
No matter how he refuses,

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,160
you must not let go.

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,640
Don't worry.

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,600
I'm paid

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,840
so I'll get the job done.

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,160
Remember, five seconds.

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
No problem.

32
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,160
You're here.

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,080
I thought no one is using
the meeting room.

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,320
Mr. Shan wanted to meet us.

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,400
You have to join, too.

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,080
Let me use your laptop.

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,480
No.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
Why?

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,160
My laptop is damaged.

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,560
This is an office laptop.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,240
Xia Luoluo.

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,280
Photocopy this.

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,640
What?

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,720
Didn't you hear me?

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,040
What?

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,320
Xia Luoluo, what's this?

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,120
Xia Luoluo.

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,360
My laptop has virus.

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,560
Go and photocopy the document.

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,320
Nice abs.

51
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,760
I

52
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,680
will check things out.

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,200
I'll get you a glass of water.

54
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,780
Tell me.

55
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,940
Why did you set up a camera in my house?

56
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,780
Nothing.

57
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,660
Are you helping Shan Chenxing

58
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,860
and being a spy for him?

59
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,260
No.

60
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,220
Did you forget what I said to you?

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,900
If you become a spy again,

62
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,220
you're done.

63
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,460
(No, I can't admit it.)

64
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,980
(I need an excuse.)

65
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,940
Can't find an excuse?

66
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,420
Who is looking for an excuse?

67
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,820
I...

68
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,580
I...

69
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,980
I set up the camera at your house

70
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,940
to record your abs.

71
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,100
What?

72
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,860
After I leave in a hurry,

73
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,340
I can't forget about your abs, Mr. Shan.

74
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,180
Are you sure?

75
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,140
Yes.

76
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,380
Sure.

77
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,780
Let me satisfy you.

78
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,540
Didn't you want to see this?

79
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,020
Yes.

80
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,460
You're unbuttoning it too slowly.
Let me do it.

81
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,420
Are you not taking off yours?

82
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,420
It's not fair for me to
take off my clothes alone.

83
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,020
Or

84
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,540
you need my help?

85
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,420
No!

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,860
Mr. Shan.

87
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
I was wrong.

88
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
What did you do wrong?

89
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,020
I was wrong about everything.

90
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,620
Make it clear.

91
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,620
I...

92
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,980
I shouldn't be a spy.

93
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,700
You're helping Shan Chenxing

94
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,980
because he's your idol?

95
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,780
It's not as simple as you think.

96
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,060
Actually, he's important to me.
