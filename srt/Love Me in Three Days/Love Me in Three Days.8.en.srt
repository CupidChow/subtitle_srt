3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Lift up your head.

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,000
No, do you need to be so rough?

5
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
Will you remember if I don't?

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,680
I didn't see anything.

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,800
Shut up.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Who

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,960
locked your house door?

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,200
I don't know.

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,000
It can't be my mother.

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,480
I have to lock the door.

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,960
Look at my daughter.

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,080
I can test him

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,280
and assist her.

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,080
I'm helping both of them.

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,440
Get this rich son-in-law.

18
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,640
It must be someone's prank.

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,920
What should we do?

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,000
My mother would turn off her phone
while playing mahjong.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,880
She won't come home until morning.

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,280
Why not you call Yan?

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,640
He's my secretary,

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
not a locksmith.

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
What should we do?

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Also, there's

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,080
something more important we need to do.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
What are you doing?

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,760
Don't move.

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,520
Are you always this clumsy?

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,600
Are you always this annoying?

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,200
That's the first time someone
describing me like that.

33
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
It feels good to be unique.

I was attracted by the illusion he made.

60
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,320
You know nothing about the happiness
of eating fried chicken with beer?

61
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Thank you.

62
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,680
This is mine.

63
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,600
I'm a guest.

64
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,040
This is my home.

65
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,640
I'm your boss.

66
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,560
Well, let's play a game.

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
It's called "I have and you don't".

68
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,360
The winner can drink a sip of beer.
How does that sound?

69
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,600
Sure, it's simple.

70
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,680
I have money.

71
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,280
Do you?

72
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,440
My eyebrows can dance.

73
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,320
I have five houses in the down-town.

74
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,000
I scored zero in my English test.

75
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,360
I scored 8.5 for IELTS
and I speak eight languages.

76
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Your life is so blessed.

77
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,400
You have houses in the down-town

78
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,040
and you speak eight languages.

79
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,600
That's so unfair.

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
I wore my shirt for ten years.

81
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,400
How about that? Did you?

82
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,600
The last sip is mine.

83
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
I don't have a mother.

84
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,840
Zhou Hongmei whom you've
met in the office

85
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,720
is not my biological mother.

86
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,920
My mother passed away due to illness
when I was very young.

87
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,160
I don't remember how she looks like.

88
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
What a coincidence.

89
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,320
I don't have a father.

90
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,280
He died in a car accident.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,760
Father and mother are
our family members.

92
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,160
We're even this round.

93
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,800
I liked painting when I was young,

94
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
but Zhou Hongmei never supported me.

95
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,280
I remember that she tore my painting.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,520
I had a cat before,

97
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,320
but Zhou Hongmei sent it away.

98
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,920
Look.

99
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm actually not as blessed as you said.

100
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,320
I struck the lottery when I didn't
have money for my tuition fee.

101
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
Someone helped me

102
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,560
when I was bullied.

103
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,960
It seems like

104
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,240
my life is quite blessed.

105
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,840
The last sip

106
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,440
is yours.

107
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,800
Look.

108
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,760
You're getting luckier.

109
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,560
Well.

110
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
What?

111
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,440
To return your favour

112
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,000
for giving me the last sip,

113
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
let me sing you a song.

114
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
