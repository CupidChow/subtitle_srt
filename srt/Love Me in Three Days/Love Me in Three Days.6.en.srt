=Episode 6=

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,920
Handsome, polite and gentle.

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,240
Shan Chenxing is indeed my ideal type.

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,240
Not like Shan Yifan.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,360
Cold, mean and arrogant.

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,840
I hate him so much.

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,120
Don't tear my shirt.

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,280
Why are you here?

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,200
I can't be here?

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,880
This is my house.

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
I know.

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Why are you here?

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,280
Relax.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,640
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,160
Madam Chen, you're here.

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,520
Your shirt is dirty.

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,760
Let me clean it up for you.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,480
Come in.

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,120
Okay.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Let go.

23
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,700
I have to say

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,700
your family is tough.

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,020
Look at how small this place is.

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,220
You're doing business and living here.

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,860
It's not easy.

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,100
Unlike Xincheng who bought Shuang

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,340
a big mansion.

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,540
So, you're talking about Jiang Xincheng.

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,060
I thought who you're talking about.

32
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,980
I have to say

33
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,780
Shuang knows how to pick up rubbish.

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,340
Look.

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,500
She picks up what Luo doesn't like.

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,820
What's the purpose of talking here?

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,780
You can't get what you want.

38
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,460
I'm just afraid that a normal house
might not be Luoluo's favourite.

39
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,220
Actually, we have a land in
the city centre.

40
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,340
We'll listen to Luoluo

41
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,220
how we're going to build the house.

42
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,620
Young man.

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,980
You're bluffing.

44
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,340
Yan, look at you.

45
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,860
Haven't you heard of Xinge Group?

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,260
Xinge Group?

47
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,340
(What's the future planning of Xinge Group?)

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,620
My son-in-law is the boss.

49
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,620
(In the next five years, we'll focus on AI...)

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,460
Look, he's on the TV.

51
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,180
Yan, look at that.

52
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,060
(20% of the funds will be the budget.)

53
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,420
(Let me ask you.)

54
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,580
(How's your romance relationship lately?)

55
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,380
(No comments.)

56
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,060
(Okay.)

57
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,460
(Sure.)

58
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,820
(That's all for today's interview.)

59
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,700
I suddenly remember

60
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,780
I have something on.

61
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,580
I'm leaving now.

62
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,620
Won't you stay?

63
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,700
Take care.

64
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,580
What are you trying to do?

65
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,300
I'm trying to flatter my mother-in-law.

66
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,060
Madam.

67
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,700
I want to bring Luoluo out.

68
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,780
Is that okay?

69
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,220
Sure.

70
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,980
Go ahead.

71
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,500
I'm not free.

72
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,900
I'm telling you.

73
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,860
Listen to me.

74
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,780
He looks mature and reliable.

75
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,100
- He's much better than the previous cheater.
- Mom.

76
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,860
What? Listen to me.

77
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,060
You must make him yours, okay?

78
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,500
Be nice. Don't come home tonight.

79
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,020
Carry on. Be nice. Carry on.

80
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,060
Let's go.

81
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,700
Where are we going?

82
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,900
Build a house.

83
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,300
Where do you want to go?

84
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,340
Nowhere.

85
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,700
Let's buy a car.

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,460
Are you crazy?

87
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,140
Let's buy some food.

88
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Let's buy some clothes.

89
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,420
This is not bad.

90
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,180
Sir,

91
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,140
you have a good taste.

92
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,300
This is our latest design this year.

93
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,460
I don't like it.

94
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,380
Which one do you like?

95
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,780
I don't like what you like.

96
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,420
Fine, besides this,

97
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,780
pack the rest.

98
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,580
Okay, sir.

99
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,220
Isn't that Xia Luoluo?

100
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,060
Come on. Talk to her.

101
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,180
Luoluo, why are you here?

102
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,700
My mother said

103
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,540
you've found a new boyfriend.

104
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,300
Did you break up with him?

105
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,380
It's none of your business.

106
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,460
Xia Luoluo.

107
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,380
Change your attitude.

108
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,860
Be gentle.

109
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,260
Look at Shuang.

110
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,620
She's so gentle.

111
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,260
I advise you two to take care
of your bodies

112
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,740
because your bodies don't belong to you,

113
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,980
but the accident drivers.

114
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,700
Be careful not to be knocked down
by a car.

115
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,500
Xia Luoluo,

116
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
why are you so rude?

117
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,660
Why are you so rude?

118
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,060
So shameless.

119
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
Luoluo.

120
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,220
Give me the bags.

121
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,340
Let's go home.

122
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,100
Let's go.

123
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,380
Tell me.

124
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,700
You keep showing up.

125
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,860
What are you trying to do?

126
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,300
I hope you can be there for me
whenever I need you.

127
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,600
(Not bad,)

128
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600

129
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,120
