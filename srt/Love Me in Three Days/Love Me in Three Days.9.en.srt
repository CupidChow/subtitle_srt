00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,080
Chenxing, you sing really well.

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
You called me the wrong name.

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm Shan Yifan.

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,480
I must have drunk too much yesterday

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,120
that I had this weird dream.

9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,520
You're not my childhood friend.

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,320
You're not my first love.

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,720
But I wish you're the last.

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,000
I want to spend my daily life with you.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,720
I want to spend
the rest of life with you.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,280
(With just this kind of trick?)

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,800
Shan Yifan, I'm not interested in you.

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Stop using

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,520
this kind of trick.

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,240
Did you write this?

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
Didn't you write this?

20
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Is this my handwriting?

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Do I use this colour?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Shan.

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
This is mine.

24
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,320
I left it there accidentally.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,760
What are you looking at?

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,840
Xia Luoluo.

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Come out.

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,800
Were you

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,360
trying to do something to me?

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
I was not.

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,760
Why did you think of me

32
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,360
when you saw the love letter?

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
I...

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
I saw something disgusting

35
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,760
so I thought of the person I hate.

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,640
So,

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,960
you really,

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
really

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,040
hate me very much, right?

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Of course.

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,600
Are you sure?

42
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
I'm sure.

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,840
I want to remind you that

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,440
we're just partners.

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,840
After we've got what we wanted,

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,360
we'll stop talking to each other.

47
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,320
(I must be an idiot.)

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,120
(Why do I become so confused
whenever I see him?)

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
(I need someone to help me get sober.)

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
He will come.

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,560
He won't.

52
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,480
He will come.

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Chenxing!

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,280
Stay low.

55
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,120
I didn't know you'd come
right after I sent you a message.

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,360
We're friends. How can I not come?

57
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Where are we going?

58
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Here.

59
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,080
I've always wanted to go there.

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Let's go.

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:34,920
Here you go.

62
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,280
You bought it?

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
No ice.

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Thank you.

65
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
I...

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
This cup has no ice.

67
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
But I've drunk it.

68
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,200
It doesn't matter.

69
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,560
Girls shouldn't drink cold drinks.

70
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
No worries, it's not disgusting.

71
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
(Well...)

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,640
(Did we just kiss indirectly?)

73
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
What? Why are you not talking?

74
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Nothing.

75
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,200
I...

76
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
You feel it's disgusting?

77
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
No.

78
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm just so happy

79
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,720
for being able to be with you

80
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,880
in the Ferris wheel.

81
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,640
Let me tell you.

82
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,840
I took the risk to come here today.

83
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,880
I'll be doomed if my fans caught me.

84
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,960
It's my honour. Thank you.

85
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Look at that.

86
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,760
Chenxing.

87
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,600
Thank you for the Ferris wheel ride.

88
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,880
It's nothing.

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,760
If you want to come again,

90
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
I'll come with you every day.

91
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
But,

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,440
there's a Ferris wheel scene
in Shadow World, too.

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,680
It's a shame that
the production has stopped.

94
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,320
Luoluo.

95
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,160
You must help me

96
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
find out my brother's secret.

97
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,720
I'm serious.

98
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,600
Well...

99
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
It's okay.

100
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,560
It doesn't matter that
you can't find anything now,

101
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,480
but I'm counting on you, okay?

102
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,120
But I...

103
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,600
Let me pick up this call.

104
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Hold on.

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,320
(Why do I keep thinking of him
when I'm being with Chenxing?)

106
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,440
(It seems like I'm really ill.)

107
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,680
(Forget it.)

108
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
(Let's end this once and for all.)

109
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,200
Chenxing,

110
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,920
actually, Shan Yifan's secret

111
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,840
is that he'll transform.
