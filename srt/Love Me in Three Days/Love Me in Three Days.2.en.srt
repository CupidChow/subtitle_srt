3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,540
(Five years ago)

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,400
Thank you.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,560
Looking forward to working with you.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,520
I've talked to the board
about the project.

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,720
Come on.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,200
Let's wish Xinge Group will
get better and better.

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,920
Sir, are you not feeling well?

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
(In the past five years,)

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,760
(whenever I touch someone
for more than five seconds,)

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,800
(I'll turn into
that person's appearance.)

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,040
(I'll change back to myself
after three days.)

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,840
Mr. Shan, are you okay?

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,760
(But I didn't expect that
I changed back early)

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,880
(after kissing you today.)

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,080
You don't have to know why I'd change

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,440
like that.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,280
You just have to kiss me

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,480
whenever I change into someone else

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,240
after we get married.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,360
Get...

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Get married?

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,640
Our wedding is fixed on 3rd next month.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,440
After all, I'm busy

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
at other time.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,360
Oh, right.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,120
There's a secret agreement

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
that I need you to sign

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,720
because if

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,360
you expose my secret,

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,960
you need to bear the consequences.

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,120
I got it now.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,080
It's not just your body.

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,480
Even your brain can't function well.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
You don't believe me, do you?

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,680
Mr. Shan,

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,080
I've prepared the things
that you asked me to prepare.

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,800
Yan.

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,440
Come and touch me.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,080
No, but she's here.

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Hurry up.

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,560
I got it now.

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,880
You have my blessing.

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,720
I'm leaving now.

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,320
Hold on.

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,640
You...

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,640
You two...

50
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,640
Don't come near!

51
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,360
See?

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,880
I didn't lie to you.

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,880
Who are you?

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Why did you kiss me?

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,160
I'm so unlucky today.

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,480
I don't even know you

57
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,320
and you've kissed me twice.

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,120
Yan.

59
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Take this as our wedding gift.

60
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,440
Here you go.

61
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,600
Are you crazy?

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
It's expensive.

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,120
You're getting married with me

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
to make me

65
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,840
a tool to recover yourself.

66
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,200
I don't accept it.

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,520
Also, I don't want to see you anymore.

68
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,520
Why wouldn't she accept it?

69
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,680
It happens too fast.

70
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,360
Let me tell you.

71
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,720
To normal people,

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
we need to date before we get married.

73
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,400
(I thought I'll be in love
wearing the high heels.)

74
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,840
(It just doesn't work that way.)

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,440
Chenxing,

76
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,880
why would I fail both

77
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,960
in my career and my relationship?

78
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,960
It's okay, Xia Luoluo.

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,840
Good luck will fall upon you.

80
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,440
Xinge Group?

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,940
(Job requirement)

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,960
I wonder who the boss is.

83
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,440
Such a wise man.

84
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,580
(Xinge Group)

85
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,640
Miss Xia Luoluo.

86
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,320
Let me introduce.

87
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,060
This is the CEO of Xinge Group, 
Mr. Shan Yifan.

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,200
You're the CEO of Xinge Group?

89
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,400
I'm sincerely asking you

90
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
to work in Xinge Group.

91
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,880
Tell me what's the job about.

92
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,320
The job scope is simple.

93
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,480
Date me.
