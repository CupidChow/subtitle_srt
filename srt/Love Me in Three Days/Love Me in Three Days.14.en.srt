3
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,320
Why are you alone?

4
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,240
You haven't eaten, have you?

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,640
I'll get my assistant to order
for you, okay?

6
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,400
Are you printing this?

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,240
Let me print it for you.

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,200
No need.

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,000
Do you need my help?

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,480
No worries, just let me know.

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,840
No need. I'm really busy today.

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,600
Why not you sit over there?

13
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,440
I got it.

14
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,080
Sure.

15
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
That's it, madam.

16
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Okay, bye.

17
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,640
Your mother called me.

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,080
Why did my mother call you?

19
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,040
She said your ex-boyfriend
and your best friend

20
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,960
are having an engagement ceremony.

21
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,120
What ex-boyfriend? What best friend?

22
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,880
Are you trying to agitate me?

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
She called and asked me

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,520
to bring you there.

25
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
I'm not going.

26
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll go with you and
they will be stunned.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,720
No need. I'm not going.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,320
Wait for me at the hotel
in the afternoon.

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
Chenxing.

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,200
You've frightened me.

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Why are you so free today?

32
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,840
Can't I come here?

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
You can,

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,080
but inform us in advance, okay?

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Luoluo,

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
take the meeting minute to my office.
Hurry.

37
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Luoluo.

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Coming.

39
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,640
Why are you here again?

40
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,360
What? I'm part of the company.

41
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Yifan.

42
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,960
Well, can I talk to you about something?

43
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,040
Will you

44
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,360
give up on Xia Luoluo?

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,280
Can you stop producing Shadow World?

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,640
No way.

47
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
That's it.

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
(It seems like I need to
compete fair and square.)

49
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,400
He said he will be here.

50
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Liar.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
Liar.

52
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,480
Luoluo.

53
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,160
Why are you here?

54
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,880
Yifan has something on today
so he can't make it.

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
Let me go in with you.

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,360
Are you happy?

57
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,560
Mr. Shan, Ms. Zhou sent over
all the previous agreements.

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,440
We need you to run through it.

59
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,320
There are a lot of them.

60
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Take them here.

61
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,760
This is last month's project.
Please take a look.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,280
This is last season's project.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,120
Chenxing, I'm holding him up.

64
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,360
Are you happy?

65
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,880
Why should I be happy?

66
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,480
If your speakers are not so loud,

67
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
everyone around would be glad.

68
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,320
This is nothing.

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,280
When I have time,

70
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,080
I'll give you a ride to
blast the tunnel.

71
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,760
The feeling...

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,400
Let me pick up the call.

73
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Hello. What's the matter?

74
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,560
We have hopes for Shadow World.

75
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,400
Mr. Huang is in contact
with an investor.

76
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,520
Go and talk to him now.

77
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Mr. Huang is waiting for you.

78
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,320
He's so reliable.

79
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,560
Yes, I'm free.

80
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,520
Sure, I'll be there right away.

81
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
You're leaving?

82
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,840
You're terribly blast.

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,680
Luoluo, this way.

84
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,120
Why are you so late?

85
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,840
Your mother told me
you're coming with your fiance.

86
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,240
Did he dump you?

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,560
Did you

88
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,640
get dumped again?

89
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,120
Tell me why the girls now

90
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,640
don't take care of themselves?

91
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,320
She went to

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,160
meet her boyfriend's parents
few days back.

93
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,000
Then suddenly she's hooking up
with a CEO.

94
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,160
I heard that the CEOs

95
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,640
like to date

96
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,600
some fresh graduate.

97
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,680
Actually, they're buying their bodies
with money.

98
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,520
They won't take responsibility.

99
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,000
Jiang Xincheng, are you an idiot?

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Luoluo,

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,880
you always hang out
with the rich people.

102
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,600
What if you get some kind of illness?

103
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
Luoluo, do you want to do a check-up
in the hospital?

104
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,200
It's going to be bad
if you spread it to us,

105
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,720
right?

106
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,200
You should go to the hospital.

107
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,000
Miss Xia Luoluo's biggest problem

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,080
is that she's too kind.

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,280
Excuse me. Sorry for disturbing.

110
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,600
Who is it?

111
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,720
Luoluo didn't want to spoil
your atmosphere

112
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,360
so you bullied her, didn't you?

113
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,560
But you should thank them, Luoluo.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,480
If they didn't

115
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
cheat on you,

116
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,560
could we have met?

117
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,920
Mother, we didn't.

118
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,760
That's not true.

119
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,680
Right?

120
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
That's true though.

121
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
Thank you very much.

122
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,440
Xia Luoluo, this is my engagement!

123
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Get lost!

124
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,840
You invited me to come.

125
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,960
Everyone, let me introduce.

126
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,240
This is Mr. Shan.

127
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,560
He's Miss Xia Luoluo's fiance.

128
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,920
He's also the biggest shareholder
of this hotel.

129
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,680
Miss Xia Luoluo's the lady boss
of the hotel.

130
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,760
Miss,

131
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,600
you should get lost instead.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm the consumer.

133
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,760
How dare you chase a consumer out?

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,200
If I remember it correctly,

135
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,160
you booked the banquet hall

136
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,480
from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., right?

137
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,840
Well, since you're
our lady boss' friend,

138
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,880
we'll extend one hour for you
with no charges.

139
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,600
But now, it's 4 p.m.

140
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,000
If you want to stay here,

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,200
no problem, it's your right,

142
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,480
but you need to pay RMB 6,000.

143
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
May I know how you're
going to pay for it?

144
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,760
Dear, forget it. Let's go.

145
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,760
Why are you so useless?

146
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,960
You can leave if you want!

147
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,800
I...

148
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Jiang Xincheng!

149
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,160
Jiang Xincheng, come back here!

150
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Xia Luoluo!

151
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,640
You've ruined my engagement banquet!

152
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,760
Apologise.

153
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,480
Why should I?

154
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,040
Let go. It's going to
be too late. Hurry.

155
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,240
Sorry! Okay?

156
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Let's go.

157
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
Enjoy your food, everyone.

158
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,400
You...

159
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,880
