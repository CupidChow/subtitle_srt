(Series finale)

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,520
You're Shan Yifan.
Stop pretending like Xia Luoluo.

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
Shan Yifan.

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,480
You're now a useless beast.

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,960
No claws, no teeth,

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,920
and you're just pretending.

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,200
Look at how terrible you are.

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,080
I'll send the video of your
transformation to the directors.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,200
I'll see how you can be

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Xinge Group's CEO!

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,840
Zhou Hongmei, do you think
just because I'm not around,

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,920
you'll be able to take over Xinge Group?

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,640
You only have 20% of shares.

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,080
Mr. Chen, Mr. Zhao, and the other elders

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,360
have more shares than you.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,960
Let me tell you, Shan Yifan.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,320
I've had a deal with Mr. Wang
from Yuehe Group.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,080
He'll dilute the stocks

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,640
and buy in more stocks.

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,680
I'll replace you very soon

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,280
as Xinge Group's CEO.

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,560
So, you've admitted that
you're taking revenge on Shan Yifan

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,320
by working with your competitor

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,480
to sabotage the company

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,280
and ruin the company, right?

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,200
So what if I've admitted it?

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,360
Today, I'll let you know

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,720
the consequences of going against me.

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,600
Who is it? Let go...

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
Shan Yifan?

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,560
Did she hurt you?

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,080
Why did you come out so quickly?

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,360
I wasn't having enough fun acting.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,440
You were lying to me?

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,640
Of course.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,800
No way.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,240
I saw that you were poisoned.

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,600
I saw that you transformed.

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,280
Mother.

41
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,800
I've got to know everything.

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Stop harming others.

43
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,120
Madam Zhou.

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,080
This is all fake.

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,920
Ms. Zhou.

46
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,520
I've recorded everything that you said.

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,320
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,360
You...

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,240
You all lied to me.

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,920
This is the upgraded version
of that drug.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
It's more unstable than
the previous one.

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,220
As for how he will turn out
after taking it...

53
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,120
(So, she's been harming Yifan.)

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,720
What a wicked trick she has there.

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
What do you think we should do?

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,400
Since she's so wicked,

57
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,200
we shall not disappoint her.

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
We knew about your plan,

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,200
so we acted along

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,360
together with you.

61
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,880
Since you're Chenxing's mother

62
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,240
and my stepmother by law,

63
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm giving you another chance.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,760
If you're willing to resign
from the board,

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,320
I'll not pursue for

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,280
what you've done.

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,080
But if you're not repenting,

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,480
I'll play every single word of yours

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,960
in the board of directors' meeting.

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,160
Don't you threaten me!
I'll never let you go!

71
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,880
I've waited for so long

72
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,240
until that old man died!

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,440
All the Shan family's assets
should be mine!

74
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
You stole them away from me!

75
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,680
Mother,

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
can you stop making mistakes?

77
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,880
We're a family.

78
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,960
Why must you be
fighting over everything?

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How could you say that to me?

80
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,600
I've been doing all these for you!

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,280
For me?

82
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,800
Have you ever listened to me

83
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,160
since I was young?

84
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,000
Have you ever asked me anything?

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,320
I've never wanted to fight
for the company.

86
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,160
I just want to act well, okay?

87
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,440
Madam Zhou,

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,920
can you stop imposing what you want

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,080
on Chenxing?

90
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,560
You're a coward!

91
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,360
My years of teaching you
have gone to waste.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,080
How can you just let go of Shan Yifan
so easily?

93
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,560
I just want him to love me.

94
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,320
I've never wanted to hurt him.

95
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,920
Zhou Hongmei,

96
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
you're a failure.

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Why must you drag everyone down
with you?

98
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,240
You should go down instead!

99
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,160
Yifan.

100
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,640
Yifan!

101
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,160
- Yifan!
- Mr. Shan!

102
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,480
- Mr. Shan!
- Yifan, are you okay?

103
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,620
(Zhou Hongmei has turned herself in
and got her relative punishment.)

104
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,260
(One year later)

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,480
(One year has passed.)

106
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,360
(I'd still think of him.)

107
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,560
(What a shame that
love no longer exists.)

108
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
Luoluo.

109
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,920
What?

110
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,840
I've kept you waiting. I'm sorry.

111
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,240
Don't be angry.

112
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,720
Don't be angry.

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,240
How could you be late
on our wedding anniversary?

114
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,200
You didn't do this to me back then.

115
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,640
I had something on today.

116
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,880
I was sending Xuewei overseas
in the morning.

117
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,200
Then I met Chenxing in the afternoon.

118
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,880
Did he show off his award again?

119
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,880
That's right.

120
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,880
He's annoying.

121
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,040
Quickly send him to start
shooting another movie.

122
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,040
I got it, my dear.

123
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,480
Since I've brought a gift for you,

124
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,440
forgive me.

125
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,600
Don't move. Let me put it on for you.

126
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,880
I asked Yan to get this customised.

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,440
Actually, I've prepared
a gift for you as well.

128
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,120
What's it?

129
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,140
I'm pregnant.
