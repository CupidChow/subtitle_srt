3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,120
Luoluo!

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,280
Why are you here suddenly?

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,040
Didn't you enter the production already?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,520
I've asked my driver to follow you.

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,560
I heard that you and my brother
are getting married.

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,520
It's fake.

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,360
I knew it's fake.

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,320
Do I still stand a chance?

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,160
Luoluo.

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,360
Do you think it's possible for us?

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,920
It's fake that I'm getting married
to your brother,

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,000
but I do love him.

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,120
I was just joking with you!

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,240
I know you love my brother.

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,880
How was

18
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,400
my acting?

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,640
I'm here to return you this.

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,000
You picked it up for me.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,640
I wanted to keep it with me.

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm about to bid farewell with you.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,200
I'm giving it back to you. See you.

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,320
Have you forgotten?

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,080
This belonged to you.

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,480
You saved me five years ago

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,880
and gave it to me.

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,920
I saved you?

29
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,680
Yes.

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,320
No way. I would have asked them to write

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,880
plots like hero rescuing beauty.

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,960
No way.

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,440
Did you remember wrongly?

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,840
No, you saved me.

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,880
And you sang me the song,
Hawthorn Trees.

36
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,040
Hawthorn Trees?

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,760
Yes.

38
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,600
Isn't that my brother's favourite song?

39
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,160
Yifan?

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,680
Well, Chenxing, do you remember this?

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,560
It's so lame.

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
Am I supposed to remember it?

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,200
Why did I forget that he'd transform?

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,080
So, the person I've been
loving is Shan Yifan.

47

Luoluo, I...

48
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,360
What's going on? What was she saying?

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,040
Meng Yao, Li Hao, what are you doing?

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,040
The most handsome guy in our class
won't like you.

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,880
Just stay in there.

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,320
I can't open it.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,720
Why can't it be opened?

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Anyone?

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,680
Is there anyone?

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,120

How did you get in there?

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,400
Help me!

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,320
Wait for me.

62
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,120
I'll think of a way.

63
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,480
No, don't leave!

I can't save you here.

65
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,960
It's too dark! I'm scared!

66
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,480
Crying won't solve the problem.

67
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,720
Stop crying first.

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,440

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,360
Stay here first.

70

I won't be leaving.

71
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,120
No way!

72

73
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,480
Well,

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,640
I was scared of darkness
when I was little.

75
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,880

76

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
You didn't invite me, did you?

106
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,760
Our mother said we'll celebrate
father's birthday earlier.
