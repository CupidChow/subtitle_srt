Why didn't you tell me earlier?

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,920
Because I didn't want to use
the nice moment

I'm willing to drink this wine with you

57
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
not because I've forgiven you,

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,960
but I hope that

59
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,360
you won't do anything 

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,400
that will threaten my fiancee.

61
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,600
Otherwise,

62
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,880
I'll not let you go.

63
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,280

This is the upgraded version

It's more unstable than
the previous one.

68
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,320
As for how he will turn out
after taking it,

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
I can't say for sure.

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,440
I don't care how he'd turn out

71
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
as long as I can chase him out
of the company.
