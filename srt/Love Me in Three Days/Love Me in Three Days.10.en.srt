=Episode 10=

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,000
Chenxing,

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,680
actually, Shan Yifan's secret
is that he'll transform.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,840
As long as he touches someone
for more than five seconds,

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,480
he'd turn into that person's appearance.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,080
He could only change back to himself
after kissing me.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,520
I got it.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,400
Do you believe me?

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,400
Yes.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,560
So, do you like to kiss him?

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,520
Do you like to kiss him or not?

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,080
Why are you asking this?

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Who are you?

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,880
Chenxing!

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,240
You have yet to answer my question.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,120
You're Shan Yifan.

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Do you like to kiss him or not?

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
No!

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,360
Do you know

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,760
what's the consequences
for telling him my secret?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,040
What consequences could there be?

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,920
Chenxing just wants to act
in his own movie.

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,800
It's not as simple as you think it is.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,400
He won't keep the secret for me.

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,400
If he finds out, Zhou Hongmei
will find out as well.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,920
She'll expose me

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,320
and I'll not be the CEO anymore.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,320
It's up to you
whether you want to tell him or not.

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,840
Hey!

31
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,920
Won't you help him?

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,560
Chenxing, wake up. Chenxing.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,880
The super idol, Shan Chenxing.

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,160
I've finally got the photo.

35
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,360
I really saw myself there.

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,600
Li, do you think I'm going crazy?

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Going crazy?

38
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,080
Where are you going?

39
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,080
You're now on four news.

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,840
Shan Chenxing seems to be dating.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Shan Chenxing's taste is terrible.

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,280
Shan Chenxing's dating his fan.

43
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,680
Shan Chenxing's lying to his fans.

44
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,200
When did I lie to my fans?

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,640
His taste is terrible?

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,920
- What do they mean?
- What do they mean?

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,040
We're in big trouble.

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,040
The fans didn't know your girlfriend
is among them.

49
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
Show it to me now.

50
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,140
(Shan Chenxing's lying to his fans.)

51
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,080
Why not we make a statement

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,920
to clarify this?

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,440
No way.

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,960
You're my fan.

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,960
We're meeting in private.

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,000
That's like telling them it's true.

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
It will only be worse.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,080
What should we do then?

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,280
Luoluo, sacrifice yourself.

60
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Endure it and the rumour will be over.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
Mr. Shan, I'm back.

62
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Miss Xia, you're here.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,640
This is the attire for today's dinner.

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Please try it.

65
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,760
Didn't you hurt your arm?

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,760
I sprained my ankle.
When did I hurt my arm?

67
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,520
You remember it wrongly.

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,200
Xia Luoluo.

69
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,840
What?

70
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
Well, can you help
Mr. Shan to try his clothes?

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,880
Me?

72
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,560
Yes.

73
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,120
Go behind him.

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,280
Make sure his sleeves are neat, okay?

75
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,840
The shirt inside.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,720
Adjust the collar, okay?

77
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,560
The neck tie.

78
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,600
No, Xia Luoluo, don't you know
how to wear a neck tie?

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Are you wearing a red scarf?

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Why not you do it?

81
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,560
What?

82
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,480
Are you still angry about yesterday?

83
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,400
Stop flattering yourself.

84
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,880
No.

85
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,840
Why do you look so pale today?

86
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,640
I'm low on blood sugar.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If you didn't enslave me,

88
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,680
I would've eaten my meal.

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Miss Xia,

90
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,640
here's your parcel.

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,320
Thank you.

92
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
Such a big love-shaped box.

93
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,800
Which admirer's secret gift is that?

94
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,280
It's none of your business.

95
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Why do I think

96
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
something is wrong?

97
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Go and check it out.

98
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Okay.

99
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,520
Why was she doing with the tie?

100
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,160
I found this in the rubbish bin
after a few hours,

101
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,120
but I think you shouldn't look at it.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Why not you take a look?

103
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
You shouldn't look at it.

104
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Take a look.

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
No.

106
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm afraid you will...

107
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Give it to me.

108
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,700
(Xia Luoluo, go to hell.)

109
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,440
Let's go and look for her.

110
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,840
Tonight's dinner is very important.

111
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Let's turn back.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why are you looking at me?

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
The engine hasn't started.

114
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,920
Start the engine then.

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,040
Where are you going?

116
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,800
What are you doing? There are reporters.

117
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,640
They're coming.

118
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,920
I asked the reporters to come.

119
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,640
What are you doing?

120
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,800
She's here.

121
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
They're coming.

122
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,000
What's your relationship?

123
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Everyone,

124
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,040
I'm the CEO of Xinge Group, Shan Yifan.

125
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,800
Today, I'm here to clarify

126
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,640
Miss Xia Luoluo's identity.

127
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,240
She's not Shan Chenxing's girlfriend.

128
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Not Shan Chenxing's girlfriend?

129
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,160
Whose girlfriend is she?

130
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,680
She's my

131
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,400
fiancee.

132
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,920
- Fiancee?
- Fiancee?

133
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
Why is she your fiancee?

134
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,080
When did you date?

135
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Please answer this question.

136
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,160
