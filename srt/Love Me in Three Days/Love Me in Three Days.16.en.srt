3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,600
Yifan?

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,680
Don't talk.

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,160
I've finally got to know your secret.

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,800
That's your hobby.

7
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,280
This place is nice.

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,800
I only came here with you. I don't
usually come to places like this.

9
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,000
It's fun.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,640
Luoluo.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,080
I was thinking for
the whole night yesterday.

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,000
I think we should go to the next phase
in our relationship.

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,200
You like me, right?

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
I...

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,200
I know you're too shy to say that.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,160
But as a fan,

17
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,080
who wouldn't want to be with her idol?

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,400
Do you know what's your difference
with stars?

19
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,180
What's it?

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
The difference is

21
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,640
stars are in the sky

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,640
and you're in my heart.

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Be with me.

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
What are you doing?

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
Why are you here?

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,240
He's trying out his acting.

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,680
Yes.

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Trying out your acting?

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
What a coincidence.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,960
I have a series that you can try.

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
Let's go. Prove it to me.

32
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,560
Now?

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,960
Yes.

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
That's too rushing.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's go.

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Let's go?

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,720
Do you know

38
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,800
what's your difference with stars?

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
The difference is stars are in the sky

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,400
and you're in my heart.

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,560
Cut! Mr. Shan, what do you think?

42
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
It's such a simple performance.

43
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,680
My brother can't showcase
his acting talents.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,800
Change to a wild acting.

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,520
Do you know
what's your difference with stars?

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Make it sad.

47
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,960
The difference is

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,760
stars are in the sky...

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Make it silly.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,800
And you're in my heart.

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,000
Make it sad and cry.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,600
Don't leave me.

53
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,200
Do you know
what's your difference with stars?

54
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,040
Stars are in the sky

55
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,000
and you...

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,360
Okay, he can act.

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm sure he really understood
the meaning of this line.

58
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Okay, cut! Done!

59
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,520
Did you do that on purpose just now?

60
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,600
Hand. Let go.

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,360
You can tell me if you don't
like me pursuing Xia Luoluo.

62
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,560
Do you have to do that?

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
So, you've admitted it?

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
Yes, I've admitted it.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
Not just that I've admitted,
I'm also telling you this.

66
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
We'll compete fair and square
from today onwards.

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,040
Let's see who Xia Luoluo
will fall in love with, okay?

68
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,480
Okay, but let me tell you this.

69
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,720
First of all, Xia Luoluo is not a toy.

70
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,440
Second,

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm not interested

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,240
in playing this game
to compete with you.

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,520
Well, I'm not like someone

74
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,520
who has a childhood sweetheart.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,480
What do you mean?

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,200
Don't you know Xuewei is back?

77
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,720
Why are you so late? Come in quickly.

78
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,280
Come in.

79
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,200
I've been waiting for you.

80
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,880
Your caregiver company
said you'll be here in one hour.

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,840
You've got it wrong. I'm not...

82
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,400
It's okay. Not a big deal to be late.

83
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,640
Help me to tidy these.

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,640
Look at my Yifan.

85
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,200
He doesn't know how to take care
of himself when I'm not around.

86
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Yifan?

87
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
Yifan.

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,760
Hold on.

89
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,480
Are you okay?

90
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,400
Yifan,

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
you know this caregiver?

92
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,400
She's not a caregiver.

93
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,560
Who is she then?

94
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
She's my...

95
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,720
I remember now.
She's your secretary. Get up.

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,760
I'm sorry, big sister.

97
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,160
I've seen you on a photo.

98
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,160
It's just that I didn't get
to recognise you.

99
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,680
You won't blame me, right?

100
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,800
You can get the identity wrong,

101
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,880
but not my age.

102
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,120
Right, big sister?

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,520
It's because your outfit is so simple,
big sister.

104
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Well,

105
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,880
this is Yifan's favourite perfume.

106
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,080
Take it as a gift of my apology.
Take it.

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,360
It smells like tea.
It's indeed the smell Mr. Shan likes.

108
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,640
Luoluo.

109
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,440
Can you listen to my explanation?

110
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,800
Call me Miss Xia.

111
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
It's not what you're thinking.

112
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,000
My father asked me to marry her
when I was little,

113
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,600
but I guarantee you that I'm only
treating her like a little sister.

114
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,800
I don't care how many sisters you have.

115
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,080
From now on, besides work,

116
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,600
we'd better not contact
each other in private.

117
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,400
Luoluo.
