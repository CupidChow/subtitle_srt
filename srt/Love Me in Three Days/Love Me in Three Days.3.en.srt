=Episode 3=

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,760
The job scope is simple.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,960
Date me.

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,720
Date?

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,200
I was wrong.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,040
I was too eager

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,520
and didn't think about your feeling.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,080
So, let's start from dating.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,320
I was wrong.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,640
I didn't make it clear.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,760
I, Xia Luoluo,

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,520
and you, Shan Yifan,

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,080
are not going to get together.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,280
We won't even be friends.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,520
See you.

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,480
Shan Chenxing.

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,040
I heard that Shadow World has stopped
the production, is it true?

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,720
Everyone,

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,440
no comments.

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,080
Thank you.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,800
I heard that you and your elder brother,
Shan Yifan, are not on good terms.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,640
Everyone,

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,120
that's all for today. Thank you.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Can you watch where you're going?

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,000
Are you Shan Chenxing?

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,240
I noticed that you reporters are crazy.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,200
You're here to look for me.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
No.

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,080
I'm Xingxing.

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm your fan.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,320
It's true.

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,640
Come on. Do you want
to take a photo or what?

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,040
No, I don't mean that.

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,880
Actually, I've liked you
for a long time.

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,200
No.

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,280
You two won't get off?

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,440
I've been looking for you everywhere.

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,560
Where should I go?

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
Can't you look at me?

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,440
I've called you many times.

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,600
Where were you?

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,480
I've just finished my meeting.

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,440
Sigh.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,480
I need to talk to you
about something private.

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,440
Won't you help me out with the movie?

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,080
It's the company's decision.

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
It has nothing to do with me.

49
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,360
The company again.

50
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,040
Can you stop suppressing me
using the company?

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,600
Shadow World is a great project.

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,720
I've talked to the director
for a long time.

53
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,680
Have you read the script?

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,440
No.

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,360
So, I know better than you

56
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,160
what a good project is.

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,040
No.

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,280
We're brothers.

59
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm not your staff.

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,680
Won't you help me out?

61
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,560
Where are you now?

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,600
In the lift.

63
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,400
The company's lift.

64
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,920
Just do it in the company's way.

65
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,640
Miss Xia Luoluo.

66
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,360
Name your price.

67
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,960
What should I do so you'll date me?

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,440
Dating is not a deal.

69
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,720
You're humiliating me.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,480
Miss Xia, right?

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,320
Are you free tonight?

72
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,920
I want to buy you dinner.

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,360
Okay.

74
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
No way.

75
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,880
She and I have something to talk about.

76
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm not talking to you.

77
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,680
Shan Chenxing.

78
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,400
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,920
This is a gift for you
as my apology for running into you.

80
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,680
I wasn't watching. Did I frighten you?

81
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,400
How would I be frightened by you?

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,520
Well, Chenxing,

83
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
do you remember this?

84
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,640
It's so lame.

85
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Am I supposed to remember it?

86
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,520
It's not lame.

87
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,040
You gave it to me five years ago.

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,040
It doesn't seem so lame now.

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,520
It matches you well.

90
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,880
Actually, there's something

91
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,280
that I need a favour from you.

92
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,480
What's it?

93
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,400
Come here.

94
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,520
Can you promise me to be my...

95
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,800
Be my...

96
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
What?

97
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,560
Be my brother's girlfriend.

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,440
Listen to me.

99
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,120
Shan Yifan has a lot of secrets.

100
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
He always disappears.

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,040
He'd disappear for three days
every time.

102
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,960
If you become his girlfriend,

103
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
you'll know where he's going.

104
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,480
Then you will tell me all his secrets.

105
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,960
That's not good.

106
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,760
It's his privacy after all.

107
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Luoluo.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,920
Let me feed you.

109
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,440
Can't you do it for me?

110
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Come on.

111
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,080
Stop crying. Your makeup is messed up.

112
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,240
It's fine now.

113
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,360
You're out here already,

114
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,960
right?

115
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
I don't know how to talk well.

116
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,340
I don't know how to comfort you.

117
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,260
My mother made this for me.
I'll give it to you.

118
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,040
(He's helped me before.)

119
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,580
(I should return him the favour.)

120
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,280
Okay.

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,800
I promise you.

122
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,600
It's a deal.

123
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,000
Why didn't you pick up my call?

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,280
Come with me.

125
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,520
Wait.

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,720
Let's go.

127
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,860
What should I do so you'll date me?

128
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,740
Okay, I promise you

129
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,660
since you're so determined.

130
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,540
But,

131
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,860
I'll not be your girlfriend,

132
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,660
but your secretary.
