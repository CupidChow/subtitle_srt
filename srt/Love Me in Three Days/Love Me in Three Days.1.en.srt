=Episode 1=

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,880
(I, Xia Luoluo, am a corporate slave)

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,600
(that is about to meet my boyfriend's
parents for our engagement.)

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,840
(I thought love is taking
one step at a time)

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,800
(and boring.)

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,080
(Until I met the man)

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,680
(who kept others' appearance for three days
after touching with them.)

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,760
I'm here, mother.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,680
Yes, I'm downstairs.

11
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,640
Wait for me.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,380
Smile.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,920
Jiang Xincheng!

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,880
What are you doing?

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,160
Luoluo.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,760
Are you cheating on me?

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,160
With Xie Shuang?

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
I...

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,240
It's not like what you think it is.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
What's it then?

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,880
I have something on. I'm leaving.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,720
Don't go.

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,880
Just tell me

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,600
if you don't like me.

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,800
Why did you cheat on me
with my best friend?

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,240
Luoluo, it's not like
what you think it is.

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,280
Am I that bad?

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Why did you cheat on me?

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,120
I didn't.

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Tell me.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Tell me now.

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,160
Buddy, help me out.

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Let go of me.

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Come here.

35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,400
You don't look like a lady at all.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,080
Let go of me.

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,720
Shouldn't I choose her?

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,800
(This is bad. His hand.)

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,960
(He's been touching Mr. Shan
for a while now.)

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,320
It's too late.

41
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Don't go.

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,480
Mr. Shan,

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,600
let's leave this place

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,760
before someone noticed this.

45
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,900
Jiang Xincheng!

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,100
Jiang Xincheng!

47
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,340
Are you a coward?

48
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,340
Why are you hiding from me?

49
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,460
You got the wrong person.

50
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,660
Are you saying that you kissed
the wrong person as well?

51
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,020
Let me repeat.

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,300
You got the wrong person.

53
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,020
Didn't you notice that
my clothes are different?

54
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,140
Don't try to fool me.

55
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,700
Enough!

56
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,860
You...

57
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,900
You...

58
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,740
Not bad.

59
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,420
Xia Luoluo,

60
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,100
you're cheating on me.

61
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,100
What's going on?

62
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,340
Mr. Shan, your clothes...

63
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,260
Who are you? Why are you all in here?

64
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,260
Mr. Shan, why did you change...

65
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,220
Did I run into some spirits?

66
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,220
Xia Luoluo.

67
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,700
I didn't know you're like this.

68
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,170
Mother, it's not like that.

69
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,690
Madam Zhang,

70
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,410
I think Luoluo

71
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,170
should give me an explanation.

72
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,170
Mother, they cheated on me
and they're framing me now.

73
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,330
I saw Jiang Xincheng came in here.

74
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,530
I wanted to pull him out.

75
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,530
After I kissed him accidentally,
he changed...

76
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,930
Madam.

77
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,570
I'll take the responsibility.
