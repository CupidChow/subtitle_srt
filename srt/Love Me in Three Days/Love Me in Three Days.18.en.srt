=Episode 18=

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,920
I've almost forgotten.
We're having a meal here

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,400
for another matter.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Yifan and I are getting married.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,840
You must attend our wedding.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,040
So, I'm getting married? Why

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,400
no one is discussing with me?

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Ms. Zhou asked me to send it.
I have no idea.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,280
Your father set the date
when he was alive.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,120
Have you forgotten?

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,880
I'm coming back

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,120
to get married to you.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,120
Luoluo.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:54,960
I

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
really didn't know about this.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,960
You don't have to explain to me.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,080
I wish you two a happy marriage
and stay old together.

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,480
Thanks for your kind words.

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,640
Luoluo,

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
I have something to tell you as well.

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,720
I wanted to surprise Luoluo,

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,800
but I'm taking the opportunity today

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,720
to tell you all that

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm officially confessing

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,840
to Luoluo.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,640
Xuewei.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,120
I think I've already repeated
myself many times.

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,840
The arranged marriage between us

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,320
was a joke of the elders.

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,480
I've never treated it seriously.

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,320
All these years,

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,320
I've been treating you as my sister.

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,920
I'm glad that you're back here,

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,640
but I hope you won't

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,920
interfere with my life too much,

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,720
especially when
it's related to Xia Luoluo.

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,680
I've always dreamed of marrying you.

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,520
Who is she to take you away from me?

40
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,560
What's so good about her?

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,680
Yan, let's go.

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,560
Madam Zhou.

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,800
What has Xia Luoluo done to Yifan?

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,800
What's going on?

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,120
It didn't go well?

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
No matter what,

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,400
I'll never let go.

48
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,520
Yifan is mine.

49
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,760
Be nice.

50
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,920
He's just being threatened

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,560
by the witch, Xia Luoluo.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,760
When we find out about
Xia Luoluo and Yifan's secret,

53
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,480
we'd be able to help Yifan
to get rid of Xia Luoluo.

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,480
Don't worry.

55
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,240
I'll find out the truth.

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,200
Luo,

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
you don't have a sweet tooth, do you?

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,680
What's wrong?

59
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,280
I just want to taste

60
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,880
the sweet taste of love.

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
Are you able to taste it?

62
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,720
It's a bit sour

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,920
and bitter,

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
but it's not sweet.

65
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,840
Is this Baxi fake?

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,040
Luo,

67
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,440
this is not fake.

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,240
"8 Xi".

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
It's real.

70
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,160
It's fake.

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Even this is bullying me.

72
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,600
Luo,

73
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,920
if you're not happy,

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,160
just tell me.

75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,160
Tell me.

76
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,200
Shan Yifan

77
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,160
is getting married to someone else.

78
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,880
What?

79
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,880
I thought I'll get

80
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,000
a rich son-in-law.

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
Shan Chenxing

82
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,040
has confessed to me.

83
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,760
Shan Chenxing?

84
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,200
That celebrity?

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,280
Is Shan Chenxing the celebrity

86
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,040
that you got his autograph?

87
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,960
Luo,

88
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
he's not bad.

89
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,400
Shan Chenxing.

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,920
One is gone

91
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,200
and the other one comes.

92
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,440
It shows that you're charming.

93
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,800
Isn't that so?

94
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,880
How charming I am?

95
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,720
My daughter is beautiful.

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
I have two eyes and one mouth.

97
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
Luo, you know how to cook.

98
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,640
Do you mean I know how
to cook the processed food?

99
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,320
After all,

100
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,440
your

101
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,640
best characteristics are that

102
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,800
you're gentle

103
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
and reserved.

104
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,400
You do have the most motherly love

105
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,880
that you're complimenting me like that.

106
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,600
I should just eat ice-cream.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,160
Stop eating.

108
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,440
Stop being unhappy.

109
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,160
I didn't say that

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
to comfort you.

111
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,160
Do you remember when you were little,

112
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,920
I was busy with the business

113
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,600
and I didn't have the time
to take care of you?

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
I didn't even get to cook a meal

115
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,320
for you.

116
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,560
But you're really mature.

117
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,080
You've never blamed me.

118
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,080
You even took care of me back.

119
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,720
Do you remember

120
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,920
that you learned how to make dumplings,

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
cook noodles,

122
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,840
and prepare hot pot?

123
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,160
Do you know how happy I was

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
seeing all those?

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,240
I gave birth to you and raised you up.

126
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,560
I know you well.

127
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,640
You've been like this since young.

128
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,720
You'll never tell me
what happened to you,

129
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,840
worrying that I might go
and make a scene.

130
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,680
Also,

131
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,960
in my heart,

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,720
as long as your nose, eyes,

133
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,200
arms and legs are intact,

134
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,720
you're beautiful.

135
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,520
My daughter is so gentle

136
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,720
and kind.

137
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,040
You deserve to be loved.

138
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,680
Am I really that good?

139
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,120
Not just that,

140
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,960
Xia Luoluo, listen to me.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,640
My biggest wish in this lifetime

142
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,480
is for you to be happy.

143
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,560
Of course,

144
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,600
it'd be better if you could

145
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,040
marry Shan Chenxing.

146
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
I don't care.

147
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,120
When you see him next time,

148
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,160
get me some of his autograph.

149
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,560
I can use it to pay when
I lose in my mahjong game.

150
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,240
Mother.

151
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,880
What?

152
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
Remember.

153
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
You're not allowed to be unhappy.

154
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,960
Do you hear me?

155
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,080
Can I take a photo with you?

156
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,720
Sure.

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,640
Thank you.

158
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,880
Chenxing.

159
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,120
Luoluo.

160
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,840
What's

161
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,960
going on here?

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,200
I was worried that you're not coming.

163
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,400
But as soon as I see you,

164
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,280
I'm so much relieved.

165
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,760
Luoluo,

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,560
can you give me a chance?

167
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,640
If you accept the flower,

168
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,000
it means you've accepted me.

169
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,840
Breaking news?

170
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,720
Super idol is pursuing
his ex-sister-in-law?

171
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,640
He's not bad.

172
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,960
He can work in UC now.

173
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,880
Yifan.

174
