=Episode 11=

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,720
I know why you said
that I'm your fiancee.

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,080
It's for the reputation of Xinge Group.

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,560
It's for the stock of Xinge Group then.

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,600
Is that all you can think of?

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
Don't worry.

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
No matter what,

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,840
I'll not exalt myself and

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
think that you like me.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,240
Your daughter, Luoluo, is capable.

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,960
She's got you a rich son-in-law.

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,200
Shuqin's teaching her well.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,080
You should quickly teach us
the skill, too.

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,240
There's no skill.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,480
Luoluo has been excellent

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,800
since she was born.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Ask her if you don't believe me.

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,640
- She has been this excellent since young.
- Yes, she has.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Are you okay?

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Shuqin, look.

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,640
I have to record this.

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,040
- Come on. Luoluo's proposing to him.
- Luoluo.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,600
Carry on. I'm recording this.

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,480
Mother, no, you've got it wrong.

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
No way.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,960
I'm recording this. Carry on.

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
You've got it wrong.

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,760
Come on. Luoluo's proposing to him.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
Hurry, Luoluo.

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,160
Mom, stop sending it to the groups.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,280
The news is fake.

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Why would I marry him?

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,840
I'm hanging up.

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,200
I'm running late.

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Stop sending it around.

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Mrs. Shan, good morning.

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,200
No, you've got it wrong.

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
It's all fake.

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,280
No.

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,960
Sorry, I'm running late.

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,600
The whole company is yours.

43
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,360
You can come at any time. Please.

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
I'll go get a glass of water.

45
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,720
Mrs. Shan, how could I let you
get the water by yourself?

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Let them do it.

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,960
Give the young people a chance.

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,080
No.

49
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,880
This is the agreement
from yesterday, right?

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,680
Let me do it.

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
No need.

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
Fish,

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,720
you've heard it as well?

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,280
Don't listen to it.

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Forget it.

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,680
It's fake.

57
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,880
It's fake.

58
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,400
Miss Xia.

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Although I'm not willing to,

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,680
you'll be Mr. Shan's assistant

61
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,360
from now on.

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,360
Remember.

63
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,360
Coffee.

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,280
53 degree.

65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,960
We're just acting.

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,440
You don't have to be so serious.

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,160
Acting? What are you talking about?

68
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,160
The fiancee rumour is only a strategy to
avoid the company from being affected.

69
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,520
You think he really likes me?

70
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,760
What if he really likes you?

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,320
Tell me. What's my strength?

72
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Your strength...

73
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,400
You have no strength.

74
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,880
But you have 50 flaws.

75
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,680
For example,

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,480
your body,

77
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,640
your look,

78
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,920
and your working performance.

79
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,880
Enough.

80
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,800
I know I'm the ugly duckling.

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,960
Anyways, we're not
in any relationship.

82
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
If there is,

83
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,080
it's a hate-hate relationship.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,720
Mr. Shan.

85
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,800
Come with me.

86
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
So domineering?

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,000
Let go of me. It hurts.

88
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
What?

89
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,040
Do you really want nothing
to do with me so badly?

90
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Of course.

91
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,200
You don't want to
get married to me at all?

92
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,680
I want to find a man whom I love
and loves me back.

93
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,440
Mr. Shan, which one are you?

94
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Tell me.

95
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,560
(Someone is taking photo of Luoluo.)

96
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,000
(If they found out that
we're not on good terms,)

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,240
(Shan Yifan will be on news again.)

98
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,960
Your collar is not tidy.
Let me help you.

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,120
Let me help you with your hair.

100
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,320
Let's take a photo.

101
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
The lighting is good here.

102
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,440
Has the person left?

103
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Yes.

104
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,480
What were you saying? Say it.

105
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
I'm not saying it.

106
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,040
Why not?

107
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Because you're stupid.

108
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
What do you mean?

109
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Guess what I mean.

110
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,400
I don't want to guess.

111
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
Is it that hard to understand?

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't get it.

113
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,240
Dear, I'm hungry.

114
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,480
Let's go for a meal.
