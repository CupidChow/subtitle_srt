=Episode 19=

3
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,200
Luoluo.

4
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,000
Can you give me another chance?

5
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,480
Don't you think it's too late now?

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,360
But, I really don't want to lose you.

7
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,600
I mean it.

8
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,360
Well.

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,880
Let's play a game.

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,240
You're not playing?

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,720
No, you...

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,600
Stop.

13
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,680
Are you playing or not?

14
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,680
I'll ask and you answer.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,240
If your answer meets my requirement,

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,840
you can take a step ahead.

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,000
If it doesn't,

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
you need to take a step back.

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,920
Why not we...

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,480
Stop.

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,560
Go back.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,400
Okay.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,240
Are you playing or not?

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,960
Yes.

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
From now on,

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,480
can you not have any other girls

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,360
by your side besides me?

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,720
But there are 358 female employees
in Xinge Group.

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,680
I can't possibly get them...

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,400
Step back.

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,280
Do I have more strength than flaws?

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,960
Why not we change...

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,800
Stop.

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,520
Get back.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,080
I got the answer now. Step back.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,280
Step back.

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
The last question.

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,920
Am I the most beautiful woman
in the world?

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,400
Tell me.

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,560
If you insist on asking such a question

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
in a macroscopic scale,

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,440
I really...

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,760
Step back!

44
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,160
Can't you say something
to make me happy?

45
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,360
It's so annoying.
I'm not playing with you anymore.

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,560
Xia Luoluo.

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,720
The exclusive seat next to me
has always been yours.

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,840
No other girl has seated on it
besides you.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,040
You asked me if you have more strength
or more flaws.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,760
I don't care about
your strength or flaws,

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,000
I like you.

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
As long as it's you,

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,720
I like it.

54
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,200
I don't mind.

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,760
You asked me

56
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
if you're the most beautiful girl
in the world.

57
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
At least in my heart,

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,720
you're the most beautiful girl.

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,240
So,

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
do you like me?

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,760
What do you think?

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,280
I like you.

63
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,800
Of course I like you.

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,960
I like you very much.

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
Not like I'm a tool to you?

66
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,400
You're the girl I like the most
in my life.

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,560
Is it like love?

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,240
It's love.

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,840
You're my everything and my whole world,

70
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,600
okay?

71
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,040
But I really...

72
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,600
You know me.
I don't know how to express myself.

73
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,880
I don't know what to say.

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,520
You're my everything.

75
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,400
All right.

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,840
I got it now.

77
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,160
Come over.

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,240
♪I'm honoured to have met you♪

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,800

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,200
♪You have wide shoulders♪

81
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,080
Come over.

82
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,160
♪Protecting me from the rain and wind♪

83
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,440
♪Keeping you company is an honour♪

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,760

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,360
♪Love is shining gently♪

♪In our eyes♪

87
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,640
So, I have a boyfriend now,

88
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,280
right?

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Wait.

90
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,840
What about Shan Chenxing?

91
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,920
You didn't say yes to him?

92
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,560
You only noticed that now?

93
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,200
Luoluo, can you give me a chance?

94
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,720
If you accept the flower,

95
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,840
it means you've accepted me.

96
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,320
Chenxing,

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,800
I know when I was in trouble,

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,840
you've helped me before.

99
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,240
But, I was only moved,
not like I like you.

100
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,520
Admiration is not love either.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,720
So,

102
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,920
I'm so sorry.

103
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,160
I can't accept you.

104
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,280
Is it because of Yifan?

106
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,080
You told me that

107
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,520
I'm gentler

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,880
and more thoughtful than him.

109
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,760
Luoluo,

110
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,080
if you agree to be with me,

111
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,240
I'll treat you better.

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,120
But...

113
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,400
But, he's now in my heart.

114
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,680
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,520
Take this.

116
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,560
Take this.

117
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,240
Even if we can't be together,

118
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,680
we can still be friends.

119
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,080
Thank you.

120
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,040
What a shame.

121
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,040
He was pursuing me with passion,

122
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,920
I couldn't return the favour.

123
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,280
Fine.

124
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,760
I'll invest in his Shadow World.

125
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Take that as your return to him.

126
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,640
Why are you being so nice to me, Yifan?

127
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,160
Of course. Isn't he your idol,

128
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,280
Luoluo?

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,760
Are you serious?

130
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,080
Of course.

131
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,320
Fine, look for my brother then.

132
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,720
Okay, fine.

133
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,200
Are you angry?

134
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,760
What did Xia Luoluo do

135
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
that she gets to seduce Yifan?

136
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,800
She's good at that.

137
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Not only did she seduce Mr. Shan Yifan,

138
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,360
she's seducing Mr. Shan Chenxing
as well.

139
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,440
I knew it.

140
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,200
It's my fault

141
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,640
that I didn't come back earlier.

142
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,200
Yes, Miss Xuewei.

143
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,000
What are you doing?

144
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,640
Sit back there.

145
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,160
I think

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,840
you're the perfect match for our CEO.

147
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,520
Xia Luoluo

148
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,280
is a pretentious mistress.

149
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,640
She's not a good person.

150
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,200
I need to think of a way

151
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,080
to let Yifan know

152
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,680
what kind of a person Xia Luoluo is.

153
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,320
Mr. Fang,

154
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,560
help me make a invitation card.

155
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,480
(Chenxing is about to start his movie.)

156
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,720
(Why is he holding a home party?)

157
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,000
(Celebrities are different.
They celebrate everything.)

158
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,760
1108.

159
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,200
1109.

160
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,680
I'm all wet.

162
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,560
Why not you get changed
and put on the pajamas?

163
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,360
I'll get the customer service
to take the dirty dress from you.

164
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,880
Sure, I'll get changed now.

165
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,240
No worries.

167
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
(Xia Luoluo,)

168
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,440
(when I take a photo of you
meeting Shan Chenxing in private,)

169
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,520
(I'll see how you can still
get together with Yifan.)

170
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,080
How did you get in here?

171
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,840
What are you trying to do?

172
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,600
Xia Luoluo!

173
