Xia Luoluo!

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,040
How dare you meet Shan Chenxing
in private behind Yifan's back?

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,080
Yifan, how come it's you?

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,280
Who else do you think it is?

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,200
What did Xia Luoluo do

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,240
that she gets to seduce Yifan?

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,920
She's good at that.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,320
Yifan.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,160
Touch me.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,320
No.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,840
Hurry up.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,560
That's not nice.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,880
I'll pull back my investment.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,360
Hand.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,080
You should've told me earlier.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,560
Xuewei,

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,120
your tricks are flawed.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,920
It shows that you're actually
not a bad person.

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,360
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,360
I obviously saw Shan Chenxing
going in there,

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,880
why did it become Yifan?

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,680
Luckily I have my last resort.

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,640
(Hurry up, kiss me.)

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,080
(Hurry up.)

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,280
(Hurry up. Transform back quickly.)

28

Hello, Madam Zhou.

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,600
I've found out how Yifan

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,760
is being controlled by Xia Luoluo.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,440
How was my acting just now?

32
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,200
Not bad.

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,560

No.

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,440
What do you want then?

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,840
I want you to dance Koduck for me.

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,560
What's Koduck?

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,320
This one.
