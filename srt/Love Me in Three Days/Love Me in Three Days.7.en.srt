=Episode 7=

3
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,317
Just like what everyone heard,

4
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:28,277
Shan Yifan's secret is that
he'll transform after touching other people.

5
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,957
I don't want to cover up
for him anymore.

6
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:35,357
He shouldn't be the CEO anymore.

7
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:38,277
From today onwards,

8
00:00:38,477 --> 00:00:41,117
you can take revenge

9
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:42,117
on him.

10
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:45,237
Shan Yifan,

11
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:46,637
you're done.

12
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:55,397
Mr. Shan.

13
00:01:05,517 --> 00:01:06,397
What?

14
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:07,797
Button me up.

15
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:09,397
Why?

16
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:11,957
Yan sprained his ankle.

17
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:13,557
There's only you today, Miss Xia.

18
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:15,997
Hurry up. The meeting is about to start.

19
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:20,757
Did you break your arms?

20
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:23,437
Don't you know how to button a shirt?

21
00:01:27,557 --> 00:01:29,237
The meeting is about to start.

22
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,037
I'm running late.

23
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:32,037
Do it yourself then!

24
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,517
I've said this many times.

25
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:42,477
Turn off the air-con when
there's no one in the meeting room.

26
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:46,357
No, it's not like what you think.

27
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:51,317
Your salary will be deducted
for the shirt.

28
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:59,677
I just tore a button.

29
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,277
You want me to compensate you?

30
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:03,157
Take it as a warning.

31
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:05,037
As long as you keep my secret a secret,

32
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:07,757
we're good.

33
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:09,557
That's too much.

34
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:10,557
That's way too much.

35
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:13,517
Oh, right.

36
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:15,317
I forgot to tell you that

37
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:17,037
your mother asked me to take dinner
at your place.

38
00:02:17,397 --> 00:02:18,237
What?

39
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:19,357
Yes.

40
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,157
You're having dinner at my place?

41
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:22,277
Yes.

42
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:24,957
Why do you want to have dinner
at my place?

43
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:26,597
Your mother asked me to go
and I don't want to reject her.

44
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:30,597
Don't come to my place for dinner.

45
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:34,837
It's too late.

46
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,317
Your house is just around there.

47
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:46,997
(Do you think it's easy to pretend
like my husband?)

48
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,157
Mr. Shan,

49
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:54,237
why not we just forget it?

50
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:57,197
Didn't you say your son-in-law

51
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:59,077
must be able to do chores?

52
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:00,997
He can carry the drinks.

53
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:02,517
Yes.

54
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:05,597
I'll do all these in the future.

55
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:06,637
Then

56
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:07,637
do it.

57
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:11,837
Show us what you got, Mr. Shan.

58
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:18,237
Goodness!

59
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:19,357
Be careful, Mr. Shan.

60
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:22,157
You've never carried
such heavy thing, right?

61
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:23,797
Are you that weak, Mr. Shan?

62
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,357
That's just one carton.

63
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:46,317
Look at you. No matter what,

64
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:47,717
he's a CEO.

65
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:48,837
Why are you torturing him?

66
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:51,317
It's nothing hard.

67
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:54,597
Are you going to help him?

68
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:56,877
What are you thinking about?

69
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:04,077
It's tough on you, Mr. Shan.

70
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:07,237
Mr. Shan, look.

71
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:09,757
Our washing machine is down again.

72
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:10,917
We need

73
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:13,077
your help with these.

74
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,757
You won't say no, right?

75
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:17,237
Well...

76
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:18,677
You won't say no for sure.

77
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:19,397
I know.

78
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,237
Carry on.

79
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:21,117
Do the dishes. Go ahead.

80
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:24,157
Thank you.

81
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:27,157
Come on.

82
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:31,237
I really like

83
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:34,837
my son-in-law.

84
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:36,717
Mr. Shan,

85
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:37,677
thank you.

86
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:39,117
As long as you're happy.

87
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,237
Didn't you say he's the honoured CEO?

88
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:47,077
No matter how honourable he is,

89
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:47,877
he's my son-in-law.

90
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:48,997
I need to test him out

91
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,877
for you.

92
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:51,197
Well done.

93
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:52,197
Who are you kidding?

94
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:53,477
I'm telling you.

95
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:54,357
I'll go out to play mahjong tonight.

96
00:04:54,357 --> 00:04:54,917
I won't come home.

97
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,717
See you, mother.

98
00:04:57,717 --> 00:04:58,477
Save that.

99
00:04:58,477 --> 00:04:59,677
Monitor him.

100
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:01,317
Make sure he does the laundry.

101
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:02,717
Bye.

102
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,677
Luoluo.

103
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:28,677
Luoluo.

104
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:30,717
Luoluo.

105
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:35,837
Luoluo.

106
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:40,197
Luo...

107
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:46,037
Pervert, why did you come in here?

108
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:47,037
Are you okay? I...

109
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:49,197
Go out now!

110
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:02,437
No, who locked the door?
