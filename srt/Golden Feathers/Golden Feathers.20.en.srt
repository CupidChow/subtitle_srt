1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,160
I just want to make sure.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,480
Are you sure of what?

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,920
That I still want you.

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,480
I gave up.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,240
I gave up on what?

6
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,120
Admit it.

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,160
That you are

8
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,120
worthless.

9
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,440
She couldn't

10
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,400
Defeat Logic.

11
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,680
She couldn't

12
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,880
To break his heart.

13
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,680
the thing you want,

14
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,480
She didn't even dare to take it.

15
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,120
impossible.

16
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,640
I just...

17
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,480
I'm just confused.

18
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,000
Still confused?

19
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,460
I won't waste my time

20
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,960
On the losers.

21
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,960
I won't give up.

22
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,080
No matter what happens,

23
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,440
You will be mine.

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,000
Good, Leo.

25
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,520
Whatever happens that night,

26
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,960
Don't deviate from the path.

27
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,560
never.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,040
I am loved

29
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,240
Golden feather.

30
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,240
When Logic falls in love with me,

31
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,680
I will break his heart

32
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,880
And I completely destroy it.

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,200
Leo,

34
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,600
Your sweetheart is here.
