1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,600
You dare hurt my
little brother?

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,493
How dare
you cause

3
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:13,460
trouble in
my school?

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,480
Go to hell!

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,240
Long live
the Queen!

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,600
I'm sorry...

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,640
It's my fault.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,780
Thank you,
Thanya.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,200
The greatest
hunter

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,754
is the one
who pretends

11
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:33,530
to be the prey.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,160
Logic,

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,060
your greatest
mistake

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,040
was taking Leo

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,160
away from me.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,600
I know.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,200
But what else
could I do?

18
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,570
It was Leo

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,200
who trapped
my heart.

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,880
And now,

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,234
I've already
given

22
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:51,110
my heart to him.

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,540
Then I
forgive you.

24
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,041
I allow the
two of you

25
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:57,820
to love
each other.

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,760
We will love each
other forever.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,060
Of course.

28
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,370
No one can
replace me,

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
just as no one
can replace you.

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,940
I love you.

31
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,130
I know.

32
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,760
Hello everyone,

33
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,970
I'm Logic.

34
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,260
Thank you,
Golden Feather,

35
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,438
for giving me
the chance to

36
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:02,209
campaign
on behalf

37
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:02,810
of my father

38
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,182
in his bid
for another

39
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:05,430
term as Prime
Minister.

40
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,390
And the person
beside me here

41
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,300
is my lover,

42
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,720
Leo.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,980
Fate

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,900
brought us
together,

45
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,876
to be each
other's

46
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:18,670
safe haven.

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,120
Hello,

48
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,420
I'm Leo.

49
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,910
And the person
beside me

50
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,910
is my lover.

51
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,420
Logic.

52
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,770
Honestly, I...

53
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
never
thought that,

54
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,210
once in my life,

55
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,834
I'd stand
here saying

56
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:38,510
something
like this.

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,260
I'm a
little shy,

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,180
But…

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,890
Love

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,220
is like life.

61
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,020
We must dare
to take risks.

62
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,390
Thank you

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
for finding each
other at last.

64
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,320
And the one I

65
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,030
cannot live
without

66
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,070
is my queen,

67
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,450
Thanya.

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Once,

69
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,750
we made a bet,

70
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,589
could we
change the

71
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:12,670
future of
this country?

72
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,210
The answer is...

73
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,670
yes.

74
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,170
We just have
to believe

75
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,510
in love.

76
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,140
And love

77
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,370
will be
the shield

78
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,350
that protects
our future.

79
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,130
