1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,301
Stealing a
bite from you

2
00:00:05,314 --> 00:00:06,080
makes it
taste better.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,720
(Why is my
heart racing)

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,920
(all the time?)

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,520
Stop
daydreaming.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
The game has
restarted.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,170
I will make you

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,200
fall in
love with me.

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,160
Open your mouth.

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,120
This is
an order.

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,320
Your mood

12
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,520
changes
too fast.

13
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,840
I can't keep
up anymore.

14
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,360
And do I
need to check

15
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,286
if there's
something

16
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:27,050
strange in this?

17
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,480
Whether there
is or not,

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,920
you still
have to eat it.

19
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,280
Got it?

20
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,260
Hey, look.

21
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,563
That couple
is making

22
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,710
me blush
to death.

23
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,724
The more I watch,
the more I swoon.

24
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:37,750
I'm already
pairing them up.

25
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,376
(Prince
Philip visits,)

26
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:45,795
(the leaders'
families will)

27
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:46,174
(attend
the welcome)

28
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:46,690
(banquet this
Saturday.)

29
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,400
What?

30
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,360
Don't tell me

31
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,640
you want me to
shove a phone

32
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,600
into my
mouth too.

33
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,800
Are you crazy?

34
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,200
Take me
with you.

35
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,815
This is my
father's

36
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:02,840
political
banquet.

37
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,920
My servant,

38
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,360
are you going
to defy me again?

39
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,920
Fine.

40
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,640
I'll take you

41
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,680
as my date.

42
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,920
Leo,

43
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,000
you promised me.

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,520
What?
