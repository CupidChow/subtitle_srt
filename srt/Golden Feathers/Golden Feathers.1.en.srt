00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,520
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,960
I am Logic,

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:03,848
the new student

4
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:04,360
council
president.

5
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,360
For all of you.

6
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,920
(Logic)
I promise

7
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,490
to uphold
the principles

8
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,690
of our Golden
Feather.

9
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,920
(Leo)
Edge and Grace.

10
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Be graceful.

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,748
(Thanya)
And be

12
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:13,520
(Thanya)
sharp-witted.

13
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,960
Thank you.

14
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,588
If he were
not the son

15
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:18,120
of the Prime
Minister,

16
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,720
then who
would choose

17
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,550
such an innocent
looking face?

18
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,520
Me.

19
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,290
This semester,

20
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,680
Logic is mine.

21
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,960
Would you
like to dance

22
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,120
with the most
beautiful girl

23
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,200
in this school?

24
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,280
Sorry, Thanya,

25
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,190
but I'm not
interested.

26
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,560
Hey!

27
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,774
You dare reject

28
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,200
the gorgeous
queen,

29
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,480
the goddess
of this school?

30
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,320
You'll see.

31
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,360
May you find
a partner

32
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,480
tonight.

33
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,560
Then I'll dance
with you instead,

34
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,680
Leo.

35
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,880
Sure.

36
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,360
(It seems
you refuse.)

37
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,908
(You are the
female partner.)

38
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:03,480
(Right?)

39
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,070
(Fine, let's go.)

40
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,800
You're crazy,
do you know that?

41
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,120
But it's fun.

42
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,480
Not really.

43
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,798
I'm just good at

44
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:24,880
driving
people mad.
