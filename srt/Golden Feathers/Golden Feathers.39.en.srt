1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,600
You silly kid.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,120
I really
want to know,

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,200
do you still
remember

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,210
your first love?

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,520
First love?

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,880
I remember...

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,400
it was
during summer,

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,760
by the lake.

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,120
I wanted

11
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,300
her necklace
so badly,

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
but she wouldn't
give it to me.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,840
See, Leo,

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,196
you make me

15
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:27,240
forget
everything.

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,360
Forget?

17
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,000
I also remember

18
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,280
I once dreamed

19
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,240
that when
I was ten,

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,440
I had a
high fever,

21
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,587
and then
I couldn't

22
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,040
remember anymore

23
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,480
what happened
after that.

24
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,720
My head hurts.

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,520
Logic,

26
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,480
can you do it
harder for me?

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,760
So I won't be
able to remember

28
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,600
anything at all.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,445
Thanya, do
we really

30
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,000
have to dress
like this?

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,920
Of course.
You lost,

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,800
so you have to
follow the deal.

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,181
Okay, then
what else

34
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,360
do you want
me to do?

35
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,560
Take that
kid's hat.

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,748
But you
must do it

37
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:38,600
like a
girl would.

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,160
Okay.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,560
I will never
give in.
