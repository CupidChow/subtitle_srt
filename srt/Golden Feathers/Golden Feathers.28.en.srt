1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,200
Then who
will love me?

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,400
We'll love
each other.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,760
After that,

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,508
you're the
only one

5
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:15,560
who's family
to me.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,720
I understand
you.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,822
Even though
I don't

8
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:18,440
really know much

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,880
about your
family,

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,268
those
words sound

11
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,080
familiar
to me too.

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,407
Not all parents

13
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,680
love their
children.

14
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,076
Not all
parents truly

15
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:28,200
love their kids.

16
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,760
Really?

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,520
Yeah. We have to
love ourselves,

18
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,600
a lot.

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,240
It's Thanya,
isn't it?

20
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,640
Forget it.

21
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,320
People are
all the same,

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,160
anyway.

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,920
I'm free,
you know.

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,680
Life's meant
to be fun,

25
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,400
not carrying
burdens.

26
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,960
You may be free,

27
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,400
but me?

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,911
My mom said
my path

29
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:53,800
was already
drawn.

30
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,080
Just like her,

31
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,462
trapped by
the blessings

32
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:57,840
and curses
of the family.

33
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,200
So,

34
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,480
are you going
to leave me?
