1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,480
Thanya,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,560
you don't mind
Logic, do you?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,560
I don't
mind Logic.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,520
But you...

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,858
go make me
my favorite

6
00:00:10,883 --> 00:00:11,520
cup of coffee.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,480
Okay.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,280
Thanya,

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,520
this necklace,
is it yours?

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,360
Yes,

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,600
of course.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,040
Here's your
coffee.

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,360
You two...

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,760
seem really
close.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,840
Of course.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,160
When I
was seven,

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,240
when our
families

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,800
came back
together,

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,680
I only had

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,160
Thanya

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,320
as my family.

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,080
That's sweet.

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,720
I'm going to
the toilet...

24
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,560
just for
a moment.

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,520
You are him,
aren't you?

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,480
The muddy
little boy...

27
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,320
of mine.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,840
You...

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,080
are that child?

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,760
Congratulations.

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,200
You found me.

32
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,360
I feel so lucky.

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,320
I never thought
I'd meet...

34
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,960
the real you.

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,560
Because I am

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,400
your first love.

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,790
The reason
you transferred

38
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:25,840
schools was
to find me.

39
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,040
Did Leo
tell you...

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,880
about that?

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,080
Was it a lie?

42
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,720
No.

43
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,488
Then what
are you

44
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:33,040
waiting
for, Logic?

45
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,560
Love me.

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,760
We…

47
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,131
should
never forget

48
00:01:38,156 --> 00:01:39,400
our heart's
beginning.
