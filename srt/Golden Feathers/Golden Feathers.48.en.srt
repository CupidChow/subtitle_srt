1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,560
The truth is...

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,280
you...

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,800
you are boring.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,520
Disgusting.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,040
Annoying.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,660
Could you please

7
00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:16,080
get off me
already?

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,720
Do you remember?

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
That Monday...

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,648
when you
told me to be

11
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,840
your lover
for a week.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,040
Everyone knew

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,560
it was just
a game,

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,570
that I was only

15
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,320
pretending
to woo you.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,920
I knew it was
kind of funny,

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,440
but do you know

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,480
what's even
funnier?

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,360
That I
actually fell...

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,200
in love
with you.

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,080
Leo,

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,360
maybe you're just
a spoiled kid.

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,480
At first,
you loved me,

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,265
but once
you had my

25
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,240
love, you
got bored.

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,000
I told you
from the start,

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,880
it was just
a game.

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,358
We weren't
supposed

29
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:19,040
to take it
seriously.

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,689
The truth
is, I already

31
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:22,560
found my
first love.

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,880
Then why
don't you

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,760
go be with her?

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,280
Because
my heart,

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,320
right now,

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,040
is with you.

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,240
At least,
for now.

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,360
Enough.

39
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,600
Please...

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
let's break up.

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,160
Fine.

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
I accept it.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,440
No matter
what happens,

44
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,600
I'm glad

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,280
I got to know
you and love you.

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,000
This game isn't
fun anymore.

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,320
It's okay.

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,441
I never should
have been at

50
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:25,920
Golden Feather in
the first place.

51
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,770
It's really
not...

52
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,840
right for me.

53
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,470
I am

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,320
Logic,

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,833
your student

56
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:12,320
council
president.

57
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,240
I hereby
announce that,

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,200
starting
tomorrow,

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,638
I will
resign from

60
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:18,400
Golden Feather.

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,760
It's a pity
that today

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,270
will be my
last day

63
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:23,040
in this
position.

64
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,920
Thank you,
everyone.

65
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,640
He's leaving
so soon...

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,720
not even till the
end of the term.

67
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,019
Guess he really

68
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:32,840
doesn't
belong here.

69
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,464
You broke up
with him, but you

70
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:36,090
still didn't

71
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,040
destroy
his heart.

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
I really don't
like this.

73
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:45,868
What are you

74
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:46,440
planning
to do now?
