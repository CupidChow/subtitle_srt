1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,320
You, you.

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,490
Welcome.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,330
Oh!

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,790
What the hell are you doing?

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,010
I have a Monday rule.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,088
First person

7
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:15,830
I see him when I wake up

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,026
He must be my friend

9
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:17,760
All week long.

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,000
Congratulations, Logic.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,050
You are the chosen one.

12
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,173
What nonsense

13
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:21,750
Are you talking about it?

14
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,210
I don't like men.

15
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,170
no.

16
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,090
Get out.

17
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,550
Mullah!

18
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,180
Give it back to me.

19
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,430
Your device.

20
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,640
Pretty cool, isn't it?

21
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,890
But it won't be used on me.

22
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,440
because.

23
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,140
I am from

24
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,460
He will use it on you.

25
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,980
Don't come any closer!

26
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,080
Logic.

27
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,920
Can you read

28
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,190
This is for me?

29
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,190
Sorry, Lily.

30
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,080
Logic،

31
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,210
Can you be my friend?

32
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,460
prattle.

33
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,710
How can two men

34
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,750
To be friends?

35
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,750
This is a complete lie.
