1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,700
Hey, sis.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Nice motorcycle.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:04,740
Mind if I
borrow it?

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,849
With looks
like yours, I'll

5
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:06,840
let you ride
for free.

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,880
Sorry,

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm in a
relationship.

8
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,080
Wow,

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,800
both of you
are so handsome.

10
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,080
Go on.

11
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,520
Thank you.

12
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,880
Why don't
you hop on?

13
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,090
Hurry.

14
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,000
Logic,

15
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,840
don't make
another mistake.

16
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,290
Come back
right now.

17
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
Ignore it.

18
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,080
Hop on!

19
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,800
Logic,

20
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,280
you are the Prime
Minister's son.

21
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,248
You are
the future

22
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:33,160
of this country.

23
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,840
You are my son.

24
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,200
That's
enough, Mom.

25
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,720
I am Logic.

26
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,600
That's all.

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,520
(If it weren't
for him,)

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,161
(I wouldn't
have had the)

29
00:00:57,186 --> 00:00:58,360
(courage to leave
that banquet.)

30
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,674
We look like
a runaway

31
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:00,480
couple,
don't we?

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
Don't you
like it,

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,808
running away
with someone

34
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,480
out of this
world like me?

35
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,640
No.

36
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,600
I love it.

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,480
Sorry.

38
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,188
My mother
came from

39
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:16,080
an old,
noble family.

40
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,552
When she
married my

41
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,680
father, an
ordinary man,

42
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,348
she pushed
him until he

43
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:21,560
became Prime
Minister.

44
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,880
And I

45
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,820
am her second
masterpiece,

46
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:26,360
groomed from
childhood,

47
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,358
with even
stricter

48
00:01:27,383 --> 00:01:27,800
discipline.

49
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,360
I'm the same.

50
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,920
My father is
a workaholic.

51
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,310
And my mother,

52
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,360
she's only
a stepmother.

53
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,720
No one loves me.

54
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,780
They only love

55
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,640
Thanya.

56
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,400
And

57
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
I love
Thanya too.

58
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,710
My birthday
is coming soon.

59
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,790
When will
Mom come back?

60
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
When will
Dad come back?

61
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,750
Lord Howard

62
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,520
is still in a
meeting, sir.

63
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,970
But I was
so scared.

64
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,354
Stop crying,
you're

65
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,040
louder than
the thunder.

66
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,680
I miss Dad.
I miss Mom.

67
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,960
No one is
here with me.

68
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,488
Why do I have
to stay with a

69
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:02,800
hot-tempered
brother like you?

70
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,377
Not all parents

71
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:06,080
love their
children.
