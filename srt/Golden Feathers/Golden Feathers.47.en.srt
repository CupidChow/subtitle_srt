1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,720
Hey, babe.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,072
I made
some salted

4
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:05,200
cheese cookies
for you.

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,360
Want to
try some?

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,400
Let's break up.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,390
Wait, Leo!

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,000
What happened?

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,400
Did I do
something wrong?

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,760
I can apologize.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,680
I'm tired
of this.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,810
I don't
want to play

13
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:29,240
this game
anymore.

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,720
Let's break up.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,445
Yesterday you

16
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,160
said you
loved me,

17
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:35,749
and today you're

18
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:36,640
breaking up
with me, Leo?

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,551
Do you think
you can just play

20
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:40,680
with my heart
that easily?

21
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,720
I just
wanted to test

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,120
if you were
boring.

23
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,920
And you really
are boring.

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,520
It won't end
that easily, Leo.

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,520
Come here.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,280
You can't
change anything.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,320
Say it again
that I'm boring.

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,560
Say it again!

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,760
You jerk!

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,880
Logic,

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,920
listen.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
You...

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
You...
