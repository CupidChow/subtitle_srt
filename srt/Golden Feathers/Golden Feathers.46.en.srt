1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,960
Do you think this
is just a joke?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,280
A joke?

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,588
Do you not care
about the bet, or

4
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:07,840
do you not care
about me anymore?

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,400
You know...

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,840
how much I
care about you.

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,600
I've always
loved you.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,880
Then destroy it.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,920
I can't destroy
the one I love.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,400
Loser.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,920
Listen to me.

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,144
Do you think
his love

13
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:29,240
is really
that strong?

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,893
I will reveal
everything

15
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:32,760
about our bet.

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,880
And Logic
will know

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,221
just how
despicable your

18
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:37,760
reason was for
approaching him.

19
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,733
The scandal
of the

20
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:40,920
Howard siblings

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,560
will be exposed.

22
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,920
And the beloved
sibling pair

23
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,960
of Golden
Feather,

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
you and I

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,360
will go to
hell together.

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
My dearest
little brother,

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,274
you should know

28
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:10,680
what it
feels like

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,320
when someone is
under pressure.
