1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,520
Leo,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,280
you've been
suspended.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,600
Little brother,

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,584
busy parents
who seem

5
00:00:08,597 --> 00:00:09,720
to have
disappeared

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,440
sent a message
saying...

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,040
you're grounded.

8
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,080
Hey,

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,040
wait, Leo.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,800
Our story is
over, Logic.

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,392
But our promise

12
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:22,370
was for
one month.

13
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,923
Then
consider this

14
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:24,840
my final order.

15
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,600
Follow it.

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,520
This time, you've
gone too far.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,040
Will it
really work?

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,040
We like...

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,880
to take risks,
don't we?

20
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,920
Of course.

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,040
What we want
isn't the body,

22
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,080
but the heart.

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,080
I thought
it was gone.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,680
So you kept it?

25
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,280
I don't
remember...

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,440
giving it
to you.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,840
Sorry,

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,360
I don't
remember either

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,160
when I
picked it up.

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,449
Things should be

31
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:15,600
returned to
their owner.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,880
Did you fall in
love with him?

33
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,760
I just...

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,920
I just want
him to love me.

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,960
Sorry for
being rude.
