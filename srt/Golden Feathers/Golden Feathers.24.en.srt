1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,960
I think

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,960
we should
end this

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,800
another way.

4
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,510
Logic's father

5
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,920
will lose next
year's election.

6
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,680
But my father
is a king.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,257
As long as
there are votes,

8
00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:09,440
they'll have
to beg me.

9
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:10,920
Logic has
no right

10
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,840
to negotiate
with me.

11
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,960
Ouch.

12
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,000
Listen.

13
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,000
Logic belongs
to me.

14
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,600
Only I can
give him orders.

15
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,160
If Your Highness

16
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,880
spouts any
more garbage,

17
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,480
the royal family
will crumble.

18
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,080
You're

19
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,120
so darn
tempting.

20
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,800
Leo.

21
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,760
Logic.

22
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,760
Come here,
right now.

23
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,790
Mom.

24
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,650
I…
