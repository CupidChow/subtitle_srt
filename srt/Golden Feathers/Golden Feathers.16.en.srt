1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,369
You're not
going to make

2
00:00:01,382 --> 00:00:02,280
me eat that,
are you?

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,160
What's going
on in your head?

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,760
I'm not
that twisted.

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,000
Just kidding.

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,040
I accept
the deal.

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,160
What do you
want me to do?

8
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,600
The deal
starts now.

9
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,580
No.

10
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,520
One week

11
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,840
is too short.

12
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,440
I want
one month.

13
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,040
Deal.

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,008
Do you think
Logic and

15
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:27,320
Leo are
really dating?

16
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,360
No idea.

17
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,800
No clue
who's on top.

18
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,832
He's my servant,

19
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:31,400
that's
what he is.

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,360
Your food
is here, Leo.

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,560
This is
what you're

22
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,000
eating today.

23
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,920
Leo's gone
crazy.

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,640
No, it's Logic

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,560
who's insane.

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,694
Fine. I
don't like

27
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:49,840
wasting
food anyway.

28
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,050
What's wrong,

29
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:54,080
giving up
already?

30
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,120
My servant.

31
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,240
All I said was

32
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,160
I hate
leftovers.

33
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,520
The motto of
our school is

34
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,120
Grace and Wit.

35
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,240
Right, little
brother?

36
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,160
The Prime
Minister's son.

37
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,680
My punishment

38
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
isn't a game.

39
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,920
Stop.
