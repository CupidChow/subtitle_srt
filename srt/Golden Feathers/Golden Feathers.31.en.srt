1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,580
Luna.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,750
Welcome to

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,930
Golden Feather.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,000
I will remember
your name.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,960
Luna.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,360
Luna.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,720
Are you okay?

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,080
Thank you.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,768
I am the student

10
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:22,280
council
president.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,007
I must
protect fellow

12
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:24,920
students anyway.

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,920
Did I

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,027
make things

15
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:28,280
between
you and Leo

16
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,400
worse?

17
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,920
I saw that you

18
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,200
care about
him a lot.

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,160
I am also
interested in Leo

20
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,320
for real.

21
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,828
But if he
still cannot

22
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:36,800
tell right
from wrong,

23
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,508
I think the
matter between

24
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:39,036
the two of us

25
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:39,760
will not
work out.

26
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,600
Logic,

27
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,580
you are...

28
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,550
sincere,

29
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,800
fair,

30
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,840
and kind,

31
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,960
just as your
friends expected.

32
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,470
I am not
really...

33
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,780
as good as
you say.

34
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,930
Can I...

35
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,680
be friends
with you?

36
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,960
Of course.

37
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,390
Then...

38
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,560
may I...

39
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,880
invite you

40
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,007
to a party at my

41
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:03,520
community
this weekend?

42
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,760
So suddenly
like this?

43
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,653
When I first

44
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:07,640
entered
this school,

45
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,520
my friends
laughed at me,

46
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,880
saying I
would never...

47
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
find friends at
Golden Feather.

48
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,240
But if you
go with me,

49
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,680
they...

50
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,040
will stop
laughing at me.

51
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,320
Luna,

52
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,040
I can be
friends with you.

53
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
But...

54
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,820
Logic,

55
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,880
I beg you,

56
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,120
please go to
school with me.

57
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,000
If you go,

58
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,628
those at
Golden Feather

59
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:34,800
who like
to bully me,

60
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,160
they will
not dare

61
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,240
to bully
me again.

62
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,280
Luna,

63
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,280
I understand
you.

64
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,640
I...

65
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,520
No.
