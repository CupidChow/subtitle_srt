1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,335
Cheap stuff
like this?

2
00:00:03,348 --> 00:00:03,960
No way I'm
drinking it.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,880
Then you choose.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,480
Whiskey X,

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,760
limited edition.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,571
The owner never

7
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:12,360
gave it
to anyone.

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,240
The boss
ordered,

9
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,388
if the Prime
Minister's

10
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:15,960
son wants
something,

11
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,800
he must have it.

12
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,360
No need to
flatter me.

13
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,680
I didn't
come here

14
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,590
to use
privileges.

15
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,880
Stop arguing.

16
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,960
Then it's
up to you.

17
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,920
Wait.

18
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,280
Did you
just call me?

19
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,680
Listen.

20
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,280
I'm sorry
about yesterday.

21
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,440
But you started
it first.

22
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,880
And who asked you
to pin me down?

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,760
So what now?

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,358
I'm pinning
you back,

25
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:41,000
of course,
idiot.

26
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,800
But this

27
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,960
wasn't part
of the deal.

28
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
Then go to hell.

29
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,920
Pick something
else.

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,960
Have these two
leave first.

31
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,120
Leave.

32
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,080
Pick something
else.

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,440
I can't think
of anything.

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,440
So what
do we do?

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,920
Then I'll make
a suggestion.

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,640
Anything
but death

37
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
or sleeping
with you.

38
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
One week.

39
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,880
Last time,

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,090
it was
your game.

41
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,550
But this round,

42
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,580
it's my game.

43
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,520
Seriously?

44
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,520
Anything at all?

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,360
Don't tell me…
