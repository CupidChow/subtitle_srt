1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Everybody,
get down!

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,560
Find cover,
everyone!

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,960
Run! Hurry!

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,480
I'll go out and

5
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:19,000
distract
them myself.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,440
No, I won't
leave you here.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,840
We must go
together.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,120
The truth is...

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,280
I'm not afraid

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,600
of you exposing

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
our bet.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,760
What I'm really
afraid of,

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,414
and what I don't

14
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:41,440
want to see
the most,

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,973
is seeing
you get looked

16
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:43,680
down on
by others,

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,600
like living
hell.

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,600
I can't
stand it.

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,200
And I don't
want...

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,070
to lose
you either.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,480
The truth is,

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,480
I once said...

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,320
I cannot

24
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,520
destroy the
ones I love.

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,400
That
includes you,

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,960
my sister,

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,640
and also Logic.

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,960
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
It's okay.

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,320
Return it to the
rightful owner.

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,960
Hurry and
go, sis.

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,240
I'll lure
them away.

33
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,160
Hey, over here!

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,640
You must die!

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,590
Leo!

36
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,280
Come on then,
over here!

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,020
Leo!

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,520
Hey, where'd
he go?

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,579
Why did you
come back doing

40
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:03,160
something
crazy like this?

41
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,800
You're in
danger!

42
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,240
How could I
leave you behind?

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,680
Are you insane?

44
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,680
We're not even
together anymore!

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,200
Where did you

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,040
get this
necklace?

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,800
Thanya.

48
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,200
She said...
return it

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,760
to the
rightful owner.

50
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,520
What does
that mean?

51
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,400
Or is this
necklace yours?

52
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,920
It's like...

53
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,280
I remembered
something.

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,920
When I was
7 years old,

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
I lost a bet
with Thanya.

56
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,800
What did
you bet on?

57
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,800
I don't know. I
can't remember.

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,720
I can't
remember.

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,120
I only
remember...

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,340
that I...

61
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,120
took a hat.

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,640
No.

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,649
I remember
it was a

64
00:02:58,662 --> 00:02:59,960
girl who
took my hat.

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
How do you
know that?

66
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,880
I was dressed
as a girl.
