1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,400
No.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,040
This is a
warning.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,828
(What exactly
did she)

4
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:11,200
(mean by
saying that?)

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,600
Tell me.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,160
Between you
and Thanya,

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,920
what happened?

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,184
I promised her I

9
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:26,240
wouldn't
tell you.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
Then everything
between us...

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,200
was a lie.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,640
Me...

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,680
And

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,800
your first
love too.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
I didn't lie.

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,720
But...

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,240
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,360
Can you give me a
little more time?

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
Right now I
still don't know

20
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:49,400
how to handle
everything.

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,920
Stop
overthinking it.

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
To hell with it.

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,000
Wait!

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,160
Stop fighting
already.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,920
Boys,

26
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,419
the Valentine's
party this

27
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:05,560
year is about
to begin!
