1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,720
Don't you know
your own status?

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,800
Going to a
slum like that.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,440
Don't you know

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,990
how dangerous
it is?

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,160
Are you looking
down on me

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,000
right now?

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,800
What do
you mean?

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,936
You probably
don't

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,440
know, do you?

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,257
That my
father also

11
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,360
grew up
in a slum.

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,240
Since you look
down on Luna,

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,457
look down on

14
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,360
people in
the slum,

15
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,880
that means...

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,560
you look down
on me too.

17
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,040
Sorry.

18
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,880
I... I
didn't know.

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,555
You were born
into a rich

20
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,800
family from
the start.

21
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,868
There are
still many

22
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:37,640
things you
don't know.

23
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,320
Even about
Thanya...

24
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,960
you probably
just want her,

25
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,815
but you don't
really care

26
00:00:41,828 --> 00:00:42,760
about her
feelings, do you?

27
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,480
I am at my wits'
end with you too.

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,160
Wait.

29
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,520
Give me the
invitation too.

30
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,490
(How can he
act so relaxed)

31
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:08,680
(in a place
like this?)

32
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,200
Oh.

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,600
Are you ready?

34
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,520
Fight,
fight, fight!

35
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,680
Is anyone
ready to fight?

36
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,092
Whoever
gets pushed

37
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:23,760
out of the
circle...

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
loses.

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,520
Begin!

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,680
Come on!

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,200
Fight a bit!

42
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,040
Fight!

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,760
Great, great!

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,880
Hey!

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,120
Someone
like you...

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,400
has to face me.

47
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,280
Hey!

48
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,380
Here we go!

49
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,360
Go for it!

50
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,440
Go for it!

51
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,760
Go for it!
