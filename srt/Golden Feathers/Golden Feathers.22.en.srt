1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,560
Don't get
frisky tonight.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,040
Relax, I'll
behave.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,860
(Philip)

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,720
Logic,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,960
long time
no see.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,280
You're still
as boring

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,120
as ever.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,440
Philip,

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,259
you're even
more annoying

10
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,400
than in the
tabloids.

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,440
And who are you?

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,560
Leo,

13
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,880
Logic's date?

14
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,008
You'd look
better if you

15
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:26,080
were on my
arm instead.

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,560
Philip,

17
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,280
this is an
official event.

18
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,591
Please conduct

19
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:32,480
yourself
properly.

20
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,680
Don't
lecture me,

21
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,780
you Prime
Minister's son.

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,160
Next year's
the election.

23
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,217
You and
your father

24
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:38,280
will be
crawling to me.

25
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
Don't forget

26
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,100
how much
my country

27
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,080
has invested
here.

28
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,240
So confident

29
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,480
in yourself,
aren't you?

30
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,040
But Leo,

31
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,280
I want to…

32
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,520
Don't you
dare touch me.

33
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,360
Hey.

34
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,360
Leo,

35
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,608
if you act
like this,

36
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:55,560
I can't
protect you.

37
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,606
A coward
like him

38
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:57,640
isn't worthy
of you.

39
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,240
And what business
is it of yours,

40
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,040
Prince Philip?

41
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,000
Logic

42
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,920
belongs to me.

43
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,320
He surpasses
you in every way.

44
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,960
Do you really
believe that?

45
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,080
Leo,

46
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,720
I told you,
he's useless.
