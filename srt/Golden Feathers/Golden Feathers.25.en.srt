1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,000
I was just

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,308
having a
little fun

3
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:04,240
with your
prince.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,880
Yes,

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,760
we were
just playing.

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,920
Put the
gun down.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,160
Leo,

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,320
are you alright?

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,560
Leo,

10
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,040
you weren't
invited.

11
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,520
As the host,

12
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,880
I'm asking
you to leave.

13
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,830
Are you really

14
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,880
Logic's mother?

15
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes.

16
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,768
And my son
will only

17
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,440
choose
someone worthy.

18
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,960
Worthy?

19
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,800
This place is
boring to death.

20
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,280
Leo…

21
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,960
Wait, Leo.

22
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,600
Enough, Logic.

23
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,360
Stop meddling
with that boy.

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,378
You'll never

25
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:41,040
understand
him, Mom.

26
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,640
There's no
need to.

27
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,520
He's
beneath you.

28
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,160
Before your
father arrives,

29
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,080
go apologize to
Prince Philip.

30
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,240
This must
be settled.

31
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,200
I'm not your
puppet, Mom.

32
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,800
I choose
my friends,

33
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,400
I choose
my own life.

34
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,323
So you dare
defy me

35
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,480
because of
that boy?

36
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,946
He's just
a spoiled,

37
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,870
useless brat.

38
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,160
A waste of time.

39
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
He'll ruin
your life.

40
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,480
And you, Mom?

41
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,320
When did you fall
in love with Dad?

42
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,640
You!

43
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,070
Logic!

44
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,880
I'll give
you ten steps.

45
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,920
One.

46
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,880
Two.

47
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,880
Three.

48
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,800
Seven.

49
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,600
Eight.

50
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,560
Nine.

51
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,500
Ten.

52
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,031
I'll even
throw in

53
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:20,720
an extra
one for you.

54
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,200
Eleven.

55
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,600
Gosh, Logic!

56
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,000
Time's up!
