1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,920
Go for it!

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,920
Go for it!

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,920
That's
enough, Leo.

4
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,200
You are not
a match...

5
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,040
for me.

6
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,868
And I don't
want to

7
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:07,600
fight you
either.

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,788
Do you still
remember

9
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:09,600
the promise
between us?

10
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,480
I order you...

11
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,708
to fight me with

12
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:13,280
all your
strength.

13
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,000
It's up to you.

14
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,560
Come.

15
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,480
Begin!

16
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,840
You actually
know

17
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,680
how to play
this sport?

18
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,668
Don't think you

19
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:32,520
know me
that well.

20
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,448
Will your
little brother

21
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:38,400
be aroused today
like usual?

22
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,760
You know...

23
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,116
if I can't
control my

24
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,520
excitement when
I'm near you,

25
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,800
I have
never lost.

26
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,680
Fine.

27
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,920
Then today...

28
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,640
you will lose
miserably.

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,960
Awesome!

30
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,280
Give him a hand,
clap your hands!

31
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,490
Awesome!

32
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,000
You are
really fiery...

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,920
aren't you?

34
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,430
Logic,

35
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,280
tonight...

36
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
you are so cool.

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,800
I think...

38
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,900
we could be more
than friends.

39
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,920
(How dare she?)

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,240
(Why?)

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,720
(What is
this feeling?)

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,520
(Why do I have
to feel upset?)
