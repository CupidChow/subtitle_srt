1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,760
Thanya,

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,005
may I have
the honor

3
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:15,000
of one dance
with you?

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,540
I thought
you'd bring

5
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:19,120
bodyguards to
deal with me.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,920
Today I
didn't allow

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,800
any of them to
enter the school.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,646
I don't
want to use

9
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:25,640
privilege
here anymore.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,060
Let me be an
ordinary person

11
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:29,320
for just one
day, please.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,240
Of course.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,440
What do
you want?

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,080
What do
you mean?

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,440
I'm sorry

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,640
for making the
two of you fight.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
But I'm leaving.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,960
I want you two to
make peace again.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,360
Leo really
cares about you.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,917
Looks like
you love my

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,160
little brother
very much.

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,520
Then just
tell me,

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,360
what do
you want?

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,360
Then...

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,760
crawl around
this auditorium

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,600
like a dog.

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,640
Right now.

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,760
I must admit,

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,680
the rules of the
Howard siblings

30
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,880
are all equally
ruthless.

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Those in debt
must repay.

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,366
This is
the rule of

33
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,080
the Howard
family.

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,000
It is the price
you must pay

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,663
for your

36
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:24,320
disgraceful
behavior

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,311
at the dance
during the

38
00:01:25,324 --> 00:01:26,200
opening of
the term.

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,959
Would you like
to dance with the

40
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:29,685
most beautiful

41
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,680
girl in
the school?

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Sorry, Thanya.

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,240
What else are you
planning to do?

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,027
He has to go
through this,

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
only then
will I give in.

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,683
You must stand
by me if you

47
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:47,160
still want to
be my brother.

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,160
Golden
Feather...

49
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,320
go to hell.
