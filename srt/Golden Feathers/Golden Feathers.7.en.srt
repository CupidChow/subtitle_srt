1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,240
Breaking news.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,080
The number
one son

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,760
transferred
to this school

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,250
to find his
first love.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,800
A mysterious
girl.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,560
Which girl

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,540
could be
better than me?

8
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,040
Screw that
first love.

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,680
He is more
naïve and

10
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,020
boring than
I thought.

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,320
We should just
let him go.

12
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,720
No way.

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,000
But

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,760
don't worry.

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,240
We'll win
anyway.

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,000
Bring him

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,280
to my "Queen
Party."

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,890
(Thanya)

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,120
Hey.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,520
The week is

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,480
almost over,
isn't it?

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,160
What's there
to celebrate?

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,080
Well, our strange

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,240
lover roles
will end

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,080
too, right?

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,320
One week.

27
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,520
Bring him

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
to my "Queen
Party."

29
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,460
(Thanya)

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm not going

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,000
to your
sister's party.

32
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,280
But you have to.

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,170
Why do I
have to go?

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,680
Because you'll

35
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,440
get a clue

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
about that girl.
