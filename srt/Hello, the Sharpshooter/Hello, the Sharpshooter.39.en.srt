(Thank you for your participation
and support!)

52
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,759
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,320
Shen Qingyuan and I
have arrived in Nanjiang.

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,919
Yes.

55
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,000
The competition starts tomorrow.

56
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,320
By the way,

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,000
Steyr customized

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,800
a golden pistol

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,039
for Shen Qingyuan.

60
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,320
There's a huge difference

61
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,720
in the meaning of colors

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,919
between Chinese and western cultures.

63
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,479
Only gold is the exception.

64
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,479
In every country,

65
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,720
it represents light.

66
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,160
I think

67
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,720
for Shen Qingyuan

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,919
and also for us,

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,320
it can be

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,119
a brilliant blessing.

71
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,039
Fine.

72
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm glad to hear that.

73
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:10,839
Okay. See you later.

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,559
Tang Xin called.

75
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,440
Is everything going smoothly
with her and Shen Qingyuan?

76
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:19,479
Yes.

77
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,279
She said the customized pistol
for Shen Qingyuan

78
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,360
turned out to be golden.

79
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,559
Such a color

80
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,839
feels like their future.

81
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,320
What about our future?

82
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,320
I've made up my mind.

83
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,559
At that time,

84
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,720
we indeed experienced

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,679
beautiful days.

86
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
But we grew separately.

87
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,559
Our experiences and moods

88
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,880
no longer remain on the same track.

89
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,720
Can we get back together, then?

90
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,199
After all, our misunderstandings

91
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,000
have been resolved.

92
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,320
Right.

93
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,360
They have been resolved.

94
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,000
But we didn't break up

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,679
only because of such misunderstandings.

96
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,160
Do you get it?

97
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,640
The crack behind the misunderstandings

98
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,320
can't be repaired.

99
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:47,839
Let's give each other

100
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,040
a chance to let it go.

101
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,880
Maybe it's the best choice for us

102
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,239
after we grow mature.

103
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,480
You're right.

104
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,040
(Divorce Settlement)

105
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,640
Thank you.

106
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,480
Thank you, too.

107
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,959
You smile so beautifully.

108
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,640
Ding Fang, um...

109
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,200
Do I look

110
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,160
a little bit old now?

111
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,519
Go work out at the gym

112
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,559
and it'll be good for your health.

113
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,480
Right.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,200
I should work out.

115
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,720
Hope you'll have a better life.

116
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,000
I will.

117
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,239
The same to you.

118
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,320
Du Lingfeng,

119
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,600
it's still so considerate of you.

120
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,760
Thank you for bringing Jujube here.

121
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,480
Sure.

122
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,079
Who am I?

123
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,040
The perfect boyfriend.

124
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:38,720
Shen Qingyuan,

125
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,679
there's a bakery over there.

126
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:40,640
The cakes look delicious.

127
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:41,920
Would you like some?

128
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,239
Look at the wandering singer.

129
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,040
There's a cat on his shoulder.

130
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:47,959
How lovely!

131
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,880
Look. Look at that.

132
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,399
Isn't your neck stiff?

133
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,760
Look. Look.

134
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,399
If I knew it, I wouldn't have offered

135
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,359
to drive you to the hotel.

136
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,279
You're too sweet.

137
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,799
It's not your first visit to this city.

138
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,239
Don't make a fuss.

139
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:12,519
The last time I came here,

140
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,959
I only worked.

141
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,799
I met you.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,200
But you were so rude to me.

143
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,480
I wasn't in the mood
to enjoy the scenery.

144
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,760
I'll show you around this time.

145
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,880
No training?

146
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,239
Yes.

147
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:28,959
Night training.

148
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,239

149

Wait. Wait.

177
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,000
There's a discount on it.

178
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:32,960
It's sold at half price.

179
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,799
So?

180
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,359
So, if you buy me a present

181
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,479
at half price,

182
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,599
your love will be reduced by half, too.

183
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,960
I'll pay full rates, then.

184
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,039
No, no, no.

185
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,239
If you pay full rates

186
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,840
for something at half price,

187
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,400
you'll be ignoring

188
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,840
the meaning of the discount.

189
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,799
What do you want, then?

190
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,119
Let's buy one and get one free.

191
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,760
Here.

192
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,039
How lovely!

193
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,880
I knew that.

194
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,119
Don't take it off.

195
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,359
It's for a couple.

196
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,200
The cat and the rabbit are

197
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,239
even of different races.

198
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,039
How can they be in love?

199
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,840
The Doll and the Little Bear

200
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,039
love each other, too.

201
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,200
You make sense.

202
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,000
Sir,

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,559
we want two.

204
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,119
Thank you.

205
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,000
You must be visitors.

206
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,960
Hope you'll have fun.

207
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,159
Good luck to you.

208
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,679
Thank you.

209
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,239
Go.

210
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,479
What did he say?

211
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:30,919
It's German.

212
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,919
He wished us good luck.

213
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,280
You can understand German?

214
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Awesome.

215
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,200
It's the greeting language

216
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,960
athletes have to speak.

217
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,559
You can take it as

218
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
"Good luck to you."

219
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,039
Nice.

220
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,760
Everybody is wishing us good luck.

221
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,520
Hope such blessings

222
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,400
will come true.

223
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,640
I hear

224
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,799
bad ideas in the mind,

225
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
however impossible they are,

226
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,280
will be likely to happen.

227
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,479
On the contrary,

228
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,599
beautiful ideas in the mind,

229
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,280
however impossible

230
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
they are,

231
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,000
will come true, too.

232
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:02,840
Right?

233
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,479
Ice creams.

234
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,080
(Turkish Ice Creams)

235
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,559
Shen Qingyuan,

236
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,039
it's very delicious,
as I heard from the Internet.

237
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,599
Delicious Turkish ice creams.

238
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,719
Would you like one?

239
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,200
One, please.

240
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,320
Okay.

241
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,840
Thank you.

242
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,280
Shen Qingyuan.

243
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:32,840
Let me help you.

244
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:50,000
It's spinning.

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,520
It's spinning.

246
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,640
It's spinning.

247
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,320
It's spinning.

248
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,640
Thank you, sir.

249
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
You're welcome.

250
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,200
Thank you. Thank you.

251
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,000
Thank you, sir.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,159
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

253
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,799
Would you like a bite?

254
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,479
Athletes can't have ice creams.

255
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,080
Then why did you ask me?

256
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,799
I wanted to check

257
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,919
if you were conscious of it.

258
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:19,239
But you gave way to temptation,

259
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,119
Qingyuan.

260
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,359
Look at that bear.

261
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,599
It looks exactly like you.

262
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,359
Take a photo of me.

263
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,679
May I have a photo with you?

264
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,599
Okay.

265
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:30,200
Thank you.

266
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,479
Make me look taller.

267
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,119
Taller?

268
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:34,440
Squat. Lower.

269
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,559
Lower.

270
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,159
Take a photo vertically.

271
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,280
Fine.

272
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,799
Make me look taller.

273
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,359
Done.

274
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,559
Thank you.

275
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,200
Thank you.

276
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,679
Take more photos of me.

277
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,640
Come on.

278
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:03,400
Still vertically?

279
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,080
Horizontally.

280
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,159
My pinwheel.

281
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,559
Come on.

282
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,559
Watch out!

283
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Kangkang!

284
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,000
Sorry, sorry.

285
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:46,599
Are you all right?

286
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,159
Are you all right?

287
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,400
Are you all right?

288
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:50,960
Kangkang!

289
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,200
Shen Qingyuan.

290
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,520
Are you all right?

291
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,080
Don't worry, Tang Xin.

292
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,280
I will save you.

293
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,280
Wrong.

294
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,479
I shouldn't

295
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:12,440
have left her there.

296
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,679
What if they hurt her?

297
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,919
Tang Xin, wait for me.

298
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,359
I'll be right back.

299
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,599
Tang Xin.

300
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,080
Tang Xin...

301
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,000
Shen Qingyuan.

302
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,239
Shen Qingyuan.

303
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:23,799
Shen Qingyuan.

304
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,359
Shen Qingyuan.

305
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,080
Shen Qingyuan.

306
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,640
I'm all right.

307
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,919
You freaked me out.

308
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,320
Are you all right?

309
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,320
I'm terribly sorry.

310
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:46,400
- Sorry. Sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

311
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,359
Luckily, he isn't hurt.

312
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,119
Are you hurt?

313
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Would you like to go to the hospital?

314
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,080
- No. Don't bother.
- Let me call a taxi.

315
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,960
No, no, no.

316
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,320
Are you all right?

317
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,039
Thank you so much.

318
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,919
Without you,

319
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,039
I don't know what would happen.

320
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:00,159
Babe,

321
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,559
say thank you to them.

322
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,080
Thank you.

323
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,959
- The pinwheel is for you,
- Thank you.

324
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,760
big brother.

325
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,680
Let's go.

326
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Say goodbye to them.

327
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,920
Bye-bye.

328
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,520
Bye-bye.

329
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,319
- Let's go.
- Okay.

330
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,599
You freaked me out.

331
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,239
Shen Qingyuan, what's wrong?

332
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,199
You look very happy.

333
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:49,839
Tang Xin,

334
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,280
I recalled everything.

335
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,280
I didn't leave you there.

336
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:02,920
You recalled it?

337
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,640
Did you really recall it?

338
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,560
When I fell,

339
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
I suddenly recalled it.

340
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,640
That day, I went to withdraw money.

341
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,280
Halfway there, I realized

342
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,079
I shouldn't have left you there.

343
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,959
Then I went back.

344
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,839
But I had an accident on my way back.

345
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,239
I never abandoned you.

346
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:27,719
I know.

347
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,560
I always know that.

348
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,520
Sorry, Tang Xin.

349
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:36,680
Sorry to have you suffer.

350
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,239
It's okay, Shen Qingyuan.

351
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:38,839
I know

352
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,160
you would never leave me alone.

353
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,560
Even if you lost your memories

354
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:42,640
and couldn't remember me,

355
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,959
you had a reason for that.

356
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,479
The blessing of the hairband seller

357
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,280
must have worked

358
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,760
so that you got back your memories.

359
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,439
I think it's because of the treatment,

360
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,400
especially because of you.

361
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,640
Oh,

362
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:55,920
let's tell Dr. Ding

363
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,479
and Coach Zhang

364
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,760
so that they'll be happy for you.

365
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:58,839
Don't tell them

366
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,239
until the competition is over.

367
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,040
Or they'll come.

368
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,400
Fine. I'll listen to you.

369
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,079
I think of something else.

370
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,199
What?

371
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,040
A surprise.

372
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,479
But it's not time yet.

373
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:17,479
Let's go.

374
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,839
Hello, Mr. Shen Qingyuan.

375
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,599
This is Mr. Bachchan.

376
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,680
You're training

377
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,680
when others are still

378
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,520
having dinner.

379
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,920
You're impressing him.

380
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,119
So, he wants

381
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,359
to have a private solo

382
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,319
with you

383
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,199
before the competition starts.

384
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,640
Sorry.

385
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,599
I just want to practice

386
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,719
before the competition.

387
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,479
Why?

388
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,400
Isn't it more interesting

389
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,439
to compete with others?

390
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,640
A shooter

391
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,079
only challenges himself.

392
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Mr. Bachchan asked

393
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,800
if you were using a new pistol.

394
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,040
Mr. Shen Qingyuan,

395
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,400
Mr. Bachchan thinks

396
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,040
it takes a shooter a long time

397
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,719
to get familiar with his pistol

398
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:15,920
before the perfect cooperation.

399
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,359
When you use a new pistol

400
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,000
in the competition,

401
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,760
you don't respect him.

402
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,079
Trying my best is

403
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,160
the best respect.

404
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:31,599
Mr. Bachchan

405
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,680
wants me to tell you

406
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,880
what you're trying

407
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,160
can be useless.

408
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,920
I'm not interested in nonsense.

409
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:51,760
At least,

410
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,239
he's a world champion.

411
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,719
How could he say that?

412
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,119
In a shooting competition,

413
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,800
psychological quality is competed, too.

414
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,280
To disturb their rivals,

415
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,280
many athletes

416
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,119
will use

417
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,400
every possible trick.

418
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,199
Talking nonsense

419
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,319
can be a mild way.

420
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,439
Why do you suddenly eat so fast?

421
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,920
I'll talk less

422
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,160
in case I disturb you.

423
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,199
Do you still think

424
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,119
no one can disturb me but you?

425
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,239
Tang Xin,

426
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,880
now you are

427
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,800
my Luck Fairy.

428
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,520
Look.

429
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,599
On your fingers,

430
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:45,640
there are ten loops.

431
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:46,920
It means

432
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,920
every time I shoot,

433
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,040
I'll get 10 points.

434
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,319
- Hi, friends.
- Hi.

435
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,400
Here we are.

436
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:00,680
How's it?

437
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,160
What do you think of this restaurant?

438
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,680
Not bad.

439
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,640
That's all?

440
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:06,680
Come on.

441
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,920
You're so demanding.

442
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,719
Athletes like us

443
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:19,400
have simple demands.

444
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,719
We need nutritious food
without additives.

445
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,160
I see. I see.

446
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,719
The best ingredients,

447
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,119
the simplest cooking.

448
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:26,880
Why do you sound like

449
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,079
you're having a cross talk?

450
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,640
Why do you still talk when you eat?

451
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,640
Focus on the food.

452
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,119
It's about time.

453
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,719
I'll have some training after dinner.

454
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,400
I'll go with you.

455
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,560
Let's have dinner.

456
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,719
Miss Livestreamer,

457
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,239
do we look like

458
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,560
parents of examinees?

459
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,040
How's your wound?

460
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,760
Does it still hurt?

461
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,439
Come on.

462
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:09,000
When you went out, you got hurt.

463
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,760
This time,

464
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,439
we kind of got good out of misfortune.

465
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,119
What does that mean?

466
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,680
When you were nearly hit,

467
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
you had good luck?

468
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,479
Yeah.

469
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,439
But I don't know

470
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,079
whether the good luck

471
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,400
would last long enough.

472
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,119
We'll know tomorrow.

473
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,040
Fine. You keep it a mystery, right?

474
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,760
I'll wait and see.

475
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,439
By the way,

476
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,880
I hear the rules for mixed team shooting
have changed again.

477
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:32,719
Yeah.

478
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,079
It gives me a headache.

479
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:35,880
But it doesn't matter.

480
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,119
Xiaoci is also good

481
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,040
at single shooting.

482
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,439
So is Shen Qingyuan.

483
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,680
Xiaoci is better.

484
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,959
Shen Qingyuan is far better.

485
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:54,839
Come with me.

486
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,079
What are you doing?

487
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,000
Wait for me here.

488
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,920
Go back to the hotel with me
after I finish shooting.

489
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,599
I was standing out there

490
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,000
just in case of disturbing you.

491
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:08,920
Do you know

492
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,839
all I want now is

493
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,839
to be disturbed by you?

494
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,680
So, start.

495
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,400
Say "Come on, Shen Qingyuan"
a hundred times.

496
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,599
By the way,

497
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,359
have some water after every ten times

498
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,439
to moisten your throat.

499
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,880
Seriously? Water for cheering?

500
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,839
Come on, Shen Qingyuan!

501
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,359
Come on, Xiaoci!

502
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:38,839
Come on!

503
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,479
Come on! Come on!

504
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:45,239
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, Xiaoci!

505
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,199
- Come on, Shen Qingyuan!
- Come on, Xiaoci!

506
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:49,359
- Come on, Shen Qingyuan!
- Xiaoci. Xiaoci.

507
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,160
Come on.

508
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,599
- Come on, Shen Qingyuan!
- Come on, Xiaoci!

509
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,079
Why?

510
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,359
- Come on, Shen Qingyuan!
- She's still there.

511
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,760
Come on, Shen Qingyuan.

512
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
Come on. Come on.

513
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,079
Get out.

514
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,160
Come on, Shen Qingyuan!

515
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,760
Xiaoci.

516
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,000
- Come on, Shen Qingyuan.
- I can cheer for you, too.

517
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,040
Xiaoci, open the door.

518
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,359
- Come on, Shen Qingyuan.
- Pound at the door, instead.

519
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,079
It's good.

520
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,280
Come on, Shen Qingyuan!

521
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Come on, Shen Qingyuan!

522
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,599
Come on, Xiaoci!

523
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,000
Come on, Xiaoci!

524
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,959
Points will be accumulated

525
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,400
in the way they are

526
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
in qualifications of the Olympic Games.

527
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,000
Top six players of each event

528
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,880
whose scores of the qualification

529
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,959
are no less than the selection standard

530
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,800
of the Olympic Games

531
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,680
will have 15, 13,

532
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,880
11, 10, 9, 8,

533
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:33,599
and 9 points

534
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,239
for finals

535
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:38,160
according to the ranking.

536
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,040
Players

537
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,280
who break the world record

538
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,599
will get five bonus points.

539
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,199
What a complicated algorithm!

540
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
It's not complicated at all.

541
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,000
Getting the first place

542
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
and breaking the world record

543
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,199
will be okay.

544
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,280
Besides,

545
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,400
it's just a commercial competition.

546
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,680
Why are you reading

547
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,560
the rules of the Olympic Games?

548
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,359
How long have you been eavesdropping?

549
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:03,239
You're just too absorbed
in the gold medal

550
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,040
to notice me.

551
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,680
Sure.

552
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,640
You and the gold medal are both mine.

553
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:13,560
Watch TV

554
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,760
and take your mind off.

555
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,079
Don't be more nervous than me.

556
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:22,079
Is he also nervous?

557
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:26,520
You don't want to watch it?

558
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,640
I'll turn it off, then.

559
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,839
Shen Qingyuan,

560
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,319
let's watch it for a while.

561
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,560
(Want to be with you.)

562
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:48,520
Wait a minute for me.

563
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,119
He must be exhausted.

564
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:23,800
You're back?

565
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,040
Dad,

566
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:27,959
do your best

567
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:28,839
for tomorrow's competition.

568
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,719
Will I

569
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,599
make you more nervous?

570
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,760
If it can make me nervous,

571
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,319
how can I take part in the competition?

572
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,520
Besides,
it's just a friendly competition.

573
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,479
That's great, then.

574
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,880
Jujube likes it

575
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,199
when you shoot.

576
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,319
Jujube's mother,

577
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,239
do you remember

578
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,040
our agreement?

579
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:55,079
Unless you're admitted

580
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,199
to the Olympic Games,

581
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,599
we can't further

582
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,520
our relationship.

583
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:00,119
Only after I make it

584
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,800
can we go further.

585
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,439
So, I will treat this competition

586
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,599
as the most important one

587
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,199
in my professional career.

588
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,959
The competition is taken step by step.

589
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:11,719
So is our relationship.

590
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,520
I'm going to sleep.

591
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:23,920
You go to bed early, too.

592
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,800
Don't imagine things.

593
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,920
Come on.

594
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,319
Why did Shen Qingyuan

595
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,400
have to comfort me

596
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,560
in the end?

597
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:35,000
What?

598
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,239
The seats for the 10m air pistol

599
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:38,280
will probably be distributed

600
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,800
in the next two section competitions?

601
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,359
Is that true?

602
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,439
But why can the seats

603
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,800
be distributed so early?

604
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,239
Then,

605
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,319
I'll have

606
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,119
only one month, right?

607
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,599
That's not a fixed seat,

608
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,160
but a quota for Chinese teams.

609
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,119
It doesn't mean

610
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,800
someone will have it.

611
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,640
The player can't be decided

612
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,400
before going through the qualifications.

613
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,119
Oh, that's fine, then.

614
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,040
What makes you so relieved?

615
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,199
Here we are.

616
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
Who told you I was relieved?

617
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,560
I wasn't.

618
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,560
Not at all.

619
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,599
Shen Qingyuan,

620
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,680
do you know people get nervous
when approaching their hometowns?

621
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,680
When the good news approaches,

622
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,719
I'll feel nervous, too.

623
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,959
So,

624
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,239
you're scared?

625
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,680
Not really.

626
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:55,079
More specifically,

627
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,920
I'm expecting.

628
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:01,959
Glad to hear that.

629
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
After this competition,

630
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:08,959
I'll start

631
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,160
the new training period.

632
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:11,800
So quickly?

633
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,160
I want to get the admission soon

634
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,599
so that you'll have no more excuses.

635
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:16,959
I'll be waiting.

636
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,040
(Audience Entrance)

637
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,359
I'm back to this gym.

638
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:27,760
However,

639
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:30,239
I'm not alone anymore.

640
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,160
Shen Qingyuan,

641
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
this is our destiny, I guess.

642
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,839
After all the trouble,

643
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,479
we've got back in the relationship.

644
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:41,880
Tang Xin.

645
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,719
I will get in trim

646
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:45,560
for this competition

647
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,079
and I won't keep you worried.

648
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:49,719
I'm glad to hear that.

649
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:53,280
I'll go take some outdoor photos.

650
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,359
You get in first.

651
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,079
Touch the pistol

652
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,119
and get back the feelings.

653
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,439
Go. Go.

654
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:16,920
Shen Qingyuan,

655
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:18,560
I trust you.

656
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,880
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

657
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:27,959
We've arrived at the gym.

658
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:29,959
Don't be nervous.

659
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,839
This is the exclusive livestream

660
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,119
of Lingda and Rui Live.

661
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:33,319
Only Rui Live is qualified

662
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:35,439
for the online livestream.

663
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,560
Not many people are watching.

664
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,000
But later, there will be...

665
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:43,680
Here we are.

666
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,239
How is it? Isn't it a surprise?

667
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,199
Tang Xin.

668
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:56,239
Miss Tang.

669
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,199
We prepared

670
00:33:58,199 --> 00:33:59,439
the surprise together.

671
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,760
Hope Shen Qingyuan won't be scared

672
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,160
when he sees them.

673
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,119
Tang Xin.

674
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:05,959
Miss Tang.

675
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:07,439
Tang Xin.

676
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,239
This is the new camera
rewarded by the company.

677
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:09,760
Look.

678
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,399
Miss Tang,

679
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:12,679
we've brought the whole team

680
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,719
to cheer for Captain Shen.

681
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,639
I came to cheer for him

682
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,520
on behalf of Rui Live.

683
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,320
You...

684
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,399
Coach.

685
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,879
Later,

686
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,199
don't disturb Shen Qingyuan.

687
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:21,959
He hasn't

688
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,919
totally recovered yet.

689
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:23,719
Don't worry, Tang Xin.

690
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:24,439
We know

691
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,600
how important this competition is.

692
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,959
We won't treat it carelessly.

693
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,639
Let's get in.

694
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:29,439
- Okay.
- Okay.

695
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,639
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

696
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,239
Did Shen Qingyuan

697
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:37,959
not know

698
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:38,879
you would come?

699
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:40,959
If he did, what surprise could it be?

700
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,239
What if he'll only be shocked?

701
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,360
He won't.

702
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,439
I have a lot of confidence

703
00:34:46,439 --> 00:34:47,560
in Captain Shen.

704
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:48,639
We once

705
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,800
visited this gym

706
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:50,879
and walked around it several times.

707
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:51,560
We're familiar with it.

708
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,120
I was a replacement
during that competition.

709
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,600
This is always the case.

710
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,280
Is the preparation area

711
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,439
near here?

712
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:02,959
Right.

713
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
It's ahead of us.

714
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,959
And that is the gymnasium.

715
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:06,399
Tang Xin,

716
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,679
I'll go get prepared there.

717
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,120
Okay.

718
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:08,879
Let me hold it for you.

719
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:09,919
Bye-bye, Yitian.

720
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:10,439
Bye-bye.

721
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:13,000
Jiang Yitian,

722
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,280
will your coming

723
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,439
delay your training?

724
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,959
Coach Zhang allowed us to come.

725
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:18,919
We don't worry.

726
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,280
When we can witness

727
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,600
the shooting competition
at the world's highest level,

728
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,399
we'll all be happy.

729
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:24,199
Unfortunately,

730
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,879
I can only watch in the auditorium.

731
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:27,560
I wonder

732
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,280
when I can shoot, too.

733
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,919
Sorry.

734
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,199
I don't mean that.

735
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,199
Miss Tang,

736
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,239
such words

737
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,239
don't matter.

738
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,399
Shooters like us

739
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,360
can be very positive.

740
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,120
Besides,

741
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,120
I'm still young.

742
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,360
You know what?

743
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,959
In recent years,

744
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,360
many old players have retired.

745
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,280
There'll be qualified successors.

746
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,760
I'm one of the successors.

747
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:45,879
So, I'm not worried.

748
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:48,879
I usually look slack

749
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,320
without much team spirit.

750
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,520
However,

751
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,320
I'll play the relay race

752
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,280
with Captain Shen.

753
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,600
- Captain Shen.
- Captain Shen.

754
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,080
Captain Shen.

755
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,159
- Captain Shen.
- Captain Shen.

756
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:15,959
Why are you here?

757
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:17,959
- We came to cheer for you.
- We came to cheer for you.

758
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:19,439
Qingyuan,

759
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,840
when they watch
a high-level competition,

760
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,360
they'll learn things.

761
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,439
Captain Shen, be seated.

762
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,199
Let me relax you before the competition.

763
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,080
After all, you'll...

764
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,760
Relax me, too.

765
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:30,959
Don't bother to relax me now.

766
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,360
I can do it for you, Yang Zhou.

767
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,040
All right.

768
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,439
We'll say no more.

769
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,760
Get well prepared.

770
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:43,520
- Mr. Du?
- Mr. Du.

771
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,600
Here comes our sponsor.

772
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,439
This is the proudest thing

773
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:47,800
I've done this year.

774
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:50,879
Shen Qingyuan,

775
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,639
do your best and shoot carefully.

776
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,080
Don't fight for the first...

777
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:56,959
Stop, stop.

778
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:00,080
Xiaoci.

779
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,439
Xiaoci.

780
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,199
Qingyuan,

781
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:07,320
ignore them.

782
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,439
No matter what you say
before the competition,

783
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,439
during it,

784
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,439
you must relax

785
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:12,800
and shoot as you usually do.

786
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,560
I'll keep it in mind.

787
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,120
Take a good rest, then.

788
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,159
Let's leave him alone.

789
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:22,199
Okay.

790
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,399
- Come on, Captain Shen.
- Come on, Captain.

791
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,840
- Come on, Captain Shen.
- Come on, Captain.

792
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,360
There you are.

793
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,360
There's little time left.

794
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,639
Don't you go get prepared?

795
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,760
There's little time left.

796
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,959
So, I came to see you first.

797
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,360
I've seen enough.

798
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,679
I've got the strength to work.

799
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:20,959
Come on.

800
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:29,879
When you got off,

801
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:30,719
you didn't follow us.

802
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,439
Now we have to go with you...

803
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:32,399
Why didn't you wait for me?

804
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,239
It's such an important occasion.

805
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,159
I must encourage Captain

806
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:34,879
by myself.

807
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,000
Go.

808
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:41,639
(World Gun King Tournament)
It's a friendly competition.

809
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,520
But we'll do it

810
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,679
according to national standards,

811
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,800
(World Gun King Tournament)
because the competition

812
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,320
will be the same

813
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,439
as an international competition.

814
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,080
Players

815
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,800
invited to this competition

816
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,639
rank very high

817
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,919
in world rankings.

818
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,639
This competition has a high value.

819
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,399
I believe players who win gold medals

820
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:58,399
in this competition

821
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,560
will also do a good job

822
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,159
in the Olympic Games.

823
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Okay. Thank you.

824
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:05,560
Just now, Coach Zhang Guozhong

825
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,199
of Haiya Shooting Team

826
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,479
introduced to us
the World Gun King Tournament.

827
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,239
Additionally,

828
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,800
the auditorium for today
is unusual, too.

829
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:13,560
It's nearly

830
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,120
packed with audiences.

831
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,280
Among them,

832
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,800
there's a special person.

833
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:19,120
You may be familiar with his name,

834
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,879
but not with his new identity.

835
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,439
He's Du Lingfeng,

836
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:24,719
the new general manager of Lingda Group.

837
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,399
Du Lingfeng,

838
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:25,719
tell us

839
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:26,879
why you came here today.

840
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
Do I need to explain?

841
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,959
Explain it clearly.

842
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,040
I came with my girlfriend Shi Xiaoci

843
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,000
for her warm-up

844
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,159
and I came to cheer

845
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:38,919
for her!

846
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,159
I'm sorry.

847
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,360
He's been too excited lately.

848
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,639
Shi Xiaoci,

849
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,560
you're going to shoot soon.

850
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,840
How do you feel now?

851
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,560
Watching Shen Qingyuan's competition

852
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,919
will help me

853
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:52,120
be on song in a better way.

854
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,520
I can learn from him, too.

855
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,159
Come on, Shen Qingyuan.

856
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:56,520
And don't forget

857
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,120
to cheer

858
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,040
for Shi Xiaoci.

859
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,120
Make more bullet comments

860
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,159
and give us more presents, friends.

861
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,199
Du Lingfeng is

862
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,399
quite a soulful boyfriend.

863
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,199
Next,

864
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,000
let me introduce to you

865
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,760
the competition rules for today.

866
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:07,040
There are ten small events.

867
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,399
Men's air pistol

868
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:09,320
and women's air pistol

869
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,439
we pay most attention to

870
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,800
will be held in the morning
and afternoon.

871
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:14,280
