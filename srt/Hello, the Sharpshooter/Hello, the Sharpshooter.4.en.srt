=Episode 4=

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,080
Xiaoci.

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,399
Did Coach Zhang talk with you?

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,639
He talked with me, too.

38
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,119
What did he say?

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,919
It's quite simple, actually.

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,479
He said, if you want to date,

41
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,199
you should date me.

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,960
It's impossible, right?

43
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,160
I think it's impossible, too.

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,399
In my eyes,

45
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,080
you always put shooting

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,240
in the first place.

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,119
It's interesting, Captain Shen.

48
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,919
What do you mean?

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,919
You have catnip in your left hand,

50
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,559
and a pocket watch in your right hand.

51
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,919
Does it mean

52
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,279
you are both moved

53
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,520
and also trying to keep calm?

54
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,080
Have you ever encountered

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,440
something like catnip

56
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,839
that you can't resist?

57
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,839
Only shooting.

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,919
What else?

59
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,000
Nothing, I think.

60
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,800
If you encounter something

61
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,160
that affects your shooting,

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,880
how will you make choices?

63
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,679
I have no idea.

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,279
Livestreamer.

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,320
Why are you here?

66
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,200
It's you.

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,559
Get in the car. Hurry.

68
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,359
Come on.

69
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm blocking the way. Hurry up.

70
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,359
Get in.

71
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,880
Hurry.

72
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,760
Where are you going?
Let me give you a ride.

73
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,959
Whatever.

74
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,920
Are you suffering a blow
from the public opinion?

75
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,839
Hey, don't cry.

76
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,359
You're crying in Du Lingfeng's car.

77
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,119
If it is shot by people,

78
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,320
you can never explain it.

79
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,559
Thanks for telling me

80
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,040
you are a celebrity.

81
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,679
At least,

82
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,160
a celebrity doesn't do dirty things

83
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,000
in broad daylight.

84
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,559
How do you explain your lie?

85
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,040
I said I was an ordinary person

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,839
and you believed it.

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,640
That means you are gullible.

88
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,480
I wasn't lying.

89
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,920
I admit it.

90
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,320
I'm stupid.

91
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,279
Where are we going?

92
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,559
Somewhere

93
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,320
that suits the time now.

94
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,679
Take it easy, Miss.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,399
Don't drink this wine like that.

96
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,600
It's strong.

97
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,200
No.

98
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,559
It is sweet.

99
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,880
At the worst, I won't get up tomorrow.

100
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,200
Can't you put up with

101
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,320
such little public opinion?

102
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,200
Moreover,

103
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,200
it will pass very soon.

104
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,839
Saying is easier than doing.

105
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,440
Then what?

106
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,600
Why were you

107
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
walking on the street then?

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,640
Figure a way out.

109
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,600
Captain.

110
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,839
Where did you go?

111
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,480
You are drenched.

112
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
What happened to you?

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
Are you sick?

114
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,559
Do you have a fever?

115
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,440
Let me ask you.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,559
Do you know what an excuse is?

117
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,320
Excuse?

118
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,040
You cheated teachers

119
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,399
to skip classes?

120
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,119
I didn't cheat teachers or skip classes.

121
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,040
No. No.

122
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,200
That's not the point.

123
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,440
I was emphasizing

124
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,600
"cheat".

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,880
Like, you lied

126
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,119
for your doing

127
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,160
to excuse yourself.

128
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,239
Like, you sleep late
and don't go to classes.

129
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,839
Out of conscience,

130
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,040
you feel guilty for it.

131
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,200
But if you are

132
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,079
really sick,

133
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,440
it won't be a problem.

134
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,079
Captain.

135
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,320
Did I make it clear?

136
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,279
Why are you leaving?

137
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,279
I even went to the shooting venue
for him.

138
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,279
I wanted to tell him

139
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,920
that statement wasn't my intent.

140
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,399
But I forgot to ask him

141
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,640
if it was his intent.

142
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,959
You said I influenced your shooting?

143
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,200
It's an excuse!

144
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,839
Why didn't it happen before?

145
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,480
When I wasn't by your side,

146
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,839
you would say...

147
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,040
Never mind.

148
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,600
You are no longer

149
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,040
that Shen Qingyuan I knew before.

150
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,519
It's good that

151
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,519
nothing has begun yet.

152
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,200
That bit of my feelings to you

153
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,160
will soon come to an end.

154
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,720
Shen Qingyuan.

155
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,559
Do you believe it?

156
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,799
What the heck should I believe?

157
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,000
We're inseparable?

158
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,880
(Go down into the whirlpool together.)
Our fate is intertwined?

159
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,239
All are lies.

160
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,799
Don't! Don't!

161
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,320
Don't hold me.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,679
"Go down into the whirlpool

163
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,320
together".

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,680
(Go down into the whirlpool together.)

165
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,400
No superstition.

166
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,320
(Weibo. No superstition.)

167
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:04,880
Captain.

168
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:06,840
Come in.

169
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,960
Captain.

170
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,799
Look at this! Look!

171
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,559
Is this Miss Tang's bag?

172
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,679
You've got it, right?

173
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,440
What's wrong with her?

174
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,919
Why does she go to a bar

175
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,559
with that playboy Du Lingfeng?

176
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,479

crosses the line

179
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,679
and harasses her?

180
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,880
Captain. Where are you going?

181
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,200
OK. OK. OK.

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,760

193

206
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,679
Don't come any closer, Shen Qingyuan.

207
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,840
Aren't you drawing a line between us?

208
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,359
Come closer

209
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:13,000

210

211
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,119
I just wanna send you home.

212
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,239
Since you've made up your mind,

213
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,159
stop being nice

214
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,359
to me.

215
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,599
That's the best for me.

216
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,119
Got it?

217
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,599
Don't make me

218
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,840
be impulsive for you

219
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,239
or think of you

220
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,320
like a fool!

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,840
I know.

222
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,840
I shouldn't have gone

223
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,359
closer to you since the very beginning.

224
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,479
But whenever I wanted to stop,

225
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:37,159
it's you who went close to me

226
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,320
and let me waver!

227
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,119
You think

228
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,599
I've influenced your shooting?

229
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,719
Haven't you influenced me?

230
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,919
You just said,

231
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,080
"Tang Xin, stop."

232
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,479
I could've kept going

233
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,919
and never looked back.

234
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,559
But I still stopped.

235
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,960
I was expecting

236
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,799
you'd say something to me.

237
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,159
I thought you'd say,

238
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,479
"Tang Xin,

239
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,359
sorry.

240
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:02,280
I didn't mean

241
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,840
what I said."

242
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,679
Even now,

243
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,440
I still have these ridiculous thoughts.

244
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:12,679
Stop going any closer, OK?

245
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,440
That's the best for me!

246
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,919
I don't wanna be

247
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,400

248
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,080

249
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,640
That's not true.

250
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,119
If something

251
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,159
affects my shooting,

252
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,280
I will

253
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,640
get it out of my life.

254
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,520

256
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,039
But I can't do that for you.

257
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,320

to distract me from shooting.

350
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,079
It's time to draw a line between us.

351
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,280
What happened before is a mistake.

352
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,959
Nothing will happen

353
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,880

Hey, Zhou.

362
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,520
It's really a brilliant idea

363
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,560
that you gave me.

364
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,239
Sounds like it's good news, isn't?

365
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,199
Tell me.

366
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,439
It's a secret for now.

367
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,719
It's on the schedule.

368
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,640
No hurry.

369
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,239
I'll show you some big news

370
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,479
tomorrow.

371
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,719
That shooting team

372
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,199
is really a good place,

373
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:49,199
teeming with talents.

374
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,280
Not only the men's team is fun...

375
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,040
Wait.

376
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,599
Are you up to something

377
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,040
on the women's team?

378
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,199
Listen to me.

379
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,239
Don't do anything stupid.

380
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,920
What are you talking about?

381
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,839
I can win the Arena of Valor

382
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,119
without feeding.

383
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,359
That means I'm innocent

384
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,520
and never do stupid things.

385
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,160
Alright?

386
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,719
Not like some guy

387
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,040
who pretends to be decent

388
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,760
and hard to deal with.

389
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,520
Why are you so drunk?

390
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Stay away from her.

391
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,359
I wonder how many girls

392
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,520
have been heartbroken for him.

393
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,600
(Failed)

394
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,479
How fun it is!

395
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,520
You just lost.

396
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,719
Are you crazy?

397
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:36,760
Nothing.

398
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,959
I'm just happy.

399
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,239
I'm a simple person.

400
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,760
If I can't be happy with someone,

401
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
I'll change to another person.

402
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,239
Anyway,

403
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:46,000
I won't be fixated

404
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:48,040
on one person

405
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,040
and ask for a snub.

406
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,280
Dr. Ding.

407
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,520
Have you checked Shen's EMG?

408
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
How is it?

409
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,760
I'll be frank.

410
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,920
It's not good.

411
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
His muscles

412
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,880
haven't been in a relaxing state.

413
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,400
I think

414
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,359
it has something to do

415
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,239
with his mental state.

416
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
I talked with him

417
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,920
when he just joined the team.

418
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,439
I found that

419
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,319
he had been in a state of tension.

420
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,400
Shen.

421
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,040
You love shooting, right?

422
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:29,760
Of course I do.

423
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,160
Perhaps,

424
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,280
it's the only thing I love.

425
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,400
In my opinion,

426
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,199
when you love something,

427
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,760
you will enjoy it,

428
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,199
and you will be immersed

429
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,160
and it makes you

430
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,040
feel relaxed.

431
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:43,880
Wrong.

432
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,599
You love it,

433
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,680
so you care about gains and losses.

434
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,479
That's why

435
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,640
I have to keep tense

436
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,959
to hold tightly

437
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,920
what I love.

438
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,400
The tension

439
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
suppresses his emotions

440
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,959
deep down.

441
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,520
Dr. Ding. That's to say,

442
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,160
we should solve the problem

443
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
in his heart first.

444
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,520
Perhaps we will find that

445
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Shen Qingyuan

446
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,359
wasn't born

447
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,520
with this personality.

448
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,839
Let's go talk with him.

449
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:13,959
OK. This way.

450
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,199
Shen.

451
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,040
We shouldn't have come in.

452
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,000
Given the special situation, do it.

453
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,400
Does he sleep under the bed?

454
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,599
He mentioned it before.

455
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,040
When the mental pressure

456
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
is beyond what he can withstand,

457
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,239
he will have this symptom.

458
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,959
This is supposed to be

459
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,280
Shen's shooting notebook

460
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,479
which details

461
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,599
his training.

462
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,359
Look.

463
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,120
(Tang)

464
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,040
Du Lingfeng.

465
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,359
So fast?

466
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,079
OK. OK.

467
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,640
Come here quickly.

468
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,479
Coach Zhang.

469
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,479
Mr. Zhou.

470
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,439
Are you busy?

471
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,920
Could we talk about

472
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,400
the livestreaming?

473
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,959
I know

474
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,280
why you come.

475
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,880
I'm just a shooting coach.

476
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,520
The school considers that

477
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,280
the young man from Lingda Group

478
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,400
is sincere.

479
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,640
And he is capable.

480
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,400
On the other hand,

481
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,239
what happened between Shen

482
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,719
and the female anchor in your department

483
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,040
had a bad influence.

484
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,439
The school has some concerns.

485
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,640
Well.

486
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,880
As for their affair,

487
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,640
we

488
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,560
have agreed that

489
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,280
we'd make a statement separately, right?

490
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,319
The statement was made...

491
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,119
Excuse me.

492
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,719
Hello.

493
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,560
Have you arrived at the venue?

494
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,319
OK. I'm coming.

495
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,199
Wait for me.

496
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,800
See... See you around.

Their photo

We meet again.

I'll join the shooting team.

521
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,839

- Ms. Xiaoci.

524
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,520
Coach Zhang was delayed
by some business.

525
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,040
I'll introduce our new member

526
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,359
to you.

527
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,319
Du Lingfeng,

528
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,880
the honorary General Manager
of Lingda Group,

529
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,560
also the project manager

530
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,760
who sponsors

531
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
our shooting team.

532
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,959
Go to greet him.

533
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:49,959
Is he Mr. Du?

534
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:50,640
Yes, it's him.

535
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,520
Xiaoci.

536
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,160
Don't say that. It's not good.

537
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,199
Sounds like I'm privileged.

538
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,319
Du Lingfeng,

539
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,959
are you approved
to join the shooting team?

540
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,119
Are you qualified

541
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,560
to be a shooting athlete?

542
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,359
If I'm right,

543
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:13,599
you must be Chen Hai

544
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,839
who scored four.

545
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,920
Don't be angry.

546
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:30,079
I know

547
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,959
you didn't perform well.

548
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,520
(Marathon article)
Before running a marathon,

549
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,160
lots of gear and equipment

550
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,119
should be prepared.

551
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,479
But we tend to

552
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,920
neglect some small items,

553
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,280
like

554
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,359
nipple covers?

555
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,920
(Marathon article)
In a marathon,

556
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,959
whether men or women,

557
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,199
if you don't wanna look bad,

558
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,479
you'd better put on this small item.

559
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,839
Do men also need nipple covers?

560
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,680
(Zhou Zuguang)

561
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:19,920
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

562
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,079
I begged Lizi

563
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,199
to exchange tasks with me.

564
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,520
I don't know marathon well,

565
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,640
but I will study hard.

566
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,400
I don't think I can

567
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,359
go back to the shooting team.

568
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:29,880
I'm not calling you

569
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,000
for that matter.

570
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,319
Come back to the company.

571
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,040
Something is wrong
with the shooting team.

572
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,959
Lizi.

573
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,599
What's going on in the shooting team?

574
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,319
I have no idea.

575
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,439
Let's go to Mr. Zhou.

576
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,599
OK. OK. OK.

577
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,280
Yes. Yes.

578
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,640
It's absolutely our oversight.

579
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,239
Yes.

580
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:53,319
OK.

581
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,719
I promise I'll figure a way out.

582
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,439
OK.

583
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,319
OK.

584
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,319
Mr. Zhou.

585
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,439
What happened?

586
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,520
It's no longer your personal problem.

587
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,479
Now the whole team

588
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,640
is likely to be dismissed.

589
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,760
Come. Say it.

590
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,359
Do you have any solution?

591
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,319
Mr. Zhou.

592
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,439
What happened?

593
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,239
Don't you know

594
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,319
such big news?

595
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:18,839
Come. Take a look.

596
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,560
Lingda Group sponsors

597
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,239
Haiya Shooting Team

598
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,920
to open up a new path
of sports livestream.

599
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,640
Next.

600
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,000
Du Lingfeng is interviewed.

601
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,680
He thinks highly of new sports stars

602
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
and reveals that the next step

603
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,160
is to change the livestream platform.

604
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,920
What did the shooting team say?

605
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,079
It certainly made an agreement

606
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,239
with Du Lingfeng.

607
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,719
Or why bother issuing the report?

608
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,599
Mr. Zhou.

609
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,280
What should we do

610
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,199
next?

611
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:48,239
I need a way out.

612
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,000
Both the shooting team

613
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,880
and Du Lingfeng

614
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,199
have rejected me.

615
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,599
How about

616
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,959
I go to talk with Du Lingfeng?

617
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:57,800
Who?

618
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,680
Du Lingfeng.

619
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,239
Do you know him well?

620
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:01,920
Yeah.

621
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,719
What are you waiting for?

622
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,760
Go right now!

623
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,000
Du Lingfeng is in the shooting team!

624
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:07,400
Go. Hurry.

625
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,119
(Haiya Shooting Team confirmed)

626
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,400
(their cooperation with Lingda Group)

627
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,839
(and the change of livestream platform.)

628
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,239
Mr. Du, can I friend you on WeChat?

629
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,199
- Sure.
- Me, too.

630
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,280
And me.

631
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,079
Wait a second.

632
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,119
Is it this? Let me scan your code.

633
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,359
And me. And me.

634
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:29,800
Me, too.

635
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,319
Sure.

636
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:40,719
Mr. Du.

637
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,760
Can I have dinner

638
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,479
with you?

639
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,719
Yes, no problem.

640
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,119
Who will pay?

641
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,239
I will.

642
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,400
Thank you, Mr. Du.

643
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,160
Thank you, Mr. Du.

644
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:54,959
(Du Lingfeng)
Come out.

645
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,000
(Du Lingfeng)
At the door of the venue.

646
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm going out.

647
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,439
OK.

648
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,800
Why didn't you answer my call?

649
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,400
I was doing business.

650
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,119
Why do you sponsor
shooting team suddenly?

651
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,560
For the business.

652
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,520
Alright.

653
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,119
What do you wanna ask?

654
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,319
What are you doing?

655
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,160
Why do you sponsor
shooting team suddenly

656
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,560
and pressure Rui Live?

657
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,280
First, not suddenly.

658
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,839
I've long prepared

659
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:47,800
for the sponsorship.

660
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,760
But last night...

661
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,040
I didn't tell you last night.

662
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,560
You were healing

663
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,959
your broken heart.

664
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,560
I didn't have a chance.

665
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,800
It's fine to sponsor.

666
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,359
Why do you get Rui Live changed?

667
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,319
It's an eyesore.

668
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,880
What's your leader's name?

669
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,760
Zhou Zuguang.

670
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,359
He is unscrupulous for his purpose.

671
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,599
I don't like him.

672
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,959
No, Mr. Du!

673
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,599
Please, Mr. Du.

674
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,920
Don't get Rui Live changed. OK?

675
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,319
We will do our best to cooperate.

676
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,400
Do you have the final say on Rui Live?

677
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,280
Du Lingfeng.

678
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,160
Didn't you two make it up yesterday?

679
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,040
I'm avoiding suspicion.

680
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,680
His fans are still cursing me.

681
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,359
What?

682
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,479
Coach Zhang is looking for you.

683
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
I just had a call.

684
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,800
(Zhou Zuguang)

685
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,120
(Zhou Zuguang)

686
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:34,599
Hello.

687
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,680
Here you are.

688
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,920
I've been looking for you.

689
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:56,800
Coach.

690
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,040
I went to the washroom.

691
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,719
Assemble.

692
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,800
Xiaoci has introduced him.

693
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,319
I won't waste your time.

694
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,400
Du Lingfeng.

695
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:15,680
From today on,

696
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,119
he'll be in our shooting team

697
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,040
as a substitute.

698
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,479
Welcome.

699
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:21,199
Coach.

700
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:22,520
You should explain

701
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,599
why he joins our team, right?

702
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,719
Is he an athlete?

703
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:26,719
Has he ever participated

704
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,040
any tournament?

705
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,400
Here is the thing.

706
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,280
Du Lingfeng is

707
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,199
a transient student in our university.

708
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,719
As for his skills,

709
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:36,920
you may introduce yourself.

710
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,079
Actions speak louder than words.

711
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,959
Since you are unconvinced,

712
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:47,479
why don't we compete?

713
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,599
If you lose,
don't use pressure as an excuse.

714
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,599
I'm just a substitute.

715
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,280
Hai.

716
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,520
Be careful. He has the foundation.

717
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,760
Not bad.

718
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:40,560
Good.

719
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,159
It's steady.

720
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,320
Nice shot.

721
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:06,600
10.2!

722
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,360
10.2!

723
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,280
Not bad.

724
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,399
What?

725
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,600
What's going on?

726
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,879
I told you that day

727
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:25,879
to let me try a shot

728
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,040
and you might change your mind
about me.

729
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,760
But you didn't.

730
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
- Hai.
- Hai.

731
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,120
- Hai.
- Hai.

732
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,479
Let's compete again.

733
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,719
Please time for us.

734
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,959
Sure.

735
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,719
It's simple.

736
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,239
Just one posture.

737
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,040
Balance.

738
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:00,600
Is it this?

739
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,040
Yes.

740
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:02,879
Try it.

741
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,800
I was just experiencing it.

742
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:25,360
Let's compete now.

743
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,239
OK. Ready.

744
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,239
Go.

745
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:32,120
Close your eyes.

746
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,280
Shen.

747
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,439
8.9s.

748
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,719
How did you find it?

749
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,280
He shot fast,

750
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,959
and is good at instant reaction.

751
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
He's taking shoes off.

752
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,919
But a competition

753
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,040
lasts one hour and a half.

754
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,439
Poor endurance

755
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,479
will make his result drop.

756
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,000
Your result is getting better.

757
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,840
8s.

758
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,800
The odor might've influenced you.

759
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,560
Again.

760
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,600
You're doing it with light gear.

761
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,320
Ready.

762
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,639
Go.

763
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:35,120
You lost.

764
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:37,000
There's a long time ahead.

765
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,600
You are much better

766
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
than ordinary people.

767
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,280
But in a high-level shooting team

768
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
like ours,

769
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,439
your talent is

770
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,080
nothing but a stepping stone.

771
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,280
Rest assured, Coach Zhang.

772
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,600
I'm as tough as a stone.

773
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,080
I believe you.

774
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:55,919
Go put your shoes on.

775
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,080
Today, I've introduced you

776
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,719
to everyone.

777
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,600
You'll get used to it.

778
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,000
Let's go.

779
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,520
I'll show you around the venue.

780
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:07,760
Continue your training.

781
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

782
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,200
(Haiya University Gymnasium)

783
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,520
Lingda Group's heir,

784
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,280
Du Lingfeng's Overseas Study.

785
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,399
Du Lingfeng is the son of Du Weiming,

786
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:26,320
the chairman of Lingda Group.

787
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,000
Six years ago,

788
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,479
he was the main player

789
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:29,760
in the shooting team of the UCY.

790
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,760
Wait. Wait.

791
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,919
What is the UCY?

792
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,600
It's an American university.

793
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,280
A branch campus in Shuiwan.

794
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,600
A branch campus in Shuiwan?

795
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,919
He won the runner-up
in the U.S. College Shooting Competition

796
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:41,239
at the age of 19.

797
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,800
He's good.

798
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,479
Yeah.

799
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:44,600
He's awesome.

800
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:45,800
He also has achievements

801
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,840
in the IPSC.

802
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,120
What is the IPSC?

803
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:49,959
Are you a fool?

804
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,120
The International Practical Shooting
Confederation.

805
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,360
- Let me see.
- You know nothing.

806
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:56,080
He participated in

807
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
many world-class competitions

808
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,600
and got

809
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,320
enviable results.

810
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,600
He's really something.

811
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,719
Why haven't we heard of him these years?

812
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,399
Yeah.

813
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,520
Xiaoci,

814
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,280
this time you happen to be heading...

815
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,919
Right towards me.

816
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:18,879
Of course.

817
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,239
You are the sponsor after all.

818
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,600
You are sponsoring us.

819
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,320
Of course I need to show initiative.

820
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:23,919
Right?

821
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:24,840
I would not presume to have the honor.

822
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,639
What you said

823
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:26,959
flatters me.

824
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,120
Actually shooting

825
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,399
has always been my dream.

826
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:30,760
But Xiaoci,

827
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:33,080
how are you gonna return my favor?

828
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,080
Before I do that,

829
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,600
give me the info on your height,

830
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,919
age and weight first.

831
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,800
