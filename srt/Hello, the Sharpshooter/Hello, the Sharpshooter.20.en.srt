Shen Qingyuan...

37
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,400
What are you doing?

00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,360
Tang Xin?

Tang Xin?

40
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,550
Miss Tang,

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,480
you're so hoity-toity!

42
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,080
Let me go!

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,390
I wrote so many letters to you

44
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,190
but got nothing back.

45
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,600
I love you,

46
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,360
you know?

47
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,030
- Can't you write back to me once?
- Let go of me!

48
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,160
Go away!

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,110
What are you doing?

50
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,030
Are you OK?

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,270
I'm glad you're okay.

52
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,080
Let's go.

53
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,030
Wait.

54
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,550
Come on.

55
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,800
Let me see.

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,880
Thanks, Shen Qingyuan.

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
Don't be mad.

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,110
Please!

61
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,600
Don't move.

62
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,480
I... I bought you a cake

63
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,830
for making the national training team

64
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,670
and came

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,200
two hours late.

66
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,670
You must be worried.

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,790
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,760
My cake!

69
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,110
It tastes better

70
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,600
than it looks.

71
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,760
Try it.

72
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,950
It's good, right?

73
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,550
Are we good now?

74
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,510
That was an accident.

75
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,550
I'll be more careful next time.

76
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,200
Get some rest.

77
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
I have other things to attend to.

78
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,550
What to do?

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,390
He's mad at me again.

80
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,510
Wait for me, Shen Qingyuan!

81
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,040
I didn't mean to do that.

82
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,070
You've said that

83
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,480
over and over.

84
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,880
Why did you go up there?

85
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,550
Didn't you know how dangerous that was?

86
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,320
That guy

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,790

Isn't it time for training?

You aren't going?

149
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,150
Didn't you say

150
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,230
you needed me
to look over your shoulder?

151
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,590
Did I?

152
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,590
Yeah.

153
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
And I can't abandon

154
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,400
my partner for the mixed team event.

155
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,440
That can't be the real reason.

156
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,710
I'll pass the trials

157
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,280
and make it to the national team

158
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,030
next year.

159
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,710
We know you will.

160
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,590
We've never doubted that.

161
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,960
OK. Go back to your training.

162
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,110
I have something else to do.

163
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,280
Sure. Got it.

164
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,030
You don't need to tell me.

165
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Did you not go

166
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,670
to the national training team for me?

167
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,350
Or am I

168
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,030
flattering myself?

169
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,030
Look,

170
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,350
you're important to me.

171
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,960
I can't tell you

172
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,150
how much exactly

173
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,440
because I've never

174
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,400
had such feelings before,

175
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,030
but you're

176
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,710
like shooting to me.

177
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,790
Well, enough about that.

178
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,710
Anyway, from now on,

179
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,200
I'll be with you at and after work.

180
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Won't that take up too much
of your time?

181
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,840
No.

182
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,520
They're just numbers.

183
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,710
I'll protect you 24/7.

184
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,790
Shen Qingyuan,

185
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,320
I'll overcome

186
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,840
my weakness

187
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,590
for you.

188
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,200
I know

189
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,640
how much shooting means to you.

190
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,080
Shen Qingyuan,

191
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,440
I'll always support you.

192
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,350
Promise me

193
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,110
that you'll

194
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,200
get into the Olympics

195
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
if you want us to go further

196
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,150
in this relationship.

197
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,400
Deal.

198
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,150
Pinky swear.

199
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,710
Guys,

200
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,000
what would Captain Shen

201
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,400
say to Miss Tang?

202
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,550
Just tell her the truth,

203
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,400
or what else?

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,670
He'd better not,

205
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,670
or she'd

206
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,400
blame herself.

207
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,710
Considering Captain Shen's personality,

208
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,670
giving her a guilt trip

209
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,910
is the least harmless result.

210
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,030
She's tolerant enough

211
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,320
to be able

212
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,400
to put up with him.

213
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,520
You're wrong.

214
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,150
She's the one

215
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,200
leading him by the nose.

216
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,000
You want some?

217
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,350
That's true, I suppose.

218
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,350
You?

219
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,670
Hai.

220
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,760
Come on.

221
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,550
What are you doing? Start shooting.

222
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,400
I'll watch you.

223
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,550
OK. Yeah. Sure.

224
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,840
- Let's go. Go shooting.
- Come on, guys. Let's do it.

225
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,710
Let's go.

226
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,880
Everyone on the team knows

227
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,640
how proud Xiaoci is.

228
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,710
How dare you

229
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,400
compare her to those girls

230
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,520
and say you like her looks?

231
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,080
No wonder she's pissed at you.

232
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,470
Wait.

233
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,470
She never cares

234
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,910
what others say.

235
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,280
But you two are different now.

236
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,280
With this ambiguous vibe going on,

237
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,440
you're known to be a player

238
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,110
and have nothing to lose,

239
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,230
but Xiaoci is different.

240
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,760
Her reputation

241
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,320
might be affected.

242
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,640
But

243
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,590
I thought

244
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,910
she was into bad boys like me.

245
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,280
See?

246
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,670
Your reaction proves

247
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,110
how charming, fun

248
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,200
and popular I am!

249
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,670
Come on!

250
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,230
Wake up!

251
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,790
Don't be so full of yourself, OK?

252
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,400
Xiaoci...

253
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,280
Don't cross the line.

254
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,880
Xiaoci,

255
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,960
I'm sorry about yesterday.

256
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,080
Be specific.

257
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,150
What did you do wrong?

258
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,150
How are you gonna apologize?

259
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,150
Lay it all out

260
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,470
to show you really mean it.

261
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,710
Yes.

262
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,760
It was all my fault.

263
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,320
I said things I shouldn't have

264
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,080
and offended Xiaoci.

265
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,550
Oh, that?

266
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
That was nothing.

267
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,550
I had a mood swing yesterday

268
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,520
because of my period

269
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,470
and left you there

270
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,670
when you treated me to dinner.

271
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,200
I should apologize to you.

272
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,550
No need.

273
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,880
Anyway,

274
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,110
men should apologize to women

275
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,880
no matter what.

276
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,400
What's that supposed to mean?

277
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,790
Like girls

278
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,080
are all unreasonable.

279
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,470
No, no.

280
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,230
I didn't mean that...

281
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,320
Liu Xiang is right.

282
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,790
The one at fault should apologize.

283
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
I'm sorry, Mr. Du.

284
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,150
I feel less of a man.

285
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,420
Can we let it go?

286
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,900
Xiaoci,

287
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,200
would you like

288
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,710
to join me

289
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,150
to congratulate Shen Qingyuan?

290
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,030
No.

291
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,200
Come to think of it,

292
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,910
things could've turned out better.

293
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,710
I agree

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,400
but

295
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,910
you seem to mean

296
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,440
more than that.

297
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,440
Xiao...

298
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,550
The line!

299
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,080
Xiaoci,

300
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,790
can we go back

301
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,680
to where we were

302
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,830
and reignite

303
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,430
those sparks between us?

304
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,830
Sure.

305
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,400
You can count on us, Captain.

306
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,000
We won't let you down

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,680
this time.

308
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,190
Yeah.

309
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,710
Isn't it true

310
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,710
that good things

311
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,160
come in pairs?

312
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,680
Captain has had us back

313
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,070
as well as...

314
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,760
Right?

315
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,590
What about

316
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,070
the status of your Moments?

317
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,430
I don't know what you're talking about.

318
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,160
Miss Tang,

319
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,160
that's all

320
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Captain is asking for.

321
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,350
Please!

322
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah. Just...

323
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,880
Just tap, tap, tap

324
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,830
and done.

325
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,070
- Right?
- Yeah.

If you can't see them again,

00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,110
there's probably a bug.

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,430
don't you

343
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,400
owe us

344
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,160
a formal introduction?

Maybe

348
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,310
you should stop

349
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,470
calling her "Miss Tang".

350
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,070
Of course.

351
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,560
"Miss Tang"

352
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,040

Ms. Tang.

00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,560
Ms. Tang.

356
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,760
I'm not joking.

357
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,000
Got it!

Ding Fang,

365
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,160
what's up?

366
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,310
Congrats.

367
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,470
Photo albums of Shen Qingyuan

368
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,310
and Du Lingfeng are best-sellers.

369
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,350
You made it.

370
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,640
I got lucky.

371
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,310
How's Mom?

372
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,800
You don't need to put on a show again

373
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,280
for the time being.

374
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,310
That's good.

375
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,160
No,

376
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,230
I... I mean

377
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,000
it's good that Mom's getting better.

378
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,070
This is the first time

379
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,710
you've called me since we came back.

380
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,430
I didn't reach out to give you space.

381
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,560
Anyway,

382
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,520
I'm happy

383
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,470
for you.

384
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,470
Zuguang,

385
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,000
do you still remember

386
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,470
the Misattribution of Arousal?

387
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,800
Yes.

388
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,560
Back then, we barely knew each other

389
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,190
and went to the Alps

390
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,950
with the postgraduate
natives association.

391
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,800
On the Skywalk

392
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,190
in Chamonix,

393
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,350
where you first

394
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,350
came to me,

395
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,190
you were too scared to stand on your own

396
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,070
so you held my arm.

397
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,310
That was

398
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,880
where our relationship started.

399
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,070
Why did you bring that up

400
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,160
all of a sudden?

401
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,880
Our hearts

402
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,950
were racing together

403
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,110
at that moment

404
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and we mistook that as love

405
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,310
from the very beginning.

406
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,070
The Skywalk

407
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,160
gave us illusions.

408
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,400
We should divorce.

409
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,470
I've never thought about that.

410
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,350
What's the point

411
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,830
of continuing

412
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,230
a meaningless marriage?

413
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,710
Or do you hate me so much

414
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,230
that you can't let me go?

415
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,590
No, I...

416
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,880
I need some time,

417
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,640
OK?

418
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,920
Let me think about it.

419
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,190
I need to get my thoughts straight.

422

Tang Xin,

423
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,470
what's up?

424
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,950
The news?

425
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,950
I've seen it.

426
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,160
Good job.

427
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,920
Keep up the good work.

428
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,000
OK.

429
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Attention, everyone.

430
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,310
I have

431
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,430
good news for you.

432
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,430
Good news?

433
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,310
Is it about Captain Shen again?

434
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,160
- Captain Shen.
- Captain.

435
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,280
Not just him.

436
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,230
It's about all of you.

437
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,560
- All of us?
- All of us?

438
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,070
All of us?

439
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,590
The results of last week's physical test

440
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,560
for the coming winter training are out.

441
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Compared with the last training period,

442
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,070
the average maximum squat weight

443
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,760
of our pistol class

444
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,110
increased by 15 kilos.

445
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,640
The endurance
of the dorsal abdominal muscle

446
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,110
has seen an average increase
of 30 seconds.

447
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,040
All of you have passed

448
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,190
the 30m Sprint and 10,000m Run.

449
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,830
Captain!

450
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,350
Hai!

451
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,680
Please continue to support

452
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,000
the Shooting Team!

453
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,920
By the way,

454
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,590
a Like would be

455
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,070
even better.

456
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
(Your Teddy: You deserve a Like
more than anyone.)

457
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,920
Who is

458
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,680
"Your Teddy"?

459
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,230
Settle down.

460
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,110
We're going

461
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,760
to the winter training base!

462
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,470
Sorry, Coach.

463
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,190
I didn't know Shen Qingyuan would

464
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,830
turn down the national training team.

465
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,230
He already explained to me

466
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,800
that he couldn't leave you here alone.

467
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,800
He'd rather stay and focus on training

468
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,830
than go there, all distracted.

469
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,280
As long as he works hard

470
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,230
and passes the trials,

471
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,520
he can still be a national team member.

472
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,430
I'll push him hard.

473
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,880
Oh, you kids!

474
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,430
Tang Xin,

475
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,070
like I said before,

476
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,800
I hope you can help Qingyuan

477
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,680
go further.

478
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,000
If you need anything

479
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,800
or have any questions,

480
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,040
feel free to come to me.

481
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,950
Go pack up.

482
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,280
Rui Live is going with us, right?

483
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,950
You're gonna be busy.

484
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,470
Off you go.

485
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,830
Thank you, Coach.

486
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,800
What are you doing here?

487
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,950
The winter training is about to begin.

488
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,350
I need to talk to Coach Zhang.

489
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,070
Coach.

490
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,000
The winter training
is about three months long.

491
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,920
It's the longest

492
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,760
off-season

493
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,190
and the end of the year,

494
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,230
pushing the Shooting Team

495
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,040
to train even harder.

496
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,710
During this period,

497
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,400
all the athletes

498
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,310
can't leave the base

499
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,280
except in extreme circumstances.

500
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,310
Intensive training

501
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,760
is scheduled on a regular basis,

502
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,350
during which trained staffs

503
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,280
will monitor

504
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,560
the team the entire time,

505
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,190
all for the more competitive

506
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,160
and intensive

507
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,680
Olympic trials

508
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,640
next spring.

(Haiya University)

510
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,430
Line up.

511
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,470
Wait for your turn.

512
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,880
Look at Captain.

513
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,280
Slow down!

514
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,830
You're one to talk.

515
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,520
Hadn't you joined

516
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,230
the winter training live team

517
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,040
behind my back,

518
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,000
I wouldn't have had to pick you up!

519
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,920
Mom was worried about you.

520
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,880
Besides,

521
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,000
it was you who spent hours at home

522
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,040
picking out outfits.

523
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,040
Be a man, will you?

524
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,800
Stop being

525
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,110
a mama's boy!

526
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,680

00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
Shooters are trained to battle noise.

702
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,640
What if it was in the middle

703
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,160
of your mindfulness training

704
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,590
or your class?

705
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,560
How's everything?

706
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,520
Still on the way.

707
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,470
OK.

708
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,830
Here's some good news.

709
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,920
The local sports channel

710
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:10,950
will join us

711
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,430
for the winter training livestreaming.

712
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,590
I need you to be prepared.

713
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,430
Also,

714
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,830
preview the event

715
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,950
on Weibo and your channel.

716
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,920
Post a few

717
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,680
eye-catching photos.

718
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,160
The local sports channel?

719
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,680
That's huge!

720
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,110
OK. Got it.

721
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,830
Who'd know

722
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,230
a gentleman like Shen Qingyuan

723
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,520
could be such a handful?

724
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,000
Luckily,

725
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,190
I've got a heavy hand.

726
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,000
Xin,

727
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,280
he is right here.

728
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,760
Stop giggling at his photo.

729
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,000
Shut up!

730
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,310
How romantic!

731
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,470
Feel free

732
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,350
to look at my face.

733
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,470
It's all yours.

734
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,120
I'm not looking at you.

735
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,670
I'm looking at Du Lingfeng.

736
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,950
This one is good, huh?

737
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,360
I'm gonna

738
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,470
pick out nine photos

739
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,390
to post on the official account

740
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,950
and forecast your winter training.

741
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,190
Not this one.

742
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,230
The lighting is awful.

743
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,040
Delete it.

744
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,240
(Delete this photo? Delete)

745
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,390
And this one?

746
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,430
That look is silly.

747
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:32,950
Delete it.

748
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,000
(Delete this photo? Delete)

749
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,150
This one?

750
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,630
That...

751
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,280
That pose is bad.

752
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,150
Delete it.

753
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:42,600
What about this one?

754
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,040
It's overdone.

755
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
His legs are way too long.

756
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,870
Delete it.

757
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,870
Shen Qingyuan,

758
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,670
enough of your nitpicking,

759
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,150
or you'd delete all my photos.

760
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,840
I'm gonna

761
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,840
use this one.

762
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,630
You can't.

763
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,600
Give me a reason.

764
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,560
It's too sexy.

765
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,390
Is it?

766
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,800
All I can see is his collarbone.

767
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,710
What are you guys doing?

768
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,800
In Captain's eyes,

769
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,560
she's practically

770
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,910
hugging Du Lingfeng

771
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,670
in person.

772
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,910
Come on.

773
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,080
Join us

774
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,430
and pray for her.

775
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:18,910
Do it now!

776
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,080
Come on! Do it!

777
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,560
Tang Xin,

778
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,800
I'm stuck at this round.

779
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,520
Help me.

780
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,280
Try again.

781
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,120
I'm busy.

782
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,710
Please!

783
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm bored to death.

784
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,560
(Delete)

785
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,680
(Delete)

786
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,120
(Delete)

787
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,390
I won.

788
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,390
Shen Qingyuan,

789
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,150
give it back!

790
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,360
You want it?

791
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,520
Sit straight.

792
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,120
Do it.

793
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,800
Now, lean forward.

794
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,560
Then backward.

795
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,360
What is this?

796
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,280
You could use an extra seatbelt.

797
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,150
Mr. Zhou,

798
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,910
we've arrived.

799
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,630
Photos for the second album are ready.

800
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,840
Good.

801
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,150
Hey,

802
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,120
Du Lingfeng has forwarded the post.

803
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,000
It's trending online.

804
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,910
Get more clips

805
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,360
of the team's interactions
to attract more attention.

806
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:12,670
I will.

807
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,520
I'm not seeing Du Lingfeng, though.

808
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,520
Do you expect the investor

809
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,000
to travel by bus?

810
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,950
See you, Mr. Zhou.

811
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,320
Lingfeng,

812
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,470
I heard you signed up
for the winter training.

813
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,760
It's closed training.

814
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,670
You can't get out

815
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,080
before it's over.

816
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,430
I've talked to my coach

817
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,870
and got some free time

818
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,320
to take care

819
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,150
of my work.

820
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,630
I don't get it.

821
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,760
Why do you

822
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,320
have to go there?

823
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,390
I don't wanna be a quitter

824
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,560
and there are personal reasons, too.

825
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,390
You're indeed serious

826
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,520
about shooting.

827
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,600
Very well.

828
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,950
Whatever your reason is,

829
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,760
I appreciate your persistence.

830
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,000
That said, you need to figure out

831
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,950
what you are gonna do next.

832
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,950
You aren't getting any younger.

833
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,430
Dad,

834
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,000
our game

835
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,080
isn't over yet.

836
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,280
You said you'd give me a chance.

837
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,910
I did,

838
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,710
but, look,

839
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,800
unlike others,

840
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,320
most athletes are making a career

841
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,560
at the cost of their health and talent.

842
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,390
Once they get old and weak, it's over.

843
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,630
Isn't it too late for you

844
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,230
to be a shooter?

845
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,430
Dad,

846
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,600
I see your point.

847
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,950
I'll think it over.

848
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,390
Good.

849
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,840
What's with the traffic?

850
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,470
I should've taken the bus.

851
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,950
Xiaoci is probably there by now.

852
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,560
Xin, look.

853
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,280
More people are coming.

854
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,600
They must be members
of the sports channel

855
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,000
and Zhengdao Media.

856
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,600
I heard Zhengdao Media

857
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,080
sent their senior livestreamer

858
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,080
and sports commentator

859
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,910
Xu Dian.

860
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,630
I was a huge fan

861
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,520
of his shows.

862
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,040
Are you with me?

863
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,910
No, Xin.

864
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,390
It's another shooting team.

865
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,390
See?

866
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,430
The one in orange.

867
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,870
Shen Qingyuan.

868
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,430
Hi,

869
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,630
I'm Zhou Yue.

870
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,320
Coach,

871
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,040
are we gonna check in first?

872
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,800
That can wait.

873
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,470
Our province has made
the winter training a priority

874
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,630
and sent two high-level teams.

875
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,190
There will be matches among us.

876
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,280
Go and say hi

877
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,760
to them.

879
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,760
Hi, guys.

880
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,190
Hello, Mr. Xu.

881
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,120
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

883
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,040
Coach.

884
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,840
Coach.

885
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,680
- Coach.
- Coach.

886
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,230
Hi, guys.

887
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,800
Is Southeast Team here
for training, too?

888
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,190
Southeast Team?

889
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,280
Oh, them!

890
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,600
Captain Shen

891
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,000
defeated their captain, right?

892
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,470
It's not a done deal.

893
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,950
The margin between winning

894
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,800
and losing could be narrow.

895
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,080
He stands no chance.

896
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,600
Our team is here.

897
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,190
So is Southeast Team.

898
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,230
Coach Liu.

899
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,910
Coach Zhang.

900
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,560
- Long time no see.
- Indeed.

901
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,630
You look great.

902
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,280
Everyone is here.

903
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,190
Coach Liu,

904
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,870
a word, please.

905
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,630
Yeah. Sure.
