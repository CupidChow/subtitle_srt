35
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:54,919
Shen Qingyuan.

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,199
Shen Qingyuan?

37
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,279
Shen Qingyuan,

38
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,680
go sleep in your bedroom.

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,360
Or you'll easily catch a cold here...

40
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,160
How's your physical training going?

41
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:22,679
Not bad.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Are your performances steady?

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,080
Yes.

44
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,600
Keep working hard.

45
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,360
We will.

46
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,039
Tang Xin.

47
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,880
Coach.

48
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:30,880
Tang Xin,

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,759
they have a mixed team training today.

50
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,800
You haven't seen any before, right?

51
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,440
It's rare content for your videos.

52
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,559
I suggest you watch it carefully.

53
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,080
Mixed team?

54
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,000
Shen and Shi are very good at it.

55
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:44,279
You'd better...

56
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,039
You'd better mainly watch.

57
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,679
I'll get to work, then.

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Coach Zhang is absent today.

59
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,800
We'll have a mixed team training.

60
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,320
Work hard.

61
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,399
Pick your positions.

62
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,639
- All right.
- All right.

63
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,960
- Xiaotong.
- Xiaotong.

64
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,800
Come here.

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,600
I'm not going there.

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,919
Today, males and females
stand next to each other.

67
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,839
Females have priority options.

68
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:22,399
You're saying... you'll pick a neighbor

69
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,479
for... for the training, right?

70
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,919
It's of little significance, though.

71
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,199
Are you a little bit nervous?

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,039
No, no.

73
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:31,679
Weird.

74
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,360
Why do I

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,479
keep stammering today?

76
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,080
Xiaoci.

77
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:36,919
Come.

78
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:37,960
I've picked this position instead.

79
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,559
Xiaoci.

80
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,000
Tang Xin.

81
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,759
How do you feel?

82
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:44,880
Are you getting better?

83
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,960
I'm fine. Much better.

84
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm glad to hear that.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,440
We're picking the positions.

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
You're just in time.

87
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,800
Captain Shen,

88
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,639
which position will you pick?

89
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't care.

90
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,360
All right. You pick it first.

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,160
I'll stand next to you.

92
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,679
Du Lingfeng,
I have something to tell you.

93
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:00,320
Get out of my way.

94
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,800
Xiaoci,

95
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:03,759
for you,

96
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,720
I've abandoned so many positions.

97
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,919
Couldn't you just stand next to me?

98
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,399
Why must I stand next to you?

99
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,199
Come on.

100
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,199
You said, "Let's wait and see."

101
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,440
Yeah.

102
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,519
You work hard and I'll see.

103
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,279
Do me a favor.

104
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,679
The last two positions.

105
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:26,799
Go ahead.

106
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,519
Lingda, Rui Live!

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,359
He's a promising shooter 
for the Olympics.

108
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,079
This is also

109
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,880
your new mission.

110
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,399
They can be
the officially-promoted partners.

111
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,160
Get going.

112
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, Xiaoci...

113
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,079
How about this?

114
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,200
You pick the position first, okay?

115
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,959
No problem.

116
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,600
They pick before me
for the sake of our friendship.

117
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,720
I should pick first, anyway.

118
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:53,799
There.

119
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:54,799
How about No. 12?

120
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,239
Later,

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,519
I'll get Du Lingfeng and Shen Qingyuan

122
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,559
for you.

123
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,040
All right.

124
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:01,640
By the way,

125
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,600
ask Du Lingfeng

126
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,119
to take that position.

127
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,959
Okay.

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,559
Live streamer,

129
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,799
we're indeed a family.

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,760
Good job.

131
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,920
Come on.

132
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,000
You always want Xiaoci to follow you.

133
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,000
But actually,

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
to get along with a girl like Xiaoci,

135
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,399
you should cooperate with her

136
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,040
and follow her pace.

137
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,559
But in this case,

138
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,440
you owe me once.

139
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,119
Fine.

140
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll repay you in every way,

141
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:32,880
except being your boyfriend.

142
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,160
As Shen Qingyuan is here,

143
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,119
I can't be your boyfriend anyway, right?

144
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,119
Don't talk nonsense.

145
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:39,959
There.

146
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,959
The last position over there.

147
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,519
Just go.

148
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,640
Xiaoci is watching me.

149
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,959
My target for now

150
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,600
is to train seriously.

151
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,399
Here I go.

152
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,040
Watch over the pistol for me,

153
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,519
Xiaotong.

154
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,679
Captain, what are you

155
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,079
staring at?

156
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:12,160
A world's famous painting?

157
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:14,839
Are the bullets not enough?

158
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,480
They are enough.

159
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,640
Over 200 bullets for a day.

160
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,440
Quite enough.

161
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,239
I'll leave you alone. Right away.

162
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,320
Come on.

163
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,959
You and Miss Tang have got along

164
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,440
in the hospital for days.

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,959
Why are you still so unfamiliar?

166
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,679
Is it because you got along

167
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,200
to a certain extent,

168
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,679
but failed

169
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,959
to be in a relationship,

170
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,799
and then you became distant?

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,559
Is it?

172
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,600
Looks like the bullets aren't enough.

173
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,040
No, no.

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,119
Xiaotong, what did you just say?

175
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,600
Shen Qingyuan...

176
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,559
I was talking

177
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,519
very normally.

178
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,600
Why do I stammer

179
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,559
when I talk to Shen Qingyuan?

180
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,679
Don't you take the video?

181
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,920
I do. I do.

182
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,440
I'm going to practice shooting.

183
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:51,640
Over there.

184
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,760
Shen... Shen Qingyuan.

185
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,359
You and Du Lingfeng...

186
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,480
What?

187
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,600
Xiaoci.

188
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,600
Is Du Lingfeng so handsome?

189
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,200
Why do you keep staring at him?

190
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,600
I... I don't.

191
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,040
You're poor at lying.

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,079
I... I came here

193
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,600
for the livestream.

194
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,200
Are you sure?

195
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,040
I'm... I'm sure.

196
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,079
Your phone is backward.

197
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,640
I...

198
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,359
I'm going to call my superior.

199
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,760
I was stammering so badly.

200
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,239
Was I really so nervous?

201
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:02,480
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

202
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,480
What's up?

203
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,480
Shen Qingyuan and Du Lingfeng get along

204
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,000
worse than we've predicted.

205
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,160
It's hard for me
to complete the mission.

206
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,000
Also, they have been

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,799
focusing on mixed team training.

208
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,600
It harms our chances of promoting them.

209
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,799
Fine. I get it.

210
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,880
Follow up the mixed team training.

211
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,040
As for Shen Qingyuan and Du Lingfeng,

212
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,000
don't ignore them.

213
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,320
Think about

214
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,959
how to start the case with Du Lingfeng.

215
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,679
I was indeed too nervous.

216
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,280
Now, I do not stammer.

217
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,640
Xiaoci,

218
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,280
why did you ask me

219
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,400
to stand here?

220
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,320
How could you do this?

221
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,479
So, you allowed me to come here

222
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,039
only because you picked

223
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,080
the loneliest position for me?

224
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,320
When I stand here,

225
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,599
I'll just watch your sweet moment

226
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,359
with Shen Qingyuan, right?

227
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,280
Du Lingfeng,

228
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,080
be professional, will you?

229
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
We're training.

230
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,320
Xiaoci,

231
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,239
I know in your eyes,

232
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,159
shooting matters most.

233
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,080
So now,

234
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,640
you only think highly of Shen Qingyuan.

235
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,080
But as long as I work hard,

236
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,640
I'll be as good as him.

237
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,159
I didn't expect you

238
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,200
to be so confident in your future.

239
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,960
See?

240
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,559
When you look,

241
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,799
I know you want some water.

242
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,960
Xiaoci,

243
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,880
can we have another try?

244
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,960
Fine. Let's try again.

245
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,280
If you can't meet my requirements,

246
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,440
stay away from me.

247
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,200
No problem.

248
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,159
They aren't even in the same camera.

249
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,760
What do I do?

250
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,400
Forget it.

251
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,599
I'll videotape them individually

252
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,599
and edit them into the same camera.

253
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,479
With the goggles and earplugs,

254
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,760
let's do the blind shooting together.

255
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,000
Ten shots for each.

256
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,880
If your total score

257
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,000
is over 150,

258
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,880
you'll pass the test.

259
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,000
No problem.

260
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:26,119
But if the pistol goes off

261
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,159
or you overrun your time,

262
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,479
the shooting will be invalid.

263
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,760
They are

264
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,119
testing the cooperation degree.

265
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,599
But time is quite pressing.

266
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,119
A formal mixed team event

267
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,200
takes five minutes at most.

268
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
Two rounds of three shots.

269
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They double the shots.

270
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,880
That's right.

271
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,719
Mixed team shooting counts on
not only cooperation,

272
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,000
but also feelings.

273
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,119
Du Lingfeng has some experience.

274
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,960
But he hasn't practiced shooting
for quite a long time.

275
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,280
He won't make it.

276
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,760
Live streamer,

277
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
make me look handsome in the camera.

278
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,359
Okay.

279
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,080
Get ready.

280
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,119
Start.

281
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,880
Load the pistols.

282
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,119
Shoot.

283
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Xiaoci, nine.

284
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,960
Du Lingfeng, eight.

285
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,000
Good job.

286
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,039
Du Lingfeng

287
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,200
didn't get good scores.

288
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,320
But gradually, he figured out

289
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,359
the shooting pace.

290
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,679
His shooting fluency

291
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,599
was good.

292
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,000
Did his pistol go off

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,320
or did he get anxious?

294
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:01,840
No.

295
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,679
Let me do the calculation.

296
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,080
Xiaoci, nine, ten,

297
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
triple nine, double eight,

298
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,200
double nine,

299
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
and ten.

300
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:11,000
Du Lingfeng, eight, six,

301
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,200
double four, double seven,

302
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,039
double eight, and double three.

303
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,440
In total, he got...

304
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,400
148.

305
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,280
What a pity!

306
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,359
If you want to take the video,

307
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,320
I can compete with her, too.

308
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,239
But...

309
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,440
We're the shooting team.

310
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,479
You should take the best video of us.

311
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,440
- Captain Shen!
- Captain Shen!

312
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
Professional.

313
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:22,799
What's the result?

314
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,159
Xiaoci got 50 for Round 1.

315
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,400
47 for Round 2.

316
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,880
49 for Round 3.

317
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,919
During Round 2,

318
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,760
she almost overran her time.

319
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,520
But luckily, she didn't.

320
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:31,719
Captain,

321
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:32,840
you got 50 for Round 1.

322
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,760
50 for Round 2.

323
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,559
And 49

324
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,880
for Round 3.

325
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,000
But because

326
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,599
you overran a second,

327
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,479
one point was deducted

328
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,359
according to the rule.

329
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:46,320
So, 48 at last.

330
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,280
You didn't get 50 for Round 3,

331
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,559
but you still did a good job

332
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,559
that we can never do.

333
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,200
Captain Shen,

334
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,799
you're still a crack shot.

335
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,119
When we cooperate more,

336
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:54,919
we'll do better.

337
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,080
Captain.

338
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,960
This is what a captain can do.

339
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,719
Hai.

340
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,359
Captain Shen did a much better job

341
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,679
than you did last time.

342
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,640
Where are you going?

343
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,039
I'm...

344
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,840
I'm going to the toilet.

345
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,239
Hold it for me.

346
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:24,280
What?

347
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,640
Xiaoci,

348
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,400
what do you mean?

349
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,599
Repeat it to me.

350
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,320
I'm saying

351
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,760
I think Du Lingfeng

352
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
did a better job today

353
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,799
than I imagined.

354
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,880
It can't be that simple.

355
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,760
Are you just praising him?

356
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,039
I just want to do a long-term experiment

357
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:40,640
with Du Lingfeng

358
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,919
and me.

359
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,960
Not exactly a long-term one.

360
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
It may be

361
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,080
only a mid-term one.

362
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,559
You're going to give Du Lingfeng

363
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,479
a long-term or mid-term torture?

364
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:50,719
Not exactly.

365
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,119
I don't want to do the experiment

366
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
simply to humiliate Du Lingfeng.

367
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,679
I want it for Shen Qingyuan, actually.

368
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,200
I want to test

369
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,640
how greatly a relationship

370
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,840
will influence the shooting.

371
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,119
If Shen Qingyuan

372
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,080
falls behind in the relationship

373
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,119
before me,

374
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,359
I'll win.

375
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,120
(Dad)

376
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,000
Hello, Dad.

377
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,919
I know you have joined

378
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,520
Haiya Shooting Team.

379
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,200
Dad,

380
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,320
here's my plan.

381
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,760
I don't think it's appropriate.

382
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,599
But...

383
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,440
Lingda is an old brand

384
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
with a long history.

385
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,640
We need the image

386
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,640
of a professional athlete.

387
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,599
It can't be trifled with.

388
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,479
Dad,

389
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,119
I know

390
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:01,880
in the eyes of the public,

391
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,239
I'm far from being
a professional athlete.

392
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:04,760
I can't solve the problem

393
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,679
simply by joining a shooting team.

394
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,440
I'm glad you know that.

395
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:09,679
But Dad,

396
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,200
could you give me more time

397
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,000
to have a try?

398
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,719
I'll make it up as soon as possible.

399
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,479
Son,

400
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
after so many years,

401
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,159
you suddenly restarted
to practice shooting.

402
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,000
Is there any

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,359
other reason for it?

404
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:24,679
Dad,

405
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,440
it's hard to explain.

406
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,280
I was impulsive to join the team.

407
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,799
But I don't want to leave like this.

408
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,359
But in China,

409
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,640
you can't be a professional athlete

410
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,960
if you're as casual

411
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,679
as you used to be.

412
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,080
I get it.

413
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,880
I'll improve my image faster.

414
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,159
Fine, then.

415
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,559
Failure is another kind of experience.

416
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I just hope

417
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,760
that you know what you're doing.

418
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,640
Du Lingfeng.

419
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:25,920
Let me make it clear.

420
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,000
You can't cry on my shoulder.

421
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,199
I won't.

422
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,359
No one

423
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,880
has even cried

424
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,839
on my shoulder yet.

425
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,920
You're a good man, I think.

426
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,079
And I've found out your advantage.

427
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,839
Be specific.

428
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,959
You're teachable.

429
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,479
I've got a plan

430
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,400
to fully exploit

431
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
your advantage.

432
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,280
Tell me about it.

433
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,000
What?

434
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,199
Be Shen Qingyuan's partner?

435
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,439
No way.

436
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,119
Do you also

437
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,280
find it inappropriate?

438
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,319
I understand.

439
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,199
This is awkward.

440
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,839
Besides, you and Shen Qingyuan

441
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,640
don't get along well.

442
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:12,719
But according to Mr. Zhou,

443
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,160
you're an internet celebrity

444
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,959
and Shen Qingyuan is a new sports star.

445
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,599
You can complement each other.

446
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:18,680
It'll also help

447
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,760
to promote the products

448
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,119
of your company.

449
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
Among your points,

450
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,040
only the last one is helpful.

451
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,359
Well, you're right.

452
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,800
If it can help with Lingda Group,

453
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
pretending to be close to Shen Qingyuan

454
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,760
won't be a problem.

455
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,479
However,

456
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:40,319
can you persuade Shen Qingyuan?

457
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:41,920
I'm not sure.

458
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,359
I knew it.

459
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Don't try to persuade him

460
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,719
in case he rejects your plan.

461
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,800
Let's cooperate secretly.

462
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,199
I'll create chances

463
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,160
to interact with him,

464
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,439
good or bad.

465
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,920
But remember.

466
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,319
Don't make me flatter him

467
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:55,880
shamelessly.

468
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,599
I won't.

469
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,599
Partners can have
a love-hate relationship.

470
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,920
A man has to sacrifice for great things.

471
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,800
When I wing it,

472
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,040
seize the time and take videos.

473
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,560
Don't drop the ball.

474
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,439
Well, speak of the devil.

475
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,760
Captain Shen,

476
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,800
could you not haunt like a ghost?

477
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,599
The toilet is in the gym.

478
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,160
I...

479
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:30,599
Captain Shen,

480
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,839
stop pulling a long face.

481
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,800
You scared her.

482
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,160
I'm talking to Tang Xin.

483
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,359
I just hate it

484
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,760
when you bully her.

485
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,119
Tang Xin.

486
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:55,839
Lying isn't a good habit.

487
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,479
I...

488
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,520
I'm sorry.

489
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:00,719
Look, Captain Shen.

490
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,319
You scared her, right?

491
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,359
Leave with me.

492
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:07,719
Captain Shen.

493
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,479
Would you cut it out?

494
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:09,199
No.

495
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,359
Don't. Don't.

496
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,640
Come on.

497
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:16,280
What's going on?

498
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,079
Don't. Don't.

499
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:17,959
What happened?

500
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,319
Come with me.

501
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,160
I have something to tell you.

502
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,640
Sorry, guys.

503
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,319
Captain Shen,

504
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,040
what happened?

505
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,400
Everything was all right, wasn't it?

506
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,920
Were you too strict

507
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,800
with Miss Tang?

508
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,479
All right. Stop looking.

509
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,239
Off you go.

510
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,839
Off you go.

511
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,640
She sells seashells

512
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,439
by the seashore.

513
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,040
The shells she sells

514
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,920
are surely seashells.

515
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,479
She sells seashells

516
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,319
by the seashore.

517
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,839
The shells she sells

518
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,880
are surely seashells.

519
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:16,959
I have no problem with talking.

520
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,520
Xiaoci.

521
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,640
How about this?

522
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,439
You pick the position first, okay?

523
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:25,400
Come on.

524
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,719
You always want Xiaoci to follow you.

525
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:28,719
But actually,

526
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,040
to get along with a girl like Xiaoci,

527
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,239
you should cooperate with her

528
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,920
and follow her pace.

529
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,439
Shen... Shen Qingyuan.

530
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,079
Don't you take the video?

531
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,199
I do. I do.

532
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,479
Do I only stammer to Shen Qingyuan?

533
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,880
She sells seashells...

534
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,599
She sells seashells...

535
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,239
She sells seashore...

536
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:12,439
She sells seashore...

537
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,640
Oh, my self-protection system,

538
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,800
do me a favor, please.

539
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,359
You want me to keep my distance,

540
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:20,920
but you can't

541
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,880
make me stammer

542
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
when I see Shen Qingyuan, right?

543
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,479
Anyway,

544
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,199
he's very important

545
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,640
for my livestream.

546
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,000
Seashore...

547
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:31,839
Seashell...

548
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,199
Back-up?

549
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,439
I'm always straightforward.

550
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,000
You have a poor foundation.

551
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:42,880
But you cooperated well with me.

552
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,640
So...

553
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,400
That's right.

554
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,359
A back-up can be a real partner one day.

555
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,479
If one day,

556
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,560
Shen Qingyuan and I

557
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,199
have a worse cooperation error

558
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,880
than the expired second,

559
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,000
you can take his place.

560
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,680
But your performance is quite unstable.

561
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,800
So, from this day on,

562
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,199
practice the shooting density.

563
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,199
I'll watch you.

564
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,079
All right.

565
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:02,920
Watch me.

566
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Sell, seashell, seashore...

567
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,479
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

568
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,599
Tang Xin,

569
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
how's your mission going?

570
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,199
Mr. Zhou,

571
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,959
Du Lingfeng barely
accepted the proposal.

572
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,040
Well done.

573
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,839
Coach Zhang and I had a deal

574
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,599
on the mixed teaming training.

575
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,000
This week,

576
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,160
there'll be a two-to-two warm-up match.

577
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:27,680
By then, you'll take care

578
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,400
of the partnering thing.

579
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,199
I get it, Mr. Zhou.

580
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,280
(Student Counseling Room)

581
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,959
Dr. Ding,

582
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,760
that's how it is.

583
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,079
What do I do?

584
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:43,959
Tang Xin,

585
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,319
Shen Qingyuan really has
a strong influence

586
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,359
on you.

587
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,439
As early as you were in the hospital,

588
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,439
I realized

589
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,599
that when you talked to him,

590
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,199
you were very unconfident.

591
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,079
In your heart,

592
00:23:58,719 --> 00:23:59,680
he's the totem, right?

593
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:00,599
Totem?

594
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,040
I gotta go, Captain.

595
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,040
Go.

596
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:08,800
Jiang Yitian.

597
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:14,959
Leave without me.

598
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:17,959
Captain.

599
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,319
Do you want to ask me

600
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,000
if you were too rude to Miss Tang

601
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,239
this afternoon?

602
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,199
Yes, you were.

603
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,319
But I don't think

604
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,640
I'm unconfident.

605
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,920
In most cases,

606
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,119
I'm just embarrassed.

607
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,319
After all, Shen Qingyuan is

608
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,000
an excellent man

609
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,079
in the past and at present.

610
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,520
Whether he's excellent
isn't the problem.

611
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,760
Thank you.

612
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,160
The problem is

613
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,959
the teenage Shen Qingyuan

614
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,920
satisfied your sense of security

615
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,280
when you were a little girl.

616
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,920
At that time, you knew

617
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,119
no matter what you did,

618
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,000
he would tolerate and accept it

619
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,800
without reservations.

620
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,760
But now you're clear

621
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,959
that you're facing

622
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,239
a completely strange young man.

623
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:10,680
He's still Shen Qingyuan,

624
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,280
but he no longer remembers you.

625
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:15,280
Many feelings are different.

626
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,079
The only similarity is

627
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,640
that you've fallen in love
with him again.

628
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,079
I just don't understand

629
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:25,880
why she lied to me.

630
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,400
Captain,

631
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,400
young men like us

632
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
shouldn't be too serious

633
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,680
in front of girls.

634
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,000
Maybe Miss Tang

635
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,880
had an emergency.

636
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,719
She was in a hurry to leave

637
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:33,880
and said she would go to the toilet.

638
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,119
You shouldn't have been moralistic.

639
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,760
But Captain,

640
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,719
are you really so angry

641
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:44,000
simply because she lied to you?

642
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,880
Look, I usually

643
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:47,800
ask for leave

644
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,160
with some excuses

645
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,000
instead of taking the training.

646
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,319
You know that very well.

647
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,119
But you don't punish me, do you?

648
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:56,280
Captain,

649
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,160
when someone

650
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,119
can really affect you,

651
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,599
it means she's very special

652
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,400
to you.

653
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,880
Besides, Miss Tang

654
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,599
seems to have pheromones

655
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,160
that you can't resist.

656
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,280
So, Captain,

657
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,400
be with her.

658
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:13,479
But you're not sure

659
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,520
if he still likes you

660
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,079
as he did before.

661
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,280
To put it briefly,

662
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,079
you have no confidence

663
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,920
to do anything you want before him.

664
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,079
You try hard to resist

665
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,239
his influence on you,

666
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,439
but you realize you can't.

667
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,319
Then you get anxious and nervous.

668
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,280
Maybe one day,

669
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
when you reconfirm

670
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,760
his feelings for you,

671
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,239
your stammering problem

672
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,119
will be truly solved.

673
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,959
Anyway,

674
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,119
I still hope

675
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,439
that he can get back his memories

676
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,119
and recall what happened between us.

677
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:47,400
Only in this way will I be brave enough

678
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,920
to be the haughty little girl he loves.

679
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,040
Then I can be relieved.

680
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,439
So, avoiding him

681
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,439
will not solve any problem.

682
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,880
Tang Xin,

683
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,040
helping Shen Qingyuan
get back his memories

684
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,839
is your top priority.

685
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,640
But if

686
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
I keep staying with him,

687
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
I'll be stammering.

688
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,239
It'll influence my work.

689
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,439
Then find out a solution

690
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,520
to diffuse the tension

691
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,239
when you get along with him.

692
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,640
Now, you emotionally look up

693
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,599
at Shen Qingyuan.

694
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,560
Why not try to look at him at eye level

695
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,640
and find his shortcomings?

696
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:25,959
Try to find out

697
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,439
that he's an ordinary man

698
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,560
just like you.

699
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Maybe

700
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,280
it's the only way

701
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,800
to get rid of the sense of inferiority.

702
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,160
What do I do, then?

703
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,160
That's easy.

704
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Do something

705
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,160
that all girls like.

706
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:47,119
For example, buy her a present.

707
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:48,319
Take her to work and get her back.

708
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,160
Or...

709
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,839
Learn to talk sweetly.

710
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,160
But you need a moment to talk sweetly.

711
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,119
The best way...

712
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,079
The best way...

713
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,000
The best way...

714
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,920
The best way is

715
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,400
to burst out talking sweetly

716
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,479
during a very harmonious conversation.

717
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,839
At that time,

718
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
the girl will freeze,

719
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,000
stunned and moved.

720
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:17,000
Anyway, don't be afraid to lose face.

721
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,959
As a young man,

722
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
you should admit your mistake

723
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:20,520
and get punished for that.

724
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:32,280
Well,

725
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,640
Dr. Ding,

726
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:39,079
my superior talked about you last time.

727
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:42,760
You mean Zhou Zuguang, right?

728
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,160
He's my husband.

729
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
He is?

730
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,280
I once

731
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,040
regarded him as my totem, too.

732
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,479
But now,

733
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,920
the totem is gone.

734
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,640
So, you're...?

735
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,160
In short,

736
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,280
we're a couple in name only.

737
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:46,920
You're in my way.

738
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,040
See?

739
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,599
You're in the way, aren't you?

740
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,560
Get on the bike.

741
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,000
No?

742
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,040
Shen... Shen Qingyuan.

743
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:11,719
Shen Qingyuan.

744
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:12,520
Shen Qingyuan, my bag.

745
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,119
Give it back to me, Shen Qingyuan.

746
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,280
Shen Qingyuan!

747
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:20,280
Will you get on the bike?

Shen Qingyuan's shortcomings,

I've lost face already.

00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,920
Shortcomings...

00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,959

You...

781
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:44,920
Are you scared?

782
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:47,400
If you're scared,

783
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,239
let's not watch it.

784
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:49,479
I'm not scared.

00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:50,800

786
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,400
Are you really not scared?

787
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,800
You're scared?

788
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,959
No.

789
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,160
Let's watch it.

790
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,959
Shen Qingyuan is scared of ghost movies.

791
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,199
But I'm not.

792
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,079
I can

793

use this shortcoming

00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,359
to build up confidence.

795
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,000
By then,

796
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,319
he'll force me to turn off the TV.

797
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,359
I can get a clear understanding

798
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,119
of his shortcoming.

What will we have for dinner?

804
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,160
Hot... Hot and sour rice noodles?

805
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,040
There're some ingredients
in the kitchen.

806
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:51,959
Let me make dinner for you.

807
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:53,760
Don't bother.

808
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:54,520
I'm not hungry.

809
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,040
Would you like to watch a movie?

810
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,160
Okay.

811
00:33:58,959 --> 00:33:59,520
Be seated.

812
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,560
Don't you watch it?

813
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,360
It's not interesting.

814
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,360
He's indeed scared.

815
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,159
But he keeps denying it.

816
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:53,520
Don't you...

817
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,159
want to turn off the TV?

818
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,399
The best way is

819
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:01,879
to burst out talking sweetly

820
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,919
during a very harmonious conversation.

821
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,000
At that time,

822
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:07,280
the girl will freeze,

823
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,199
stunned and moved.

824
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:14,919
It's up to you to decide.

825
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:23,120
Don't... Don't you mind?

826
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,399
What's your point?

827
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,040
I mean

828
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,239
you're a little bit weird today.

829
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,679
How do you think I should behave?

830
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,080
How do I think?

831
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,760
You love

832
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,800
to give orders, don't you?

833
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,919
Learn to talk sweetly.

834
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,080
Learn to talk sweetly.

835
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,479
Learn to talk sweetly.

836
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,040
How will I want

837
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,239
to give orders to you?

838
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:11,040
Forget it.

839
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
I just want you to be happy.

840
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,320
I...

841
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,600
I...

842
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,560
Enjoy... Enjoy the movie yourself.

843
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,120
Why did he behave differently

844
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,159
from what I imagined?

845
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,760
When I'm so confused,

846
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,439
how can I get a clear understanding

847
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:41,080
of his shortcoming?

848
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:45,439
Oh, yes.

849
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,360
He expelled me during the competition

850
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,639
because I disturbed him.

851
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,080
You can do it, Tang Xin.

852
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,719
Go disturb him

853
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,679
and make him humiliate you.

854
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,199
Then you'll feel his shortcoming

855
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,479
from the bottom of your heart

856
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,320
and he'll no longer be perfect.

857
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,719
A mosquito.

858
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,800
Then why do you use a flyswatter?

859
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,800
I can't reach it with my hand.

860
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,399
Tang Xin!

861
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,199
Come over.

862
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,760
Am I disturbing you?

863
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,159
No.

864
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,919
Are you doing after-meal sports?

865
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,719
But you haven't had dinner yet.

866
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,280
I'm killing mosquitoes

867
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,679
and you're doing sports.

868
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,439
We don't disturb each other.

869
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,159
I don't mean that.

870
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,919
I'm asking if you're hungry.

871
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm hungry.

872
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,239
Don't... don't you expel me?

873
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,639
Why do I do that?

874
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,959
Go to the kitchen if you're hungry.

875
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:23,959
You'll find some dishes.

876
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,600
But you...

877
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,639
You never respect anyone

878
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,639
and you expel whoever disturbs you,

879
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:36,840
don't you?

880
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,080
So, you were killing mosquitoes

881
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,360
near me on purpose?

882
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,840
It smells great.

883
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:50,159
Are the dishes for me?
