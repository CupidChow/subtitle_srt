=Episode 10=

35
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:38,720
Aim the rear sight

36
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,120
at the front sight

37
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:41,160
and point it at the bull's eye.

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
Three points on the same line.

39
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:43,440
Try it.

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,239
7.2. Far miss.

41
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,440
Carry on.

42
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,080
What is he looking at?

43
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,639
Hold on.

44
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,600
The rhythm is not right when you shoot.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,199
It's supposed to shoot

46
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:29,039
between heartbeats.

47
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,600
And you need to hold your breath

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,720
so as to fire

49
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,800
the most accurate shot.

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,399
All right.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,399
Give me your left hand.

52
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,759
Raise the pistol with your right hand.

53
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,559
Hold your breath.

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,520
And shoot.

55
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,320
Off-target.

56
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,039
It's normal.

57
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,639
How about this?

58
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,440
Practice your position

59
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,520
and rhythm first.

60
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,839
Come on.

61
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,759
Stand in line with the number.

62
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,759
Feet shoulder-width apart.

63
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,440
Raise the pistol slowly.

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,080
Do pheromones

65
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,039
have independent consciousness?

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,839
Look at its matching accuracy.

67
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,360
It's more...

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,000
It's more accurate
than cars, houses, and looks,

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,800
- and...
- Yang Zhou.

70
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,720
What?

71
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,880
Pheromones are really amazing.

72
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,199
Right?

73
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,199
Did you notice that

74
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,520
when Tang Xin sees Shen Qingyuan today,

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
she becomes afraid to speak?

76
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:09,600
And she stammers when she speaks.

77
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,600
Now I notice it.

78
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,399
- Right?
- Miss Tang

79
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,479
does stammer

80
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,759
when she's with Captain today.

81
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,320
What are you talking about?

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,119
Let me join you.

83
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,359
I was saying

84
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm heading for the office.

85
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,359
Yang Zhou,

86
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,880
please tell Tang Xin for me.

87
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,000
OK, sure,

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,640
no problem.

89
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,559
I got to go then.

90
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,239
Keep practicing.

91
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,000
OK, bye.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,640
Bye.

93
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,320
She told me

94
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,799
Miss Tang kind of stammers.

95
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,399
Put your shoulder,

96
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,480
the front sight and the bull's eye

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,200
in a straight line.

98
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,119
Raise the pistol slowly

99
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,519
to the top of the target

100
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,239
and then lower it.

101
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
I'm going to use the restroom.

102
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:07,959
Captain.

103
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,959
How's it going?

104
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,320
It didn't work.

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,519
Impossible.

106
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,359
Next,

107
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,720
I'll do it my own way.

108
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,799
This whole afternoon,

109
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,440
I haven't started to confront it,

110
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,440
but kept avoiding the problem.

111
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,160
There are ways that are not awkward.

112
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,399
For example...

113
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,720
Singing.

114
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,399
How embarrassing it'll be

115
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,359
to sing in front of Shen Qingyuan.

116
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,480
Stop!

117
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,519
Let go, you!

118
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,640
Let go.

119
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,519
What are you doing?

120
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,519
Call the police!

121
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,440
Security!

122
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,480
Security!

123
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,000
Security!

124
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,519
Security!

125
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,559
What are you doing?

126
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,959
- Don't let him get away.
- Stop there!

127
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,079
Are you alright?

128
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm fine.

129
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,920
What happened to your hand?

130
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,519
It's fine.

131
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,920
Let me see.

132
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:37,920
Captain.

133
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,519
Jiang Yitian and I have to run now.

134
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,239
See you.

135
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:40,799
Bye.

136
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
Jiang Yitian, Yang Zhou.

137
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,279
Miss Tang.

138
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,880
You've been working hard lately.

139
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,519
Let's have some fun tonight.

140
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,200
What do you think?

141
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,200
- Where are we going?
- Where are we going?

142
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,519
Karaoke.

143
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,160
You have to persuade Captain first.

144
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,600
Shen Qingyuan.

145
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,959
I asked them to go to a karaoke.

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,720
Are you going with us?

147
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,000
Normally, I wouldn't go.

148
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,160
Failed.

149
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,839
But this time is an exception.

150
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,640
I can take you home tonight.

151
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,279
Thank you!

152
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,119
Shen...

153
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:49,959
Aren't you going to sing?

154
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,839
Come on, livestreamer.

The more you do this,

00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,119
Exactly.

178
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,200
Captain.

179
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,400
Why don't you sing for her?

180
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,039
Right?

181
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,520
Yeah.

182
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,239
- Captain! Captain! Captain!
- Captain! Captain! Captain!

183
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,239
With that said,

184
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:16,919
I've never seen

185
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,840
Captain Shen sing.

186
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:18,840
He looks like

187
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,359
he can't sing at all.

188
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,880
- Captain! Captain! Captain!
- Captain! Captain! Captain!

189
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,320
You want to see him sing

190
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
this much?

191
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,039
It's okay, Xiaoci.

192
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,200
Today

193
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,479
I'll show you

194
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,679

00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,520
Do you dare

200
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,559
to sing with me?

201
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,840
OK.

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,559
So, Shen Qingyuan,

260
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,919
we can only be

261
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,239
each other's past,

262
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:00,200
instead of the future,

263
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,479
right?

264
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:03,400
Otherwise,

265
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,599
why we didn't have

266
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:06,640
the firework display

267
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,559

What are you doing?

269
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,599
Practicing singing?

270
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,599
I can teach you.

271
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,039
Sing.

272
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,799
I don't know how.

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,799
I can't even carry a tune.

274
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Then, let's change it

275
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,280
to a simpler song.

It's near the company

00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,159
and convenient.

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,119

299
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,159
It was dangerous today.

300
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Thank you.

301
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,599
You should treat the wound

302
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,719
on your face.

303
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,719
It's fine.

304
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,760
If they ask, I'll tell them

305
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,520
my wife got mugged.

306
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,440
That way they'll know I have a wife.

307
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,960
Is having a wife

308
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,599
more important than your dignity?

309
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,799
A good wife

310
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:14,359
is a man's most precious thing.

311
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,440
Precious.

312
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:17,679

00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,000
It is, why?

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,719
Let me see.

317
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,760
Hug me, please.

318
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,359
I failed to do my duty

319
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,359
as your wife,

320
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,520
so that you

321
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,920
completely lost interest in me.

322
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,400
Two years have passed.

323
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:14,920
Now we're

324
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,359
under the same roof,

325
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,920
but you still don't feel a thing for me.

326
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:20,520
It's not like that.

327
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,160
Ding Fang.

328
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:22,839
It's my fault.

329
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,239
I'm not good enough.

330
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,280
I'd better leave.

333
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,280
Have you got home?

334
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,239
Do you know where Shen Qingyuan's gone?

335
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:13,920
I don't.

336
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,040
Fine.

337
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,640
Take care of yourself.

338
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,239
You haven't answered

339
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,160
my question.

340
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,599
Wh-What question?

341
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,520
Why don't you speak?

342
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:42,520
Because I get nervous and I stammer

343
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,040
when I'm with you.

344
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,520
Shen... Shen Qingyuan.

345
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,959
Thanks

346
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:07,839
for the help today.

347
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,599
After I took the first step,

348
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,400
it doesn't seem that hard.

349
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,560
So next,

350
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,359
I can livestream
Shen Qingyuan's match

351
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,959
by the way of singing.

352
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,000
But what if

353
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,719
people laugh at

354
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:01,839
my poor singing?

355
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,160
(Jiang Yitian)

356
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,480
(New message)

357
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,079
Where can I download
the livestreaming app?

358
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,000
In the app store.

359
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,119
Downloading apps.

360
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,280
Who's this stupid livestreamer?

361
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,560
She wants to ride on the wave

362
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,599
of the famous athlete?

363
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,040
She's completely out of tune.

364
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
I'll find a way

365
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,959
to make my singing

366
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,640
be in harmony with the match.

367
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,680
Don't you feel hot?

368
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Don't you feel hot?

369
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,520
I don't.

370
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,839
Why are you dressing like this?

371
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,599
I'm doing

372
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,119
singing livestreaming practice.

373
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,560
Good luck.

374
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,520
He laughed.

375
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,160
But is he mocking me?

376
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,560
No.

377
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,640
I can't care too much

378
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,000
about what he thinks.

379
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:25,680
What?

380
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,560
I like this material.

381
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,680
It's soft.

382
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,520
I... I have to do the livestreaming.

383
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:40,560
Why use a slow song?

384
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,520
Haven't I taught you

385
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
the rhythm?

386
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,439
Try a song with regular rhythm

387
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,079
to get the hang of it.

388
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,839
Regular rhythm?

389
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,760
Haven't I taught you

390
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,839
the rhythm?

391
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,199
Try a song with regular rhythm

392
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:17,800
to get the hang of it.

393
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,359
Chicken beep beep.

394
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,040
Chicken beep beep.

395
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,599
Look, there's a hen over there.

396
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,000
I can't follow up.

397
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,640
Try another.

398
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,119
Please, find me

399
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,599
one song that I can sing.

400
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,239
She still can't find the rhythm.

401
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,239
What's this sound?

402
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,640

417

You made it.

418
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,439
Thank you, Shen Qingyuan.

419
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,680
I'll remember this rhythm.

420
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:11,760
Shen Qingyuan.

421
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,439
I won't let your efforts be in vain.

422
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,920
I'll remember it.

423
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,280
What did I dream about?

424
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,560
Rap.

425
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,840
(Qianyang 26)

426
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,040
You mean it, Tang Xin?

427
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,520
You wanna rap in the livestream?

428
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,920
This is a secret.

429
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,839
I haven't done it yet.

430
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,199
Tang Xin,

431
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:58,839
you've been

432
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,400
a reliable and discreet person.

433
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,199
What's got into you?

434
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,040
You suddenly decided

435
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,319
to break free of the constraints?

436
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,560
Hello.

437
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,520
Hello. Hello.

438
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,680
We've got a new colleague

439
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
working with us.

440
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Mr. Zhou said

441
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,199
we should learn from her strength.

442
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,119
I don't think it's that simple.

443
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,239
Forget it.

444
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
It's good that you want a breakthrough.

445
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,079
But look at the rapper's tongue.

446
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,359
They speak quickly like a zebra.

447
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,680
You'll have to play

448
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,959
and commentate.

449
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,560
Will you even freestyle a bit?

450
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,400
I can only try my best.

451
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:32,920
Lizi.

452
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,280
Be my support.

453
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:36,479
Come on, Tang Xin.

454
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:37,640
I'll be your support.

455
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,119
If this works well,

456
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,959
I won't be worried about

457
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,079
the livestream

458
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,040
of the next provincial competition.

459
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,040
Hi, Mr. Zhou.

460
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,119
Tang Xin.

461
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,680
Come to my office with me.

462
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,079
He needs me?

463
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,239
Go ahead, be quick.

464
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,640
Hi, Tang Xin.

465
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,520
Sit.

466
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,319
Miss Lizi.

467
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,680
Don't, Ai.

468
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,599
Just call me Lizi.

469
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,479
We're about the same age.

470
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,319
Lizi.

471
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,359
I'm new here,

472
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,880
and need time to familiarize myself.

473
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,319
Now it's break time,

474
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,719
and I have a few questions to ask.

475
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,760
Sports livestreamers

476
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,719
have to come to matches.

477
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:37,599
It's not like your previous company

478
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,800
where you can give one on the spot.

479
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,239
Haven't you and Tang Xin

480
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,359
stayed in the shooting team?

481
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,119
She's a pillar of our department.

482
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,800
Just learn from her.

483
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,280
That's for sure.

484
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:48,839
Oh, right.

485
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,800
Does Tang Xin

486
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
have a good relationship

487
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
with Mr. Zhou?

488
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,439
Their relationship.

489
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,000
I'll put it this way.

490
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:56,479
Few of our videos

491
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:57,400
praised by the leaders

492
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,520
of the TV station

493
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,760
are made by Tang Xin

494
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,079
together with Mr. Zhou.

495
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,520
She's been a great help

496
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,479
to Mr. Zhou.

497
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,880
She's amazing.

498
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,599
I have to learn from her.

499
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:07,839
Go for it.

500
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,719
I'll get back to work.

501
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,160
What happened yesterday?

502
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,439
On the shooting team.

503
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,719
You mean

504
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:24,359
me joining the 2v2 match?

505
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:26,119
Yes.

506
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,719
Did Mr. Zhou

507
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,160
have a fight with Dr. Ding?

508
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:31,880
Oh, no.

509
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,359
He must be in a bad mood.

510
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,000
Sorry, Mr. Zhou.

511
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:37,000
I said yes to Shen Qingyuan
without permission.

512
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:38,839
Sit down.

513
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,439
I haven't blamed you.

514
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,680
Shen Qingyuan asked you
to join the match?

515
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,839
They...

516
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:49,520
Shen Qingyuan and Du Lingfeng

517
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,479
had a quarrel yesterday

518
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,560
for their partner of the match.

519
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,479
I think Shen Qingyuan wanted to prove

520
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:56,479
he's way better than Du Lingfeng,

521
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,560
so he picked me as his partner
on purpose.

522
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,800
Sorry, Mr. Zhou.

523
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,719
I agreed to mess around with them.

524
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:04,920
It's good.

525
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:06,280
The more they include you,

526
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,359
the better the chance
for you to shoot the partnering thing.

527
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,520
And

528
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,760
you eased up their conflict

529
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,560
without knowing it.

530
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,400
So that they are now

531
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
on better terms.

532
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,079
Mr. Zhou.

533
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,199
Don't praise me.

534
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,119
I'm not.

535
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,520
Alright.

536
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,520
Join the 2v2 match.

537
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:27,640
And create chances

538
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,239
for them to interact more.

539
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,599
As for the livestreaming,

540
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,800
let Ai do it

541
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,479
so she can have a practice.

542
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,959
She's quite passionate.

543
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,680
OK.

544
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,640
You may leave.

545
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,599
Captain, that's very kind of you.

546
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,520
I was just saying it,

547
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,839
but you actually invited us to lunch.

548
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,800
Jiang Yitian, what did you do

549
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,599
to get Captain treat you to lunch?

550
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,439
And you even take me.

551
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,599
Our captain

552
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,800
is learning

553
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,880
to use the smartphone.

554
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,319
I teach him to download apps.

555
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,280
You're tricky,

556
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,040
Jiang Yitian.

557
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,400
Next time you do this,

558
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,439
bring me with you.

559
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:10,520
Of course.

560
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,479
Tell me.

561
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:13,599
OK.

562
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,760
Captain,

563
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,000
let me show you.

564
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,280
These eating, shopping
and taxi ordering apps

565
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,359
are all convenient apps.

566
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,400
They can make our life easier.

567
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,040
And these are recreation apps.

568
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,760
This app store

569
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,400
is what you need.

570
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,119
You can download

571
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,400
any application you like from here.

572
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,439
It's got everything.

573
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,040
Smart phones

574
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,000
are our soul vessel nowadays.

575
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,719
Every empty soul

576
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,920
can get rest here.

577
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,439
Yes.

578
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,160
W-Wait.

579
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,880
It's not right.

580
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,079
Captain has shooting

581
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,160
and Miss Tang.

582
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,599
He's not empty.

583
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,280
Get away.

584
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,239
Get away.

585
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,000
Captain,

586
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,959
did I make it clear?

587
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:46,560
You see,

588
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,160
about this app,

589
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,119
I can explain...

590
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,079
Captain.

591
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:49,839
Let's go.

592
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,079
Smart apps.

593
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,479
I remember Rui Live's headquarter is

594
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,560
around here somewhere.

595
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,439
- Captain.
- Captain.

596
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:04,959
Captain.

597
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,319
Did I say something wrong?

598
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:07,680
Captain.

599
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,119
You didn't.

600
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:10,920
Are you full?

601
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,119
I am.

602
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:12,800
Perfect.

603
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,439
Let's go for a run

604
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,239
to help with digestion.

605
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,040
No, Captain...

606
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,640
Captain.

607
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,599
That's not the way to the campus.

608
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:19,680
Are you dull?

609
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,479
You have such a bigmouth.

610
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:21,560
That's Rui Live's headquarter.

611
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,119
Come on.

612
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:23,959
Sir.

613
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,119
You don't know how helpless I am now.

614
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,599
They didn't even give me a chance,

615
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,800
but only let me

616
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,880
livestream the short games.

617
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,359
They didn't even mention me

618
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,800
when they did
the provincial competition.

619
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,680
I know.

620
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,239
I'm new here.

621
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,800
But it was you who recommended me.

622
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,239
What do they mean

623
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,319
when ignoring me like this?

624
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,239
Moreover,

625
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:45,800
the so-called

626
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,199
Mr. Zhou's right hand

627
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,880
can barely express herself.

628
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:57,160
(Qianyang 26)

629
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Captain, you have good stamina.

630
00:32:59,079 --> 00:32:59,800
But Captain,

631
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,079
we don't know

632
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,680
which floor Miss Tang's on.

633
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,599
How about sending her a message?

634
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:08,880
OK.

635
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,359
I'll listen to you

636
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
and won't act rashly.

637
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,479
I'll wait patiently for the chance.

638
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,280
Learn to sing from me?

639
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,000
She must be covering something up.

640
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:39,839
Tang Xin.

641
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,839
Why don't you get some rest?

642
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,839
I can't.

643
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,000
The livestreaming is about to begin.

644
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,239
I'm both nervous and excited.

645
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,479
Right.

646
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:47,800
The term list of shooting
I gave you today

647
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,040
is not very detailed.

648
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,160
I will give you

649
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,920
a more detailed one.

650
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,719
It's fine.

651
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,760
I know you're busy.

652
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,839
And you'll join the 2v2 match

653
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,680
with Shen Qingyuan.

654
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,280
Oh,

655
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,160
I saw some people wearing

656
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,719
uniforms from the window.

657
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,719
I don't know

658
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:02,640
if it's them.

659
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,079
Shen Qingyuan?

660
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,880
There's no way he could be here.

661
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,080
I'm sending her a message.

662
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:16,639
Miss Tang.

663
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,520
Are you

664
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,439
on the third floor?

665
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,639
How did you know?

666
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,679
We're downstairs.

667
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,879
She's here. She is.

668
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,560
You have a sharp eye.

669
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,399
It's them.

670
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
I told you.

671
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,199
Are they here for you?

672
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,040
Miss Tang, come downstairs,

673
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,879
so we can go back to the team together.

674
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,560
Captain is with us.

675
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:49,679
You know what I mean.

676
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,159
Well, Ai,

677
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,679
would you like

678
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,760
to meet them with me?

679
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,520
Thanks, but I'll pass.

680
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,159
I've got many things on
with the livestreaming.

681
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,800
OK. Come on.

682
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,879
I'm gonna go.

683
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,719
Why isn't she here?

684
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,399
- Miss Tang.
- Miss Tang.

685
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,760
You look lovely today.

686
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,439
There you are finally.

687
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,399
If you don't come out,

688
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:17,280
our captain

689
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,520
will suffer from cervical neck pain.

690
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,879
Why...? Why are you here?

691
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:23,000
Is something wrong?

692
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,360
Today we're...

693
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,959
You have a great working environment.

694
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,560
Looks like

695
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,600
we're going to keep

696
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,560
a distance from her.

697
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,120
Wait.

698
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,320
I ordered a cab.

699
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,520
Let's go back to the school together.

700
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,000
Your phone, your phone.

701
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,679
It's ringing.

702
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,719
Pick it up. Pick it up.

703
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,879
Hello, sir.

704
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:47,719
He has a call.

705
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,399
Yes.

706
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,199
We're at the front door

707
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,800
of Rui Live.

708
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,439
You've arrived?

709
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:52,959
OK, OK.

710
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:53,760
We're walking to you.

711
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,840
OK.

712
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,080
- The cab is here?
- Captain.

713
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:56,639
The cab is here.

714
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,399
Let's go.

715
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,439
Let's go.

716
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,840
Aren't you going, Captain?

717
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:01,840
We're leaving first.

718
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,600
See you, Captain.

719
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,840
We can go together.

720
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:09,399
Shall we...? Go for a walk?

721
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,439
Careful.

722
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,560
Thanks.

723
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,239
Is he keeping

724
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,479
a distance from me?

725
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,560
Am I being paranoid?

726
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,040
Still trying to chase me?

727
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,679
I didn't mean it.

728
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,800
How's your singing going?

729
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,280
Aren't you going to do livestreaming?

730
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:16,879
I plan

731
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:18,360
to practice fast-paced rap.

732
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:19,320
It can match the rhythm

733
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,159
of the competition

734
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,560
and people won't know I sing off key.

735
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,239
But I found

736
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,919
it's not as easy as I expected.

737
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,520
So I've hit a bottleneck.

738
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,040
Still about the rhythm problem.

739
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I noticed many changes

740
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,719
in the way I rap.

741
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,280
For a beginner like me,

742
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,919
it will be like Kuaiban.

743
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,719
And the content is also a problem.

744
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,399
It's hard

745
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,679
to improvise on the lyrics.

746
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,080
Read the words you typed for me.

747
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:47,399
I'll give you a beat.

748
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,040
I... I...

749
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:56,159
Relax.

750
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,080
One, two, three.

751
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,879
Go.

752
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
I noticed many changes

753
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,840
in the way I rap.

754
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,679
For a beginner like me,

755
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,959
it will be like Kuaiban.

756
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,199
I noticed many changes

757
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,320
in the way I rap.

758
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,120
Not bad.

759
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,520
The center density is quite right.

760
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:26,040
Xiaoci.

761
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:27,800
Look at my sweat.

762
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,600
It's all because of the training.

763
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,520
You haven't eaten, right?

764
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,719
I brought you some food
from the canteen.

765
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:34,479
Have some.

766
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:46,760
Xiaoci.

767
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:48,479
You prepared

768
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:49,520
the food specially for me?

769
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,120
Hard work

770
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,959
indeed pays off.

771
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,840
You have to keep up the hard work.

772
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,600
Or there will be no payback.
