Tang Xin,

67

you appear to be quiet and shy,

68

but turns out you are so brazen-faced.

Your commentary

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,559
was quite amateur.

78
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:35,720

79

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,479
The live room number

176
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,520
has been sent through bullet chat.

177
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,880
Rainbow Bear.

178
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:11,799
Go ahead.

179
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,640
I'm ready.

180
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,880
H-Hi, everyone.

181
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,239
This… This is…

182
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,719
Don't be nervous.

183
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Pay attention to the pace.

184
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,200
Hi, everyone.

185
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,000
We are at the competition site

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,719
of the Lingda Cup

187
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,640
10m air pistol mixed team event.

188
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,760
I'm…

189
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm…

190
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,559
I'm Rainbow Bear.

191
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,040
(Non-bitter Lemon)

192
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,359
The first live room of Rainbow Bear

193
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:13,919
only existed for three days.

194
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,960
This is my new account.

195
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,000
But I managed to find a way

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,760
to recover all the data

197
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,679
and the previous videos.

198
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,239
Please take a look.

199
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,320
(You were so popular. Glad you're back!)
(Fantastic! Rainbow Bear is back!)

200
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,760
(Fantastic! Rainbow Bear is back!)
(Wonderful! Rainbow Bear is back!)

201
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,719
I'm a fan of Rainbow Bear.

202
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,919
And Rainbow Bear

203
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,359
is Tang Xin.

204
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,440
(No. I don't believe it.)
(You've got my back!)

205
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,599
About the video online,

206
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,880
the background

207
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,239
was Rainbow Bear's live room,

208
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,919
but the scenes were edited.

209
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,679
Besides, the second part

210
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,719
wasn't some wild livestream.

211
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,640
It was just an accident.

212
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:11,960
The unedited video

213
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,840
has been released.

214
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,000
(Trap. It was a trap.)
(The video was edited.)

215
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,320
And now, I'll answer

216
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
one last question.

217
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,479
The man in the end of the video

218
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,000
was me.

219
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,400
That was Captain.

220
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,799
- It was Captain.
- It was Captain.

221
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,640
Shen Qingyuan…

222
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,360
(Non-bitter Lemon)

223
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm her boyfriend.

224
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,800
(My Qingyuan, stop talking…)
(I didn't see that coming.)

225
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,119
- Captain.
- Captain.

226
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,359
Captain, good for you!

227
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,840
Good for you, Captain!

228
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,400
Your efforts

229
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,640
should be recognized by everybody.

230
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,799
(Is he confessing his love to me?)

231
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,679
(Is he…)

232
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,400
Okay.

233
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,039
Xin, Mr. Zhou is calling.

234
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,599
Captain.

235
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,479
So,

236
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,159
does it feel good to have a champion

237
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,840
to be your brother-in-law?

238
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,039
Not bad.

239
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,359
You know what?

240
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,640
You all should thank me.

241
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,840
Hadn't I found out

242
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,039
that Tang Xin has the pheromone

243
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,679
that's irresistible

244
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,280
to our captain,

245
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,640
and helped him solve

246
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,359
the problem of pheromone

247
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,520
round the clock,

248
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,039
they wouldn't

249
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,559
have lived together

250
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,719
and even come

251
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:54,239
to this far.

252
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,440
So I should thank you

253
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,200
on their behalf, huh?

254
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,239
Of course.

255
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,280
Have you ever heard of pheromone?

256
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,599
What's that?

257
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,599
I read in a book

258
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,760
that when a male animal smells

259
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,640
the pheromone of a female,

260
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,640
the male would be

261
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,559
attracted to the female.

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,599
Animal?

263
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,200
It's like
how nepeta cataria can affect cats.

264
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,039
It's addictive

265
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,520
and irresistible to them.

266
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:35,760
What?

267
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,559
I think I'm a little addicted to you.

268
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,719
Turns out he wants to be with me

269
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,919
because of pheromone.

270
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,400
What's the matter with you?

271
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Tang Xin, come here.

272
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,559
- Tang Xin.
- What's with her?

273
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:02,320
I think you should tell Mr. Zhou

274
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,960
what Ai

275
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,880
did to you.

276
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,520
Obviously

277
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,919
this Ai is quite ambitious.

278
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,400
She's just a nobody,

279
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,119
and she already made a fake video
to set you up.

280
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,000
Who knows what she'd do

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,159
in the future?

282
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:13,320
That's right, Xin.

283
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,799
You should be more careful.

284
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,359
You can't rely

285
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:16,840
on Qingyuan's rescue every time.

286
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,799
(Non-bitter Lemon)
(I'm her boyfriend.)

287
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,039
Mr. Zhou.

288
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:28,640
Tang Xin.

289
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,640
Please come in.

290
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:31,159
The leaders have seen

291
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,280
the unedited video.

292
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,119
You can come back to work tomorrow.

293
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,719
Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

294
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:36,520
Have a seat.

295
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,679
I'm happy for you.

296
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,039
Very nice.

297
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,919
Not only did you find

298
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,280
the unedited video,

299
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,960
but you also made

300
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,719
our Rui Live even more popular now.

301
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,440
The number of viewers

302
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,880
has reached a new record

303
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:56,960
this morning.

304
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,479
And Du Lingfeng's sponsorship

305
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,479
also helped a lot.

306
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,479
Your relationship with Shen Qingyuan

307
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,840
is such a blessing to us.

308
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,799
Killing three birds with one stone.
How wonderful!

309
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,760
Actually, about this thing…

310
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,719
It's alright. Say no more.

311
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:09,359
I understand.

312
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,359
Listen,

313
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,400
personally,

314
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,840
I have no problem with you dating him,

315
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
and I will not intervene whatsoever.

316
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:20,080
But from the work's

317
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,960
point of view,

318
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,039
I really hope you won't

319
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,239
break up with him.

320
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,080
We'll have a long-term cooperation

321
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,640
with the Shooting Team.

322
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,080
If you break up with him,

323
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,320
how are we supposed to work with them?

324
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,960
So, I need you to be mindful.

325
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,440
I… I'll try my best.

326
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,919
What do you mean try your best?

327
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,760
Just be serious in this relationship.

328
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,280
Don't think about breaking up. Come on.

329
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,280
I've checked

330
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,359
the shooting team's schedule.

331
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,039
On October 28,

332
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,880
they'll check in
for the winter training.

333
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,520
And the training will start

334
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,039
on November 10.

335
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
Go home and get prepared.

336
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,320
I want you to report this event.

337
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,239
And I hope

338
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,559
you can take some time

339
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,760
to train Ai.

340
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,919
Her competence is so-so,

341
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,280
but she's good at playing cute.

342
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,760
What's wrong?

343
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,760
Mr. Zhou.

344
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,359
In fact, Ai…

345
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,599
Yeah. I know what you mean.

346
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,559
Ai's capability

347
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,679
is still quite limited.

348
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,320
- But you can teach her.
- Mr. Zhou.

349
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,679
Ai, good timing.

350
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,479
We were just talking about you.

351
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:27,960
Come here.

352
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,799
Good.

353
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,799
I'm here to give you my leave notice.

354
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,760
Hasn't she already told you?

355
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:34,919
Yes, I asked someone

356
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,000
to make those fake videos,

357
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:37,200
but no one wants

358
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,679
to be a nobody forever

359
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,719
in a workplace.

360
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,520
She's your right hand

361
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,679
and Shen Qingyuan's girlfriend.

362
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,039
I admit that I lost.

363
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,320
What…

364
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:47,239
What are you talking about?

365
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,320
You haven't told him yet?

366
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,040
(Qianyang 26)

367
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,359
So Ai just resigned like that?

368
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,000
She deserved it.

369
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,520
She felt guilty

370
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,800
and she was afraid
that she'd be haunted.

371
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,400
Haunted?

372
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,359
My sister isn't a ghost, okay?

373
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,920
Alright, I'll go home now.

374
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,160
I'll come to work tomorrow morning.

375
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,839
Okay.

376
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,719
Bye-bye.

377
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,400
Xin, don't forget

378
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,359
to reply to Qingyuan.

379
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,640
Remember.

380
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,199
Ai,

381
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:28,920
you are finally gone!

382
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,880
Hi, Bluebean.

383
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,880
I'll take good care of you.

384
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,119
Hope you'll grow faster.

385
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,000
Even if you turn

386
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,359
into an elf one day

387
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,119
and leave me,

388
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,079
as long as you can remember me,

389
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,640
I'll be fine.

390
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,239
One bite is refreshing,

391
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,800
and two bites can relieve all stress.

392
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,199
When I finish the spicy
and sour rice noodles,

393
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,040
I'll clean the house

394
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,880
and make everything as fresh as new.

395
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,359
You are back?

396
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,040
Are you okay?

397
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,239
I'm fine.

398
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,880
The house is too messy.

399
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,119
I'll clean it up.

400
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,280
Let me help you.

401
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,239
No. You don't have to.

402
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,479
You should at least
finish your noodles first

403
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,839
before starting to clean up.

404
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,079
It's just too messy.

405
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,959
I want to clean it up first.

406
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:42,719
Tang Xin…

407
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,040
Go take a rest.

408
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:19,839
It's clean.

409
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,520
Why did you do that?

410
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:26,640
I…

411
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,439
I was just cleaning.

412
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
I mean why you didn't

413
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,319
respond to my love.

414
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,359
Why are you avoiding me?

415
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,000
It's okay. I'm fine.

416
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,280
I can walk myself.

417
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,520
Dr. Ding.

418
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,040
Sorry to bother you.

419
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,880
I want to have a chat.

420
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,599
Do you know

421
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,079
that Shen Qingyuan
confessed his love to me?

422
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:22,040
It's not a psychologist's job

423
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,760
to give you dating advice.

424
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,119
I'm sorry.

425
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,359
I…

426
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,520
I was kidding.

427
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,439
I like a line

428
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:30,079
said by Fellini,

429
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,199
"The truth is always obscure,

430
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,439
why the lie is always easy to tell."

431
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,520
I think this line

432
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,359
is perfect to describe affection.

433
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,640
Tang Xin.

434
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,479
Do you like him?

435
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:42,959
You should

436
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,319
ask yourself

437
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,439
if you want to accept his love.

438
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,040
To be honest,

439
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,760
I really like him.

440
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:53,719
See?

441
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,119
You've known the answer already.

442
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:56,560
But

443
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
can I accept his love?

444
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,359
After all, he hasn't

445
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,719
regained his memory yet.

446
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:04,199
I don't know

447
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,560
if he really likes me,

448
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,439
or he just wants

449
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,640
to solve the problem of pheromone.

450
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:08,959
Moreover,

451
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,280
I still haven't overcome

452
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
my own problem.

453
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,439
I don't want to hold him back.

454
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:19,119
After all, his career
is more important to him.

455
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,160
You shouldn't think that way.

456
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,160
It only shows

457
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,520
that you lack confidence
in your relationship.

458
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,760
Don't you remember

459
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,560
what I told you before?

460
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,560
Go with the flow.

461
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,640
It's so hard to go with the flow.

462
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:01,839
(Captain,)

463
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,359
(you were so cool today)

464
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,079
(when you confessed your love
to Miss Tang.)

465
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,479
(But she didn't respond.)

466
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:15,719
(You need me)

467
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:16,640
(to explain it to you, right?)

468
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,240
(Jiang Yitian retrieved a message)

469
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,719
(Wrong message.)

470
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,400
(I was going to say she's a girl,)

471
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,560
(and she gets shy easily.)

472
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,599
(You can ask her)

473
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,439
(and find out yourself.)

474
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,479
(I did.)

475
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,560
(What?
And she still didn't say anything?)

476
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,880
(Nothing.)

477
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,760
(Could it be that she doesn't like you?)

478
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,760
(I don't know.)

479
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,479
(Captain, with all due respect,)

480
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,160
(she comes to our training hall
every day.)

481
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,719
(How could you not notice)

482
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:12,800
(the details?)

483
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,439
(Speaking of Miss Tang,)

484
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:17,719
(she doesn't look like someone)

485
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:19,079
(who knows how to say no.)

486
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,040
(Maybe)

487
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:23,000
(she'd feel bad if she turned you down.)

488
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:25,439
(Captain,)

489
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
(may I ask)

490
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:27,520
(if Miss Tang)

491
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,479
(doesn't like you,)

492
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:29,719
(what would you do?)

493
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,040
(Hypothetically, of course.)

494
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:43,640
(Captain,)

495
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,880
(I think you should)

496
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,239
(find some ways to test
if she likes you.)

497
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,119
(If you can't do it,)

498
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,359
(I can help you)

499
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,119
(to find out.)

500
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,760
(But how?)

501
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:58,920
(I'm her boyfriend.)

502
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,400
(Non-bitter Lemon)

503
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,439
Young people nowadays

504
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,160
always act on impulse.

505
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:16,720
(Non-bitter Lemon)
(Yeah!)

506
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,080
(Ding Fang)

507
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,920
(Hubby)

508
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,079
It's me.

509
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:57,599
I apologize

510
00:25:58,839 --> 00:25:59,599
for what I did.

511
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:01,520
Why do you apologize?

512
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,719
I…

513
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,760
Wasn't I the one who hurt someone

514
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,400
who cared about me

515
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,040
with harsh words?

516
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,560
Are you okay?

517
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,839
You burnt your tongue?

518
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,680
But my hearing is fine.

519
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,599
You can start bragging

520
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,800
about your recent success now.

521
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,439
Ding Fang.

522
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,280
Can we

523
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,400
drop that topic?

524
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,479
Then what else is there

525
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,839
left for us to talk about?

526
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,880
There… There sure is.

527
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,959
For instance?

528
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,800
Tang Xin and Shen Qingyuan.

529
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,800
Last time you asked me

530
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,280
to find an apartment for Tang Xin

531
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,839
so that the two of them

532
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,800
can live together, right?

533
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,200
(Non-bitter Lemon)

534
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,680
Young people nowadays
always act on impulse.

535
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,640
What did you say?

536
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:54,839
Nothing.

537
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,880
We are…

538
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,959
Gosh.

539
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,599
Since when did we become like this?

540
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,479
I've never changed, Zhou Zuguang.

541
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
You are the one who changed.

542
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:07,839
Okay.

543
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,040
It's my fault then.

544
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:26,880
Come on.

545
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,640
Let's have a toast.

546
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,400
To Captain Shen and Xiaoci!

547
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,760
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

548
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,800
Mr. Du.

549
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,119
Our players can't drink wine.

550
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,319
Please drink some water

551
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,119
instead of wine

552
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:36,880
to celebrate with us.

553
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,680
They are still practicing.

554
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,520
Are we celebrating

555
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,920
behind their back here?

556
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,719
This is just a small ceremony
before meal.

557
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,959
They don't have to be here.

558
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:45,560
They don't even have

559
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,280
to join us for the meal.

560
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,560
Mr. Du,

561
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,920
are you and Xiaoci…

562
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,079
Coach.

563
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,839
Captain Shen and Xiaoci

564
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
completely defeated

565
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,479
the Southeast Shooting Team yesterday.

566
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,479
Don't you think?

567
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,319
That's true.

568
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,640
Then can we

569
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,400
have a small

570
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,439
celebration or something?

571
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,119
That's right.

572
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:10,439
You have a strict diet to follow.

573
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,160
I don't think it's a good idea.

574
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,239
We can take care of it ourselves.

575
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,359
We'll throw a BBQ party.

576
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,640
I've asked for some meat that passed

577
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,319
quarantine inspection from the canteen.

578
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:18,359
And I promise

579
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,199
we won't violate any rules.

580
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,280
Not even a little bit.

581
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,160
Right?

582
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,040
We won't violate any rules.

583
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,439
Yes.

584
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,199
We promise we won't.

585
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:23,920
We won't.

586
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:24,920
We won't.

587
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,239
Just this once.

588
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:27,959
You bet.

589
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,239
Thank you, Coach!

590
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:31,199
Thanks, Coach!

591
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,040
This is your training plan.

592
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,119
Give it to Captain Shen.

593
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,359
Consider it done.

594
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,400
Thank you, Coach!

595
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,199
- Thank you, Coach!
- Thank you, Coach!

596
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,079
- Bye, Coach!
- Bye, Coach!

597
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,239
Done!

598
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,119
Good job, Jiang Yitian.

599
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,040
Captain Shen.

600
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,400
Miss Tang.

601
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,880
What brought you here

602
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,760
so early today?

603
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:51,680
- Miss Tang.
- Jiang Yitian.

604
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,319
Miss Tang.

605
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,239
When are you going

606
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:56,119
to accept our captain's love?

607
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,520
Miss Tang, I've told your fortune.

608
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,880
You'll be very lucky in love today.

609
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,400
Is it because our Captain Shen…

610
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,439
What are you talking about?

611
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,439
Miss Tang,

612
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,319
you don't have

613
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,040
to give us a specific time.

614
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:05,719
A rough time

615
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:06,640
would be fine.

616
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,520
Miss Tang,

617
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,439
do you like

618
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,119
our Captain Shen?

619
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:09,920
Our Captain Shen is…

620
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,079
Are you kidding?

621
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:11,839
Of course, she does.

622
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,560
Right, Miss Tang?

623
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,640
I… I'll go have lunch now.

624
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,239
I'll go with you.

625
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,239
Miss Tang.

626
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,160
- Miss Tang.
- Captain.

627
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,040
Your brochure.

628
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,599
Fang,

629
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,839
Mom had another heart attack.

630
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,959
What?

631
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,400
Another heart attack?

632
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,119
Yes. She's just out of danger.

633
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,199
The doctor said

634
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:31,479
her condition isn't stable.

635
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,160
Besides, she's been quite emotional

636
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,800
and demanding to see you

637
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,640
and my brother-in-law.

638
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,400
Okay, I see.

639
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,359
I'll be back as soon as possible.

640
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,359
Mr. Zhou, these need your signature.

641
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,000
Okay.

642
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:03,280
But I only have time
the day after tomorrow.

643
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,119
You don't want

644
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,239
to go back with me, do you?

645
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,800
It's not like that.

646
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,479
I'm just caught up with work.

647
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,560
Okay.

648
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:11,599
I…

649
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,719
But I'm sure my mom hopes

650
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,319
that we can go back together.

651
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,319
If you are willing to wait,

652
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,400
we can drive back together.

653
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,599
We leave in the morning

654
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,599
the day after tomorrow, okay?

655
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,079
Okay.

656
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,599
But I can only stay
for a couple of days.

657
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,640
Zhou Zuguang,

658
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:31,920
you don't have to explain

659
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,000
your schedule to me!

660
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:40,680
Mr. Zhou,

661
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,160
please review this.

662
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,319
Tang Xin.

663
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:52,599
What's the matter?

664
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,199
I'm not good for you, right?

665
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,000
I affected your performance.

666
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Why did you say that?

667
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,199
You asked me

668
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,560
to leave

669
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,280
during the Shooting Championship.

670
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,640
You did affect me back then.

671
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,000
But it's different now.

672
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,280
I'd get distracted

673
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,160
when you are not around.

674
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:19,959
But before you wouldn't…

675
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,959
I'll go to my office now.

676
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Please go back

677
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,079
for your training.

678
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,239
Don't forget the BBQ party.

679
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,760
(Qianyang 26)

680
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,520
Tang Xin.

681
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,719
Why haven't you

682
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:54,800
accepted Shen Qingyuan's love yet?

683
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,239
He confessed his love to you
during livestream.

684
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,640
What are you waiting for?

685
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,800
Don't tell me

686
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,239
you still can't forget about that scum.

687
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,640
I just need more time to think about it.

688
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,719
Then are you going

689
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:13,000
to keep him waiting like this?

690
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,520
