35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,599
Ai,

36
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,239
please get off the car.

37
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,160
But why?

38
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,160
Tang Xin is going to
the glee feast with me.

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,959
I know you two

40
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,839
don't quite get along.

41
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,239
You'd better not see each other.

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,319
Let me get you a cab.

43
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:50,400
Fine then.

44
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:52,319
Remember to make it up to me.

45
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,000
Sure.

46
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,839
All right, the cab will be here soon.

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,879
Come on.

48
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,479
Mr. Xu.

49
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:33,839
Tang Xin.

50
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,160
He treats her as if she were a big name.

51
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,800
Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Xu.

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,399
You're being too polite.

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,800
Let's go. Get in the car.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,399
Come on.

55
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,199
Get in.

56
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,880
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

57
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:47,720
All right.

58
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,880
Fasten your seat belt.

59
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,800
(Lucky)

60
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,759
What do you want this time?

61
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,919
What's your name again?

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,520
Yang Zhou.

63
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,199
What do you want?

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,600
Blind faith won't do any good

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,880
to your performance.

66
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,839
This isn't blind faith.

67
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,639
This is faith.

68
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,919
All right, whatever.

69
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,639
Go ahead.

70
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,639
Shoot with your faith.

71
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,399
Come on.

72
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:54,839
See?

73
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,360
Far from the bull's-eye.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,559
Yang Fan...

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,520
My name is Yang Zhou.

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,479
That's a weird name.

77
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,199
Anyway, Mr. Yang,

78
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,759
your faith thing

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,880
doesn't seem to work.

80
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,639
It won't help you.

81
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,040
Captain.

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,399
Don't bother with his nonsense.

83
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,119
Many athletes

84
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,440
have their own mascots,

85
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,880
and when a game is near,

86
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,679
many would ask for a good omen.

87
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,040
Go back to your training.

88
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,640
(Lucky)

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,399
It actually can bring me luck.

90
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,880
(Bay Hotel)

91
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:33,839
Come on, guys.

92
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,720
A toast.

93
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,559
Come on.

94
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,320
Bottoms up.

95
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,119
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

96
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:40,959
My glass is empty now.

97
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,679
Let's see whose isn't.

98
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,920
Just dig in.

99
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,600
Tang Xin,

100
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,399
this isn't an interview.

101
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,119
Don't be nervous.

102
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,079
Relax.

103
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,000
You know what?

104
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,239
Let me introduce you to them

105
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,239
so that you'll feel at ease.

106
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,839
All right, let me introduce you.

107
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,119
Fill the glass.

108
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,239
Guys,

109
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,359
she is Tang Xin from Rui Live.

110
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,440
I once told you about her.

111
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,920
She now has a considerable reputation.

112
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,920
Nice to meet you all.

113
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,760
Aren't you an adult?

114
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,839
How can an adult drink juice?

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,320
Let me fill Ms. Tang's glass
with liquor.

116
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,799
Why don't you take turns
toasting with everyone here?

117
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,279
Wait, I...

118
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,359
I don't drink.

119
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,959
Don't give her a hard time.

120
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,040
We're just here to talk business,

121
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,440
aren't we?

122
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,359
It doesn't matter what you drink,

123
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,279
as long as you show your sincerity.

124
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,200
Right?

125
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,359
Right.

126
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,359
Zhang,

127
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,600
be easy

128
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,239
on her.

129
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't worry.

130
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,920
No one will force you to drink.

131
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,040
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

132
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,959
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

133
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,920
I'd like to propose a toast.

134
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:34,959
Bottoms up, all right?

135
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,640
Bottoms up.

136
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,920
- Sure.
- Bottoms up.

137
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,959
Tang Xin, sit.

138
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Eat more, guys.

139
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,440
Okay, that's all for today.

140
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,239
It's only adaptive training tonight.

141
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,720
Later the intensity will be greater.

142
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,600
We had no night training at school.

143
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,559
It's so tiring here.

144
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,320
So, what's your average score?

145
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,920
Let me see.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,880
No, no, Captain.

147
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,519
This is just my first night training.

148
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,880
I need time to get used to it.

149
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,000
There's not much time

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,679
for you.

151
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,440
We'll have all forms of assessment soon.

152
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,200
Why don't I see Miss Tang here?

153
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,440
Isn't she supposed to be with our team?

154
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:25,880
You...

155
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,679
You'd better care more about your score

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,480
instead of others' business.

157
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,119
I know, Captain.

158
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:30,799
Rest assured.

159
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,040
Still working?

160
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Have you eaten?

161
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,399
Captain,

162
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,239
see you.

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,799
Are you in the dorm?

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,799
But we're in a closed base.

177
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,359
No athlete is allowed to go out at will.

178
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,359
No way...

179
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,320
Miss Tang.

180
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,159
Drink more with me.

181
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,320
No. It's getting late.

182
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,359
I gotta leave.

183
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,840
Tang Xin.

184
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:54,479
Sit back.

185
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,080
Stay a little longer.

186
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,280
The night shift is tiring, isn't it?

187
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,119
Who's that?

188
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,280
Wang,

189
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,520
drive Zhang home.

190
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,479
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Hurry. Come on.

191
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,280
I can give you a ride.

192
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,080
Come on, let's go.

193
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,640
Hurry up.

194
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,280
Come on.

195
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,039
Excuse me, Mr. Xu.

196
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,000
It's getting late.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,039
I gotta go.

198
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,599
Tang Xin.

199
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,840
Tang Xin.

200
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,679
Why in such a hurry?

201
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,440
Tang Xin. Don't go for now.

202
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,520
Stay a little longer.

203
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,039
No!

204
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,679
Stay a little longer, Tang Xin.

205
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:57,599
Tang Xin.

206
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,440
No, Mr. Xu!

207
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:00,000
Tang Xin, I'll drive you home later.

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,719
- Mr. Xu!
- Tang Xin.

209
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,679
Tang Xin, I'm fond of you.

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,679
That Xu,

211
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,479
I'm telling you,

212
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,640
he just likes young girls.

213
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,119
Let's drink more!

214
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,320
Mr. Xu, let go of me!

215
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,880
Mr. Xu!

216
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,559
Tang Xin.

217
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,000
Mr. Xu!

218
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,679
- Tang Xin.
- Let go of me!

219
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,400
Tang Xin, I really like you.

220
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:25,039
Let's go.

221
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,559
Are you all right?

222
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:03,799
All right?

223
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,200
Take it.

224
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,479
Shen Qingyuan.

225
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,599
Wait for me, Shen Qingyuan.

226
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,400
What is it?

227
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,919
I sprained my ankle.

228
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,000
You sprained your ankle?

229
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,479
Does it hurt here?

230
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes.

231
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,599
Liar.

232
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,679
You didn't sprain it at all.

233
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,760
Shen Qingyuan.

234
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,919
Mr. Xu.

235
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,239
What happened to you?

236
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,200
Don't touch it.

237
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:14,880
Don't.

238
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,239
Let me get you some ointment.

239
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,760
The pharmacy is just nearby.

240
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,960
Can't you walk there to buy it?

241
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,119
Easy.

242
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,320
The ointment will be delivered soon.

243
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,719
Why don't you tell me

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
about the glee feast,

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and Tang Xin...?

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,280
That stupid girl...

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,239
Who does she think she is?

248
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,960
She beat you up like this?

249
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,640
I'm not that weak

250
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,080
to be beaten up by a little girl.

251
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,280
Then who did?

252
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,919
Shen Qing...!

253
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,640
I knew it!

254
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,080
She and the people around her

255
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
are all the same bad!

256
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,559
Mr. Xu, you might want to

257
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,159
keep your distance from her.

258
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,679
Aren't you the one who told me

259
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,359
that she was easy to get?

260
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,000
Otherwise, I…

261
00:12:58,359 --> 00:12:59,599
I wouldn't have been like this.

262
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,039
Don't be upset, Mr. Xu.

263
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,239
Look,

264
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,640
Rui Live and the TV station are now

265
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,599
in cooperation.

266
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,559
How about taking the winter training
as a chance

267
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
to teach them a lesson?

268
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Teach them a lesson?

269
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,239
Seriously?

270
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,559
I'm not shameless!

271
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,280
As long as they keep this between them,

272
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,520
I can pretend nothing happened.

273
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,239
I have to make a careful plan on this.

274
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,599
All right, make a careful plan then.

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,840
Does it still hurt?

276
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,000
I can give you a massage.

277
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,679
Come. Let me give you a massage

278
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,400
and cool you down.

279
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,000
I apologize for lying just now,

280
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:45,000
but...

281
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,440
Could you walk a little slower?

282
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,479
Let's go back together.

283
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,359
I left something behind.

284
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,039
You still wanna go back?

285
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,840
How many times have I told you

286
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,000
to stay away from that scum?

287
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,000
Why can't you just

288
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,919
listen to me?

289
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,880
Fine!

290
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,679
I did wrong!

291
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,520
But I didn't mean to.

292
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,520
I went to the feast
on behalf of Rui Live.

293
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,000
How could I have thought
it would end up like this?

294
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,719
Do you have to be so harsh on me?

295
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,119
Why?

296
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,400
Why is it that other boyfriends

297
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,840
always humor their girlfriends

298
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,159
while it's upside down

299
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,000
when it comes to me?

300
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:22,919
It's not fair!

301
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,880
Why am I so pitiful?

302
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,880
It's not that you're pitiful.

303
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,520
It's just that you're heartless!

304
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:29,760
I'm not!

305
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,239
I have possessiveness, okay?

306
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,200
Aren't you

307
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,799
embarrassed

308
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,880
to say that?

309
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,200
Tang Xin,

310
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,359
do you know that

311
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:45,039
I don't know how to be good to you?

312
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,400
I don't want you to get hurt

313
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
or suffer wrong,

314
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
but I just can't help it.

315
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,320
I just can't help giving all my care

316
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,359
to you!

317
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,760
Shen Qingyuan,

318
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,039
just because I didn't dine with you

319
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:01,039
doesn't mean I don't care about you.

320
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
I wanted to finish making the gift

321
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,679
and then give it to you,

322
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,640
but I didn't expect

323
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,880
Mr. Zhou would get me involved

324
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
in that feast all of a sudden.

325
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:09,880
I...

326
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,239
A gift?

327
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,000
It's a surprise.

328
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,440
Just pretend I didn't tell you that.

329
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's go.

330
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,719
Let's get a cab.

331
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,640
No.

332
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,760
I have to go back to get my paper bag.

333
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,719
If there's nothing important in the bag,

334
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,520
don't go back.

335
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,000
Very important.

336
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,000
The...

337
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
The gift you made for me?

338
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:37,239
Let's go.

339
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,000
I can't leave behind the thing you made

340
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,239
with your own hands.

341
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,440
All right. I have arrived.

342
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,520
You can't see it now.

343
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,880
Be good.

344
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,520
Tang Xin. Tang Xin!

345
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,280
Tang Xin,

346
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,239
don't bother yourself
with the bad memory.

347
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,719
I'll have to deliver it to the store.

348
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,119
There's still a lot to do.

349
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,400
Come on!

350
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:29,479
Ma'am,

351
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:30,800
please get me two cups of milk...

352
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:31,319
Sure.

353
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,239
Three eggs,

354
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,479
and two sandwiches.

355
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,560
Oh,

356
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,880
and two sausages.

357
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,560
Okay.

358
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,040
Thank you.

359
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,959
Miss, who did you get up so early

360
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,640
to bring breakfast?

361
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,560
I have the same responsibility as you,

362
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,920
and that is to look after the athletes.

363
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,199
Shen Qingyuan.

364
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,479
Shen Qingyuan, are you awake?

365
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,719
I brought you breakfast.

366
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:08,880
Has he gone out already?

367
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:12,239
How come?

368
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,319
He should be in the room at this time.

369
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:31,479
Xin.

370
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:32,319
Morning, Miss Tang.

371
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:33,719
Have you forgotten
she's Captain's girlfriend?

372
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:34,560
Just call her by her first name.

373
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,319
- Xin.
- Morning, Xin.

374
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,359
Did you see your captain?

375
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,599
Captain hasn't come back yet?

376
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:43,280
What?

377
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,319
(The group was renamed "Running Group".)
When did Captain rename the group chat

378
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,959
"Running Group"?

379
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,880
Didn't he get back late

380
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,040
last night?

381
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,719
But he still had the energy
to rename the group chat.

382
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,359
I almost forgot.

383
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:53,920
Miss Tang,

384
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:54,920
did Captain

385
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,239
go to see you last night?

386
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,680
To tell you the truth,

387
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,479
if the manager

388
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,959
and the Coach find out

389
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,400
that he left this closed base,

390
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,719
he would be punished.

391
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,199
If Captain hasn't come back yet,

392
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:09,959
could it be...?

393
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,439
- Xin...
- Xin.

394
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,479
Where's she going?

395
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,040
I have no idea.

396
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,319
Tang Xin.

397
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,239
Coach.

398
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,040
Shen Qingyuan...

399
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,040
What's about him?

400
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,119
Nothing really.

401
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,760
I'm just here to ask you,

402
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,359
did he make it through

403
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,560
his first day of the winter training?

404
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,280
It was just the first day.

405
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,839
No need to worry about him.

406
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,880
I worry that I might
affect his performance.

407
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,560
Not at all.

408
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,680
When you were
in the shooting center yesterday,

409
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,560
Shen's average score

410
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,160
was even 0.1 higher than usual.

411
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,280
Would you like to see

412
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,119
yesterday's score stats?

413
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,000
No need, Coach.

414
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,920
I should probably get back to work.

415
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,560
Okay.

416
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,760
Oh, yeah,

417
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,199
she actually gave me inspiration

418
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,719
for the training cycle plan.

419
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:25,839
Good.

420
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,079
Looks like

421
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,839
he sneaked out last night

422
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,079
without being noticed.

423
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,920
Why are you here?

424
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,079
Why are you here?

425
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,280
Of course, I'm here to find you.

426
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,479
Shen Qingyuan,

427
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,839
thank you for last night.

428
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,280
Coach didn't notice, did he?

429
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:30,760
That's a relief.

430
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,000
Our sharpshooter

431
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,359
will go on working hard today, right?

432
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,680
Are you gonna pretend that

433
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,599
what happened last night didn't happen?

434
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,800
Let it go.

435
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,959
It's okay. It's all in the past.

436
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm with you right now,

437
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,040
which means

438
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,479
the future is the brightest,

439
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,880
so I don't want to look back.

440
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,760
Look,

441
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,400
doesn't it look like a bull's-eye?

442
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,680
Think about it,

443
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:16,959
in front of you,

444
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,599
there are so many

445
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,119
provincial,

446
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,520
national

447
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:22,839
and world-level

448
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:24,439
gold medals

449
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,239
waiting for you.

450
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,239
And once the winter is over,

451
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,839
you'll have to go all out

452
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,280
to qualify for the Olympics.

453
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,719
There are so many things

454
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,280
worth looking forward to in the future.
How wonderful!

455
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,719
Wonderful indeed.

456
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,520
However, no matter how promising
the road ahead is,

457
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,479
we have to kick the obstacle
out of the way first.

458
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,520
That guy's name is Xu Dian, right?

459
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,160
Has he sent you

460
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,040
harassing messages?

461
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,599
Or is there anything else

462
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,160
that can be used as evidence?

463
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:09,959
Or at least

464
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,800
we can report him

465
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,719
publicly online.

466
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,760
Shen Qingyuan.

467
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,479
Forget about it.
Don't take any further action.

468
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,479
Tang Xin,

469
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,680
I won't let him get away with this.

470
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,439
Shen Qingyuan,

471
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,000
right after the winter training,

472
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,239
you'll have to go all out

473
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:27,160
to prepare for the competition.

474
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,760
In case you miss the Olympics,

475
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,359
you'll have to wait another four years.

476
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,560
We have no time or energy

477
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
to spend on him.

478
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,280
I promise

479
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,680
not to let my training suffer.

480
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,959
So how are you going to deal with him?

481
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:38,920
He is a gold anchor

482
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,479
and has been in the media industry
for decades.

483
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,680
Are you sure you'll win over him
on this?

484
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,839
Almost impossible!

485
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,319
Yet he could easily

486
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
ruin our reputation.

487
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,800
But I don't care about public opinion.

488
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,599
But can you think about it for me?

489
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:49,920
I am.

490
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,839
I can't stand him hurting you.

491
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,040
No,

492
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,760
things are not what you think.

493
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,199
You can easily say that

494
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,359
you don't care about public opinion,

495
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,239
but I'm a livestreamer

496
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,439
who works for a company.

497
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,040
Even if you and I don't care,

498
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,000
what about the company?

499
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,119
You can't just think about things

500
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,760
from a personal perspective,

501
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,680
Shen Qingyuan.

502
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:11,520
Tang Xin,

503
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,040
don't be afraid.

504
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,839
I told you

505
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:14,800
I would protect you.

506
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,640
Shen Qingyuan...

507
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,520
Say no more.

508
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,359
Don't worry.

509
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,599
Don't you think

510
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,719
Captain and Miss Tang

511
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:49,560
are a little abnormal?

512
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,280
In the past, Miss Tang

513
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,119
walked behind Captain,

514
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
but today Captain

515
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,760
walked behind Miss Tang.

516
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,680
That's not the point.

517
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,239
The point is

518
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:00,400
the atmosphere between them
is a little abnormal.

519
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,719
Are they in a cold war?

520
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,760
Maybe.

521
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:08,959
See those two losers?

522
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:10,599
Yesterday, I specially

523
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,520
asked about

524
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,920
that buttoned-up guy's

525
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,000
name.

526
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:16,479
You know what?

527
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,239
I forgot it soon after.

528
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,479
Maybe he's really a

529
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,040
person of no name.

530
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,719
Anyway, Captain,

531
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,520
have you found the countermeasure?

532
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,400
Yeah, Captain,

533
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:33,359
if you have,

534
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,359
use it asap.

535
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:35,479
Look,

536
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,760
our coach looks

537
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,880
as he were

538
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,599
their coach's assistant.

539
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,760
Just wait and see.

540
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,719
- Coach.
- Coach!

541
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:44,959
Coach.

542
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,839
- Morning, Coach.
- Good morning, Coach.

543
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:48,719
Come on.

544
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,800
All line up.

545
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,079
Southeast Team members,

546
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:51,560
assemble!

547
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,719
In this winter training, Coach Zhang

548
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,400
is mainly responsible
for improving your performance.

549
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:07,760
Coach Zhang,

550
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,560
your turn.

551
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,359
In this training cycle,

552
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,400
we basically focus on preparation

553
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,800
through regular training,

554
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,359
yet I hope all of you

555
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,040
can further improve your

556
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,920
competitive ability
as well as training quality.

557
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,680
According to the routine,

558
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,079
next is

559
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,880
the assessment period.

560
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:23,959
Coach.

561
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,199
Is the assessment this time

562
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,599
still only about mock contests

563
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:28,000
just like before?

564
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:29,359
Or what?

565
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,760
Have you ever thought about
the downside?

566
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,239
If our assessment

567
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,800
is always about mock contests

568
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,680
and single matches,

569
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:41,680
then the beneficiaries

570
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,920
will always just be

571
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,119
the ones who win.

572
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:45,319
And the others

573
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,040
will only be less and less motivated,

574
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
which makes a vicious circle.

575
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,479
Well...

576
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:51,560
Zhou Yue!

577
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:52,880
Coach Liu,

578
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,800
with my good performance,
I don't really care.

579
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:55,839
But I care about

580
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,880
my teammates.

581
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
I can't stand seeing them

582
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,520
play foil to the winners anymore.

583
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,959
When we talk about
rewards and punishments,

584
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,119
one thing is certain

585
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,760
that rewards make athletes
be more motivated

586
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
and work harder to go further,

587
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:08,439
while punishments
due to poor performance,

588
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,079
on the contrary, I guess.

589
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,359
What do you say?

590
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,479
So, what do you suggest?

591
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:17,959
Joint training.

592
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,000
Joint?

593
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:19,880
Yes.

594
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,640
For now, instead of contests,

595
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,319
we only have rankings.

596
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,760
Every day after training,

597
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:24,719
both our Southeast Team

598
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:25,719
and their Haiya Team

599
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,839
will separately tally up

600
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,119
its training results

601
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,199
which include the average score
for the entire team,

602
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,599
the total number of shots,

603
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,359
and

604
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,239
the top three with the highest scores.

605
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,479
Now that we are

606
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,640
here together in the winter training,

607
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,560
we should also make progress together.

608
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,560
Captain Zhou is right!

609
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,079
He's right!

610
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,319
You know what?

611
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,880
What Zhou just suggested

612
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,000
was quite reasonable.

613
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,439
How about this?

614
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:47,680
Starting today,

615
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,479
let's try what Zhou suggested

616
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,680
for a few days.

617
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,160
Okay?

618
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,719
- Okay!
- Okay!

619
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,359
What do you think he's planning?

620
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,920
I think what he suggested

621
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,880
was practical.

622
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,280
Excuse me, Coach.

623
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,680
Won't the men's and women's teams
keep separate statistics?

624
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,000
I almost forgot.

625
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,719
Separate, of course.

626
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,239
So that

627
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,280
the top athletes from both teams

628
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,400
can stand out.

629
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,160
Okay.

630
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,520
Where's Du?

631
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:14,800
Coach.

632
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,280
If you really want to know where he is,

633
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,520
I suggest you find out in the news.

634
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,680
Hi.

635
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:39,839
Boss Du.

636
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,760
Do you know what time it is?

637
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:43,839
Why are you still in bed?

638
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,760
Don't tell me
your winter training program

639
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:46,920
is sleeping.

640
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,000
Don't joke with me.

641
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,439
I'm just trying to be nice.

642
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,520
So, how's your bet

643
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,839
with your dad going?

644
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,119
It's not too late to surrender

645
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,239
and apologize to him.

646
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,599
No way.

647
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,920
I still have the chance.

648
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,280
You'll see.

649
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,119
Fine. Thumbs up for you.

650
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:03,599
Then get up and go to the training.

651
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,599
Or do you want to get beat

652
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,800
at shooting, too?

653
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,160
Fine.

654
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,760
Good for you.

655
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:11,000
Bye!

656
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,680
(Shi Xiaoci)

657
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,800
Xiaoci, are you training now?

658
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,440
(The message was sent but rejected.)

659
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,880
Any more questions?

660
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,000
- No.
- No.

661
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:43,800
Coach Zhang.

662
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,359
I have a question.

663
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,319
In that case, will all the members

664
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,719
of the winning teams get rewards?

665
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:51,920
Plan your feet on solid ground

666
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,119
before you want to fly in the sky.

667
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,040
Rewards?

668
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:54,839
That depends on

669
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,040
your performance.

670
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,000
Right?

671
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,760
If there're no more questions,

672
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,560
let's give what Zhou suggested

673
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,520
a try.

674
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,040
If all goes well,

675
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,800
we'll formally adopt
the new plan tomorrow.

676
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Any more questions?

677
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,040
- No.
- No.

678
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:09,760
Get started.

679
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,359
Some of you are already
thinking about rewards?

680
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,359
What's your problem with that?

681
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,800
Your team's success

682
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,160
depends almost entirely

683
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
on Shen Qingyuan.

684
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,680
If it weren't for him,

685
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:37,239
how would you be able to

686
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,199
compete with us on average?

687
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,040
Let's see at the game.

688
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,280
Aren't you Chen Hai

689
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,520
who determined the final result
of the qualifiers

690
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,040
for the National Championships

691
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,800
with your last shot alone?

692
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,839
What exactly do you mean?

693
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,439
Hai.

694
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,760
Don't fall into his trap.

695
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,680
Seriously, Shen Qingyuan?

696
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,839
Your teammates rely on your backup

697
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,239
even when chatting with others?

698
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,359
Aren't you guys

699
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:03,199
feeling oppressed?

700
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:03,959
Enough!

701
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:04,680
What do you want?

702
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:05,719
What?

703
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:06,439
- What?
- Jiang Yitian.

704
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:09,479
Let's go to training.

705
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:38,680
Captain.

706
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,719
Your strategy has worked.

707
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:43,680
From now on,

708
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,239
they'll be a laughing stock.

709
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,680
He's really unaffected by others.

710
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:26,640
Captain.

711
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,239
Coach.

712
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,040
Shen.

713
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:42,239
Follow me.

714
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,479
Don't worry.

715
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,199
I've got other strategies
to deal with him.

716
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,199
Tang Xin.

717
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,719
You're here to do the livestream, right?

718
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:23,560
After you left in a hurry last night,

719
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,040
I worried about you all night.

720
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:25,719
What if you had run into danger

721
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,120
on your way back?

722
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,040
No.

723
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,719
You saw that

724
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,120
I had company on my way back.

725
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,239
I know. It's Shen Qingyuan.

726
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:34,239
He was indeed impulsive last night.

727
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,399
But don't worry.

728
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,600
I won't give him a hard time.

729
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,360
He's just young

730
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,199
and impulsive.

731
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:40,239
And that's why I worried about

732
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,360
your safety.

733
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,640
(Lounge)

734
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,639
Coach,

735
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:53,600
what is it?

736
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:57,560
You left the base last night?

737
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,239
I...

738
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:02,520
Okay. No need to explain.

739
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,639
Someone called me

740
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,239
and told me to check

741
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,679
the surveillance footage.

742
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,360
I checked it.

743
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,439
It was really you.

744
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,719
You're good at climbing walls, huh?

745
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,679
Is that "someone"...?

746
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,080
Xu Dian?

747
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:16,040
Mr. Xu,

748
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:16,959
please don't

749
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,399
bring it up in the future.

750
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,919
And I won't go to a feast

751
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:20,719
like that again.

752
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,840
Look how serious you're being on this.

753
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,479
Don't take this minor matter

754
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,879
to heart.

755
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,719
After all, we'll be working together

756
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,719
all winter.

757
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:32,719
You mustn't

758
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,000
feel pressured.

759
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,560
I know it's him.

760
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,679
Actually, I don't care.

761
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,479
On this matter,

762
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:41,600
I can accept any punishments.

763
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Stop guessing widely.

764
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,639
Why would a decent anchor like him

765
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,679
tell on you?

766
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:46,879
Besides,

767
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:47,879
what's the point of knowing

768
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,719
who told on you?

769
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,560
Want revenge?

770
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,360
And then

771
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,399
make the same mistake again?

772
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,560
Did you go out

773
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,479
because of Tang Xin?

774
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,439
I'm not a fuddy-duddy,

775
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,040
and I'm not opposed to your dating.

776
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:00,199
But you have to

777
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,639
have a sense of priority.

778
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:03,399
I don't know what happened

779
00:36:03,399 --> 00:36:04,239
between you and Xu Dian,

780
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,399
but on this matter, first,

781
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,719
he never told on you.

782
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,239
Second,

783
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:09,679
it was him who informed me in advance

784
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,719
so that I could keep it secret

785
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,719
for you.

786
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,639
In fact, you should thank him.

787
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,239
Coach.

788
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:17,639
If there's nothing else,

789
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:19,239
I'm leaving.

790
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,080
Shen!

791
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,880
(Lounge)

792
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,719
That kid...

793
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:28,840
To be frank,

794
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,600
I don't like those feasts

795
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,560
either.

796
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,439
So crowded and so noisy.

797
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,120
When it's convenient for you,

798
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,959
I can tutor you in private.

799
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,159
But

800
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,399
don't let Shen Qingyuan know then.

801
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,000
Not to mention
that his training could be affected,

802
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,879
but what if he got punished?

803
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,000
It wouldn't be worth it.

804
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,000
Right?

805
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,040
Qingyuan,

806
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,399
what're you staring at?

807
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,199
What does that mean?

808
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,120
Let me see.

809
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,959
Your message was sent

810
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,360
but rejected.

811
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,239
Wait a sec.

812
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
She blacklisted you.

813
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,520
Then... How can I contact her?

814
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,080
Do you have her phone number?

815
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
You can just call her.

816
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,320
I don't.

817
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:25,239
Fine. Let me see what I can do.

818
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,760
(Milk Tea Lover
The message was sent but rejected.)

819
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,720
(Milk Tea Lover)

820
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,159
What's going on?

821
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,439
Qingyuan,

822
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,159
this "Milk Tea Lover"

823
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,399
is a girl, right?

824
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,159
No way to contact her?

825
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,520
I guess so.

826
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,840
Because you have to

827
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,560
wait until she

828
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,479
removes you from her blacklist.

829
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,719
Otherwise,

830
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,719
your message

831
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,800
will always be rejected

832
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,520
and can't be received by her.

833
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,719
Fine.

834
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,399
"Milk Tea Lover"?

835
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,120
What?

836
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,239
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

837
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,159
I gotta go.

838
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:06,719
Tang Xin!

839
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,600
Tang Xin!

840
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,679
Hold on, Shen Qingyuan!

841
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,239
Don't have a conflict with him here.

842
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:20,959
Oh, Shen,

843
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,399
I was about to reach you.

844
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:27,120
I already informed your coach

845
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,239
about your violation

846
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,439
and leaving the base yesterday,

847
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,360
and told him to keep it low-key.

848
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,600
That's none of your business.

849
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:37,040
Anyway,

850
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,159
no one would like to see

851
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,560
a young man's future ruined.

852
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:41,080
Only if you and I

853
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,159
keep it low-key,

854
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:43,679
no one will get hurt,

855
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,199
including Tang Xin.

856
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,399
I don't think you want to hear

857
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,840
rumors and slanders about her,

858
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,719
right?

859
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,080
What are you guys talking about?

860
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,479
Are you a ghost, kid?

861
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,000
All right. That's it.

862
00:38:59,520 --> 00:38:59,879
Tang Xin,

863
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,560
see you later.

864
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,520
Xin, Qingyuan,

865
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,919
what's wrong with him?

866
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,199
I need some rest.

867
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,600
Qingyuan,

868
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,760
has my sister

869
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,959
run into trouble?

870
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,800
Mr. Xu.

871
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,120
Can we have a talk?

872
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:49,679
Now I see,

873
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,479
it was you who told on him
ahead of me.

874
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:54,800
No wonder when I called Coach Zhang,

875
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,439
his reaction was not what I expected.

876
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:58,239
I had to change my plan

877
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,439
and put in a word for Shen Qingyuan.

878
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,560
Yeah, I told on him.

879
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:02,879
But Mr. Xu,

880
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,399
I don't remember you

881
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,919
hating Shen Qingyuan

882
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:06,719
so much.

883
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,479
Things are now different.

884
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:11,719
Good.

885
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,399
I like your attitude now.

886
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,399
So,

887
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:15,320
how do you think

888
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,760
I can help you

889
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,679
with it?

890
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,360
You're so young

891
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,159
yet have complicated ideas.

892
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,679
Not really.

893
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,479
Actually, I only have one simple idea.

894
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,320
All I can think about is the game,

895
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,719
but in the game,

896
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,760
I have to come up with ideas
to take out my opponent.

897
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:31,719
