=Episode 22=

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,120
Before we start,

36
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,400
I'd like to emphasize a few

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,199
"first time".

38
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,919
(Non-bitter Lemon)
This is the first time

39
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:41,080
the Mobilization Meeting
on Winter Training

40
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,639
of the provincial shooting team
is broadcast live

41
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:43,760
through the TV station.

42
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,959
It's also the first time

43
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,519
it's live-streamed in sync
through video websites.

44
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,839
The girl is doing well.

45
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,800
Her performance is steady.

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,080
hello,

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,160
welcome to the 2019 Mobilization Meeting

49
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,360
on Winter Training

50
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,800
of the Southeast Sports Bureau.

51
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,839
First, let's welcome

52
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,360
Director Wang of the Sports Bureau

53
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,279
to deliver a speech.

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,800
(Southeast Sports Bureau
Winter Training Mobilization Meeting 2019)

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,559
During the cycle training of 2018,

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,479
I want to praise

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,279
our athletes specifically.

58
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,960
The veterans have returned to form.

59
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,080
Among the new athletes,

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,960
a number of vanguards

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,360
have emerged.

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,720
(Non-bitter Lemon)

63
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,919
When it's

64
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,559
the athletes' turn to take the stage?

65
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,199
Be patient, Mr. Zhou.

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,440
They're more anxious than you.

67
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,800
Especially,

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,279
Shen Qingyuan

69
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:47,839
and Shi Xiaoci

70
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,279
of the Haiya Shooting Team.

71
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,639
- Great, Captain Shen!
- Captain Shen.

72
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:58,759
They won 10m Air Pistol

73
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,559
in singles and mixed doubles

74
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,880
at the Individual Shooting Championship

75
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:05,320
this year.

76
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,800
It has boosted

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
the morale of our team

78
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,119
and set an example

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,440
for our athletes!

80
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,880
Great!

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,520
Great.

82
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,399
Well done.

83
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:36,880
Xiaoci.

84
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,360
Look what Du Lingfeng is like.

85
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,800
Why don't you respond to him?

86
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:40,919
Why?

87
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,600
Must I respond to him?

88
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,039
Next,

89
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,679
let's welcome the athlete representative

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,440
(Non-bitter Lemon)
to the stage

91
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:51,520
and give a speech.

92
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,880
Welcome.

93
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,880
Let's welcome Shen Qingyuan.

94
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,759
Qingyuan, well done.

95
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,880
Go ahead.

96
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,320
I have nothing special to say.

97
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,320
The only goal of shooting

98
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,200
is accuracy.

99
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,279
I have

100
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,239
one only goal, too,

101
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,760
the Olympics.

102
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,519
You must get

103
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,600
into the Olympics

104
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,359
if you want us to go further

105
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,359
in this relationship.

106
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,600
In the coming days,

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,279
my team and I

108
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,559
will aim at the Olympics

109
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
with more bullets and gold medals.

110
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,519
Thanks, everyone.

111
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:45,679
Cute!

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,600
So handsome!

113
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,279
- Great!
- Great!

114
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,880
- Captain Shen.
- Captain Shen.

115
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,079
- Captain Shen.
- Well done!

116
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,559
Look at them,

117
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,760
and look at us.

118
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,119
What a gap!

119
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,640
We're inferior to them in skills.

120
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,799
What can we do?

121
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,160
Can you

122
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,920
stop belittling yourselves?

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,559
No, Captain.

124
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,200
It's the truth.

125
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,399
Didn't you...?

126
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,160
The past is the past.

127
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,119
To challenge them,

128
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,399
what matters is the present.

129
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:31,959
Captain,

130
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,519
you don't intend to challenge
Shen Qingyuan

131
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,320
on the first day
of the winter training, do you?

132
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,279
Yes, I do.

133
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,839
Really, Captain?

134
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,359
How do you challenge him?

135
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,119
One on one?

136
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,920
You'll know when it's time.

137
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,600
You did a great job.

138
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,320
Keep up the good work.

139
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,440
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

140
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,839
What about him?

141
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,559
He isn't bad, too.

142
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:52,799
That's good.

143
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,359
Captain Shen.

144
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:56,839
Captain.

145
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,160
I thought you went to get your pistol.

146
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,279
I want to take the air.

147
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,720
We'll take the air with you.

148
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Don't you see?

149
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,799
It's their one-to-one time.

150
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,839
Don't be the third wheel.

151
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,600
OK.

152
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,440
Mr. Zhang, see you.

153
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Bye-bye.

154
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,880
Gotta go, Captain.

155
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:17,839
Captain, bye-bye.

156
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,679
Are you going to practice?

157
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,480
Flat-headed hollow bamboo bullet.

158
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,440
No.

159
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,279
I have to find a picture

160
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,160
for reference.

161
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,320
Just in time.

162
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,799
I want to shoot some
interactive tidbits.

163
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,679
I'll go with you.

164
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,839
Come on.

165
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,519
Qingyuan.

166
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,600
Well done.

167
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,799
We'll practice ready position
with unloaded pistols.

168
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,559
Put away your bullets.

169
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,839
You put it down too quickly

170
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,200
and didn't hold it.

171
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,600
Don't worry about shaking.

172
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,959
In a certain amplitude,
squeeze the trigger consciously,

173
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,079
then fire unconsciously.

174
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,799
Why don't you shoot?

175
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,600
You're just practicing raising guns.

176
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,359
It's neither interactive nor intense.

177
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,480
Come with me.

178
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,200
All right.

179
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,640
I'll interact with the viewers.

180
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,359
Shen Qingyuan,

181
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,400
would you like a competition?

182
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,040
(Entrance of the Training Ground)

183
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,599
Hurry.

184
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,640
What is he doing?

185
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,520
Ignorant.

186
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,159
Excuse me?

187
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,159
Mirror reverse firing.

188
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
In short,

189
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,559
with a mirror

190
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,320
in front of each of us,

191
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,280
we turn our backs to the targets

192
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,039
and aim at them by mirror image.

193
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Isn't that fun?

194
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,880
It isn't a competition event.

195
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,799
What does he want?

196
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,039
It's usually used

197
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,960
in practical shooting.

198
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,280
But if you ask me,

199
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,640
I'd say Captain Shen will do fine.

200
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,880
Right? Hai, what do you think?

201
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,440
In routine training,

202
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,599
we practice a stable and unique

203
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,479
muscle memory.

204
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,200
The difficulty

205
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,119
of mirror training

206
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:46,320
is to break the muscle memory.

207
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Frankly speaking,

208
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,840
the more stable and skilled

209
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,880
a shooter is,

210
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,880
the more difficult
the training is to him.

211
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,080
Shall we talk Captain Shen

212
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,840
out of it?

213
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,159
OK. Let's compete.

214
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,960
- Captain Shen.
- Captain Shen.

215
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,799
10 shots to settle the outcome,

216
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,960
OK?

217
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,080
OK.

218
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:07,719
Captain.

219
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,280
I don't think it's a good idea.

220
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,400
The old fox may have

221
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,440
set a trap for you.

222
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,599
I know.

223
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,320
But it's fun.

224
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
It's a shame if I miss it.

225
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,599
- Captain.
- Captain.

226
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,679
Qingyuan, come on!

227
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't disturb him.

228
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:46,799
Captain.

229
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,960
Are you okay with it?

230
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,640
Yeah.

231
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,080
How did you

232
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,239
come up with the idea?

233
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,400
Rest assured.

234
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,640
I've practiced before.

235
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,359
Miss Tang,

236
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,559
don't you livestream

237
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,440
our competition?

238
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,119
Captain of Southeast Shooting Team

239
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,840
versus captain

240
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,919
of Haiya Shooting Team

241
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,119
in an unorthodox competition,

242
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,919
isn't it a shame
if you don't livestream it?

243
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,280
Is he so sure to win?

244
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,200
Are you worried

245
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,479
about Shen Qingyuan
making a fool of himself

246
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,239
in front of the camera?

247
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,239
I almost forget

248
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,719
that you're his girlfriend.

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,840
It's normal

250
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,880
that you have such concerns.

251
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,919
Surely it's normal I worry about him.

252
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,359
But Shen Qingyuan

253
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,919
never has distracting thoughts
before a competition.

254
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,000
And he won't talk so much

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,919
as you do.

256
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,520
He'll do fine.

257
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,799
Let's begin, then.

258
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,400
Hello, everyone,

259
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,000
welcome to Rui Live.

260
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,479
After the Mobilization Meeting,

261
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,440
you haven't seen enough,

262
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,599
have you?

263
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,320
Don't worry.

264
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,719
There's a special competition

265
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:09,119
going on with the shooting teams.

266
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,599
I'm sure you'll find

267
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,080
it's new and exciting.

268
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,080
Captain.

269
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,599
Only 10 shots.

270
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:19,080
You must stay in control.

271
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,919
I've had it foretold.

272
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,840
You're helping him

273
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,400
if you keep your mouth shut.

274
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,400
Captain, come on!

275
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,159
Come on, Captain.

276
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,919
What are you doing?

277
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,880
I'm doing the livestream.

278
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,840
Cheer for me.

279
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,239
The first thing after getting up

280
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,239
is to cheer for Captain Shen.

281
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,880
You're the world's No. 1,
better than anyone.

282
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,799
You can be beaten by no one.

283
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
Never miss a shot!

284
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,479
Hit targets within a hundred steps!

285
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:05,679
Absolutely sure!

286
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Crack shot!

287
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Come on, Shen Qingyuan!

288
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,919
Win the first!

289
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,919
Win the first for whom?

290
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,119
For me, and for you.

291
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,120
(I'm too young to see this.)

292
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,160
(Why can't I see? Let me see!)

293
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,360
(Close-up of Shen Qingyuan just now.
Got him!)

294
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,032
(I want a girlfriend
like the livestreamer, too.)

295
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,240
(Livestreamer, cheer for us, too!)

296
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,359
8.2.

297
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,880
How could he do it?

298
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,799
I can't believe it!

299
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,760
Yeah.

300
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,599
Not good for Captain.

301
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,880
6.4.

302
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,400
Only 6.4?

303
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,880
6 again.

304
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,760
Captain is trying

305
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,640
another way.

306
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,320
Only 5.

307
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,960
What should he do?

308
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,400
It seems that the muscle sense

309
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,159
doesn't work.

310
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,359
The standing position

311
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,039
has completely broken

312
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,119
his muscle memory.

313
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,359
Wait a minute.

314
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,400
I'm having a word
with Shen Qingyuan.

315
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,080
Fine.

316
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:02,880
Anyway, it isn't

317
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,840
a formal competition.

318
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,400
It doesn't matter to wait for a moment.

319
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,719
Shen Qingyuan,

320
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,559
come here.

321
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,159
You occasionally
don't look at the target

322
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,320
in your routine training, do you?

323
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,080
Then,

324
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,119
why don't you try

325
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,960
to not look at it at all?

326
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,640
Have you finished?

327
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:37,280
Sorry, everyone.

328
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,039
Let's continue.

329
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,240
Come on!

330
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,160
- Come on!
- Come on!

331
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,920
Great!

332
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,040
As you may have heard,

333
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,560
I suggested Shen Qingyuan

334
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,119
revert to his usual state

335
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:50,959
and not look at the target,

336
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,719
because I hoped

337
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,160
through memory

338
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,000
and faith,

339
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:54,640
he'd find his usual position

340
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,079
of frontal fire.

341
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,160
That's the only way

342
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,800
he can find his touch

343
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,640
in a short time

344
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,000
and shoot perfectly

345
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,599
through the unconscious.

346
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:08,719
Let's see this round.

347
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,319
The so-called fantasy
grows out of nothing.

348
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,439
But what Shen Qingyuan needs to do

349
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,239
is to get rid of everything.

350
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,239
It must be difficult.

351
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,959
Whether he can do it or not

352
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
all depends

353
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,479
on his faith as a shooter.

354
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,880
Shen Qingyuan,

355
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,359
you must be good

356
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,560
at getting in a world of your own.

357
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,719
It seems to be of some use.

358
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,560
Good!

359
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,199
Good!

360
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,160
(I'll place my bet on Zhou Yue.)

361
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,079
(Can I still believe in Shen Qingyuan?)

362
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,199
(Shen Qingyuan still can't
save the situation. )

363
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,280
10.1.

364
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:29,439
Captain, you still have 4 shots.

365
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,160
- Come on!
- Come on!

366
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,479
- Come on!
- Come on!

367
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,079
Captain, keep it steady.

368
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,160
He is awesome.

369
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:39,560
Captain, come on!

370
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:12,959
Captain,

371
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,920
last shot.

372
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,479
Come on!

373
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,359
- Come on!
- Come on, Captain!

374
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:15,839
- Come on!
- Come on!

375
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,439
- Come on!
- Captain, keep it steady.

376
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:16,959
Come on!

377
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,319
- Come on!
- Come on!

378
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,040
Captain is great!

379
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:30,439
10.7, excellent!

380
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,319
He'll absolutely win.

381
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,440
(Non-bitter Lemon)

382
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:21,359
Captain.

383
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,640
Captain, you're brilliant!

384
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,439
- Congratulations, Captain!
- Congratulations, Captain!

385
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,119
Great!

386
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,520
Zhou Yue must be

387
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,640
embarrassed in front of the netizens

388
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:27,959
all over the country.

389
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:28,560
Yeah.

390
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,160
Who would have expected that?

391
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,239
During the winter training,

392
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,439
we'll bring you more

393
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,920
interesting interactions
from time to time.

394
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,400
During the period,

395
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,800
there will be a series of exciting

396
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
simulated competitions and trials.

397
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,359
Newcomers,

398
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,319
do you see the plus

399
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,040
at the bottom of the live room?

400
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,359
Follow us with one click.

401
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,959
You'll get more blast

402
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,280
shooting news at all times.

403
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,560
Tang Xin,

404
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,400
what are you shooting?

405
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,040
Mr. Xu,

406
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,160
Mr. Zhou asked me to shoot more

407
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,199
interactive videos of the team.

408
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,119
They happened to have a competition,

409
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,239
so I did a livestream.

410
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,719
You're dedicated.

411
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,800
Go on.

412
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,479
Well,

413
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,280
let me help you to shoot

414
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,359
some videos of their interaction.

415
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,560
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

416
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:02,760
Shen Qingyuan.

417
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,079
You fought back again.

418
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,119
Well done.

419
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:14,439
You lost.

420
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,400
What do you have to say?

421
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,239
It's the Olympic spirit

422
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,239
to be friendly

423
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,800
and helpful to each other.

424
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:35,479
However, Shen Qingyuan,

425
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,959
I remind you out of kindness,

426
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,560
the better you do

427
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,400
in mirror shooting,

428
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,319
the worse you do in the usual shooting.

429
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,040
You should worry about that.

430
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
After all, you play much more

431
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,800
than I do.

432
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,000
That is all we have

433
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,040
for today.

434
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,239
I'll see you next time.

435
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,439
Gotta go.

436
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,920
Tang Xin,

437
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,599
do you have any plans for tonight?

438
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,359
Our company is having

439
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,160
a small glee feast.

440
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,839
Why don't you join us?

441
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,400
Me?

442
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:19,880
I don't think it's appropriate.

443
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,560
There's nothing inappropriate.

444
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,000
You are all livestreamers.

445
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,439
You should take the chance to meet them.

446
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:26,000
I'll be there, too.

447
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,079
What a careless guy!

448
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Mr. Xu, I'm sorry.

449
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,160
I can't join you tonight.

450
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,400
I have to go.

451
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,079
Tang Liqi,

452
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,920
help me to put away the equipment.

453
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,400
Yes.

454
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,800
Hello, Mr. Xu.

455
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,680
Hi.

456
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,760
(Southeast Shooting Team)

457
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,319
Captain,

458
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,880
how can you bear it?

459
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:58,319
Why can't I?

460
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,319
But...

461
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:00,839
Zhang Yan.

462
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,839
Do you know the difference

463
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,119
between Haiya and us?

464
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,079
The three of us

465
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,119
all went to the last competition.

466
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,719
You finished fifth

467
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,760
at least.

468
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,359
Chen Hai of their team

469
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,079
was at the bottom,

470
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,319
who didn't even make it to the finals.

471
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:17,319
You mean…

472
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,719
Haiya

473
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,079
has a reputation,

474
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,040
but

475
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,880
they only have one leading player.

476
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,439
As for the others,

477
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,839
they're just drifting along aimlessly.

478
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,280
Right.

479
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,680
Chen Hai seems to be poor

480
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,040
in psychological quality.

481
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,160
And Jiang Yitian.

482
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:33,040
I can tell at first glance

483
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,199
that he is flighty and impetuous.

484
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,000
They also have an amateur, Du Lingfeng.

485
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
The others are completely irrelevant.

486
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:40,359
That's right.

487
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:41,680
Though shooting

488
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,119
is a single event,

489
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,439
this time,

490
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,479
the two teams of us

491
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,800
come over together for training.

492
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,400
Two teams,

493
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,280
not just me and him.

494
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,119
Shen Qingyuan.

495
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,160
Shen Qingyuan.

496
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,400
Shen Qingyuan.

497
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,680
Shen Qingyuan.

498
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,760
Don't get too close to him next time.

499
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,439
Do I sense

500
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:36,680
jealousy here?

501
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,839
I'm serious.

502
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:39,920
Fine.

503
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,119
I'll only get close to you.

504
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,359
Let's go.

505
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,680
I'll take you to a special place.

506
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
(East Zone Dormitory area entrance)

507
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:03,959
Xiaoci.

508
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,319
Xiaoci, do you have a minute?

509
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,520
I don't know what happened before.

510
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,040
I wanna...

511
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,000
Xiaoci.

512
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,239
Let's go.

513
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,880
I didn't know there was
such a place in the base.

514
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,959
Awesome!

515
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,599
They don't know it,

516
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,280
do they?

517
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,319
This place isn't on the way
to the training ground.

518
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,680
Don't tell them.

519
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:49,000
How did you find it?

520
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,079
Shooting requires concentration.

521
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,560
There are two methods,

522
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,560
shield

523
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,079
and meditation.

524
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,119
I used to use the first one before.

525
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,199
In the mirror competition,

526
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,319
I tried the second one.

527
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,800
It went well.

528
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,280
I see.

529
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,280
But it seems

530
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,560
to have nothing to do with the lake.

531
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,239
Meditation needs

532
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,280
a good environment.

533
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,520
Come on. I'll show you.

534
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,599
OK.

535
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,359
Take it.

536
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,160
Don't get frostbite on your hands.

537
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,040
Let me warm them.

538
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,839
Not upset anymore?

539
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,839
With such a
considerate girlfriend like me,

540
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,199
if you're still upset,

541
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,479
I can do nothing but give up.

542
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,640
My hands are cold.

543
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,640
You're really not upset?

544
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,560
Xiaoci.

545
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,319
Shi Xiaoci, stop there!

546
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,959
What's wrong with you?

547
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,400
Didn't I make it clear?

548
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,079
We're not suitable for each other.

549
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,640
We've tried to build

550
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
a relationship of battle.

551
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,599
But it went wrong.

552
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,839
So we should end it in time.

553
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,719
The game is over.

554
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,520
Do you understand?

555
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,119
It's a game of two players.

556
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:27,760
What makes you decide it's over?

557
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,839
Do you think I'm cute now?

558
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,439
Honestly,

559
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,680
you're a little aggressive.

560
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,359
But this is me

561
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,599
most of the time.

562
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,319
Most of the time,

563
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,959
I'm stubborn, unreasonable

564
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:52,640
and insensitive.

565
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm not the girl you said

566
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,880
that made you comfortable

567
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,040
at the first sight!

568
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,719
I know

569
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,239
it's my own problem.

570
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,239
But I can't

571
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,599
force you to accept it.

572
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,079
So I must let you go early.

573
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,160
Though you didn't force me to accept it,

574
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,239
you unilaterally

575
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,239
decided to end the game.

576
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,520
You're practically forcing me.

577
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,719
Why don't you see

578
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,959
the gap between us?

579
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,040
No matter in upbringing

580
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:14,880
or psychological level,

581
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,839
we just can't...

582
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,520
The gap is there for us to close.

583
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,640
I've told you from the beginning.

584
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:21,359
Xiaoci, I'm going to close the gap.

585
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,239
How about this?

586
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:42,920
How about this?

587
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:45,239
Then,

588
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:48,239
this.

589
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,040
Xiaoci.

590
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:52,800
Xiaoci, wait for me.

591
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,760
Would you cut it out?

592
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:55,959
Xiaoci.

593
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:03,040
Xiaoci.

594
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,920
Xiaoci. Xiaoci!

595
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,959
I'm gonna check on him.

596
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:16,079
What's wrong?

597
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,199
Nothing.

598
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,239
I sprained my ankle.

599
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,199
Why are you here?

600
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,239
I just pass by.

601
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,000
Would you like to go to the infirmary

602
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,800
and have it taken care of?

603
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,239
No.

604
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,479
You

605
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,160
are so caring.

606
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:35,800
Tang Xin,

607
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
help me to figure out what to do.

608
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,719
Xiaoci asked to break up with me

609
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:39,479
for no reason.

610
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:41,000
What should I do?

611
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,000
I can't help you.

612
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,199
Xiaoci knows best

613
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,160
what she thinks.

614
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,520
If you don't catch up with her,

615
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,920
you'll lose the chance
to ask her face to face.

616
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,160
Sounds fair.

617
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:50,959
Gotta go.

618
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,839
Take care.

619
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,760
Sure enough, he isn't jealous

620
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,599
of everybody.

621
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,000
But why does he

622
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,119
have a problem

623
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,000
with Mr. Xu?

624
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,719
Shen Qingyuan.

625
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:14,959
Hedgehog.

626
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:15,719
Hedgehog?

627
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
It's lovely.

628
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:22,520
Look out! It may prick you.

629
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,640
Doesn't it look like you?

630
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,719
The look it gets angry

631
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,040
is more like you.

632
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,439
Let's keep it.

633
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,680
We can't keep it in the dormitories.

634
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:53,079
There is

635
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,359
nothing to eat around here.

636
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,719
You stay in the dormitory recently.

637
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,560
No one will take care of it
if you keep it at home.

638
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,000
You're right.

639
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,239
How about this?

640
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,359
I'll buy you

641
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,640
an incubator

642
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,560
and come to feed you once a day.

643
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,920
Today…

644
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:12,840
I only have winter jujube.

645
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:13,719
Does it like this?

646
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,239
Have a try.

647
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,719
Hedgehog.

648
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,639
Here you are.

649
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,040
I'm hungry, too.

650
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:25,719
You can have one, too.

651
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,120
Shall we grab a bite?

652
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:31,520
I'm not going.

653
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,719
I have videos to sort out.

654
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,600
You go ahead.

655
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:37,840
Eat.

656
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,199
Finally!

657
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,120
It isn't easy at all!

658
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,520
(Counseling Room)

659
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,199
I've given them tests

660
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,360
on EMG and heart rate.

661
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,000
Everyone is in fine form recently.

662
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,879
Here.

663
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:41,679
Thanks.

664
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,959
That's good.

665
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,080
Dr. Ding, how's your stay

666
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
with us?

667
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,080
Not bad.

668
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,280
It's closed-door training.

669
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,000
The place is isolated.

670
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm sorry

671
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,600
to have you eat and live

672
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,840
with the children for so long.

673
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,600
Thank you.

674
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:56,919
Don't mention it.

675
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:57,600
I'm not

676
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,320
the only auxiliary here.

677
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,600
There are nutrition team,
physiotherapy team

678
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,080
and central nervous system testing team.

679
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,600
Compared to them,

680
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,760
it's nothing.

681
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:06,879
Good.

682
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:07,879
As long as you have a comfortable stay,

683
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:08,719
I'll be relieved.

684
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,840
I won't bother you any longer.

685
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,520
I'm going to see

686
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,239
how's their practice going.

687
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,000
OK.

688
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,719
Keep me posted.

689
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:15,520
Okay.

690
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,520
(Li Lyu, Lawyer)

691
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,199
Hello? Ding Fang.

692
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,000
Hold on.

693
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,800
So, what happened?

694
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,919
Since last time,

695
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:15,719
we haven't been in touch

696
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,560
for a while.

697
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,719
You

698
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,719
forgot what I had said,

699
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,520
didn't you?

700
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,199
What did you say?

701
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,840
Divorce.

702
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,399
I'm not ready yet.

703
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,879
What do you need to be ready for?

704
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:42,879
You're always trying to escape.

705
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,760
You escaped before
and you're still doing it now.

706
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,600
Ding Fang,

707
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,280
would you

708
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:48,479
stop scolding me

709
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:49,520
every time you talk to me?

710
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,840
Yes.

711
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:52,239
I know your career

712
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,760
is rolling these years.

713
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,479
You've got professional ranks
and titles in psychology.

714
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,439
You've published several books online.

715
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:58,719
You have lots of fans

716
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,040
online and offline.

717
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,520
But I'm a loser, OK?

718
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,360
I even have to muster my courage

719
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,840
while facing you.

720
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,600
Are you happy?

721
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,160
(Invitation)

722
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,639
Hello?

723
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:50,760
Are you free tonight?

724
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,639
Yes.

725
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:54,639
Go to the dinner

726
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,840
of Zhengdao Media for me.

727
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:57,760
Tang Xin.

728
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,239
It's a good opportunity

729
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,239
to expand your circle.

730
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,560
Making more friends

731
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,679
in the industry

732
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,560
will make your work easier.

733
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,199
Got it?

734
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:05,560
Do I have to go?

735
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,719
But I don't know anyone.

736
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:09,679
I planned to...

737
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,159
That's exactly
why you must know them!

738
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,159
Forget it. I don't have to tell him.

739
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,080
After all, I'm just going to dinner

740
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,199
as my boss asked me to.

741
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,760
However,

742
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,679
it's really embarrassing

743
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,919
not to know anyone there.

744
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,399
Mr. Xu,

745
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,959
where are we going?

746
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,120
Bay Hotel.

747
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,679
Is it the restaurant that is difficult

748
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,639
to make reservations?

749
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,439
I hear

750
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:07,679
they serve delicious seafood.

751
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,679
Of course.

752
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,600
(Tang Xin)

753
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,639
Tang Xin.

754
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,399
Hello? Mr. Xu.

755
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,439
Sorry to bother you.

756
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,959
I want to know

757
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,520
if you're going

758
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,280
to the glee feast tonight.

759
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:27,879
My boss

760
00:40:27,879 --> 00:40:29,439
asked me to go there
on behalf of the livestream platform,

761
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,280
but I don't know anyone.

762
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,040
So, I wonder

763
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,280
if I can go with you.

764
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:35,399
OK.

765
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,760
I'm at the gate of the base.

766
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:37,879
Just meet me here.

767
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,639
Don't mention it.

768
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,399
See you later.

769
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:45,879
Ai.

770
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,520
