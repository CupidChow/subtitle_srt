Shen Qingyuan, go get the door.

00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:46,559
Hello, pet delivery.

38

Please sign for it.

00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,000
Thanks.

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,680
No problem.

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,360
So heavy.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,559
I miss you so much.

Thanks.

No problem.

00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,559
Jujube,

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
I miss you so much.

47
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,800
Let me have a look, let me have a look.

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
You must be starving.

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,679
Shen Qingyuan.

50
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,119
Shen Qingyuan!

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,960
I told you not to peek.

52
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,160
I won't, I won't, I won't.

53
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:51,039
I won't.

54
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,479
Is my sketch ugly?

55
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,600
Your sketch is very good.

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
But there's something missing.

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,600
What is it?

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,080
Let me show you.

59
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,679
Why do you draw a beard on him?

60
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,639
I want to grow old with you.

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,199
Then we'll have to

62
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,639
break through many obstacles together.

63
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,320
Rest easy.

64
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Tell me,

65
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
which promise I made to you

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,039
did I fail to keep?

67
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,279
Make sure you keep your word.

68
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,839
Rest easy.

69
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,119
Nuisance.

70
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,800
New anchor Ren Rong

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,839

74

(Ai)

75
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,320
Hello.

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,920
Is that Ai?

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,519
Mr. Zhou,

78
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,079
let's meet when you have time.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,519
OK.

80
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,399
Hello, Dr. Ding.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,920
Now I'm in Yongcheng with Shen Qingyuan.

82
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,760
It's quite a big breakthrough

83
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,480
that he can go back to Yongcheng
with you.

84
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,279
Turns out only you

85
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,839
can make Shen Qingyuan

86
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,839
move forward.

87
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,559
Tang Xin,

88
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,160
ever since I started
doing psychological counseling

89
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,600
for the shooting team,

90
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,920
I've found

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,239
many athletes

92
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,480
have more serious psychological problems

93
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,320
than ordinary people.

94
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,920
Maybe it's time

95
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,000
to pay attention to

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,279
their psychological problems.

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,680
(Search)

98
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,520
(Psychological counseling for athletes
Search)

99
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:39,320
…With repeated traumas…

100
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,760
Until they have no more fear

101
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,480
of memory.

102
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,679
Dr. Ding seems to have mentioned it too.

103
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,839
But it's too risky.

104
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,200
Shall I give it a try?

105
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:08,720
Tang Xin,

106
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:09,959
we are running out of shampoo.

107
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,440
You…

108
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,799
Shen Qingyuan,

109
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,760
I seem to have lost the necklace

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,079
you gave me on a mountain path.

111
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,519
I'll go back to look for it.

112
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,799
Sorry,

113
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,480
the subscribed you dialed

114
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,839
cannot be connected for the moment.

115
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,239
Will her friend be back?

116
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,959
I don't know.

117
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,119
It seems…

118
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:27,760
Young girl,

119
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,079
it seems your friend

120
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,959
is gonna leave you behind.

121
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,440
He's not coming back.

122
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,919
Why don't you have some fun with us

123
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,280
while we have nothing to do
at the moment?

124
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,159
No,

125
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,799
he's sure to come back.

126
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,080
Don't touch me.

127
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,719
Don't think about it.

128
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,400
Just drop the idea.

129
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,799
Be quiet!

130
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,280
Shen Qingyuan,

131
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,520
I know

132
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,919
you'll come to me for sure.

133
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:06,960
I'm sure you will.

134
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,640
Tang Xin.

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,679
Shen Qingyuan.

136
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:20,280
Shen Qingyuan!

137
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,679
Shen Qingyuan.

138
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,599
I knew

139
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:25,080
you'd come to me for sure.

140
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,119
Tang Xin,

141
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,679
no matter what you lose afterwards,

142
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,719
make sure you don't get lost yourself.

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
It's a pity it's winter.

144
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,479
It's a pity we are here.

145
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,559
Why do you say so?

146
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,719
I heard that in the suburbs here,

147
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,880
there are lots of

148
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,520
fireflies

149
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,200
in the autumn evenings.

150
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,280
At that time,

151
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,239
if you twirl around

152
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,039
on the rooftop of the base,

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,880
the light

154
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,280
will rain down from the sky

155
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,200
and wrap you in it.

156
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,400
It must be very beautiful

157
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,239
and touching,

158
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,599
and it's a fantastic occasion
for love confession.

159
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,719
Let's go together

160
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,400
in the autumn next year.

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,559
OK.

162
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,880
No, we can't.

163
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,239
I'll be in the middle of a competition
at that time.

164
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,320
How can I go?

165
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,599
When you finish the competition.

166
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,280
When you get the gold medal,

167
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,599
we'll go to celebrate your victory.

168
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,719
And we'll go secretly.

169
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,400
Du Lingfeng,

170
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,000
I've made up my mind.

171
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,320
I will not switch to another event

172
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,960
or look for a new partner.

173
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,719
I believe in Shen Qingyuan.

174
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,200
I'm sure he'll be back.

175
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,359
All right then.

176
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,479
I'll withdraw from the team

177
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,119
when he's back,

178
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,400
OK?

179
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,559
This is not right, Xiaoci.

180
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,359
We've finally got to

181
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,280
spend some time together.

182
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,200
Why are we talking about

183
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,960
another man?

184
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,440
Don't you sense something's wrong?

185
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,719
Maybe in the next dozen years,

186
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,840
you'll have to talk about

187
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Shen Qingyuan with me all the time.

188
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:31,440
That's good too.

189
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,960
At least this means

190
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,599
we can have a common topic

191
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,039
for the next dozen years.

192
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:40,880
Shen Qingyuan,

193
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,799
do take care of yourself!

194
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,559
What are you doing? Keep it down.

195
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,400
Sit down.

196
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,880
Back then, it was right here,

197
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,000
right in this location

198
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,320
that the firework display was scheduled.

199
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,640
I waited for you for a long time here,

200
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,599
but you didn't show up.

201
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,559
You promised me
to watch the fireworks together.

202
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:20,000
I even wrote you an invitation

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,440
with special care.

204
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,080
(Letter of Invitation)

205
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,200
♪Like the wind♪

206
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,560
♪You're unreal♪

207

♪I can't feel you

208
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,360
♪Take me out of this sea♪

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,800
♪As a blank canvas♪

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,920
♪Hopefully with the one I love♪

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,800
♪I can feel the ways of the world♪

212
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,400
♪Tears shed for you♪

213
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,799
You promised to come together.

214
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,320
Why didn't you come?

215
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,599
Only later did I know

216
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,880
you somehow didn't

217
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,919
see the invitation and stood me up.

218
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:38,960
Later

219
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
you promised to make it up to me

220
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,440
with another firework display,

221
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,200
saying you had found

222
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,080
a very beautiful place

223
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,479
and you'd take me to the mountains.

224
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,760
Unexpectedly,

225
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,239
on our way there we ran into…

226
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,080
Sorry.

227
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,039
It seems I'd been hurting you

228
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,479
either by design or accident
throughout the whole thing.

229
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,119
No.

230
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,599
That was in part my fault.

231
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,599
I was too childish.

232
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,919
If

233
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,119
I could tell you myself back then,

234
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,640
we probably wouldn't
be like ships that pass in the night.

235
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,919
Tang Xin,

236
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,280
I'll surely make it up to you

237
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
with a more beautiful firework display.

238
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,239
Shen Qingyuan,

239
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,520
what matters is not
watching the fireworks

240
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,919
but being with you.

241
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,640
♪Love is like the wind♪

242
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,280
♪You're unreal♪

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,960
Come on, come on.

244
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:45,000
Let's take a snap, take a snap.

245
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,000
Come on, come on.

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,679
Be quick, be quick.

247
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,360
♪Have fun like a kid♪

♪Hopefully with the one I love♪

250
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,359
In fact,

251
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,520
I quite like

252
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,719
the interludes between the fireworks.

253
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,040
♪Tears shed for you♪

254
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,679
Shooting

255
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,799
is a quiet sport.

256
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,640
It's hard to be quiet in your company,

257
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,200
but it can still calm me down.

258
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,880
♪Your heart rippled a little♪

259
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,440
Look.

260
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,640
Life itself

261
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,520
is just like this target.

262
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,280
If you set your heart on

263
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,679
reaching the goal

264
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,200
and ignore the external factors,

265
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,200
ripples will keep coming up

266
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,479
and push you away.

267
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,080
In the end,

268
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,479
you'll only be
further and further away from your goal.

269
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,479
So we need to solve

270
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,640
the 99%

271
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,520
external factors first.

272
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,039
When they are solved,

273
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,080
the 1% target

274
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,840
in the center

275
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,119
will naturally fall into place.

276
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,119
Don't you think so?

277
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,000

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,640
Come on, come on.

286
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:30,839
My long-time classmates,

287
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,199
shall we have a drink together?

288
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on.

289
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:35,960
Help yourselves.

290
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,040
Here, cheers.

291
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:42,839
You are here.

292
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,119
Zhou is here.

293
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,479
Zhou.

294
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,319
- Long time no see.
- Everybody is waiting for you.

295
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,640
A seat specially reserved for you.

296
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,280
Punish him with drinking.

297
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,520
He can't get away with it.

298
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:53,520
Well,

299
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,280
latecomers will be punished.

300
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,119
I see, I see. I get it.

301
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,719
Don't force him.

302
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,520
He knows the rules.

303
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,959
Of course he should know.

304
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,760
Well, classmates,

305
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,280
of all the reunions over the years,

306
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,199
this is the best attended one, isn't it?

307
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,599
- Yes.
- Yes.

308
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,880
For our reunions over the years,

309
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,359
there are more or less

310
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,560
always a few people absent.

311
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:13,479
As it happens, for today's reunion,

312
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:14,680
nobody is absent.

313
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,439
Yes, everybody is here.

314
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,400
Yes.

315
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,599
Like Zhou,

316
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,680
a very busy man.

317
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,760
Every time

318
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,800
his wife comes alone.

319
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,560
Tell us,

320
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,800
why did you come this time?

321
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,040
I've been missing you guys,

322
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,239
so I just came.

323
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,839
All right. I know the rules.

324
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,160
I'll punish myself
with three shots of liquor.

325
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,520
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

326
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:33,719
OK.

327
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,479
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

328
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,239
One shot.

329
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,599
Two shots.

330
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,400
OK, three shots.

331
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,319
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on.

332
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,160
Let's drink together, together.

333
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,359
Come on, come on.

334
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,439
Zhou.

335
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,199
I can't either.

336
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,520
He's busy.

337
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,239
He must drink every day
at the business drinking parties.

338
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,760
He's a battle-hardened veteran.

339
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,800
That's for sure.

340
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,719
The more he drinks,
the younger he looks.

341
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,800
What's the matter?
What are you looking for?

342
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,439
I can't find my cellphone.

343
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:17,719
Can't find your cellphone?

344
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,000
Let me give you a call.

345
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,599
Wait. Let me search the number.

346
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:27,959
Look at me.

347
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,239
With Zhou being here,

348
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,400
why am I making the call?

349
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,199
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

350
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,040
(Hubby)

351
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:52,880
You guys are down there

352
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
for such a long time.

353
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,680
Are you kissing?

354
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,560
What a pair of lovebirds!

355
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,959
You're still billing and cooing here.

356
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,400
Are you doing it to upset us?

357
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,400
All right, all right.

358
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,319
I also can't find my cellphone.

359
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,560
Look for it for me.

360
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,160
Me too.

361
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,280
Don't tease my wife.

362
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,400
I'll drink with you.

363
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,880
Zhou, Ding Fang,

364
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:13,839
we as a couple

365
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,920
drink a toast to you couple.

366
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:15,959
OK.

367
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,800
Why are they all in pairs?

368
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,760
Shouldn't all the couples present

369
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,599
drink a toast?

370
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:23,560
Let's raise our glasses.

371
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:25,160
Come on.

372
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:25,920
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on.

373
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
Come on. Let's all have a drink.

374
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,400
I'm happy.

375
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,560
We haven't met for seven years.

376
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,479
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

377
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,240
(Gulf One)

378
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,120
I'm off.

379
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,320
Was everything good? Was the food good?

380
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,000
Very good.

381
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,920
You couple,

382
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,199
don't be late for the next reunion.

383
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:47,880
You must come.

384
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,959
And everybody must come too.

385
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,160
Nobody must be absent.

386
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
The point is not to be late.

387
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:53,880
Sure, sure.

388
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,400
Zhou,

389
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,800
make sure you are not late next time.

390
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,599
OK. I see, I see.

391
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,560
We are going for now.

392
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:58,760
You guys go back too.

393
00:20:58,959 --> 00:20:59,719
You'll be punished if you're late again.

394
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,359
- OK.
- I'm off.

395
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,400
Ding Fang, come next time.

396
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,319
OK. See you next time.

397
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,239
Bye.

398
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,599
- We are going.
- See you next time.

399
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:10,640
Ding Fang…

400
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,439
Don't ignore your health
even when you are busy with your work.

401
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,199
I'm all right.

402
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:28,680
These days

403
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,239
I've not been busy with my work.

404
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:31,560
Actually, I've been

405
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,119
shadowing a new anchor

406
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:34,880
of the TV station.

407
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,520
A female anchor?

408
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,560
Yes.

409
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,680
I didn't expect after so long a time,

410
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,000
Zhou Zuguang,

411
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,560
you are still into this?

412
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:53,800
Wait,

413
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,359
what do you mean by that?

414
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,839
What do I mean?

415
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,560
Back then, weren't you distracted

416
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,839
by a female intern anchor

417
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,599
to the point of
being absent-minded at work

418
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,079
and seeing a nosedive in your career?

419
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,839
Now your career

420
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,359
has finally begun to pick up.

421
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,400
I kindly remind you

422
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,800
not to repeat your old mistakes.

423
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,160
Ding Fang, can you not

424
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,400
speak in such a sarcastic tone?

425
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,520
That intern just left

426
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
and shelved

427
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,719
the elaborately planned show.

428
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,000
You ask me not to care and get angry.

429
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,839
How could that be possible?

430
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,119
You, on the other hand,

431
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,199
must have a guilty conscience.

432
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,680
What do you mean?

433
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,719
Make it clear.

434
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,880
Back then, I saw you

435
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,359
walking out of the hotel

436
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:37,959
with that man.

437
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,400
Which man?

438
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,959
I'm really sorry, Dr. Ding.

439
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,599
I didn't expect

440
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,280
Qingyuan would shut you out.

441
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:57,680
It's OK.

442
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,880
We met for the first time after all

443
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,000
and without

444
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,880
his consent,

445
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:03,839
so he was right

446
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,800
to be vigilant.

447
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,319
The child's temperament

448
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:09,959
has become like this

449
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,280
only recently.

450
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,239
This is also

451
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,400
the problem that worries me most.

452
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,560
As he's my only child,

453
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,280
I'm always afraid of

454
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,719
any time bomb lying in wait.

455
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,479
Talk to him when you have time

456
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,599
and communicate more.

457
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,359
After all, a psychologist

458
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,119
is not a man-eating monster,

459
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:28,719
right?

460
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:29,800
I usually

461
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,359
give counseling sessions
at Haiya Hospital.

462
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,479
You can come to me anytime

463
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,959
if there's a need.

464
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:34,520
OK.

465
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,119
Sorry to have troubled you, Dr. Ding.

466
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:36,640
No problem.

467
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,479
Bye.

468
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,079
So you've taken Shen Qingyuan's father

469
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,880
as a man I was having an affair with?

470
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,119
Is it because of this

471
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,119
that you were suddenly cold to me

472
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,000
and stopped touching me again?

473
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,479
How ridiculous you are!

474
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:07,000
Well,

475
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,000
Ding Fang, let me…

476
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,239
Let me explain to you.

477
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,280
Lin,

478
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:19,280
the intern four years ago,

479
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:21,959
nothing happened between us either.

480
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,160
All I felt about her

481
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,359
was appreciation
of a superior to his subordinate.

482
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,800
Since she left without letting me know,

483
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,560
I felt kind of left out in the cold.

484
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,400
That was it.

485
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,319
Yes, that was it.

486
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,439
I also want to tell you that

487
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,079
the man you saw before,

488
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,079
Mr. Li the lawyer,

489
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,640
is the ex-husband of one of my patients.

490
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,040
We've just got to know each other.

491
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,800
I admit

492
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,319
he likes me indeed.

493
00:24:58,479 --> 00:24:59,800
He's also been courting me these days.

494
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,680
But I don't have that intention.

495
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,760
OK, I see.

496
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,359
I once couldn't understand

497
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:17,000
why the man full of idealism

498
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,880
whom I always adored

499
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,000
as a totem

500
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,319
suddenly changed.

501
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,239
He became such a cold fish.

502
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,000
Back then I wondered

503
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,760
what I had done wrong.

504
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,040
But now the penny dropped.

505
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,199
Forget it.

506
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,079
There's really no point

507
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,199
in talking about this now.

508
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,199
We can't turn the clock back.

509
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:58,280
Ding Fang!

510
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't want a divorce.

511
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,800
Look.

512
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:39,520
Life itself

513
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,800
is just like this target.

514
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,359
If you set your heart on

515
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,680
reaching the goal

516
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,479
and ignore the external factors,

517
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,400
ripples will keep coming up

518
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,560
and push you away.

519
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,040
In the end, you'll only be

520
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,800
further and further away from your goal.

521
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:55,719
So we need to solve

522
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:56,880
the 99%

523
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,719
external factors first.

524
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,280
When they are solved,

525
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,239
the 1% target

526
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,079
in the center

527
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,359
will naturally fall into place.

528
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,359
Don't you think so?

529
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,760
You've woken up, Shen Qingyuan.

530
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,079
Only by getting up early

531
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:41,719
can I see

532
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:42,599
your sleeping face.

533
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,359
Can you be serious?

534
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,599
Now you should
give morning greetings properly.

535
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,400
Good morning,

536
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,079
Tang Xin.

537
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,599
Good morning,

538
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,479
Shen Qingyuan.

539
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,199
I love you.

540
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,280
I'm ready to go back to my team

541
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,520
and fulfill my promise to you.

542
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:13,880
Hi, Mom.

543
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,040
Too fast.

544
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,040
Do it again.

545
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,479
Wrong expression.

546
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,040
Do it again, do it again.

547
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:45,479
Father-in-law.

548
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,800
Mother-in-law.

549
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,599
How old are you, young fellow?

550
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,079
This is not right.

551
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,800
How can you come empty-handed?

552
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,079
Again, again, again.

553
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,079
Father-in-law.

554
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:06,479
Mother-in-law.

555
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,280
How long have you known each other?

556
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,599
How did you get to know each other?

557
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,239
What is it about my daughter
that attracts you?

558
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,760
What is it about you
that attracts my daughter?

559
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,760
How do you usually get along?

560
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,000
Do your parents know you are dating?

561
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:25,920
This is no good.

562
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,520
Wait, wait.

563
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,760
This is no good. Too awkward.

564
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,760
Shouldn't we

565
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,319
match up our confessions

566
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,079
before the rehearsal?

567
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,239
Right.

568
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,400
Look.

569
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,319
I've googled a collection of

570
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,760
50 Questions for Meeting Your In-laws.

571
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,479
Let's walk through them now.

572
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:44,400
Question No. One.

573
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,520
Who initiated the courtship first?

574
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,079
Forget it.

575
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,040
My parents won't ask

576
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,079
such a detailed question.

577
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:55,760
Next one.

578
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,040
You initiated the courtship first.

579
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,719
You took the initiative

580
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,280
to emit your pheromone to me,

581
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,280
so you initiated the courtship first.

582
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,599
What do you mean by I emitted it?

583
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:14,040
You obviously
took the initiative to sniff it first.

584
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,319
Wrong.

585
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,599
What pheromone and all that messy stuff?

586
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:18,839
You courted me,

587
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,239
which is as plain as day,

588
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,199
how can you talk black into white?

589
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,359
At least

590
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,079
you must have fallen for me before that.

591
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,199
As you said,

592
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,079
you fell for me first.

593
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,760
You couldn't figure out just yesterday

594
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,359
who fell for whom first.

595
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,640
Shen Qingyuan,

596
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,040
why do you insist on saying

597
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,719
I courted you first?

598
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,760
Men

599
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,000
always have a sense of self-esteem.

600
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:03,000
When it comes to meeting the in-laws,

601
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:05,359
let's each

602
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,719
lower our self-esteem once.

603
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,079
For example,

604
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:11,000
when you meet my parents,

605
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,199
you'll be my enabler.

606
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,000
When I meet your parents,

607
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,239
I'll be your enabler.

608
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,439
OK?

609
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,000
It's like helping each other
to score a goal.

610
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:19,920
I know.

611
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,359
Shouldn't we

612
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,920
come into the room
and rehearse together?

613
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,079
It's more efficient this way.

614
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,560
Here.

615
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:32,959
Dad, Mom.

616
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,920
Father-in-law.

617
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,400
Mother-in-law.

618
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,000
(Parent's seat)
Young fellow,

619
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,439
what's your basic family condition?

620
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,040
Are you the only child?

621
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,239
Young fellow,

622
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,359
what do

623
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,839
both your parents do?

624
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,920
Young fellow,

625
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:54,000
do you like a boy or a girl?

626
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:55,079
Young fellow,

627
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,079
now you are an athlete.

628
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,359
Are you thinking of

629
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,800
continuing the sport in the future?

630
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,479
Young fellow,

631
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,119
how old are your parents?

632
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:04,400
Young fellow,

633
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,239
if Tang Xin is ill,

634
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,839
are you willing to take care of her

635
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:08,800
wholeheartedly?

636
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,640
Young fellow,

637
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,640
do you have many relatives
in your family?

638
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,079
Young fellow,

639
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,520
is your family a harmonious one?

640
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,040
Do you have a successful career?

641
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,520
Young fellow, what is your personality?

642
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,560
Do you have many friends?

643
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,640
Young fellow,

644
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,719
do you have a target to strive for

645
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,800
before you are 30?

646
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,520
(BESTORE)

647
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,760
Hello, welcome to our store.

648
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,119
How may I help you?

649
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,479
Is there anything
suitable as gifts for parents?

650
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:40,000
Yes.

651
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,839
Please come with me.

652
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:41,640
This way.

653
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,760
(BESTORE)

654
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,520
Here we are.

655
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,040
Don't I look odd

656
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,719
in this outfit?

657
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,719
No.

658
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,520
I cherry-picked

659
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,560
this outfit for you.

660
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,719
It can highlight your temperament.

661
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,079
Well,

662
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,560
shall we go in?

663
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,400
Let's go.

664
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,439
Here we are.

665
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,680
This one?

666
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,319
This floor has quite a festive vibe.

667
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,319
Celebrating weddings and the new year.

668
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,040
Wait, wait, wait.

669
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,199
Your tie

670
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,319
is tied in a much too formal way.

671
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:37,920
Let me do a casual way for you.

672
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,319
That's it.

673
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,640
This knot

674
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,079
looks a bit familiar.

675
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,280
This is a red scarf knot.

676
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,079
Just leave it at this.

677
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,000
No.

678
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,479
First impression is very important

679
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,640
for my parents to judge a son-in-law.

680
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,120
I still think you are wearing your tie

681
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,159
in a much too formal way.

682
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,439
You'd better take it off.

683
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,639
What's more,

684
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,320
remember the dos and don'ts

685
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
I told you yesterday.

686
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,320
Impress them.

687
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,159
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Tang.

688
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,199
Hello, hello.

689
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,360
Tang Liqi.

690
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:37,560
Brother-in-law.

691
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:39,040
Mom!

692
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,159
Your son-in-law is here!

693
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,239
Mom.

694
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,040
Have some tea, Qingyuan.

695
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,120
Thanks.

696
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,520
Xin.

697
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,360
Let me tell you,

698
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,520
your dad's gone for grocery shopping

699
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
and he'll be back soon.

700
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,120
I'll cook you guys something delicious

701
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,719
when he's back.

702
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,600
By the way, Liqi.

703
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,919
Be quick to get some fruit

704
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,040
for Qingyuan.

705
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,760
- Be quick.
- OK.

706
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,719
Mom,

707
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,560
what are you searching for?

708
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:08,320
I'll be ready in a minute.

709
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,000
Wait a moment.

710
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,399
No rush. Take your time.

711
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,239
The slower the better.

712
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:11,959
Here, Qingyuan.

713
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,919
Have some fruit.

714
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:13,840
The tangerines are very sweet.

715
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,520
Try some.

716
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,159
Thanks.

717
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,639
These are the answers
we matched up yesterday.

718
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,760
If you are not assured,

719
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,560
go to the bathroom to read them now.

720
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,919
You'll do great!

721
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,639
Found it, found it.

722
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,120
Mrs. Tang.

723
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,040
So you are Qingyuan?

724
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,479
I didn't know

725
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,679
you are so tall.

726
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,120
That's good, that's good.

727
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,479
Mom,

728
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,760
your gaze is embarrassing him.

729
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,639
Look, I forgot what I'm gonna do.

730
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:46,560
Well,

731
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,159
can I take your measurements?

732
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:53,399
Let me have a look.

733
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,919
120.

734
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:57,199
Just right.

735
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,919
Qingyuan,

736
00:35:58,919 --> 00:35:59,719
from your figure, I know at first glance

737
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,639
you are an athlete.

738
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:01,520
Here, here, here.

739
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,800
Let me have a look. Let me compare this.

740
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,959
Just right, just right.

741
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:07,479
Just the right size.

742
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:09,360
Take a seat, take a seat.

743
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:14,760
You see,

744
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,320
I heard from her brother that

745
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,520
you are here alone

746
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,239
and find it hard to buy clothes, right?

747
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:20,360
I knitted this sweater

748
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,120
for her brother at first.

749
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,040
I knitted it
one size bigger unexpectedly.

750
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,159
Not just one size bigger.

751
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,080
It's big enough to hold another man.

752
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,120
Stop talking.

753
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,120
Just now

754
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,479
I took your measurements

755
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,840
and it's the right size for you.

756
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,959
If you don't mind,

757
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,239
just take it, OK?

758
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,560
That would be great.

759
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,639
Good.

760
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,320
You see,

761
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,120
my motherly love

762
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,879
didn't go to waste, right?

763
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:48,879
Then again,

764
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:49,439
from now on

765
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,120
you are also

766
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,879
my other son,

767
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:51,479
aren't you?

768
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:52,800
Mom,

769
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,199
don't count your chickens
before they are hatched.

770
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:55,280
Thank you, Mom.

771
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,560
OK, OK, OK.

772
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,199
Great, great.

773
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,399
In this case,

774
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,800
appellative changing fee
and red packet for the new year

775
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,520
are a must.

776
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,120
Nuisance!

777
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,320
Does it hurt?

778
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,120
Qingyuan, here, here.

779
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,360
Have a tangerine.

780
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,399
It's very sweet, very sweet.

781
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,040
Mom,

782
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,919
Qingyuan bought all these for you.

783
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:14,600
Try some.

784
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:16,159
Did he?

785
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,600
Qingyuan,

786
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
it's very sweet of you.

787
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,959
How did you know

788
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,000
these are my favorites?

789
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,919
Thanks, thanks.

790
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:22,600
I did what I should do.

791
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,360
Thanks.

792
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:24,360
Mom,

793
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
act normal.

794
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,199
How am I not acting normal?

795
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,000
Didn't I do the same to you?

796
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:29,959
Now you

797
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:30,959
have a boyfriend,

798
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:31,840
you are fully-fledged,

799
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,239
so you begin to diss me, right?

800
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
I've known you for over 20 years.

801
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,320
How can I not read your mind?

802
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,639
Mom,

803
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,040
could it be you are being nervous

804
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,959
and concealing your nervousness

805
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:41,199
by making instant acquaintance?

806
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:43,600
My sister knows you well.

807
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,080
Mom, I've found earlier on that

808
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,560
you are indeed being nervous
when seeing your son-in-law.

809
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,239
You want a spanking too, don't you?

810
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,479
What's wrong with me being nervous?

811
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,080
They meet us parents for the first time,

812
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,239
and I meet my daughter's boyfriend

813
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,399
for the first time.

814
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,399
What's wrong
with me being a little nervous?

815
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,040
What's wrong? What's wrong?

816
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,959
- All right, all right.
- Tell me what's wrong?

817
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,360
I'm home.

818
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,439
Dad!

819
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,679
Here, son, take it.

820
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,560
Dad.

821
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,320
Here, take it off for me.

822
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,800
Here.

823
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:06,800
Is your mother acting normal?

824
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,560
Yes, yes.

825
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,959
Hurry up. Qingyuan is here.

826
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:11,800
Hello, Mr. Tang.

827
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,679
Is this tall guy Qingyuan?

828
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,040
Here.

829
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,919
Welcome to our home. Long time no see.

830
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,600
Long time no see.

831
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:18,800
Turns out you guys have met before?

832
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,600
We just hit it off straight away.

833
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,320
Here, take a seat, take a seat.

834
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,959
Be quick to take a seat.

835
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,040
Great.

836
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:24,679
Look,

837
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,199
Qingyuan bought this for me.

838
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,000
How nice he is!

839
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,080
He knows what I like to eat.

840
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,239
These are all your favorites.

841
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,639
Here, let me open one for you.

842
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,040
See if it's past its expiration date.

843
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,679
Well… well…

844
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Don't you know
how to start a conversation?

845
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,120
I was kidding.

846
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,000
Qingyuan, help yourself to some too.

847
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,600
Here.

848
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,479
Here, here, your favorite.

849
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,439
The atmosphere is so good
in your family,

850
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:43,120
no,

851
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:44,800
our family.

852
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,600
Enough, enough.

853
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,479
Cut it out.

854
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,000
Look at Qingyuan,

855
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,080
you can tell
he's an athlete at first glance.

856
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,199
What a good figure he has!

857
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:51,959
Liqi,

858
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:52,840
lose no time to do some exercise

859
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,639
and try to be

860
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,159
as tall as him later.

861
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,080
To keep up with my brother-in-law!

862
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,840
Go for it, go for it.

863
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,040
Take off your coat.

864
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,439
Make yourself at home.

865
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,560
Just chill out.

866
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,320
No wonder I feel so hot.

867
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,479
Look, how handsome Qingyuan is!

868
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:08,280
He's exactly the same as me

869
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,120
when I was young.

870
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:10,879
OK, OK, OK.

871
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,280
Whatever you say.

872
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:13,280
Have a tangerine, Dad.

873
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,159
Close the door.

874
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:43,479
Go ahead.

875
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:46,120
Xiaoci texted me, saying

876
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,760
you and Jiang Yitian and others

877
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,320
have got to know it all?

878
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,320
Do you have to
go through all that trouble?

879
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,000
Don't you just want to convince me

880
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,679
not to tell Mom and Dad

881
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,040
the past stories
of you and my brother-in-law

882
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,959
so as to avoid unnecessary troubles,

883
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,520
right?

884
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,840
You still call him brother-in-law?

885
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
I thought you'd be angry

886
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,040
and stick up for me back then.

887
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,080
We are not such kind of

888
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,639
affectionate siblings.

889
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,320
All right, Tang Xin.

890
00:40:12,879 --> 00:40:13,959
I'm not a fool.

891
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,239
Hasn't he lost his memory?

892
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:17,360
Who knows what happened back then?

893
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:19,120
To be honest,

894
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:20,199
if I hadn't come into contact

895
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:20,919
with him,

896
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,800
I'd suspect he fled the scene alone.

897
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,439
But from what I know about him now,

898
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,000
he won't leave his teammates behind

899
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,320
even if he gets hurt himself.

900
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:28,000
Such kind of man

901
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,520
was less likely to

902
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,479
leave his sweetheart behind

903
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:30,520
and drag out an ignoble existence.

904
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,959
It surprises me you could come up with

905
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,199
such a well-founded conclusion.

906
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,399
It took me quite a long time

907
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,199
to figure this out.

908
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,199
Of course.

909
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,840
You just need to see
who has the smarter brain.

910
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:46,719
Mom!

911
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:47,479
Mom!

912
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,000
Dinner's ready, dinner's ready.

913
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,239
Here. Dish up, dish up.

914
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:57,719
Here.

915
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:58,320
Where do I put it?

916
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,000
Put it here, put it here.

917
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,600
OK.

918
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:01,239
Give me a hand.

919
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:01,360
Give me a hand.

920
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,800
This is your mother's strong suit.

921
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:05,959
