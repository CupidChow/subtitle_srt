=Episode 24=

35
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,839
Actually, I only have one simple idea.

36
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,680
All I can think about is the game,

37
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,080
but in the game,

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,120
I have to come up with ideas
to take out my opponent.

39
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,080
Am I right?

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,080
Remember not to tell anyone else

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,959
about our meeting.

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,160
(Tang Xin)

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,560
(Mr. Xu)

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,840
(Mr. Xu)

45
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,200
(Mr. Xu)

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,880
Tang Xin, why didn't you
answer the phone?

47
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,639
It's okay

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,039
that young people get emotional.

49
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,440
But you have to

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,000
finish your work, right?

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,160
All winter long,

52
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,839
we'll have to cooperate.

53
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,600
Hello?

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,240
Hello? Mr. Zhou.

55
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,320
May I discuss something with you?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,559
Say it.

57
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,119
I want to withdraw

58
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,320
from the livestream of winter training.

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,600
What?

60
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:05,960
Tang Xin,

61
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,000
get this straight.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,759
What on earth do you mean?

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,800
Here... Here's the thing.

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,399
I'm not used to living in a dorm.

65
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,399
You went to college.

66
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,480
How can you be not used to that?

67
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,200
The shooting team

68
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,559
has arranged a single room for you.

69
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,239
Could you find

70
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,399
a poorer excuse?

71
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,959
Tang Xin,

72
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,559
tell me the truth.

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,279
I know you very well.

74
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,040
You're not

75
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,160
an irresponsible girl.

76
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,119
If you're wronged,

77
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,079
I'll compensate you when you're back.

78
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,000
Hold on for a few more days.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,279
It's a very good start.

80
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
We shouldn't give up halfway,

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,880
should we?

82
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,200
As for Xu Dian...

83
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,880
Communicate more with him.

84
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,239
We couldn't make a comeback

85
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,600
without his cooperation.

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,399
By the way,

87
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,040
did he go to the dinner

88
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,920
last night?

89
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,279
Did you get closer

90
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
to him?

91
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,359
Mr. Zhou,

92
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,079
Xu Dian...

93
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,720
Never mind.

94
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Don't send me

95
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,799
to that kind of dinner anymore.

96
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,160
Why?

97
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,160
I don't like it.

98
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,320
Qingyuan,

99
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,640
do you not dare to go upstairs

100
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,600
in case you quarrel with Tang Xin again?

101
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,040
Or do you want to find the evidence

102
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,480
to tip Xu Dian off?

103
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,519
But if you tip him off,

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,119
things are sure to get worse.

105
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
In the end, they will still

106
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,720
seek confirmation from Tang Xin.

107
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,359
I'll keep her company.

108
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:54,959
Qingyuan,

109
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,959
actually, she...

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,440
She appears to be timid.

111
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,679
But since she was born,

112
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,720
she has known her own mind

113
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,600
and she's been insightful.

114
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,760
In this matter,

115
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
she remains bitterly opposed.

116
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,000
She must have a reason for that.

117
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,559
What reason?

118
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,880
I don't know.

119
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,000
She was hurt.

120
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,519
I want the man who hurt her

121
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,519
to pay the price.

122
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,040
What's the problem with that?

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,359
You sound like

124
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,359
there's no problem.

125
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,480
But...

126
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,320
Why did she cry?

127
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,279
I don't know.

128
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:26,679
But think about it.

129
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Now that she cried,

130
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,279
she must have cried

131
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,119
for a reason.

132
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,519
You just don't know it yet.

133
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,200
Is it because I was too rude?

134
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,359
How...?

135
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,519
How about this attitude?

136
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,959
Oh, the excellent side of his face.

137
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,799
It's like there's background music
around him.

138
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,040
Okay. Good.

139
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,359
Here's your lunch.

140
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,440
Thank you.

141
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,079
Shen Qingyuan,

142
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:33,959
what are you going to do?

143
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:36,880
I'm going to feed you.

144
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,799
Be seated.

145
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:56,920
Boiled egg.

146
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,600
It's rich in protein.

147
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,160
It's also the best way

148
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,480
to preserve the nutrition

149
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,600
of eggs.

150
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,839
I don't want it.

151
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,320
How...?

152
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,880
How about some spinach?

153
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,040
It has rich lutein

154
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,559
that prevents the aging of the eyes.

155
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,000
Or have some lettuce.

156
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,839
It also has abundant dietary fiber.

157
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,279
Why do you know so much?

158
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,000
Balanced nutrition

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,519
matters a lot to an athlete.

160
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,959
I've kept that in mind.

161
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,760
I was wrong this morning.

162
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,399
I was too rude.

163
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,039
Will you still not

164
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,440
let this go?

165
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,760
Don't worry

166
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,119
or think too much.

167
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,039
Leave it to me.

168
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,559
I know you try to console me.

169
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:45,200
But I'm all right.

170
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,640
Go for the training.

171
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,719
I want some rest alone.

172
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,720
(Counseling Room)
(Consulting)

173
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,320
Dr. Ding,

174
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,159
I've tried

175
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,840
the suggestive word.

176
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,200
It worked very well.

177
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,599
That's great.

178
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,599
The psychologist Pavlov

179
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,359
once said

180
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,880
that language is a universal
conditioned reflex.

181
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,000
When you can find

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,080
a suggestive word

183
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,599
that suits and pleases you,

184
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,159
it will play

185
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,479
a positive and effective
controlling role

186
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:54,599
in your training

187
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:55,479
and competitions.

188
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:59,039
Could you tell me

189
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,359
about your suggestive word?

190
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,080
It'll sound a little bit pretentious.

191
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,799
Fine.

192
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,960
Let's keep it

193
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,119
a bit more mysterious.

194
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,479
What if it doesn't work
after you tell me?

195
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,799
Thank you, Dr. Ding.

196
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:18,440
Next week,

197
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,359
I'll come and tell you my condition.

198
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll be waiting for your good news.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,479
Okay.

200
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,480
(Consulting)

201
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:28,960
Captain.

202
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Such a rare visitor.

203
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,919
What would you like to tell me?

204
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,239
I'm just stopping by.

205
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,840
Come on in and close the door.

206
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,600
(Counseling Room)
(Consulting)

207
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:58,840
Have some water.

208
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,119
Thank you.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:34,000
(Counseling Room)
(Consulting)

210
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:38,760
Forget it.

211
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,679
There are two teams
in the training base.

212
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm afraid

213
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,719
Dr. Ding is terribly busy.

214
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,320
What would you like to tell me?

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,119
Are you on good terms

216
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,880
with Tang Xin?

217
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,159
Sort of.

218
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,200
Since we met

219
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,359
in the hospital,

220
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,599
we've got along well.

221
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,280
So, we keep in touch occasionally.

222
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,880
Do you keep close contact?

223
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,239
Not really.

224
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,440
She usually comes to me

225
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,359
on her own initiative.

226
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,840
She comes to you?

227
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,559
Shen Qingyuan,

228
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,440
are you being jealous of me?

229
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,359
I may look

230
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,599
single,

231
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,119
but I'm married.

232
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,719
I'm jealous of myself, actually.

233
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,080
Fine.

234
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,679
Tang Xin is indeed

235
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,440
a lovely girl.

236
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,200
If I were a man,

237
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,520
I might also fall in love with her.

238
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,200
You and her?

239
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,000
That's inappropriate, isn't it?

240
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,960
All right.

241
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,320
So, what on earth

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
do you want to talk about?

243
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:02,919
There's something

244
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,280
I don't know

245
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,239
how I shall deal with it.

246
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,520
You're not being a good girl.

247
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,559
Don't try to mess with me.

248
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,320
You're young.

249
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,159
Don't self-destruct.

250
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,480
(Mr. Xu)

251
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,320
What if I'm still scared

252
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,799
during the livestream?

253
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,599
Are you saying

254
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,760
that she has her own confusion?

255
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,080
Everyone

256
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,440
has some secrets

257
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,520
that he/she doesn't want
anyone else to know.

258
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,239
That's how

259
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,760
human nature is tested.

260
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,400
If you say something

261
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,840
and it hurts you more,

262
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,840
why must you say it out?

263
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,119
I just don't want this case

264
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,840
to be let go of like this.

265
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,159
Think about it.

266
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,719
Since you came,

267
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:31,000
you've been saying "this case"

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,559
instead of the real problem.

269
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,000
It means you're keeping something

270
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,080
from me, too.

271
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,880
It's the same story.

272
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,719
Anyway, just one question.

273
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Do you trust her?

274
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,039
Or

275
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,239
do you know her well enough?

276
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,919
Wait for me in the canteen.

277
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,080
I have something to ask you.

278
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,479
I get it, Dr. Ding.

279
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:13,919
Thank you.

280
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,320
You're welcome.

281
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,440
I hope

282
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,880
you and she

283
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,400
can move on as soon as possible.

284
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,840
We will.

285
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,760
So, Zhou Zuguang,

286
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,159
should you and I

287
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,440
move on, too?

288
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,440
Why is the line always busy?

289
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:02,679
What's going on?

290
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Who's Tang Xin calling?

291
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,840
Forget it.

292
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,080
I wouldn't bother to ask.

293
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,320
I'll just go have a try.

294
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:33,320
You mean

295
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,440
she doesn't eat egg white?

296
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,760
She had too much when she was little.

297
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,919
But she hasn't told me about it.

298
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,159
Xiaoci, be careful.

299
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,320
The ground is slippery, Xiaoci.

300
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,039
Stop following me.

301
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,239
What else do you want me to say?

302
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,159
Come on.

303
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,159
I still don't understand

304
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,239
what you said.

305
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,400
Let's make a clean break.

306
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,479
It's a simple sentence.

307
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:54,599
Is it so hard to understand?

308
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,400
Such a simple sentence

309
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,760
has little information.

310
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,679
Let's talk more about it.

311
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,840
Look, all these days,

312
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,040
you haven't texted me back.

313
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,880
You even deleted me.

314
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,040
What have I done wrong?

315
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,959
You should make it clear to me.

316
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,640
Du Lingfeng,

317
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,719
you've done nothing wrong.

318
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,400
The problem is

319
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,880
that we're not the same kind of people.

320
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,359
Come on.

321
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,520
Why aren't we?

322
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,959
We got along well, didn't we?

323
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,839
We got along well?

324
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,079
For example,

325
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,280
we met a drunkard that night.

326
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,760
Do you think you did the right thing?

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,719
Tang Liqi?

328
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,479
There you are.

329
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,959
You can even get along well

330
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,000
with such a jealous man
like Shen Qingyuan.

331
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,079
Liqi,

332
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,199
you're really something.

333
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,760
How about judging the case for me?

334
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,119
Are you all right?

335
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,239
Miss,

336
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:02,439
I...

337
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,760
I can't find the subway terminal.

338
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,839
Subway terminal?

339
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,119
Could you help me?

340
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,920
Fine. Fine.

341
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,959
I'll... I'll walk you there.

342
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:10,959
Which subway terminal?

343
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,119
Be careful.

344
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,520
Thank you.

345
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,160
Be careful.

346
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,359
Be careful.

347
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,280
Which way?

348
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:19,760
This way.

349
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,079
No.

350
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,079
This way.

351
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,280
What are you doing?

352
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,520
Miss,

353
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,680
let's talk more about life.

354
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,839
Get off me.

355
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,199
Get off me!

356
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,119
Get off me!

357
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,719
I'm warning you.

358
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,199
Show some respect.

359
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,400
You're quite unyielding.

360
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,040
Who?

361
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,599
Who are you?

362
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,599
He's beating me!

363
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,959
Still pretending?

364
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,000
Help! Hoodlum!

365
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,479
Somebody help!

366
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,719
Hello? The police?

367
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,599
He hit me! He hit me!

368
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,000
Xiaoci,

369
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,280
why were you so careless

370
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
at this time of night?

371
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,400
You're a girl and you're vulnerable.

372
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,479
You should have stayed away

373
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,400
from such a drunkard.

374
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,079
Or he would push his luck,

375
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,280
thinking you approached him
deliberately.

376
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,719
What did you say?

377
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,959
That was the case.

378
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,359
Think about it. What have I done wrong?

379
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,719
It happened

380
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,119
before the winter training, right?

381
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,000
Why are you still arguing about it?

382
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,319
I didn't say anything wrong,

383
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,119
did I?

384
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,640
It was late at night.

385
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,599
She is a girl

386
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,640
and that's a drunkard.

387
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,160
What if something terrible happened?

388
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,760
Is that the point?

389
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,160
Right.

390
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,119
You're men, after all.

391
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,959
To you, sexual harassment

392
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,920
of girls is like

393
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:49,719
what happens

394
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,880
in another world, right?

395
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,719
You aren't capable enough

396
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,439
to feel how the girls feel.

397
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,000
So, many people

398
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,280
can't understand it.

399
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,160
They think girls suffer
from sexual harassment

400
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,719
because they ask for that.

401
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,000
Because they wear short skirts.

402
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Because they walk home at night.

403
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,640
Because they make mistakes
with good intentions.

404
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:05,839
Because

405
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,319
there is no smoke without fire.

406
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:08,920
Right.

407
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,000
At that time,

408
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
I only cared about your safety

409
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,959
and I used the wrong words.

410
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,040
My apologies.

411
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,000
Don't bother.

412
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,040
This is only one of our problems.

413
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,520
I just want to convince you

414
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,079
why we don't make a couple.

415
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:30,520
All right.

416
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,719
I'll reflect upon myself.

417
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,479
Shall we eat first?

418
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:39,839
The dishes are getting cold.

419
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,920
I used to think

420
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,800
you were a clever man.

421
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,040
Looks like I was wrong.

422
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,199
You know what?

423
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,839
I'm not a stupid girl

424
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,520
who will suffer

425
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:50,359
and be sacrificed in the end

426
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,000
because she doesn't know how to refuse.

427
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,439
So,

428
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,560
what should we do?

429
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,520
Unless you're in the same situation

430
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:07,839
or have the same identity,

431
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,599
do not question others easily.

432
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,000
The last thing you should do is

433
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,119
to be opinionated.

434
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,319
Just try to understand.

435
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,319
The last thing you should do is

436
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,359
to be opinionated.

437
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:33,880
Just try to understand.

438
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Captain. Captain?

439
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,079
What's on your mind?

440
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,920
He's having a re-cognition of the world.

441
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,000
Don't disturb him.

442
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,160
But we'll have a competition

443
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,680
with Southeast Team in no time.

444
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,280
You will?

445
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,199
On your marks.

446
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,359
Zhou Yue,

447
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,920
this is the shooting ground

448
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,800
of our team.

449
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,319
What are you coming for?

450
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:06,719
Sorry,

451
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,199
but the light is bad
in our training ground.

452
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,119
So, we want to exchange places with you.

453
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,199
Exchange?

454
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,160
How can you exchange places

455
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,520
without telling us in advance?

456
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,119
Tell you?

457
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Who do you think you are?

458
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,680
Your team is

459
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,000
full of troublemakers.

460
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,119
I've recorded it.

461
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,239
What are you doing?

462
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:25,760
Don't stand in my way.

463
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,000
Bro,

464
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,800
looks like you want a new phone.

465
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,599
The coach is absent today.

466
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,079
I can get you a new phone.

467
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,319
Shen Qingyuan,

468
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,680
you're grabbing the wrist

469
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,760
of a shooter.

470
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,880
Aren't you going too far?

471
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,680
Take your men

472
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,479
and get back to where you came from.

473
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,760
Captain,

474
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,079
shall we let it go?

475
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,199
Get back to your positions.

476
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,760
Go, go, go.

477
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,920
Why hasn't Tang Xin come yet?

478
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,160
She asked me

479
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,239
to take her shift for a little while.

480
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,599
She's crazy about work.

481
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:27,880
She'll come soon, I guess.

482
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,640
Wait for a bit longer.

483
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,319
Tang Xin,

484
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,560
why haven't you come yet?

485
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,040
I'm afraid I have to run away.

486
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,119
How's it going?

487
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,479
We have to do the calculation.

488
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,400
But I'm not able to do that.

489
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:24,680
Captain,

490
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,439
I remember before you shoot,

491
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,520
you can always make a very close guess

492
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,719
of your performance.

493
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,319
Check this out.

494
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,800
How do you think your performance
would be?

495
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:33,959
300 shots.

496
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,760
10 for each shot.

497
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,119
I'm going to announce

498
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,119
your shooting results
for this afternoon.

499
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,079
Qingyuan,

500
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,719
Tang Xin is packing and leaving.

501
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:48,280
Where is he going?

502
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,680
Captain is leaving again?

503
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,359
If Shen Qingyuan

504
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,040
hadn't hurt Captain Zhou's wrist

505
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,400
before the competition,

506
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,719
we wouldn't have lost.

507
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,680
Yeah.

508
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,680
Captain Zhou was

509
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,959
only the third place for male shooters.

510
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,000
Only a few tenths from the second place.

511
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,479
Captain Zhou.

512
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,239
Captain Zhou,

513
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,479
don't feel sad.

514
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,959
We watched

515
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:13,800
the trick of Haiya Shooting Team.

516
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:15,959
It's quite normal.

517
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Just remain calm.

518
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,160
Otherwise,

519
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,920
we would lose more games.

520
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,760
Do you get it?

521
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,160
But I never expected

522
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,479
to lose to Chen Hai.

523
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,040
Him?

524
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,359
He has some real strength.

525
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,760
I'm sorry.

526
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:11,839
Shen Qingyuan.

527
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,520
You're not sorry to me.

528
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,839
Tang Xin, don't leave.

529
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,560
I promise I'll protect you.

530
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,680
You've been protecting me.

531
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:25,400
No longer

532
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,839
in an opinionated way.

533
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,839
If I hold you too tight,

534
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,239
I'll hurt you, too.

535
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm learning to improve.

536
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,959
Give me some time, will you?

537
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:47,640
Shen Qingyuan, thank you.

538
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,280
But promise me

539
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:55,520
that you won't make more trouble

540
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,560
about Xu Dian.

541
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,880
I don't want your athletic career

542
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,119
to be affected by anything.

543
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,640
Nor do I want it to be affected

544
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:05,199
by me.

545
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,079
I'll go wash my face.

546
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,800
What are you thinking of?

547
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,800
Shen Qingyuan,

548
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,479
I have something to tell you.

549
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,880
It's what I mentioned

550
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,560
on the rooftop last time.

551
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,079
It explains

552
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,719
why I pushed you away in the field game.

553
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,439
Because

554
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,680
when I face

555
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,560
a deliberate close contact

556
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,520
or a binding movement,

557
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,680
I can't help

558
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,119
being scared, terrified

559
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:39,400
and worried.

560
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,719
Then I resist involuntarily.

561
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,959
So, in previous cases,

562
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,520
I didn't mean to push you away.

563
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,800
It is

564
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,479
like a thorn in my heart.

565
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,800
It has to be removed anyway.

566
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,640
Shen Qingyuan,

567
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,520
I want to remove it for you.

568
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,680
I don't know whether I'll make it.

569
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,599
But for you,

570
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,760
I want to try my best.

571
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,479
A couple of years ago,

572
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,199
I was kidnapped.

573
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,439
Luckily,

574
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,479
the police arrived in time.

575
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:49,199
Otherwise, I...

576
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,640
I wasn't

577
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,800
actually hurt,

578
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
but since then,

579
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,599
I've been scared of close contact

580
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,079
with the opposite sex.

581
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,000
It's not your problem.

582
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,479
Others don't think so.

583
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:18,040
If people know about it,

584
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:19,520
they may

585
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,040
all talk behind me

586
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:22,239
and gossip about me.

587
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,760
"Right.

588
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,560
That's the girl.

589
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,119
I hear she was nearly..."

590
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,319
There could be other versions.

591
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,160
For example, "She went out of home
in the middle of the night.

592
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,599
She was indiscreet…"

593
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,439
Say no more.

594
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,439
I was very scared at that time.

595
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,199
But I didn't dare to say it.

596
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:02,719
I had no friends to console me.

597
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,839
In front of my family,

598
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,319
I didn't dare to show it.

599
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:11,319
Even in front of the boy...

600
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,599
Forget it. It's gone.

601
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:31,160
I'm tired.

602
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,760
Get in for some rest.

603
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,479
Shen Qingyuan,

604
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,119
may I rest my head on you?

605
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,800

606
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,079
from this day on,

607
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:51,000
I want to change myself for you.

608
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,000

610

on my own initiative.

611
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:00,119
Last time,

612
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,920
I also plucked up my courage

613
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,000
to kiss you, right?

614
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,119
Give me your head.

615
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,479
You sound horrible.

616
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,199

00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,399
At present,

699
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,919
the most common way

700
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,159
is exposure therapy.

701
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,800
We make the patients

702
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,959
return to where they were hurt

703
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,159
and reconstruct the traumatic scene

704
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:22,840
so that

705
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,600
they can face the harm they once had.

706
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,040
Considering her mentality,

707
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,520
it's not a good therapy for her.

708
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,159
Then let's try

709
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,040
some other way first.

710
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,159
I'm coming.

711
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,280
Tang Xin.

712
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,040
You're so early.

713
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,320
Xiaoci.

714
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,639
What's wrong?

715
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,159
Come on in.

716
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,560
You've rejected

717
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,639
all the routine therapies,

718
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,479
Shen Qingyuan.

719
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,399
Have you asked for Tang Xin's opinion?

720
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:23,840
I know

721
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,479
I can't make a decision for her.

722
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,560
It's up to her

723
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,520
to pick a therapy.

724
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,959
But I still wonder

725
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,439
if there's a therapy

726
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,080
that I can

727
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,840
also get involved.

728
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,879
Then you have to use

729
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,000
the companion method

730
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,159
I once told you about.

731
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,879
How did it work

732
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:41,120
on Tang Xin?

733
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,439
It worked.

734
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:45,639
But she didn't fully recover.

735
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,840
It must be

736
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
a long process.

737
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,760
During the treatment,

738
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:51,159
chances are that

739
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,399
the patient may get worse.

740
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,320
So, the companion

741
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,479
has to put in

742
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:58,120
far more effort

743
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,000
than he can imagine.

744
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:02,120
He has to be patient and careful.

745
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,399
Sometimes,

746
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,639
he even has to take the pressure
off the patient.

747
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:10,639
I haven't done enough.

748
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,120
After all, the focus of your life

749
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,520
is shooting.

750
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:26,399
Maybe we can consider bringing in

751
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,879
a new adhesive.

752
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,879
Are you saying

753
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,919
the other man?

754
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,360
What are you thinking of?

755
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm saying

756
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,280
animal companion therapy.

757
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,919
Animal?

758
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,560
How about plants?

759
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,320
Animal.

760
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:54,800
Only a pure and lovely

761
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,639
animal

762
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,159
can better relieve

763
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,439
the patient's stress.

764
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,159
It has to approach the patient.

765
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,959
Sometimes,

766
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:03,040
it has to communicate with the patient

767
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:05,439
and even be adored by her.

768
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,159
By the way,

769
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,040
besides animal companion therapy,

770
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,840
you can also praise Tang Xin more often.

771
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:15,120
Use more positive feedback.

772
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,639
It will make her feel

773
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,000
that she's recognized,

774
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,840
and it will increase her confidence.

775
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,760
Then she can feel

776
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,560
that she has transcended herself.

777
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,280
All these methods will help

778
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,159
with her psychological problem.

779
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,320
So, you mean

780
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,959
Shen Qingyuan promised

781
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:34,159
to have no conflict with Xu Dian,

782
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:34,879
but actually,

783
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:36,080
he didn't let it go.

784
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,800
I fear if he annoys Xu Dian,

785
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,159
Xu Dian will be desperate

786
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,040
and expose that Shen Qingyuan
left the base.

787
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:43,879
Then Shen Qingyuan's career
will be jeopardized.

788
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,560
You're right.

789
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,360
But we can't

790
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,639
just let go of such a bad man.

791
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,639
A man like him

792
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,360
will get more reckless

793
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,040
and even hurt more girls.

794
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,159
If you're worried,

795
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,000
shall we do an anonymous tip-off?

796
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,760
But an anonymous tip-off

797
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,639
can't be convincing.

798
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,760
I don't have

799
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,879
enough evidence.

800
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:05,399
Looks like

801
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:07,360
Shen Qingyuan is also trying
to find more evidence.

802
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,439
It will affect his training, right?

803
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,479
Has he

804
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:12,840
made nuisance calls

805
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,879
to you

806
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,320
or sent harassing messages?

807
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,360
Yes.

808
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,360
Terrible messages.

809
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,520
But he uses a virtual number

810
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:22,280
and it can't identify him.

811
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,399
Oh, my God!

812
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:26,840
He's apparently a habitual harasser.

813
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,919
No way.

814
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,879
We can't have Captain Shen
work on this alone.

815
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,360
It must be solved as soon as possible.

816
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,760
I think the best way is

817
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,399
to find more victims

818
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,000
and do a tip-off together.

819
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,879
If the girls who were harassed by him

820
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,800
stick together,

821
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:45,159
they can support each other.

822
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,800
But I can't even handle my own problem.

823
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:48,959
There's no way

824
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:50,399
that I can find other victims.
