=Episode 6=

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,240
(Inpatient Department)

36
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:41,879
I am…

37
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:43,160
In a hospital.

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,919
You passed out on the field

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,040
because I…

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,519
Stop!

41
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,199
Can you stop talking nonsense?

42
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,480
Who says

43
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,519
I…? I passed out because of you?

44
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,800
Why did that happen then?

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,080
How do I know?

46
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:01,959
Go ask the doctor.

47
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,440
The doctor will be here in a minute.

48
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,199
Wasn't it because I kissed you…

49
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,960
Can you drop the subject?

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,199
Haven't we agreed to draw the line?

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
You woke up.

52
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,399
You know what,

53
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,919
I would have given you an ECG

54
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,440
if you didn't struggle in your dreams.

55
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:26,000
Let me give you an examination.

56
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,160
Excuse me, please move aside.

57
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,160
Hello, again, Shen Qingyuan.

58
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,199
Dr. Ding.

59
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,440
How are you doing recently?

60
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,119
I'm fine.

61
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,520
I don't have any problems.

62
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Good for you.

63
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,639
Excuse me, doctor.

64
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,360
I'm fine.

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,559
Please let me leave the hospital.

66
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:08,600
Miss.

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,520
Your head got hurt.

68
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,399
It could be serious.

69
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,080
- I don't feel anything.
- No.

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,800
I have responsibilities to you.

71
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,080
- You must get checked out.
- I'm fine.

72
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,800
What's wrong?

73
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:14,919
Young man,

74
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,960
talk some sense into your girlfriend.

75
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,399
Concussion is kind of a big deal.

76
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,119
How could she

77
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,000
turn down the examination?

78
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:20,679
What's up?

79
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,520
Hello.

80
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,839
I'm Ding Fang.

81
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,759
Hello.

82
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,320
I've read her

83
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,279
medical notes.

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,679
There's nothing serious.

85
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,520
Let me take care of it.

86
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,600
Give us a minute.

87
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,559
OK.

88
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,679
Dr. Ding, we'll leave it to you.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Let's go.

90
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,759
You can leave, too.

91
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,919
They all left.

92
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,039
Let me help you.

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,839
You don't shake hands with people

94
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:19,480
for fear of physical contact?

95
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,920
Not really.

96
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,720
So you're not afraid of contact.

97
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,000
You're afraid of particular contacts

98
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,359
or particular people,

99
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,160
like a stranger

100
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,559
or some guy.

101
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,440
Don't be afraid.

102
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,279
I'm not treating you

103
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,799
or prying your privacy.

104
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,160
If you need to talk,

105
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,799
just tell me.

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,880
I won't tell anybody.

107
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,600
It's not a particular person.

108
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,600
It's a particular move.

109
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,920
Do you mean some restrictive move

110
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,959
will remind you of unpleasant things?

111
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:06,359
All psychological barriers
are due to some obsession.

112
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,839
You can't solve it without facing it.

113
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,480
OK.

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,679
I know to face it

115
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,200
takes a lot of courage.

116
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,239
It's difficult.

117
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,079
How is she?

118
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,959
She's fine. Don't worry.

119
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,399
But she needs to
stay for observation for two days.

120
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,839
Do you know its cause?

121
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,799
She seems to be

122
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,679
too sensitive to something

123
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,760
at the moment.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,040
Physically

125
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,440
or psychologically,

126
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,320
I haven't figured it out yet.

127
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:51,799
Take care of her.

128
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,239
Too sensitive?

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Physically?

130
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,239
Is she

131
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,920
allergic to something?

132
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:19,920
There was a cabin,

133
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,359
smoke,

134
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,920
rubber trees,

135
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,200
and...

136
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,800
(Kiss)

137
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,799
Was this...

138
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,160
(Kiss)

139
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,760
The psychological reason?

140
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,040
(Inpatient Department)

141
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:17,760
What a coincidence.

142
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,519
Why do I see you everywhere?

143
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,160
Xiaoci,

144
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,239
don't you think

145
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,119
we are intimate friends?

146
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,760
You're definitely a big boss.

147
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,839
You even need an assistant

148
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,399
to carry the fruits.

149
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,200
With two more people,

150
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,399
you can play mahjong.

151
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,559
You...

152
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:33,799
Why do you carry

153
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,480
such heavy things?

154
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,079
Give me.

155
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,040
I'm not tired.

156
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,640
Give me.

157
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,959
Tired? Thirsty?

158
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,279
Go downstairs for a cup of tea.

159
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,040
Mr. Du.

160
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,880
Just go.

161
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,559
Xiaoci,

162
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,559
what decade are you living in?

163
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:49,600
People don't play mahjong anymore.

164
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,440
It's ashamed

165
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
I'm not interested in rich men

166
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,040
like you.

167
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,119
Xiaoci.

168
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:58,880
I...

169
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,320
Come in.

170
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,200
It's you.

171
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Are you expecting someone?

172
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,160
No, no.

173
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,679
After you passed out yesterday,

174
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,080
Jiang Yitian and the other guys
were worried about you.

175
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,119
But they were too embarrassed

176
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,080
to come to a girl's ward.

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,159
So they asked me to check up on you.

178
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,520
Thanks for your concerning.

179
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,440
How are you?

180
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,520
Did you take tests?

181
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,960
It isn't serious, is it?

182
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
No, it isn't.

183
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,000
Good.

184
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,479
Your devoted viewers

185
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,479
will be relieved.

186
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,479
I'm flattered.

187
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:48,359
I don't have

188
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:50,119
livestreams to do right now.

189
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:52,960
Didn't he come?

190
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,880
He did.

191
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,359
No.

192
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,039
Who were you talking about?

193
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,960
It's good he is taking care of you.

194
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,880
Did you hear everything?

195
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,119
Of course.

196
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,960
Got anything useful?

197
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,799
No.

198
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,039
You did it too quickly.

199
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Mr. Du, I'm not like you.

200
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,359
You're not ashamed of asking anything.

201
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,960
If I knew,

202
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,039
I would ask you

203
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,080
to visit her with me,

204
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,640
right?

205
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,599
I was afraid you wouldn't like it.

206
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,400
I have nothing against you.

207
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,080
In short,

208
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,359
we are just two visitors

209
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,599
of a same patient.

210
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,080
Why would I mind?

211
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,239
The spectators of Toutiao

212
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,239
wouldn't think so.

213
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,559
You're right.

214
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,200
It's really hard to prove my innocence

215
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,760
under the public opinion.

216
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,000
Xiaoci.

217
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,039
Xiaoci.

218
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,400
In fact, it has an advantage

219
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,520
to hit the headlines.

220
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,080
What is it?

221
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,400
For example,

222
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,840
as a trending topic

223
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,080
of the gossip news,

224
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,320
if I help you to hit the headlines,

225
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,320
you will definitely get luck

226
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,440
and won't miss the target on the field.

227
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,359
Xiaoci,

228
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,840
don't you wait for me?

229
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,039
You freaked me out.

230
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,039
I thought

231
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,280
I lost a gofer.

232
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
You still have the heart to blame me.

233
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,799
Do you have any conscience?

234
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,320
Don't I have conscience?

235
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm not in the mood to eat.

236
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,719
Besides,

237
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,239
after I get out of the hospital,

238
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,960
I'll still be your gofer.

239
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,799
If the company goes out of business,

240
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,119
I'll lose my job.

241
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,440
What you said about the company...

242
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,239
Rest assured.

243
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,559
Tell you what,

244
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,200
I never go back

245
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,000
on my words.

246
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,719
I'll always keep my promise.

247
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,799
I'll meet Mr. Zhou another day.

248
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,119
Great.

249
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:58,960
Get well soon.

250
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,719
Eat these.

251
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,840
869 yuan in total.

252
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,320
WeChat or Alipay?

253
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Do you take credit card?

254
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,400
I don't have WeChat.

255
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,359
Really?

256
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,320
Credit card is fine.

257
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,840
(Outpatient Department)

258
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,719
I should ask Xiaoci to wait for me.

259
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,119
It's convenient that I give her a ride.

260
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:53,599
Why do I become a fool

261
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,960
whenever I see her?

262
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,719
It's because she has a glib tongue.

263
00:11:58,479 --> 00:11:59,799
Interesting.

264
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,919
Interesting.

265
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,719
Mr. Du, how do you do?

266
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:09,799
You're...

267
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,440
I'm Zhou Zuguang from Rui Live,

268
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,119
Tang Xin's direct superior.

269
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,039
Mr. Zhou.

270
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,840
Tang Xin and I

271
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,719
were talking about you just now.

272
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,479
So,

273
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,719
do you come to visit Tang Xin?

274
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,359
No.

275
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,200
I came here specially to see you.

276
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,559
Why?

277
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,840
I want to cooperate with you.

278
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,599
I'm listening.

279
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,119
I hear that you've joined

280
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,239
the shooting team.

281
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,520
It's so exciting.

282
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,640
Nowadays,

283
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,400
people of sportsdom are eager to
enter the entertainment circle.

284
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,679
You've generated positive energy.

285
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,719
We're experienced

286
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,119
in the field of

287
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,640
sports livestream.

288
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,960
We can help you

289
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,119
to create a better public image.

290
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,919
Of course,

291
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,760
it will also be helpful

292
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,719
for the brand promotion

293
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,520
of the sports industry of your company.

294
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,760
Mr. Zhou.

295
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,080
Nice to meet you.

296
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm looking forward to working with you.

297
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,159
What are you doing?

298
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:18,719
Where did you get the fruits?

299
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,239
Du Lingfeng just came.

300
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,119
Don't eat it.

301
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,039
Dirty.

302
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,200
What are you doing?

303
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,919
It just fell on the quilt.

304
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,280
What a waste!

305
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,960
You should eat this.

306
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,359
Pomegranates contain more Vitamin C

307
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,280
than apples.

308
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,919
What do you want?

309
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,200
I'll be responsible for you.

310
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:53,880
I don't want you

311
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,280
to be responsible for me.

312
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,840
I'm the one who hit you,

313
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,919
otherwise, you wouldn't
end up in the hospital.

314
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,159
It was an accident.

315
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,840
Don't mind.

316
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,320
You mind the word responsibility
very much.

317
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,119
Why do I mind it?

318
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,280
I'm just afraid...

319
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,520
I'll take care of the medical expenses.

320
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,960
Why don't you talk?

321
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,679
No.

322
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,559
The one who minds the word
responsibility

323
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,640
is you.

324
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,919
I think you are

325
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,039
a little moody.

326
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,559
That's you.

327
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:56,679
You're not just moody.

328
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,119
You're a fish with only
7 seconds of memory.

329
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,400
What do you mean?

330
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:04,919
Nothing.

331
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,359
Eat.

332
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,520
I'm going to wash my hands.

333
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:44,960
Why don't you eat?

334
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,520
I have to peel the pomegranate.

335
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,080
I'd rather have an apple.

336
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,359
Shen Qingyuan,

337
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,320
what are you doing?

338
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,640
Do an experiment.

339
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,359
What do you want?

340
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,520
Help you to find out the cause

341
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,280
that provoked the strong reaction.

342
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Dr. Ding said

343
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,599
you were probably allergic to something.

344
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,119
So I collected

345
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,119
all the allergens you might contact

346
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:12,960
that day.

347
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,599
Don't you really know the reason?

348
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,719
Do you?

349
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,039
Shen Qingyuan,

350
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,599
do you have an obsession with anything?

351
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,119
Yes.

352
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:45,760
You.

353
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
You're...

354
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:03,840
Testing allergens.

355
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,880
But none of these
seems to be the allergen.

356
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,239
It's OK.

357
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,119
You can leave now.

358
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll help her.

359
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,880
I'll be back later.

360
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,719
Don't bother.

361
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,880
OK, let me see.

362
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,560
Do you want to talk to me?

363
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:44,760
No.

364
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,560
It's OK.

365
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,280
Anyway, I'll be here

366
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
for the next couple of days.

367
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,280
Whatever you need,

368
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,920
feel free to tell me.

369
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,119
Have a rest, then.

370
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,479
Are you familiar with him?

371
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:17,959
In the past few years?

372
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Shen Qingyuan.

373
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Shen Qingyuan.

Dr. Ding,

394
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,439
do you have a moment?

395
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,160
I have something to tell you.

396
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,319
Years ago,

397
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,160
I've known Shen Qingyuan.

398
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,280
But he disappeared later.

399
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,239
But I always believed

400
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,760
there was a reason.

401
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,000
He wasn't that kind of guy.

402
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,920
Do you really believe him?

403
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:15,479
I'm not flattering him.

404
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:16,479
He used to be

405
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,439
very dedicated before,

406
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,280
especially to shooting.

407
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,520
So he is still

408
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,040
the number one shooter of Haiya.

409
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,280
After all these years,

410
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,640
I met him again.

411
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,040
And he is still glowing
on the shooting range.

412
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,680
I'm kind of relieved.

413
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,719
After all, it means

414
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,400
he is still the same guy.

415
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:39,520
Even if he doesn't want to

416
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,000
bring up what happened before,

417
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,680
and he shut me out,

418
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,839
I don't mind it.

419
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,040
But you're still affected.

420
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,280
Because our relationship is...

421
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,920
Figuratively speaking,

422
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,760
we are at the two ends

423
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
of a rubber band.

424
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,880
I try to maintain my position

425
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,959
and our relationship.

426
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,760
But he...

427
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,520
The two of us

428
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,199
are undoubtedly in a same relationship,

429
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,239
but I don't know

430
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:16,280
what he is thinking about.

431
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,479
For a moment,

432
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:18,680
he tries to break the band;

433
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,280
for another moment,
he bounces back to me.

434
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,680
It's just like this time.

435
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,359
Have you ever thought

436
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,239
it's actually a

437
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,479
magical bond.

438
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,839
I do.

439
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,959
But I don't understand

440
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,280
why he wouldn't

441
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,520
talk about what happened before.

442
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,479
I really want to

443
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:43,000
ask him about that thing.

444
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,199
He had a car accident before.

445
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,520
But

446
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,160
he looks absolutely normal.

447
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,520
Selective amnesia

448
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,640
is when a person's brain

449
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,599
is stimulated by external factors

450
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,839
or his brain

451
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,400
gets hit by something,

452
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,920
he'll forget the things

453
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,760
he doesn't want to remember

454
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,760
or the people he wants to avoid.

455
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,479
Do you mean

456
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,959
he doesn't remember
the things before the accident?

457
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,439
Not just the things.

458
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,319
He may have forgotten you.

459
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,079
I used to make a few

460
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,160
discreet inquiries with him,

461
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,439
but he showed no signs

462
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,280
of knowing you.

463
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,079
That's why he reacted like that

464
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,599
when he was with me.

465
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:50,319
So he forgot me.

466
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,040
Now you know the truth.

467
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,280
Will you tell him?

468
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,719
I've already

469
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:04,640
affected him a lot.

470
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,280
If I tell him all about it,

471
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,680
I'm afraid it will affect his grades.

472
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,920
Shooting is his only target.

473
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,239
I can't ruin him.

474
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,239
You've been worried about

475
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,560
Shen Qingyuan these years.

476
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,239
You may have neglected yourself.

477
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
I might have.

478
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,880
(Haiya University Gymnasium)

479
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:51,640
Captain Shen.

480
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,800
Coach Zhang let me ask you

481
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,040
why you didn't
come for training yesterday.

482
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,160
For your information,

483
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,040
I'm not blaming you
in the name of the coach,

484
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,479
though I do

485
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:03,400
want to know the reason.

486
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,520
I was looking after Tang Xin yesterday.

487
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,839
Actually, I visited her, too.

488
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,560
She seemed to be fine.

489
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,520
But why did you

490
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,880
admit it so frankly?

491
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:17,319
I suggest you

492
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,839
keep it between us.

493
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,839
As for the coach,

494
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,520
I'll keep it a secret for now.

495
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,439
Thanks.

496
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,839
It's nothing.

497
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,959
However,

498
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,760
have you ever considered

499
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:28,599
if you really want to

500
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,920
keep Tang Xin,

501
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:30,640
what kind of relationship

502
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,239
would you maintain with her

503
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:32,839
that wouldn't

504
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,160
affect your career?

505
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Do you feel reluctant to tell me?

506
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,160
No, I don't.

507
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,599
I just don't know the answer.

508
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,439
It's OK.

509
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,479
The process doesn't matter.

510
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,239
I hope you can balance

511
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:51,040
your relationship and your career.

512
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,719
I also hope you would

513
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,640
always be my

514
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,520
best partner.

515
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,599
Otherwise,

516
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:58,160
I may get you back

517
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,400
from Tang Xin.

518
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,079
I was joking.

519
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,640
Come for training tomorrow.

520
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,959
Don't get caught again.

521
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,479
Dr. Ding,

522
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,199
what should I do?

523
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,920
Because of the work,

524
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,560
I'll see him inevitably.

525
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,959
But facing him

526
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,520
makes me exhausted.

527
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,400
And now,

528
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,959
I know his situation...

529
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:33,839
Why don't you
let nature take its course?

530
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:34,839
Lay down

531
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,359
the complicated emotions.

532
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,640
When it's time to face it,

533
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,959
just face it.

534
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,239
Most important of all,

535
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:42,040
you should unburden your heart.

536
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,839
That may help you

537
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,959
to find a comfortable way to get along.

538
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,400
But I can't say anything.

539
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,800
If I tell him

540
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,079
our previous relationship

541
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,400
and the things years ago,

542
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,520
what would he think of me?

543
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,959
If you don't want to tell him,

544
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:01,040
you can choose another way

545
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,439
to awaken his memories.

546
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,839
Thus you'll know the truth.

547
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,599
Thus I'll know the truth?

548
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,520
(Zhou Zuguang)
Dr. Ding.

549
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,479
I have to answer the phone.

550
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,119
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

551
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,920
Du Lingfeng agreed to cooperate?

552
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,040
Seriously, Xiaoci?

553
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,839
You encouraged Shen Qingyuan

554
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,079
to pursue his true love?

555
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,800
What should you do?

556
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,319
You don't really expect him

557
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,560
to return to you, do you?

558
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,040
Can you think straight?

559
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,800
I've never thought about

560
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,000
being with your Prince Charming, OK?

561
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,880
No.

562
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,359
How can a campus belle

563
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,880
not be with a campus beau?

564
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,599
Don't you think so?

565
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,439
My possessive desire
for Shen Qingyuan

566
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,319
is confined only to work.

567
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,760
Frankly speaking,

568
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,920
I don't want him to have a relationship.

569
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,199
But I have no choice now.

570
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:01,439
I can't talk him out of it.

571
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,199
I'd better wait and see.

572
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:03,839
Then why did you

573
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,199
talk about stepping on,

574
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,199
no,

575
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,560
treading on,

576
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,000
treading on Du Lingfeng?

577
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,239
He's different.

578
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,959
He is arrogant

579
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,640
and glib at the same time.

580
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:17,599
I just

581
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,760
want him to lose badly.

582
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,400
OK. Talk to you later.

583
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,040
I'm going to practice.

584
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,839
Don't be late, will you?

585
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,680
Yes.

586
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,960
(PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELING)

587
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,359
Come in.

588
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
For so long,

589
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,680
it's the first time

590
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,239
you come to my office voluntarily.

591
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,199
Do you want to talk about her?

592
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,800
It isn't a physical problem,

593
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,280
is it?

594
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,680
So you want me to help her

595
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,920
to solve her psychological problems?

596
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,880
I was the reason
why she became like this.

597
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,319
It's my responsibility to figure it out.

598
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,479
You care about her, don't you?

599
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,599
Can you do anything?

600
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,760
She has vegetative system dysfunction.

601
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,920
It's a common disease

602
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,040
nowadays.

603
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,199
Apart from organic lesions,

604
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:11,040
it's more of a mental disorder.

605
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,880
So what's the treatment?

606
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:15,599
Accompany.

607
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,239
You finally come.

608
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,439
Where is it?

609
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,280
VIPs box of the concert.

610
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,079
Is it good enough?

611
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:38,760
What's Xiaoci's attitude

612
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,199
towards me?

613
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,280
It isn't very clear.

614
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,719
VIPs box of the concert

615
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,000
and you give me such an answer?

616
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,119
She said she felt different about you.

617
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:51,760
Really?

618
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,479
Sure.

619
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,359
What do you mean?

620
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,160
With such a face,

621
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,680
a family,

622
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,599
and personality charm,

623
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,400
any girl

624
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,640
would throw herself into my arms.

625
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:07,119
From what you told me,

626
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,319
there's nothing special

627
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,400
about Xiaoci.

628
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,719
She just played

629
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,640
hard to get.

630
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,199
Sir, don't flatter yourself.

631
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,239
There are many guys

632
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,400
who are tall, rich and handsome
that chase Xiaoci.

633
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,319
Did you see that she accepted anyone?

634
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:21,359
There are many?

635
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,880
There are a lot.

636
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,760
She doesn't accept any of them?

637
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,800
Of course.

638
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,239
In my opinion,

639
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,839
Xiaoci just socializes with them
instead of

640
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,680
going out with them.

641
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,359
So her relationship status

642
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,520
remains a mystery.

643
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,719
I haven't seen her Mr. Right.

644
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,760
Why?

645
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,400
First,

646
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,160
she is career-minded.

647
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,560
I understand.

648
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,160
Second, she isn't a butterfly.

649
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,199
She has a bottom line.

650
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:43,119
The last but not the least...

651
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,839
What's that?

652
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,760
She doesn't think much of any guy.

653
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,520
She said she liked to win.

654
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,400
Anyone who

655
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
falls in love,

656
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,959
no,

657
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,760
not just in love, but in work, too,

658
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,199
anyway, anyone who falls down first,

659
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:57,239
is a loser.

660
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,199
She said I was different.

661
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,160
Does that mean

662
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,800
she thinks I may win?

663
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:07,239
Pardon me.

664
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,560
(Inpatient Department)

665
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,959
Why do you come again?

666
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,719
Have you finished?

667
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,439
Is it good?

668
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,359
It's just pomegranate.

669
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,239
It's good.

670
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:52,239
Do you live alone?

671
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Why do you want to know?

672
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,359
You'll leave the hospital soon.

673
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,319
Great.

674
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,319
You don't have to
pay more medical expenses.

675
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,560
It's not safe living alone.

676
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,839
Have you considered
to find someone to live with you?

677
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,359
I'm fine.

678
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,839
I always live alone.

679
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,640
Our dormitories
are all bedroom apartments.

680
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,560
Couldn't you find a roommate?

681
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,119
Kind of.

682
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,160
I don't want to trouble others.

683
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:27,839
If it were you,

684

would you like to
live with someone else?

685

If you like,

686
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,400
I will.

687
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,280
What did you say?

688
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,239
I said,

689
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,800
I would live with you.

690
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,640
No, Shen Qingyuan.

691
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,760
Don't be afraid of troubling me.

692
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,280
It's my responsibility.

693
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,439
As for the department,

694
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:54,439
I'll find a way.

695
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,359
Well...

696
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,959
What's going on?

697
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,439
Hello, Tang Xin.

698
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,319
Dr. Ding,

699
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,400
Shen Qingyuan suddenly asked

700
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,640
to live with me.

701
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,479
Did he say that?

702
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,400
Yes.

703
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,880
But I think

704
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,839
it may be a way

705
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,760
to solve your problems.

706
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,439
You can think about it.

707
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,239
I support your decision.

708
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:58,079
You'll find an apartment eventually.

709
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,400
Why do you suddenly want to see me?

710
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,040
I want to ask a favor of you, of course.

711
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,679
Can't you talk about it on the phone?

712
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:10,679
What,

713
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,159
do I need a reason

714
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,000
to see you now?

715
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,840
You're really a big boss.

716
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,959
Honorable men are always busy.

717
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,040
But I don't see

718
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,600
what you're getting up to.

719
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,320
Well, Ding Fang,

720
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,199
I was just transferred to Rui Live.

721
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,719
My work starts to gain ground.

722
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,919
Do you have to be sarcastic like that?

723
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,199
Weren't you marginalized

724
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,919
by the TV station?

725
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,800
What do you know about it?

726
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,080
You don't tell me anything.

727
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,959
How do I know about it?

728
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,080
Are you still working in the hospital?

729
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,800
I am also in charge of

730
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,120
psychological counseling

731
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,439
for Haiya Shooting Team.

732
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,800
Haiya?

733
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,040
Is something wrong with the team?

734
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:02,199
No.

735
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,320
It's not a big deal.

736
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,120
I want you to switch a dormitory

737
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,439
for Tang Xin.

738
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,840
Don't tell her I asked you.

739
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,479
Since when

740
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,040
have you been so acquainted with her?

741
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,760
Besides,

742
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,280
where do I

743
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,560
find another dormitory for her?

744
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,120
Isn't the one we used to live in

745
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,280
good enough?

746
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:23,639
No.

747
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,439
Do you think the apartment

748
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,439
is useless now?

749
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,600
Are you telling me

750
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,560
you still think

751
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,439
it's useful?

752
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,800
Bear.

753
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:13,239
Let's say goodbye to the apartment.

754
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,800
It's heavy.

755
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:33,439
Allow me.

756
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,399
Thank you.

757
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,159
Sir,

758
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,239
just follow the road

759
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,479
and keep on walking.

760
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,879
I'll send you the room number.

761
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:53,919
OK. No problem.

762
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,639
- Do you live here today?
- Do you live here today?

763
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,320
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

764
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,439
Let's go.

765
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,919
Is it here?

766
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:28,479
Come on.

767
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:39,959
Is it this one?

768
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:40,520
Yeah.

769
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,639
401.

770
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:42,879
This one.

771
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:45,159
Open the door.

772
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,439
Don't you have the key?

773
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,719
Yeah.
