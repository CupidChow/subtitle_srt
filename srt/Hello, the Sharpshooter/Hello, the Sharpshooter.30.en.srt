35
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:36,959
Shen Qingyuan,

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,519
are you all right?

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,559
Are you recalling something?

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,760
Did I say anything?

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,040
No.

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,680
Are you cold?

41
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,360
Under this circumstance,

42
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,479
if he started to talk,

43
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,240
his heart would probably

44
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,800
pop out.

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,399
But if he didn't,

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,399
it would probably

47
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,360
explode inside.

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,679
Shen Qingyuan,

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,639
are you crying?

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,960
Of course not.

51
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,520
It's pitch-dark.

52
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,559
Even if you are, I can't see it.

53
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm not crying.

54
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,000
You'd better pray

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,720
for a longer blackout

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,600
so that

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,639
I won't be able to

58
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,160
see you melting.

59
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,720
I said I'm not.

60
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,279
I don't believe you.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,839
Touch it.

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,119
See?

63
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:04,880
No tears.

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,199
Your face is burning.

65
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,640
Does this

66
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,000
make you uncomfortable?

67
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,640
Are you scared now?

68
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,279
Is this what kissing

69
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,200
feels like?

70
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,359
Do you like it?

71
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,079
It's strange.

72
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,079
Thanks.

73
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,679
You're welcome.

74
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,440
Good night.

75
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,120
(No. 64 Building 33)

76
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,679
I've decided to give up

77
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,959
the gamble between us.

78
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,839
I won't force you

79
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,920
to take over the company, either.

80
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,040
You decide

81
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,239
what kind of life you live.

82
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,000
No one knows

83
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,040
which will come first,

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
tomorrow or accident.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,480
(Inpatient)

86
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,480
Oh, my God!

87
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,920
What did I do yesterday?

88
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,760
Shen Qingyuan?

89
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,480
Does this

90
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:41,920
make you uncomfortable?

91
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:54,640
Has he recalled our past?

92
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,720
Oh, no! I need...

93
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,880
I need some fresh air.

94
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,679
Shen Qingyuan,

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,799
let me go.

96
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,919
I hope he didn't

97
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,960
hit himself last night.

98
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,479
Not on his wound, please.

99
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,400
What food can soothe his pain?

100
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,559
Red bean and pearl barley buns are good.

101
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,080
He needs protein, too.

102
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,320
Eggs will do.

103
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,919
Collagen can speed up

104
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
his recovery.

105
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,400
One trotter for him.

106
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,440
And calcium.

107
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,559
What's for calcium?

108
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,280
Pork chop soup is perfect.

109
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,400
Dr. Ding.

110
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,559
You're here already?

111
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,479
I'm at the canteen.

112
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,440
Are you getting food

113
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,400
for yourself and Shen Qingyuan?

114
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,280
Dr. Ding,

115
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:06,520
there was a blackout
at the hospital last night,

116
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,840
and Shen Qingyuan

117
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,359
hid under the bed

118
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,919
again.

119
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,440
He seemed to have recalled something

120
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,159
but I was too worried

121
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,039
to ask.

122
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,239
And then...

123
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,840
You had a breakthrough?

124
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,119
When he grabbed me,

125
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,479
I wasn't that scared.

126
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,960
Actually,

127
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,159
I wasn't

128
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,359
at all.

129
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,280
Tang Xin,

130
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,840
that's the best news I've ever heard.

131
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,880
I'm happy for you

132
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,119
that everything

133
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:49,479
is going on the right track.

134
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
Thank you, Dr. Ding.

135
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,960
You know,

136
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,840
Shen Qingyuan

137
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,960
does that

138
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,039
every time it thunders and rains.

139
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,960
If I force him

140
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,159
to recall the past,

141
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,840
what will happen to him?

142
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,119
He'll either regain

143
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
his memory quickly

144
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,200
or become worse.

145
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,679
The good thing is

146
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,840
you two

147
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,239
have probably gotten over

148
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,880
tons of problems together

149
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,719
when living

150
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,400
under the same roof,

151
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,840
but that's still not enough.

152
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,159
Since Shen Qingyuan was wounded,

153
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,799
you've been taking care of him

154
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,039
every day.

155
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,440
That's good for you

156
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,799
because it gives you a chance

157
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,679
to protect him

158
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,039
instead of being protected.

159
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,320
That brings you closer and closer to him

160
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,000
from a stranger to a friend

161
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,880
to his protector.

162
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:52,359
During this process,

163
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,359
you've also become

164
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,359
stronger mentally.

165
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,119
Finally,

166
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,840
on the night of the blackout,

167
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,359
you were

168
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,799
metamorphosed, right?

169
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,080
If Shen Qingyuan

170
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,520
goes through

171
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,799
such a similar process,

172
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,280
he's likely to

173
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,640
recover anytime.

174
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,239
No need to push him, though.

175
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:26,880
Wake up.

176
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,880
Hey.

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,599
Let's sleep for a few more minutes.

178
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,880
Bed 16,

179
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
what are you doing?

180
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,599
Were you having a weird dream?

181
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,799
Sorry.

182
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,280
You seem lost.

183
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:44,520
Put down your legs

184
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,599
for the routine check.

185
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,559
Does it hurt?

186
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:03,719
No.

187
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,080
And here?

188
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,479
No.

189
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,000
It's almost healed.

190
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:12,919
Still,

191
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,119
don't put too much pressure on this leg,

192
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,200
got it?

193
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,760
Have a good one.

194
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:17,640
Thanks.

195
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,239
Oh,

196
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,559
about the car accident...

197
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,359
Yes?

198
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,159
In January 2015,

199
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Shen Qingyuan was taken to

200
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,960
No. 9 Hospital after the car accident

201
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,239
in Yongcheng.

202
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,359
It's said he got emergency treatment

203
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,440
at the nearest hospital first

204
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,200
before transferred there

205
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,080
out of the city overnight.

206
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,880
Yongcheng.

207
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,559
Do you know that place?

208
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:57,919
Dr. Ding,

209
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,119
I have reason to believe

210
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,719
that was the day

211
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,719
of his accident.

212
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,080
At that time,

213
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,719
we were having

214
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,840
our last date.

215
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,880
We missed the firework show,

216
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,320
and Shen Qingyuan said

217
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,400
he'd make it up to me with a surprise.

218
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,520
Then

219
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,640
we got stopped by robbers.

220
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,440
Let's take a photo together

221
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,679
when the fireworks are in the air.

222
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,280
That will record our moment forever,

223
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,119
you know.

224
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,520
Make sure I look good in it.

225
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,479
I'll try.

226
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,039
What's that supposed to mean?

227
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,479
I mean...

228
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,119
Whatever.

229
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,000
I must look pretty.

230
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,640
It's windy.

231
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,280
We're gonna

232
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,559
keep this photo forever.

233
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,239
Let's have a trial first.

234
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,679
Is letting off fireworks

235
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,159
the extra surprise you said?

236
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,679
Take a guess.

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,719
Don't move!

238
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,799
- Stop!
- Don't move!

239
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,640
Back off!

240
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,559
Let me go!

241
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,679
Don't move!

242
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,359
Where's your money?

243
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,799
Tang Xin...

244
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,440
Step back!

245
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,640
There's not a dime

246
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,039
in your freaking bag!

247
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,039
Go get us money,

248
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,479
or she's dead!

249
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,440
Tang Xin...

250
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,280
Step back!

251
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:30,400
Go!

252
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,239
Shen Qingyuan,

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,159
just do what they say.

254
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,200
Don't piss me off,

255
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,559
or I'll kill her now!

256
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,679
Tang Xin...

257
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,960
Shen Qingyuan, go!

258
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,440
I'll be right back.

259
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,719
Hey,

260
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,159
no cops!

261
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,400
I guess

262
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,760
he got hit

263
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,479
on the way to the bank.

264
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,559
Since then,

265
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,200
I haven't seen him again.

266
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,640
Are you sure?

267
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,280
Positive.

268
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,280
The date is a match.

269
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,159
His school said

270
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,679
he quit because he was sick.

271
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,119
I was worried about him.

272
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,440
Still, that doesn't explain

273
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,119
why he's got

274
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,400
PTSD

275
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,440
ever since

276
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,119
he got hit

277
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,599
on the way to the bank.

278
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,159
Is it

279
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,919
because of guilt

280
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,039
that he failed to protect you?

281
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,479
Or

282
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,960
he didn't go to the bank?

283
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,159
No way.

284
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,520
He isn't that kind of person.

285
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,679
Don't take it to heart.

286
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,239
That's just my theory.

287
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,599
You know him better than me,

288
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,119
don't you?

289
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,919
Tang Xin,

290
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:55,239
do you still remember what you said?

291
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,400
What matters is

292
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,359
you're together now.

293
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,520
I see your point.

294
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,479
I like what we have now.

295
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,280
He can't be distracted when preparing

296
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,680
for his most important competition.

297
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,040
OK.

298
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,160
I should go.

299
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,000
Keep me updated.

300
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,520
You're up.

301
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,160
Where were you?

302
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,439
I went to get food.

303
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,640
Then Dr. Ding dropped by

304
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,719
and we had a chat.

305
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,839
The nurse just came.

306
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,599
She said I could start doing

307
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,719
rehabilitation exercises soon.

308
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,319
Really?

309
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
That's great!

310
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,040
Are you curious about this?

311
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,760
No.

312
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,199
I just find it

313
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,119
special.

314
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,359
Shooting

315
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,479
is a still sport.

316
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,920
There was a time

317
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,359
I kept getting

318
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,280
ticking watches

319
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,000
and put them around me

320
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,079
during training

321
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
to see if I'd be distracted.

322
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,400
What's so funny?

323
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,760
I'd only do the same

324
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,959
to wake me up

325
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,439
but I'd stay still.

326
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,160
Since I had the accident,

327
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,359
I've only needed

328
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,079
this particular pocket watch.

329
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,920
Was it with him

330
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,239
on the day of the accident?

331
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,199
But it's stopped working

332
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,640
since a long time ago.

333
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,119
So I have no idea

334
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,040
why I'm keeping it.

335
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,680
Better not

336
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,119
push him too hard these days.

337
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,199
You'll probably feel calmer

338
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:20,520
in front of a stopped watch.

339
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,199
Enough about that.

340
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,520
Have your breakfast

341
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,680
before it gets cold.

342
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:29,719
And

343
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:30,880
once you finish,

344
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,199
I have good news for you.

345
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,360
(Inpatient)

346
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,359
You're all good now?

347
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,760
That's what Dr. Ding said.

348
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,040
Don't give me that look.

349
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,800
It's creepy.

350
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:01,920
Two months.

351
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,319
What?

352
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,160
61 days.

353
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
It's been 61 days

354
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
since I said I like you.

355
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,439
So?

356
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,680
You owe me 61 kisses.

357
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,160
Now that you're fine,

358
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,640
you gotta make it up to me.

359
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,079
Shen Qingyuan,

360
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,680
you're being ridiculous.

361
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,560
Wait.

362
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,239
There should be morning

363
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,119
and goodnight kisses,

364
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,119
so it should be

365
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,160
122, all together.

366
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,680
This morning's included.

367
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,199
Do it now.

368
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,760
Shen Qingyuan,

369
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,359
knock it off.

370
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,359
I'm needed elsewhere.

371
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,079
Gotta go.

372
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,520
Kiss me goodbye then.

373
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,199
Shen Qingyuan,

374
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,079
I can't wait for you to recover.

375
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,560
Neither can I wait to go back

376
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,680
to fight for the ticket to the Olympics.

377
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,800
Coach Zhang.

378
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,160
Take a look, sir.

379
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,319
I'll allow it.

380
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,520
Thank you, sir.

381
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,560
What's Zhou Yue's game?

382
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,560
Why did he talk to

383
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,359
our coach all of a sudden?

384
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,959
I'm sensing his hostility.

385
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,119
That can't be good.

386
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:05,880
Hey.

387
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:06,880
Hey,

388
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,000
keep an eye on Zhou Yue.

389
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,439
Zhou Yue.

390
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,520
Be discreet.

391
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:11,680
You got it.

392
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,319
Coach.

393
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,359
Is this for Rui Live?

394
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:27,439
No, no.

395
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
I'm just getting more videos of you

396
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,400
for future use.

397
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:31,800
OK.

398
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,000
That's enough.

399
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:33,839
Yes, sir.

400
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,560
(Asking for Leave)

401
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,280
(Shen Qingyuan Test Results)

402
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,040
You've become

403
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,920
well enough

404
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,359
for rehabilitation exercises.

405
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,640
Can I go back

406
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,920
to do them?

407
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,520
Better stay here

408
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,880
and we can watch you anytime.

409
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,920
You can be off the wheelchair.

410
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:06,160
Walk with your crutch

411
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,479
to the Rehabilitation Center with me.

412
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,839
We'll make a plan for you first.

413
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,160
Come on.

414
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:12,640
I got you.

415
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:13,920
Be careful.

416
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,400
I'll help you.

417
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,160
Be careful. Slowly.

418
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,520
Young man,

419
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,239
how old are you?

420
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,400
You can go there alone.

421
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,719
Miss,

422
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,920
you don't need to come.

423
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,760
Let's go.

424
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,160
Come on.

425
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:36,280
Let's go.

426
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:37,839
Keep your eyes

427
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,760
off her.

428
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,119
I mean,

429
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,479
she can

430
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,719
hold you when you walk.

431
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,160
And when do you do your exercises?

432
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:45,640
You can't

433
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,719
do them without her?

434
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,280
Move it.

435
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:49,959
Shen Qingyuan,

436
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,199
just go without me.

437
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:52,719
This way.

438
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,239
Be careful.

439
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Be careful. Slowly.

440
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,800
Wait. Hold on.

441
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,640
Put on your coat.

442
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,280
Be careful.

443
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,880
What's up, Xiaoci?

444
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,479
Tang Xin,

445
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,319
you know where Du Lingfeng is?

446
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,880
Du Lingfeng!

447
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,800
What are you doing here?

448
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,839
How did you find

449
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,920
my hideout?

450
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,119
What's wrong?

451
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,760
Did you and Shen Qingyuan fight?

452
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm not surprised.

453
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,079
If

454
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,640
you two are over,

455
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,520
just let him go.

456
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,439
I'll set him up with other...

457
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,560
Why did you grab my phone?

458
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,479
You know how many times

459
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,520
I've called you?

460
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,920
So has Xiaoci!

461
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,800
But you didn't pick up.

462
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,920
Have you blocked her number?

463
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,520
Can't I have some space?

464
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
I should've blocked yours, too.

465
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:12,920
You know

466
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,319
how worried she is?

467
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,359
She's never

468
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,160
asked anyone for help,

469
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,119
- but just now...
- Tang Xin,

470
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:19,959
save it.

471
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,760
I got it.

472
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,599
All those calls

473
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,599
and cheering

474
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,479
are all for Shen Qingyuan,

475
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,359
not me.

476
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:31,079
I've blacklisted her

477
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,560
to put an end

478
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
to our relationship.

479
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:35,680
Wait.

480
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,199
We've never had one.

481
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
There's nothing to end.

482
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:41,880
Du Lingfeng,

483
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,079
you've got in

484
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,239
way over your head

485
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,119
with this

486
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,920
ridiculous love triangle among us.

487
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:48,199
Xiaoci...

488
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,239
Xiaoci only likes you!

489
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:56,640
Really?

490
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:58,760
Have I ever lied to you?

491
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,160
Why would I lie

492
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,119
about her affection?

493
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,479
You're trying to push her to me

494
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,760
so that you can have Shen Qingyuan

495
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,520
all to yourself, right?

496
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,119
Besides,

497
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:12,160
if what you said is true,

498
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,680
why did she ignore me?

499
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,800
What did I do wrong?

500
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,760
If I tell him

501
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,280
about Xiaoci's past...

502
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:24,920
No.

503
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,959
I can't betray her

504
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,719
and leak her privacy.

505
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,280
Hey.

506
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,640
Where are you?

507
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,119
Bed 16,

508
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,760
are you trying to sneak out again?

509
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,680
Please, Doctor.

510
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,599
Don't be mad.

511
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,640
He must have his reason,

512
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,239
right?

513
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:46,800
Doctor,

514
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,160
I really have an emergency.

515
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,040
Yes. Of course.

516
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,199
He means no disrespect.

517
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:51,160
It must be urgent.

518
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,520
I doubt it!

519
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:53,800
As long as you're here,

520
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,599
nothing is more urgent than your health.

521
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,239
As an athlete,

522
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,359
you should know that.

523
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,599
Go back to your room.

524
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,000
What are you doing?

525
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,000
Be careful, man!

526
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,719
Doctor! Doctor!

527
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,520
There you are.

528
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,640
Sorry, Doctor.

529
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,359
He got out when I left.

530
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
So he's leaving

531
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,439
to find you?

532
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,359
Fine. Alright.

533
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:23,479
I got it.

534
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,880
Love means the world

535
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:27,160
to people your age.

536
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:30,959
Young lady,

537
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,119
just spend more time with him,

538
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,439
or he'll try to escape again.

539
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,479
That'll slow down his recovery.

540
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:37,160
Understand?

541
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,640
Yes, sir.

542
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,760
And you!

543
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,839
Go back, too.

544
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,640
You're

545
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,599
no better than him.

546
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,280
Go!

547
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,079
Yes, sir.

548
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,199
We're going back.

549
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,040
Thanks.

550
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,400
Don't let him get out again.

551
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,760
Let's go.

552
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:58,439
Why did you leave

553
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,280
without telling me again?

554
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,599
I was worried.

555
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,719
I was caught up with something.

556
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,880
Now that

557
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,160
you no longer have intimacy issues,

558
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,880
you should catch up

559
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,640
on your kisses.

560
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:09,719
Come on.

561
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,719
Plant one on me. XO.

562
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,199
Shen Qingyuan,

563
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,520
did you

564
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,119
pick that up online?

565
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,079
Be good.

566
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,000
Come on. Let's go back.

567
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,880
Stop running around!

568
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,560
Shen Qingyuan,

569
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:39,959
don't press

570
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,280
your wound.

571
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,359
Shen Qingyuan,

572
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,520
why are you still mad?

573
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,439
What did I do wrong?

574
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,199
Why did you refuse to kiss me?

575
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,680
A nurse was behind us.

576
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,719
I don't get it.

577
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,000
How come you're colder to me

578
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,479
after last night?

579
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,040
I'm not.

580
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,280
You left without saying a word.

581
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,520
I went to see Du Lingfeng.

582
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,719
Everyone is telling me
how pathetic I am.

583
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,479
Why am I still thinking about her?

584
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,040
Xiaoci!

585
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,640
It's me,

586
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,040
Shen Qingyuan.

587
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,359
This way.

588
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:52,880
I'm sorry

589
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,680
to keep you waiting.

590
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,439
I feel bad

591
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:55,920
for having you come all the way here.

592
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:56,959
That's fine.

593
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,160
Anything to drink?

594
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,479
Americano would be fine.

595
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,040
Thanks.

596
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:00,760
Excuse me.

597
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,280
Yes, ma'am.

598
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:01,800
We'd like to add

599
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,719
one Americano, please.

600
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:03,640
OK. Be right up.

601
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,439
- Thanks.
- Have a seat.

602
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,199
I've put the file together.

603
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:07,959
Take a look

604
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,400
and tell me if you'd like to

605
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,000
add anything.

606
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,719
Thanks.

607
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,800
I hope that's not too much trouble.

608
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,439
Not at all.

609
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,439
It's the least I can do.

610
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,280
And sorry

611
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,280
about last time.

612
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,800
That was awkward.

613
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,599
No, I understand.

614
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
I think

615
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Zhou Zuguang is still not over you.

616
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,800
Sir,

617
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,560
here's your coffee.

618
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:32,280
Thanks.

619
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,359
Please enjoy.

620
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,239
By the way,

621
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,920
your ex-wife

622
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,000
is relatively fine

623
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,000
except for

624
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,280
minor depression caused by the divorce.

625
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,520
If she takes her meds on time

626
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,479
and relaxes herself,

627
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,000
she'll recover soon.

628
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,040
Good to know.

629
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,560
Are you still friends?

630
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,000
Not anymore, I guess.

631
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:54,000
I just hope

632
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,719
all is well for her.

633
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,640
May I ask

634
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,800
why your marriage failed?

635
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,719
She's into someone else.

636
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,199
What about you two?

637
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,439
Pretty much the same.

638
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,479
I think

639
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
he's in love

640
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,880
with an intern

641
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,520
but I'm not sure.

642
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,319
Why?

643
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,319
Because you have no evidence?

644
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,479
I don't know

645
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:24,599
the exact reason,

646
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,640
nor did he tell me.

647
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:27,760
It's like

648
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,040
he's standing off me out of the blue.

Where did you go?

He'd better not go to your hospital

726
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,840
to hurt you again.

727

I'll be back soon.

732
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:18,520
Captain,

733
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,840
take good care of yourself.

734
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,199
We can't wait

735
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,800
to have you back.

736
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:24,479
By the way,

737
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,959
your tip of stealing kisses

738
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:29,959
is working well.

739
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,320
See? I told you so.

740
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,399
What?

741
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,080
Stealing kisses?

742
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,080
How dare you, Shen Qingyuan!

743
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,320
You've got a plan!

744
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:41,439
That came out wrong.

745
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,800
I just want you to kiss me.

746
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,479
Even if they aren't here,

747
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,560
I can sense their chemistry.

748
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,760
Shen Qingyuan,

749
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,679
are you sure you can help

750
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,439
Du Lingfeng and Xiaoci together?

751
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,879
You don't believe me?

752
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,600
I didn't mean that.

753
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,399
I know Xiaoci has agreed

754
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,159
to our plan.

755
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,800
It's just that

756
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,120
matchmaking doesn't seem to be

757
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:21,199
your kind of thing.

758
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,239
I'm not too sure about myself, either.

759
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,879
Why didn't you tell me?

760
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,320
Because I know you can give me energy

761
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,199
and confidence.

762
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:36,080
Stop it, Shen Qingyuan!

763
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,879
Like you're kisser fish!

764
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,920
(Inpatient)

765
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,360
Hey,

766
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,280
wait for me at the parking lot.

767
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,199
Yes, sir.

768
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,679
Xiaoci,

769
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,439
just follow my lead.

770
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,760
How's your leg?

771
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,800
Much better.

772
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:46,600
It's this one.

773
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,719
Hey...

774
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,560
Are you done?

775
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,439
I'm worried about you.

776
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,959
You reek of alcohol.

777
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,679
Have some water.

778
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:03,800
So,

779
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,159
what's this about?

780
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,479
Where's Tang Xin?

781
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,560
Do you need me because she's not here?

782
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,760
Look,

783
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:16,959
I'm in no mood

784
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:18,800
to partner you now.

785
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,919
I'm surprised

786
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:22,959
that you care so much

787
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,479
about our partnership.

788
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,199
I'm not that sick.

789
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:30,879
That's a relief.

790
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,360
Hey,

791
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,760
get your phone out,

792
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,280
open WeChat

793
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,439
and put it here for a few minutes.

794
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,280
Shi Xiaoci is gonna tell you something.

795
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,719
Just listen, or you'll regret it.

796
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:59,040
I've decided to let her go.

797
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,280
What more do you want?

798
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:02,479
To break my heart into pieces?

799
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:04,439
Here comes a teachable moment.

800
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,639
What?

801
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,360
Facing the problem instead of escaping

802
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,280
is the making of a man.

803
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,479
Tang Xin is such a blabbermouth!

804
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,439
Whatever it is,

805
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,600
Shi Xiaoci demands an answer.

806
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,199
Du Lingfeng,

807
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:45,719
listen carefully

808
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,159
to what I'm about to say,

809
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,600
then you can make your decision.

810
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,479
I want you to know

811
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,919
that I like you.

812
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,000
I know you like me, too,

813
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,919
but I'm not sure

814
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:04,280
whether you like the girl

815
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,040
in your imagination

816
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,120
or the real me.

817
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:07,520
The real Shi Xiaoci

818
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,879
is much less free and brave

819
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:09,600
than you saw.

820
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,120
Like I said,

821
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,600
I can be mean,

822
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,080
aggressive

823
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,800
or even unreasonable,

824
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,439
especially in relationships.

825
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,679
I'm sensitive.

826
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,399
I hope the man I like

827
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,719
isn't a sexist

828
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,280
or biased against women.

829
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:27,120
I know you wanna protect me

830
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,560
but what I need

831
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,600
is to be seen

832
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,800
as an equal partner

833
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,919
instead of

834
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:33,239
a fragile vase.

835
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,280
I've told you

836
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,199
I want a worthy relationship

837
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:38,840
in which we treat each other fairly

838
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:39,800
with mutual respect.

839
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,639
Whether or not

840
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,479
can you accept me

841
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,120
for who I really am,

842
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,760
again I'm sorry

843
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,959
