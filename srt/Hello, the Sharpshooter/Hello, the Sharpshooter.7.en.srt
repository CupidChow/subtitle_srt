Hello, Mr. Zhou.

68
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,839
I have pretty much sorted it out.

69
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,759
Thank you, boss,

70
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,399
for the big house.

71
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,039
It's fine.

72
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,240
The cooperation

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,160
between Du Lingfeng and our company,

74
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,559
you contributed a lot.

75
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,839
You helped

76
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,360
save our department.

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,880
You deserve it.

78
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,839
But don't get carried away.

79
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
I've thought about it.

80
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,360
Putting you and Shen Qingyuan
in the same apartment

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,320
actually benefits us.

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,759
It facilitates the communication

83
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,320
between Rui Live and the shooting team.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,839
Got it, Mr. Zhou.

85
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,399
Your primary target

86
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,119
on the shooting team

87
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,720
will still be Shen Qingyuan.

88
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
He has the best chance

89
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,239
to be enrolled into the national team.

90
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,359
If you run into any obstacles

91
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,760
with him,

92
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,720
just talk to me at once.

93
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,880
Don't try to solve
every problem on your own.

94
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,079
Are you hungry?

95
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,239
I'll get you some
hot and sour rice noodles.

96
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,359
An athlete shouldn't eat
hot and sour rice noodles.

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,880
I remember

98
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,920
your diet in high school

99
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,079
wasn't so rigorous.

100
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,839
Pardon?

101
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,239
Nothing.

102
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,040
Are you always like this?

103
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,239
I've heard high school sports kids

104
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,799
don't need to keep a diet.

105
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,359
It's different now.

106
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,679
I mean,

107
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:35,000
stuff like barbecue

108
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,279
and the spices on food,

109
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,160
they are all forbidden.

110
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,760
And the routine
unannounced Inspections

111
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,720
will be more strict.

112
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,640
That's too bad.

113
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,040
What if the desire
for delicious food kicks in?

114
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,799
Hold it down

115
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,320
or apply to the coach

116
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,079
for out-dining.

117
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:49,880
But the menu must be submitted.

118
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,239
Shooters have the longest career

119
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:56,359
among competitive sports
athletes, right?

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,679
Yes.

121
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,559
You can still shoot in your 40s?

122
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,799
You really don't want any?

123
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,279
To earn glory,

124
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,880
stay hungry.

125
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,799
I'll tuck in, then.

126
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,440
Is it...?

127
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,040
Good?

128
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,679
So good.

129
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,519
Sour and spicy.

130
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,320
Very appetizing.

131
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,559
More noodles,

132
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,320
less words, then.

133
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,720
Mom.

134
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,640
This is my new dorm.

135
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,359
My company is paying for it.

136
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,799
I'm making this video for you.

137
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,480
Shen Qingyuan.

138
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,079
Can you please move aside?

139
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm making a video

140
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,239
for my mom

141
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:50,799
to let her know

142
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:51,880
that the company is paying

143
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
for the nice apartment.

144
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,040
I'm sure she'll be proud.

145
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,079
Thank you.

146
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,239
Tang Xin.

147
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,000
I want to visit your new dorm.

148
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Patience, Lizi.

149
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,799
I'll invite you over for dinner
some other day.

150
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,920
You're in your new dorm, right?

151
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,799
Congrats.

152
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,359
Thanks.

153
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,200
I envy you so much.

154
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
You've got a new dorm.

155
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:35,720
Don't know when the company

156
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,040
will give us one as well.

157
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,600
You guys can come over for dinner

158
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,760
with Lizi some other day.

159
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,440
Many social relations, huh?

160
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,679
Hi.

161
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,320
Captain Shen. Nice to meet you.

162
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,160
I'm Tang Xin from Rui Live.

163
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,399
From this day on,

164
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,559
I'll be responsible for the recording

165
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,320
of the daily life of the shooting team,

166
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,679
and I'll try my best not

167
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,399
to be a troublesome roommate.

168
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,040
I hope to gain your approval.

169
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,359
What are you doing?

170
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,160
At start,

171
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,559
we got off on the wrong foot,

172
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:10,320
so there was trouble for both parties.

173
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,160
Now.

174
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,480
Let's start over.

175
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,480
We begin with the self-introduction.

176
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,880
Here. Here.

177
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,279
Put them here.

178
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,000
Put them here.

179
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,040
Sir.

180
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,920
There are more.

181
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,799
Please get them all here.

182
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:34,880
Brothers and sisters, come here.

183
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
A treat for everybody.

184
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,320
Thank you, Mr. Du.

185
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,520
I'm told it's a perfect

186
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,960
electrolyte-replenishing drink.

187
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,039
Thank you, Mr. Du.

188
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:44,919
Chen Hai.

189
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,559
Thank you.

190
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,960
Come on. Come on.

191
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,840
Everybody got one?

192
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,960
- Thank you, Mr. Du.
- There's more.

193
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,239
- Thank you, Mr. Du.
- Thank you, Mr. Du.

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,080
Jiang Yitian,

195
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,000
help me hand them out.

196
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,679
Just go.

197
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,479
Come on. Come on.

198
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,080
One can for everybody.

199
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,359
Here's your personal delivery.

200
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,640
Thanks.

201
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,880
How much is it?
I'll give you the money.

202
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,440
Xiaoci,

203
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,520
just go ahead
and ask for my WeChat account.

204
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,960
Don't be shy.

205
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,479
Shy?

206
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll just scan your QR code.

207
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,719
Show me.

208
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,599
Forget it.

209
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,520
It's embarrassing to charge a girl.

210
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,640
I'll return one to you next time.

211
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,799
You are

212
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,679
such a smart girl.

213
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,280
We start off slowly,

214
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,640
then we meet more,

215
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,599
and we'll become intimate.

216
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm not interested in

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,919
being intimate with anybody.

218
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,359
What interests you, then?

219
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,559
Oh, I remember.

220
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,359
Only success interests you.

221
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,559
That's easy.

222
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,320
Xiaoci,

223
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,479
my info is in the e-archive,

224
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,440
and I've got a gun.

225
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,760
There will be

226
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,919
mixed team competitions,

227
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,919
we can pair up,

228
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,320
get into the national team,

229
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,359
and aim for the Olympics.

230
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,640
They name themselves

231
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Two Gunners.

232
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,760
Our name will be Two Winners.

233
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,719
What do you think?

234
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,119
I don't need fantasy,

235
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,000
thank you.

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,280
You just got enrolled.

237
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,640
You need more basic training.

238
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,880
Dry firing practice.
White target density.

239
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,280
Ring target density.
Feel the ring target.

240
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,400
There is a whole bunch
of training programs.

241
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,200
Yes, I know that.

242
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,719
I can do the training.

243
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,440
But after the training,

244
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,760
can we be partners?

245
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,520
Mixed team competition

246
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,039
isn't only about the skills.

247
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,960
It's more about a good rapport.

248
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:34,000
This is a good rapport.

249
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
This is no rapport.

250
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,760
This is opportunistic.

251
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,599
No.

252
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,080
I just seized the chance.

253
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,440
Guys,

254
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,640
one more for everybody.

255
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,479
Need help?

256
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,520
Yes.

257
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,599
It says

258
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:26,960
it's connected,

259
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,159
but there's still no Internet.

260
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,000
Can you fix it?

261
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:30,880
No.

262
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,119
Never mind.

263
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,479
How about we take a bus

264
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,280
home?

265
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:45,960
No.

266
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,599
I can fix this.

267
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,599
I can.

268
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,520
Done.

269
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,280
And I set

270
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,760
a WIFI password
that's very easy to remember.

271
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,200
You'll remember after one look.

272
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,119
It doesn't matter.

273
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,719
I don't really use WIFI.

274
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,960
What if you do?

275
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,040
(One-on-one)

276
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,400
One-on-one?

277
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,280
Oh, right.

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,039
I'm going to the shooting center

279
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,119
this afternoon.

280
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,320
Let's go together.

281
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,200
(One-on-one)

282
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,920
(Haiya University Gymnasium)

283
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:02,840
Mr. Du,

284
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,440
today, we will be

285
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,239
having rapport training.

286
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,200
What does rapport training do?

287
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,000
What is this video about?

288
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,880
This is the re-play

289
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,599
of Captain Shen and Xiaoci
in a mixed double competition.

290
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,039
After watching this,

291
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,200
you'll know how important rapport is.

292
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,400
Every time I watch this,

293
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,880
I'm amazed by the vibes between them.

294
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,719
Yeah.

295
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:26,280
10.7 points at the same time.

296
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,599
There's no chemistry

297
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,520
between two slow starters,

298
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,159
and two impatient shooters

299
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,640
can't score high together.

300
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,440
Only by sharing

301
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,719
a rapport with the partner

302
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,280
and knowing their firing time

303
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,799
and pace very well

304
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,000
can the two be complementary

305
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,840
teammates.

306
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,039
Wow, Captain lives up to his title.

307
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,960
Cool.

308
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,440
So great.

309
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,520
Just awesome.

310
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,200
Amazing.

311
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,400
Know your rival, know yourself.

312
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,239
Bro,

313
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,880
this is the best I can do.

314
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,479
I say,

315
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,679
only the two of them on this team

316
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,000
share a good rapport?

317
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,599
No.

318
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:08,599
Me and Yang Zhou, too.

319
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,159
Yeah.

320
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,000
Come on. Come on.

321
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:12,400
We'll show him

322
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,239
what a good rapport really means.

323
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:14,919
There they go again.

324
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,679
Here we go.

325
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,440
All right. Ready.

326
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,119
Three, two, one. Go.

327
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,599
So?

328
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,159
- Good.
- Good.

329
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:34,760
Good, right?

330
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,679
Good.

331
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,320
Good rapport.

332
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
- Good rapport.
- You bet.

333
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,239
I just feel

334
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,200
a bit gross.

335
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,799
What do you know?

336
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,760
- You know nothing.
- You know nothing.

337
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:49,159
Captain Shen.

338
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,479
- Captain Shen.
- Captain Shen.

339
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
- Hi, Miss Tang.
- Miss Tang is here.

340
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
- Hi, Miss Tang.
- Hi, Miss Tang.

341
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:54,760
They look more and more

342
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,080
like a couple to me.

343
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,559
Right?

344
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,119
Do they?

345
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,840
Give the little livestreamer a break.

346
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,479
- Gather whistle. Go.
- Go.

347
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,559
Listen carefully, everybody.

348
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,960
You're familiar

349
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,080
with the training programs today.

350
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,200
Three-legged race.

351
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,159
Anti-interference training.
Rapport training.

352
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,320
Find your partners.

353
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,239
Two men a group.

354
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,239
Start the warm-up.

355
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,760
- Got it.
- Got it.

356
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,479
I'll go get the bands.

357
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,559
How do we pick partners?

358
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,159
Captain Shen,

359
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:31,960
please give me some instructions.

360
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,640
Xiaoci.

361
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,159
Come here.

362
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:35,719
Coming.

363
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,159
Want to pair up with me?

364
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,200
Come.

365
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,719
Stand right here.

366
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,159
Give me your hands.

367
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
What do you mean?

368
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,760
Are you going to hold my hands?

369
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,080
Don't feel like it?

370
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,640
Well, I'll pick another partner, then.

371
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,520
Congratulations, they're holding hands.

372
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,559
Squat.

373
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,119
Together down. Together up.

374
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:09,479
Down.

375
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,039
Up.

376
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,080
Down.

377
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,320
Up.

378
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,320
Down.

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,679
Carry on.

380
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,280
Down.

381
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,559
Up.

382
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,919
Down.

383
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,200
We share such a good rapport,

384
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,599
and we'll win the first place again.

385
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,000
We're also-rans.

386
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
Don't know why you're all excited.

387
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,359
All right.

388
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,479
Good enough?

389
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:47,960
Good.

390
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,840
Is it okay?

391
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,320
Sure.

392
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,239
Let's swap.

393
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,479
No.

394
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,320
Please. Please. Please.

395
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,880
Drinks for a month.

396
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:03,919
Okay?

397
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,640
Okay.

398
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,959
Oh, no. Xiaoci.

399
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,199
Stomachache.

400
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,040
I need to go to the bathroom.

401
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,199
I can't be your partner.

402
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,800
What?

403
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:12,520
What about me?

404
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,400
You find another partner.

405
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,439
You find another partner.

406
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,040
What?

407
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,800
Xiaoci.

408
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,800
I'm going to find out

409
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,319
if we share a good rapport.

410
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,079
I guess only the harsh reality

411
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,400
can make you stop.

412
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,959
Don't you think it looks like

413
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:31,959
I'm proposing to you?

414
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,000
No.

415
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,160
It's more like you're
begging me for mercy.

416
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,959
Do you know

417
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,599
the trick

418
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,599
of the three-legged race?

419
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,160
What?

420
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,880
The rapport.

421
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,560
Bear the same thought,

422
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,880
aim for the same goal.

423
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,479
It isn't just a slogan.

424
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,520
You'll be going through

425
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,479
many tests.

426
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,680
Why isn't Captain Shen in the race?

427
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,640
You watch them.

428
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,199
Okay.

429
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,359
I get it.

430
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,199
I stole his partner,

431
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,640
so he has no one to pair with.

432
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,920
It's because Captain Shen is too tall,

433
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,959
no one can really pair with him.

434
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:20,520
So

435
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,079
he told Coach Zhang beforehand

436
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,319
that he wouldn't be in the race.

437
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,359
I wanted to race with him.

438
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,319
Wait a second.

439
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,239
Are...? Are...?

440
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:32,239
Are you calling me short?

441
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:32,920
Xiaoci,

442
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm not short, am I?

443
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:37,640
Pretty long.

444
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:39,640
Yeah.

445
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,199
Coach has got other work to do.

446
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,280
You guys can start the training.

447
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:51,000
We're all ready.

448
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Xiaoci,

449
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,000
you will

450
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,800
be following my pace.

451
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,239
Why don't you follow mine?

452
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,760
My legs are long,

453
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,520
so I take big steps.

454
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
I move fast.

455
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,040
Don't worry.

456
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,160
I can catch up with you.

457
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:05,560
All set?

458
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,239
Ready.

459
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,640
Three.

460
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:12,959
Two.

461
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,400
One.

462
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,359
What?

463
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,199
What's the matter with him?

464
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:29,760
Move.

465
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,280
Let's move.

466
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,560
Left.

467
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:51,920
Too slow. Too slow.

468
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:59,400
All right.

469
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,040
This one is over.

470
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,079
Next one.

471
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,560
Anti-interference Shooting.

472
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,560
Move.

473
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,000
Come.

474
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,680
Xiaoci,

475
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,319
what is this anti-interference thing?

476
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,400
The shooter will

477
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
follow the regular process,

478
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
but someone

479
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,319
will say something
to mess with your head.

480
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,479
It is to improve your mental quality.

481
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,319
Because it takes

482
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,319
a great amount of concentration

483
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,079
to be an excellent shooter.

484
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,239
Interesting.

485
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,560
Are you ready?

486
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,719
- Yes.
- Yes.

487
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,520
Yitian, you first.

488
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,479
Yitian, go for it.

489
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,560
- Hold it steadily.
- Focus.

490
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,920
Can you do it?

491
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,640
Right.

492
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,079
Don't you miss the target!

493
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,719
Yitian,

494
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:48,959
do an 8-point shot

495
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:49,959
to cheer us up.

496
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:50,560
Right.

497
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,880
Yeah.

498
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,520
Come on.

499
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,920
You can't even shoot an eight.

500
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:57,479
Wrong position.

501
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,400
Xiaoci.

502
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,160
Xiaoci, good luck.

503
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,239
Xiaoci, good luck.

504
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,800
- Good luck.
- Xiaoci.

505
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,959
Mr. Du said,

506
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,319
if you give a bad shot,

507
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,280
the girl team

508
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
may lose the sponsorship.

509
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,599
Hold on,

510
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,319
don't put the pressure on me.

511
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,560
Mr. Du also said

512
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,040
he'd sponsor us

513
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,680
no matter how bad the shot would be.

514
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,199
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

515
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,000
Xiaoci.

516
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,680
- Xiaoci.
- Xiaoci.

517
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,280
- Get sponsored. Get sponsored.
- Get sponsored. Get sponsored.

518
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,560
Stand straight.

519
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,640
- Xiaoci.
- Xiaoci.

520
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,040
Cool.

521
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,319
Du Lingfeng.

522
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:42,760
Your turn.

523
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,280
Mr. Du.

524
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,000
Play it well, Mr. Du.

525
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,800
Yeah, Mr. Du.

526
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:49,959
Go for it.

527
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,280
You've got to give
your best shot, Mr. Du.

528
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,800
Mr. Du, do your best.

529
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,119
You know, Xiaoci

530
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,119
cheered for you.

531
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,520
No hold-back, Mr. Du.

532
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,479
Right, Mr. Du.

533
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,280
Don't be scared.

534
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Right, Mr. Du.

535
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,079
- Mr. Du. Mr. Du. Mr. Du.
- Mr. Du. Mr. Du. Mr. Du.

536
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,079
Good luck, Mr. Du.

537
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,160
What are you playing at?

538
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,520
Just take the shot.

539
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Don't waste time.

540
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,000
Or how do you chase a girl?

541
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,560
Yeah.

542
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:11,880
No girl would

543
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,199
like a dawdling man.

544
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,199
Right, Xiaoci?

545
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:16,760
- You bet.
- Yeah.

546
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,959
Yeah.

547
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,560
Mr. Du, keep your hand steady.

548
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
- Keep your hand steady, Mr. Du.
- Aim, Mr. Du.

549
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,719
Stay focused, Mr. Du.

550
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,319
You can do this.

551
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,319
Don't miss the target.

552
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,319
Amazing.

553
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:32,400
You've been training secretly, right?

554
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,319
That was a good shot.

555
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,400
Shen.

556
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:39,560
You're up.

557
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,560
- Captain Shen. Captain Shen.
- Captain Shen. Captain Shen.

558
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,719
Your hand is shaking.

559
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,439
Hey, you.

560
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,199
Write down the name and information

561
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,439
of the person who mocked me.

562
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,479
I no longer run errands for you.

563
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,239
After spending too much time
with Shen Qingyuan,

564
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,800
you've become a traitor.

565
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,640
Miss Tang.

566
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,680
Say something

567
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,160
to distract Captain Shen.

568
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,800
Yeah. Quickly.

569
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Are you sure you're teammates?

570
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,719
Yeah.

571
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:05,520
Captain Shen

572
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,680
- is not a human.
- Right.

573
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,079
No matter what we say,

574
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,400
he always

575
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,239
shoots 10.9.

576
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,959
Miss Tang, think of something

577
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,319
to distract our captain.

578
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,280
- Quickly.
- Right, right, right.

579
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,079
I can't.

580
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,000
I've got it.

581
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,760
Look, you just

582
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,520
read this.

583
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,560
We're here waiting.

584
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,959
Speed it up, Captain Shen.

585
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,119
Come on. Come on.

586
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,119
Here's a friendly reminder.

587
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Though Lingda and Rui Live

588
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,079
signed a contract,

589
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,760
it won't cost me much

590
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,160
breaking it.

591
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:35,640
Quickly. Quickly. This.

592
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,239
Captain Shen.

593
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:38,239
I heard that you stayed
abroad for four years,

594
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,439
why did you come back?

595
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:41,839
Did you make any mistakes

596
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,839
halfway through?

597
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,040
What do you know?

598
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,599
It's all for...

599
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,160
For

600
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,640
the meeting with Xiaoci.

601
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,280
Shen Qingyuan,

602
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,479
all doors in the world

603
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,000
should be knocked by you.

604
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,439
Because you're "knocking" pretty.

605
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,319
You're "knocking" pretty.

606
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,680
- You're "knocking" pretty.
- Captain Shen,

607
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:09,319
you're "knocking" pretty.

608
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,400
Hold the gun steady, Captain Shen.

609
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,400
- Captain Shen.
- Captain Shen.

610
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,400
Awesome.

611
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,400
10.9.

612
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,439
What did I tell you?

613
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,400
There's no way

614
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,680
he can be distracted.

615
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,280
Unbelievable.

616
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,640
Chen Hai, your turn.

617
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,439
- No.2.
- No.2 is up.

618
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,079
Hai is coming through.

619
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:33,839
Your turn.

620
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,959
- Chen, the No.2. Chen, the No.2.
- Chen, the No.2. Chen, the No.2.

621
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:39,560
Yeah.

622
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,239
No.2,

623
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,079
are you stressed?

624
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:44,760
His hand is going to shake.

625
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,920
No, No.2.

626
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,599
Your hand mustn't shake, No.2.

627
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,839
Was there any change

628
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,959
in Shen Qingyuan's state?

629
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,760
Not really any trace of change.

630
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,880
The little girl was

631
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,959
at the anti-interference training, too.

632
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,680
He still played well.

633
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,119
Is it because he's gotten used to it?

634
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,680
I just wanted to take a shot

635
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,560
when I proposed them to live together.

636
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,160
It's just no one knows

637
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,439
what part of his memory

638
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,479
he's lost.

639
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,719
I can only try alternative ways.

640
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,400
All right.

641
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,000
Let's do what we can.

642
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,160
Shen is really

643
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,319
a promising shooter.

644
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,719
As his coach,

645
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,079
I can't easily give up on him,

646
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,160
right?

647
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,960
(Medical History Shen Qingyuan)

648
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:37,200
(Medical History Tang Xin)

649
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,920
What's that on your face?

650
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,280
Sorry.

651
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,079
I forgot that you're here, too.

652
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,839
Are you doing laundry?

653
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,800
These are for my bath.

654
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,040
Do you need so much stuff?

655
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,520
I'm done.

656
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
You... You go take your shower.

657
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,520
What's with that mask?

658
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,119
My shaver.

659
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:35,880
Excuse me.

660
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,079
Can I get something?

661
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:38,640
Come in.

662
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,479
Can you turn your back on me?

663
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,000
Where is it?

664
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,800
Are you looking for this?

665
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,599
Why are you holding this in your hand?

666
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,040
And my toothbrush.

667
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,800
So other than brushing your teeth,

668
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,959
you shave your face in the evening?

669
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:13,680
It... It...

670
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,280
It's not for the face.

671
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,079
It's not a facial shaver.

672
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,560
Plus,

673
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,040
I don't have any mustache.

674
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,280
Really?

675
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,239
If she allows me to get so close,

676
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,959
then a kiss should...

677
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,400
That is true.

678
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Your, uh...

679
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:50,119
You dropped that thing of yours.

680
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:55,359
It... It... It...

681
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,119
It's not... It's...

682
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,599
What is it?

683
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,640
It's for...

684
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,439
It's a hair band.

685
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:04,800
Why do you have

686
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,319
so many weird things?

687
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,439
Weird how?

688
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,000
All girls

689
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
have things like these.

690
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:28,560
The menstrual pad!

691
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,599
I didn't expect living together

692
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,640
to be so hard.

693
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,040
Bathroom, living room, the kitchen.

694
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,280
I'll share all those with him.

695
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,479
And I can't wear the night skirt.

696
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,599
I wanted a can of cocktail.

697
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,119
- You first.
- You first.

698
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:30,280
Okay.

699
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:33,920
Stop.

700
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,760
You first.

701
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,280
I'll clean it up for you.

702
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:05,680
No.

703
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,640
I'll do it myself.

704
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:10,680
Sorry.

705
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,119
I was too hasty.

706
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,680
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

707
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,479
What are you doing?

708
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,280
Don't get close.

709
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,079
Why are you so nervous?

710
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,359
Sure I'm nervous.

711
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,160
We're not of the same gender.

712
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:27,640
This is the scariest part.

713
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,680
No.

714
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,680
It's not about gender.

715
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,839
There's a problem between us.

716
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,119
Shen Qingyuan,

717
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,280
how come the more I stress it,

718
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,520
the less attention you pay?

719
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,000
You even used my ladies' shampoo.

720
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,760
You have no sense of boundary.

721
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,359
I made a mistake.

722
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,119
I wanted to apologize to you.

723
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,280
Then what?

724
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,520
And then...

725
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,079
I apologized.

726
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,520
We're even now.

727
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,520
Yes.

728
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,520
And no.

729
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:08,280
I think we

730
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,079
can't always...

731
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,520
We'd better schedule

732
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,400
the shower time.

733
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:16,959
It'd be best that you cope with me,

734
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,839
and I cope with you.

735
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,680
No problem.

736
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:28,760
Um, I'm going to bed.

737
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,800
Sleeping late was a big mistake.

738
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,439
Shen Qingyuan.

739
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,040
Shen Qingyuan, are you in your room?

740
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:41,160
Want breakfast?

741
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,319
What the heck?

742
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,280
You scared me.

743
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,079
You're like a...

744
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:45,719
Follow me.

745
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,199
What are you waiting for?

746
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,040
Eat.

747
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:05,319
This is for me?

748
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,640
I don't dare to eat unless you say it.

749
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,199
Tang Xin,

750
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,920
I strongly suspect

751
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,319
that you have been reading

752
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,520
guidebooks about
how to be a roommate.

753
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,040
You got me.

754
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:18,560
You're in a hurry, right?

755
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,239
Just eat.

756
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,920
I will, then.

757
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:39,079
Is it good?

758
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:39,920
Good.

759
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,520
So good.

760
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:53,959
Mr. Zhou, I'm here.

761
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:54,880
Come, come.

762
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,040
Come and have a look.

763
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,280
What do you think?

764
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,000
About what?

765
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,560
A promising shooter for the Olympics.

766
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,920
A young entrepreneur.

767
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:07,199
Hot topic guaranteed.

768
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,399
Hits guaranteed.

769
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,280
And then,

770
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,360
DAU for Rui Live guaranteed,

771
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,520
right?

772
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,040
Yes, yes, yes.

773
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,600
This will also

774
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,439
be your new task.

775
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:18,639
Mr. Zhou,

776
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,439
are you thinking about...

777
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,120
Yes.

778
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,679
They are
the officially-promoted partners.

779
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,159
I've even worked out

780
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,159
the title of their live streaming.

781
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,439
It will be

782
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:33,280
"Du Lingfeng's crossover shooting,

783
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,280
pairs up with the genius shooter
Shen Qingyuan,

784
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,600
once again, the dream sets sail".

785
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,560
Keep in mind

786
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,520
that opportunities are only open for

787
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,560
the visionaries.

788
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,000
So now.

789
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,439
Right now.

790
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,399
You get me more footage

791
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,320
for future use.

792
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,560
Wait.

793
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,280
How's your new apartment?

794
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,520
Pretty good.

795
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,360
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

796
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:57,399
What's your relationship
with Ding Fang?

797
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,280
You know Dr. Ding?

798
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,280
I'm asking you a question.

799
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,760
You don't ask me back.

800
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:03,120
I knew Dr. Ding

801
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
in a hospital.

802
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,840
She's nice.

803
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,000
We talked a lot.

804
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:07,840
Simple as that?

805
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:10,000
All right, then.

806
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,360
Go out and keep yourself busy.

807
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,320
Xiaoci,

808
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,840
can you give me a chance?

809
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,320
Think about it.

810
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:25,760
You're one of the best shooters.

811
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,000
Isn't it cool to have a sidekick?

812
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,879
Fine.

813
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,199
Whether you agree or not,

814
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,040
someday, you will

815
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,280
be willing to applaud for me.

816
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,840
Okay. I'll wait for that day to come.

817
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,199
Morning, Captain Shen.

818
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:44,919
Morning.

819
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,800
Shen Qingyuan,

820
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,239
Xiaoci said she'd wait

821
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,120
for me to impress her.

822
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,639
You won't get to be

823
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,639
her partner anymore.

824
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,560
What's the meaning of that?

825
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,439
Enough.

826
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:58,679
Start training.

827
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,479
Have you watched the news?

828
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,639
- No.
- No.

829
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:27,439
This is the first day

830
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,959
of the Asian Games.

831
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,479
China won the first gold medal.

832
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,439
- The first gold medal.
- The first gold medal.

833
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,840
Air rifle, right?

834
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,120
You cheer for others?

835
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,320
Air pistol!

836
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,040
It's our strong point.

837
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,159
Won the gold medal
in the first Asian Games.

838
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,080
Amazing.

839
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:47,080
So the upcoming national competition

840
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,719
is a good chance to test you

841
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,159
as a mixed team.

842
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:50,280
The Asian Games.

843
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:51,639
The first time.

844
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:53,479
Then the Olympics.

845
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,479
Again, the first time.

846
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,320
You mustn't relax.

847
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,159
We just do

848
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,080
what we usually do,

849
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,959
and we'll be good.

850
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,639
Do you know how much time
you have got left?

851
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,560
- Yes!
- Yes!

852
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,399
Two months...

853
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,719
- Before the winter training!
- Before the winter training!

854
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:08,600
Four months...

855
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
- Before the World Championship!
- Before the World Championship!

856
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,719
Six months...

857
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:12,199
- Before the Olympics Qualification!
- Before the Olympics Qualification!

858
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,479
The Olympics Qualification!

859
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,199
No?

860
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,959
I didn't plan too much

861
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:23,719
training for you today.

862
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,159
It's pretty much a day off for you.

863
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,600
Go home and adjust your minds,

864
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,719
as well as your bodies.

865
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,840
Starting from tomorrow,

866
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,639
I'll schedule more strict

867
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:30,600
training for you.

868
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:31,600
Got it?

869
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,520
- Got it!
- Got it!

870
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,320
Start training.

871
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,000
- Go.
- Go.

872
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,040
See? The coach is mad.

873
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,520
I didn't say anything.

874
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,239
Are you full?

875
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,639
I'll help you clean the table.

876
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:50,360
Another network outage.

877
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,280
You fix the Internet,
I'll wash the dishes.

878
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,159
Yes, sir.

879
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,199
It's fixed. Try again.

880
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:22,959
I got it.

881
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,120
Watch what you want to watch.

882
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,399
I don't like watching TV.

883
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,479
I'll watch some TV, then.

884
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,959
Shen Qingyuan.

885
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,159
Shen Qingyuan.

886
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,159
Shen Qingyuan.

887
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,639
You sleep in your room.

888
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,080
You'll catch a cold sleeping here.
