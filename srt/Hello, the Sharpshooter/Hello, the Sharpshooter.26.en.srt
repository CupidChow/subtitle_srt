=Episode 26=

35
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,360
Not to mention

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,910
you and Shi Xiaoci are on the same team.

37
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,950
You colluded with each other

38
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,870
to set me up.

39
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,760
And that girl...

40
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
What if I've got photos

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,120
and a witness?

42
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,310
You mean Tang Xin?

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,360
It's Ai.

44
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,630
Do you know

45
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,120
how I found you guys that day?

46
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,440
She sent me the photos of you taking

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Tang Xin to the business drinking party.

48
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,230
What's more...

49
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,830
If word gets out about this scandal,

50
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,510
not only will it be bad for me,

51
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,590
but also harm

52
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,630
Tang Xin's reputation.

53
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,910
The evidence we have now

54
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,440
is not enough to bring down Xu Dian.

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,830
We can firstly use

56
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,110
Xiaoci's recording as a cover

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,960
to make him believe

58
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
we are fully prepared.

59
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,880
Then we'll use Ai's account

60
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,630
as a sleight of hand

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,550
to force him out of
the live broadcast of winter training.

62
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,630
We'll achieve our goal

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,600
and get it over with.

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,390
There is something you can do

65
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,440
if you don't want us to report you.

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,110
Why do you walk without making a sound?

67
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,600
Xu Dian has promised

68
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,830
to quit the live broadcast
of the winter training.

69
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,030
Did he threaten you

70
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,830
or say something against you?

71
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,390
Will he let it go at that?

72
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,270
He dares not.

73
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,800
But…

74
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,390
Tang Xin,

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,750
Xu Dian

76
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,080
is the shadiest person instead.

77
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,110
If there's any follow-up to this matter,

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,550
it'll certainly

79
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,440
make him look worse than now.

80
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,670
Shen Qingyuan, thank you.

81
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,880
I can't claim all the credit for myself.

82
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,080
Everybody is in on it.

83
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,390
But you are here alone
to receive a reward,

84
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,240
aren't you?

85
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,240
Is that so plain to see?

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,880
Do you even try to hide it?

87
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,360
Those you've hired

88
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,110
are too dumb.

89
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,030
The last one

90
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,320
was too stubborn.

91
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,270
And this new girl,

92
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,800
fragile as she seems,

93
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,510
she's a nuisance.

94
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,000
Lin?

95
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,320
How dare you!

96
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,600
You harassed her

97
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,640
which was why she left

98
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,000
without saying anything, right?

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,640
She was your assistant,

100
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,040
a key member of your team.

101
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,110
Stop pretending you don't know.

102
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,680
(Idle)

103
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,390
Come in.

104
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,110
Have you made up your mind?

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,550
Take a seat.

106
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,110
Go ahead.

107
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,000
Today I met

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,270
a former colleague of the TV station.

109
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,550
Haven't you been

110
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,640
doing joint live broadcast together?

111
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,550
Yes.

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,790
Do you still remember my demotion

113
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,350
with the TV station four years ago?

114
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,790
Back then, I just couldn't figure out

115
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,320
what had gone wrong.

116
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,670
How could someone I trusted so much

117
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,110
suddenly betray me?

118
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,670
Later when I saw

119
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,830
people who entered as interns,

120
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,550
I began to have misgivings.

121
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,790
There used to be a time

122
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,640
when I didn't even want to build

123
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,510
a closer relationship with those people.

124
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,000
Just now,

125
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,550
just now I learned…

126
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,270
Zhou Zuguang,

127
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,950
when we hadn't lived apart,

128
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,320
you just kept on about

129
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
that female intern.

130
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,640
You think it was a pity

131
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
to lose her, don't you?

132
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,350
What era are we in now?

133
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,790
If you are really keen to find her,

134
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,270
you can't possibly fail to find her.

135
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,350
There's no point
in coming to seek advice from me.

136
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
She's someone who betrayed me

137
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,950
at a critical moment.

138
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,320
What's the point of finding her?

139
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,000
Indeed.

140
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,440
From a psychological perspective,

141
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,160
the heavier the weight one occupies

142
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,480
in another person's heart,

143
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,950
the harder it is for him

144
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,270
to make up for the harm he's inflicted.

145
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,040
Especially in the case of betrayal,

146
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,950
it's possible for you to want to

147
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,040
avoid her for the rest of your life.

148
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,000
That may not be the case.

149
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,720
If you love someone to the extreme,

150
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,720
even if she betrays you,

151
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,440
you'd still be reluctant to let her go.

152
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,880
So do it ASAP, Zhou Zuguang.

153
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,390
I'm gonna

154
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,390
start a new life too.

155
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,070
Let's put it off.

156
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,720
Until I get the important things done.

157
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,110
Give me a specific time.

158
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,230
Until I figure out how to

159
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,440
start talking about the past.

160
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,320
Zhou Zuguang.

161
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,880
Well, when are you gonna

162
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
stop playing the waiting game?

163
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,000
I forgot about you.

164
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,830
Don't call him little one.

165
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,440
He's a little critter.

166
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,760
Shen Qingyuan,

167
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,920
come to have a look at him.

168
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,440
He's actually very gentle.

169
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,440
I told you to do a good job,

170
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,350
but didn't ask you to do this.

171
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,510
I'll get a branch to tease him.

172
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,040
I…

173
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,320
Is this one OK?

174
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,320
You still care about a branch

175
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
at such a moment?

176
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,070
Here.

177
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,270
If you really hurt your hand,

178
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,390
what are you gonna do

179
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,320
as a sharpshooter?

180
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,950
How long do you think I can do it?

181
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,720
Five years?

182
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,150
Ten years?

183
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,030
Twenty years?

184
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,590
No more.

185
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,110
So?

186
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,470
So shooting is a temporary companion,

187
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,550
but you are a companion of a lifetime.

188
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,280
Shen Qingyuan,

189
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,030
now you must

190
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,710
give priority to shooting.

191
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,200
Let's take him home

192
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,320
after the winter training.

193
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,710
The little hedgehog?

194
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,150
Really?

195
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,200
Did you hear it?

196
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,320
You are going home with us.

197
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,000
Behave yourself when you are home.

198
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,710
From then on

199
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,150
we'll be a family of three.

200
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,880
The time has not come yet.

201
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,080
I just feel

202
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,520
a bit better

203
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,440
after telling you about the past.

204
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,790
What matters most is

205
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,320
I don't reject you anymore.

206
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,790
Just not reject?

207
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,590
I like you very much.

208
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,150
Even so, you can't take the risk.

209
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,030
We still have plenty of time.

210
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,840
I'll always be by your side.

211
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,200
Mr. Zhou!

212
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,590
Are you leaving now?

213
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,960
Yes.

214
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,710
Don't leave so soon.

215
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,030
I want to show my gratitude to you

216
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,710
by inviting you to dinner tonight.

217
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,840
No, thanks.

218
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,520
I've got a lot of work to do
at the company.

219
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,230
Why don't you guys eat instead?

220
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Let me see you out.

221
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,640
OK.

222
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,470
Mr. Xu,

223
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,030
why are you leaving all of a sudden?

224
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,710
Yes.

225
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,400
We are unsure
about the joint live broadcast

226
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,440
without you being in charge.

227
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,910
Yes.

228
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,670
I can't help it.

229
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,760
Something comes up at the company.

230
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,710
I have to go back to deal with it.

231
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,960
You must be very busy, Mr. Xu.

232
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,880
An able man is always busy.

233
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,960
Tang Xin.

234
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,840
Sorry.

235
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,350
I had an over-simplistic view

236
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,400
of what happened before.

237
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,320
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

238
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,590
I believe

239
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,470
you are a girl full of energy.

240
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,320
Let's work hard on this

241
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,400
winter training serial live broadcast

242
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,470
and try to make it

243
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,470
a hit show as a warm-up
for the Olympics.

244
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,200
Captain Shen,

245
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,760
you are the linchpin

246
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,790
of our success.

247
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,440
Make sure you keep up the good work.

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,550
Mr. Zhou,

249
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,840
this is the kind of face he has.

250
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,030
He's always so serious.

251
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,790
All right, I see.

252
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,710
I'll wait for the good news from you
at the company.

253
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,520
Stop kissing my ass.

254
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,440
Don't worry.

255
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,880
I'll transfer a new anchor here.

256
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,640
OK, OK, OK.

257
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,030
You have students everywhere, Mr. Xu.

258
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,230
Each of them is better than the last.

259
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,080
Anyone is OK.

260
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,640
Anyone is OK.

261
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,840
- Yes, yes, yes.
- You two…

262
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,230
All right, here comes the car.

263
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,110
Go back.

264
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,200
You have so much work to do.

265
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,840
No need to see me out.

266
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,960
OK. Take care, Mr. Xu.

267
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,640
Take care, Mr. Xu.

268
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,960
Mr. Xu,

269
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,000
am I late?

270
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,520
I came as soon as I got your call.

271
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,350
Not late, not late.

272
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,590
Let's go.

273
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,440
Goodbye.

274
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,320
OK.

275
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,150
I didn't expect you had

276
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,110
kept a trick up your sleeve.

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,230
If you are not a shooter,

278
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,400
you'll be cut out for making big news.

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,670
Let's hang up.

280
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,790
What a sour face!

281
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,840
He needs to be taught a lesson.

282
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,350
Shen Qingyuan,

283
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,030
why did you pull a long face just now?

284
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,350
That's how my face looks.

285
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,030
Mr. Zhou has done us a big favor.

286
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,280
We should thank him.

287
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,760
Don't show a bad attitude.

288
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,640
That's what he should do.

289
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,400
If he didn't send you
to the business party,

290
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,030
Xu Dian wouldn't
have the chance to do it

291
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,760
and you wouldn't have to feel so bad.

292
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,760
Shen Qingyuan,

293
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,350
I feel so at ease

294
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,670
with you by my side.

295
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,000
Apart from animal therapy,

296
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,760
you can also praise Tang Xin more.

297
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,590
What are you thinking?

298
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,440
Your outfit today

299
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,470
looks so nice.

300
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,280
Are you happy

301
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,550
when I say so?

302
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,150
You are not happy?

303
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,030
It's not that I'm unhappy.

304
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,880
Let's go for lunch.

305
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,080
There'll be nothing left if we are late.

306
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,710
What's wrong with him?

307
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,440
I just said a word or two.

308
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,960
Does he have to be so mean?

309
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,910
It's so delicious.

310
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,840
Give more positive feedback.

311
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,230
You

312
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,440
look like a million dollars today.

313
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,550
Here.

314
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,110
Have an egg yolk.

315
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,470
Your earrings

316
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,470
also look very nice today.

317
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,840
Look, you are

318
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,910
chowing down on your food.

319
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,910
How I envy you!

320
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,400
You don't get fat
no matter how much you eat.

321
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,280
I…

322
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,880
You are finished?

323
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,910
Shen Qingyuan,

324
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,110
you can tell me outright

325
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,030
if you have any reservations.

326
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,000
You don't have to speak
in such a bizarre tone.

327
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,600
(Shen Qingyuan)
(Did I say something wrong?)

328
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,960
Did I say something wrong?

329
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,640
What's gotten into you today?

330
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
He asked so abruptly.

331
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,960
He must be in a fit of anger now.

332
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,200
No.

333
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,840
But if you are feeling down,

334
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,960
just go out for some fresh air.

335
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,230
Don't stay in the room alone.

336
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,280
He even sent such a rude question mark?

337
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,840
Go get a massage if you are tired.

338
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,640
The base is equipped with

339
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,440
a super luxury massage room.

340
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,910
Positive feedback…

341
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,520
I'd better do what she says.

342
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,640
I must find a way to ease the tension.

343
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,320
Oh, right.

344
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,350
How come I've forgotten about this?

345
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,840
But shall I just give the gift

346
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,640
for the Spring Festival like this?

347
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,320
Can't care so much.

348
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,200
Meet the urgent need first.

349
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,280
This is the real enjoyment of life.

350
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,230
When we resume regular training,

351
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,710
we'll fall behind Southeast Team again.

352
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,590
Every time they are the quickest

353
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,590
to come to the massage room.

354
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,190
Don't rain on their parade.

355
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,280
Did you find that?

356
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,830
Hai was off his game for the training

357
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,710
today.

358
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:23,920
He was probably

359
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,070
affected by the Southeast Team.

360
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,590
Hai has finally managed

361
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,760
to get back in form.

362
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Hai's personality is

363
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
he closes his ears to good news.

364
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,070
Yes, yes, yes.

365
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,000
But he easily

366
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,680
takes in upsetting news.

367
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,280
Yes.

368
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,920
What shall we do?

369
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,160
Don't we have a WeChat group?

370
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,400
Let me have a look.

371
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,070
- Captain.
- Captain.

372
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,040
How come you are here?

373
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,280
Anything wrong with that?

374
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,520
No.

375
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,230
No, no, no.

376
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,350
I'm going over there.

377
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,880
OK.

378
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,590
I reckon something good has happened.

379
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,590
Let me see the group name.

380
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,350
Wait, wait, wait.

381
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,760
Wait a minute.

382
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,830
Be quick.

383
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,110
Come over here!

384
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,470
Someone is trolling Captain again.

385
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,950
With a photo I took.

386
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,280
Look.

387
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,600
(Shen Qingyuan Bossy and Domineering)
(Discord Within Haiya Shooting Team)

388
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,710
They're going too far
in making up stories.

389
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,310
Keep it down.

390
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,230
What else does it say?

391
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,000
It shows a photo of

392
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,350
Hai's result today.

393
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,760
It says Captain Shen

394
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,230
has been lording over us for so long

395
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,040
that we've lost the desire to do better.

396
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,520
Let's keep it a secret
from Captain for now.

397
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,710
Let me praise him first.

398
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,590
Yes, yes, yes.

399
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,160
Let me praise him first

400
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,310
to divert his attention.

401
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,560
OK, OK.

402
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,110
(Jiang Yitian changed the group name
to Shooting Praise Group)

403
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,070
From now on, our group

404
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,230
is mainly for praising people.

405
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,160
What do you guys think?

406
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,350
I agree.

407
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,590
Well, no other responses?

408
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,640
Is there any dos and don'ts

409
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,920
for praising people?

410
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,880
Are you OK?

411
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,350
It's not as strong as the shock

412
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,430
I get from Captain.

413
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,230
More gently, please.

414
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,000
Captain,

415
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,950
what we say to you

416
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,160
is not praise at all.

417
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,400
It all comes from the heart.

418
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,830
I got it.

419
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,760
What?

420
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,880
One must speak in a sincere tone, right?

421
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,590
I'll try.

422
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,680
Come over here.

423
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,160
Do you think

424
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,000
Captain wants to praise Miss Tang?

425
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,680
Who else can he praise?

426
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,800
Could he praise us?

427
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,950
But isn't it a sign of a car crash

428
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,920
if Captain is to praise her?

429
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,560
Maybe the crash has already happened

430
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,760
and he's just asking for help.

431
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,520
The probability

432
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,880
could be as high as 99%.

433
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,070
Wait a moment.

434
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,710
Let me have a look.

435
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,000
Hai, I'm sorry.

436
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,040
I have to take care of

437
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,520
Captain first.

438
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,280
Here they are.

439
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,560
What?

440
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,310
Let's practice first.

441
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,280
What are you looking at?

442
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,400
At the man who's made headlines.

443
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,000
Stop looking!

444
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,190
I'm looking at you big stars.

445
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,830
What's up?

446
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,190
What are you saying?

447
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,830
Jiang Yitian.

448
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,310
Don't be flighty and restless.

449
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,280
Captain.

450
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,800
Given how Captain Shen

451
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,230
treats his team members,

452
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,560
who cannot be flighty and restless?

453
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

454
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,280
Exactly.

455
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,160
Look, look.

456
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,350
It's going viral online.

457
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,470
Dark soul, collapsed public persona.

458
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,110
People's characters
are not written on their foreheads.

459
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:20,920
All right.

460
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,470
It's you indeed.

461
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,230
You can't beat him head-on,

462
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,640
so you are back-stabbing?

463
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,520
Exactly.

464
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,070
We are all professional shooters.

465
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,830
Let's compete
in our professional specialty.

466
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,230
Why are you spreading a rumor?

467
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,350
I've only

468
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,000
provided a photo.

469
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,280
It's up to the media

470
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
to read into it.

471
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,000
So what?

472
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,310
You can't take it anymore, can you?

473
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,000
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

474
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,800
What are you talking about?

475
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,040
What do you want?

476
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,000
Shen Qingyuan.

477
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,920
You are trying to
ruin our captain's wrist again.

478
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,470
Is a piece of news still not enough?

479
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,230
Yes.

480
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,160
This is also

481
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,760
part of the anti-disturbance training.

482
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,640
So what?

483
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,880
You can't take this, can you?

484
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,430
And you hurt my team member
because you can't take it?

485
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,070
Get back to training.

486
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,560
Captain.

487
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
My team member is right.

488
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,110
Speak with your results.

489
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,110
OK, no problem.

490
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,310
Your reputation is ruined

491
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,560
online anyway.

492
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,950
With only results but no moral quality,

493
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,280
you are nothing but a laughingstock.

494
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,880
What are you doing?
Such a buzz around here.

495
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,110
- Hello, Coach.
- Coach.

496
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,160
Coach.

497
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,110
Nothing much, Coach.

498
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,040
We are

499
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,000
doing technical exchanges.

500
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,040
It's good to do exchanges often.

501
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,350
Come over here.

502
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,590
I have something important to tell you.

503
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,880
This training season

504
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,920
is over.

505
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,640
Tomorrow we are going to have

506
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,680
the first assessment of our two teams

507
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,520
since the start of the winter training.

508
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,520
It is to test

509
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,800
the results of our recent training.

510
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,560
Do you feel the pressure?

511
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,160
It's good to have pressure.

512
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,760
The upcoming assessment

513
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,920
consists of three events.

514
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,520
Singles, mixed team
and three-member team

515
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,680
will all be part of the assessment.

516
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,830
But the rules

517
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,800
are slightly different
from the ones before.

518
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,680
There'll be no qualifiers this time

519
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,920
and we'll go straight to the finals.

520
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,000
Really?

521
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,950
Straight to the finals?

522
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,640
Short of two shots.

523
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,070
First, for the singles,

524
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,760
shooters do two rounds of shooting

525
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,070
with ten shots each

526
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,760
and the result
of the best round is taken.

527
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,310
Top three shooters of

528
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,160
men's and women's singles are picked

529
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,560
to form three pairs

530
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,880
for the mixed team test

531
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,880
with 30 shots for each team.

532
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,520
The rest of the shooters

533
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,920
form teams of three

534
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,430
and go straight to the team competitions

535
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,680
to decide the winners separately.

536
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,430
Coach Zhang,

537
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,110
isn't this a bit too complicated?

538
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,520
- Yes, yes.
- Yes.

539
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,000
- Yes.
- Yes, Coach Zhang.

540
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,680
Complicated?

541
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,830
Not quite.

542
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,430
If you do well in the first round,

543
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,190
you'll be exempted from
the second round of assessment

544
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,680
and go straight to mixed team.

545
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,560
If you don't do well in both rounds,

546
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,830
there will be no mixed team

547
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,590
and you'll have to prepare for
the team competitions straight away.

548
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,920
It depends on how well you can do.

549
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,350
I'm sure

550
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,830
I'll skip the mixed team event.

551
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,800
It's the same with me.

552
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,800
- Same here.
- Same here.

553
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,430
Me too.

554
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,680
Do you all get it?

555
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

556
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,710
Go on with your training.

557
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:04,920
By the way,

558
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,430
we'll have academic classes tonight.

559
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,520
Nobody is allowed to skip the class.

560
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,560
- OK.
- OK.

561
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,190
Dismiss.

562
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,880
Go. Dismiss.

563
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,190
What are you looking at?

564
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,070
Practice now.

565
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,760
I've practiced more this afternoon

566
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,680
than I've done for the whole week.

567
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,680
Who hasn't?

568
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,350
But since
we've thrown down the gauntlet,

569
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,280
we must win.

570
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,040
For tomorrow's victory,

571
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,430
keep it up!

572
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,110
I'm sorry I can't lift my arm.

573
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,070
Be quick.

574
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,920
Keep it up.

575
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,590
Keep it up.

576
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,400
Get on with your training. Be quick.

577
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,280
Captain Shen.

578
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,590
Captain Shen.

579
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,350
Captain Shen.

580
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,430
Captain Shen.

581
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,310
You've finished training?

582
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,040
Why didn't you

583
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,880
reply to my messages?

584
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,560
Are you still being unhappy?

585
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,430
My cellphone is dead.

586
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,110
Shouldn't you charge it if it's dead…

587
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,560
That's good too.

588
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,590
You don't reply once in a while

589
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,040
to make me on tenterhooks,

590
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,920
which is quite good.

591
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,680
It's probably another

592
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,560
large-scale car crash scene.

593
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,640
Shen Qingyuan,

594
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,280
why do you speak in such a bizarre tone?

595
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,190
What have I done wrong?

596
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,640
I was praising you.

597
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,280
Just that I haven't learnt

598
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,190
the essence of praising people yet.

599
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,400
Why do you suddenly

600
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,560
want to praise me?

601
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,310
They are not praises.

602
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,190
They are

603
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,920
coming from my heart,

604
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,640
heartfelt words.

605
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,190
You are weird.

606
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,400
Wait a bit more.

607
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,430
Wait for me to practice more.

608
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,560
Practice what?

609
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,070
I just want to praise you.

610
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,110
Shall I wait a bit more
to give the gift too?

611
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,040
What is body language?

612
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,920
It means

613
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,950
body language in communication.

614
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,640
In our competitions,

615
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,520
we often come into contact

616
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:30,880
with some foreigners.

617
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,190
Yes.

618
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,800
So it is important to foster

619
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,310
good intercultural

620
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,310
communication skills.

621
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,400
A language learner

622
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,680
needs to know the language

623
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,400
as well as its culture.

624
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,350
Today

625
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,800
I'm going to talk about

626
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,040
body language,

627
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,110
Chinese and foreign body languages,

628
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,310
body distance

629
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,640
and differences in contact behavior.

630
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,560
So here

631
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,590
there are a few key words

632
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,710
to pay attention to.

633
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,830
Body distance.

634
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,480
- Contact and behavior.
- Drop-dead gorgeous.

635
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,680
- What do they mean?
- Stunning beauty.

636
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,040
Body distance is…

637
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,440
- Body distance…
- Divine visage.

638
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,640
is what we often refer to as

639
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,190
- social distance.
- Breath-taking beauty.

640
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,600
It's the distance you keep from people

641
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,350
- while you are standing
- Dazzling beauty.

642
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,350
and communicating with them.
This is a very important distance.

643
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,160
- Different countries' definitions…
- Photographic memory.

644
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,310
- Some countries…
- Shen Qingyuan.

645
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,920
…may feel…

646
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,950
We are having an English class,

647
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,950
not a Chinese language class.

648
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,600
…when people first meet, they can

649
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,430
- be close to one another.
- Did you hear what I said?

650
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,800
- But in some countries…
- Well,

651
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,470
don't listen for now.

652
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,470
…social distance

653
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,000
- must be strictly maintained.
- Don't listen for now.

654
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
For them, this is called safe area.

655
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,680
- Safe distance.
- Breath-taking beauty.

656
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,350
- If you are too close to people,
- Photographic memory.

657
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,120
they would think you are

658
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,710
- intruding into their safe space.
- Sharp-witted.

659
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,310
And the next is contact.

660
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,280
Contact.

661
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,520
When can contact begin?

662
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,040
As we all know,

663
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,280
the most common social etiquette

664
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,960
is handshaking, right? As we all know,

665
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,680
handshaking is a typical form
of contact.

666
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,800
A little frog sees your serious learning

667
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,070
and comes to root for you.

668
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,400
People may hug

669
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,600
or even kiss each other's cheek, right?

670
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,640
We often see in TV plays

671
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,840
the extent of contact.

672
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,960
We need to know the country first.

673
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,640
The little frog you folded

674
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,120
is really…

675
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,560
- The last is behavior.
- vivid,

676
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,680
lifelike

677
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
and unpredictable.

678
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,590
Let me recite more.

679
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,710
Captain, look.

680
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,080
And you are still flinching.

681
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,560
Actually, as soon as you stand there…

682
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,560
Shall we

683
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,110
take a snapshot

684
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,950
and post it online,

685
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,920
saying Shen is busy dating all day

686
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,830
and neglecting his study?

687
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,710
Isn't it boring

688
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,710
to use the same trick twice?

689
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,160
What's more,

690
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,590
whether he's neglecting his study

691
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,470
is up to his coach's judgment.

692
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,230
Shen Qingyuan.

693
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,230
It seems

694
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,680
Shen Qingyuan is quite capable.

695
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,950
He looks as if

696
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,190
nothing can distract him.

697
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,560
He has no soft underbelly at all.

698
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,830
If it goes on like this,

699
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,040
our assessment match…

700
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,880
Our country, ourselves,

701
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,680
we athletes and our compatriots…

702
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,000
It's an English class,

703
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,880
not a Chinese language class.

704
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,430
They are the same.
They are both language classes.

705
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,040
Not necessarily so.

706
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,350
As you know,

707
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,110
there are differences

708
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,590
between our culture
and foreign cultures.

709
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,350
- Our ways of communication
- Be good.

710
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,400
- are slightly different.
- Concentrate on the class.

711
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,710
When friends meet,

712
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,350
- we shake hands
- Stay still.

713
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,110
- Captain is quite something.
- before hugging each other.

714
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
But in the west,

715
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,950
people hug before shaking hands.

716
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,280
For instance,

717
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,110
these two students'

718
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,350
body language…

719
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,040
is quite consistent with

720
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,040
western ways of communication.

721
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,830
Body language.

722
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,160
Just now these two students

723
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,830
gave us

724
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,800
a simple demonstration of contact.

725
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,160
That's the ins and outs of the story.

726
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,920
Shen Qingyuan didn't have

727
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
such bad praising skills back then.

728
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,190
You don't know

729
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,280
he had a silver tongue

730
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,310
in senior high school.

731
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,160
Did he?

732
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,160
Back then he was just…

733
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,400
king of the praising group.

734
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,950
Even ten Mr. Zhou

735
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,950
and Du Lingfeng combined together

736
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,950
were not as articulate as he.

737
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,520
Back then, I was

738
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,040
bombarded with his sweet talk every day.

739
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,470
From what you told me,

740
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,760
he's shown no sign

741
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,070
of memory recovery?

742
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,190
But it doesn't matter.

743
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,520
It's good the way things are now.

744
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,760
Although he's somewhat different
from his former self,

745
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,350
what matters is

746
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,920
we are together.

747
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,110
So

748
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,000
even if he can never

749
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,920
recover his lost memory,

750
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,560
I don't think that'll be a problem.

751
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,190
As to the truth of the matter back then…

752
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,710
If it's possible,

753
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,830
I still want to know.

754
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,590
But if it's really impossible,

755
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,230
I won't insist.

756
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,350
That young guy just now was so handsome.

757
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,070
Did you find that?

758
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,710
Du Lingfeng,

759
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,430
what are you doing here?

760
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,280
Hi.

761
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,190
You smell of alcohol.

762
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,520
Xiang,

763
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,040
you go back first.

764
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,640
What about you?

765
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,160
I'm OK. Don't worry about me.

766
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,680
OK?

767
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,430
By the way,

768
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,070
be careful.

769
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,520
A drunkard has great strength.

770
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:31,800
Xiaoci,

771
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,040
you came back so late.

772
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,710
It's getting dark.

773
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,070
Are you here to be frozen

774
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,800
on such a cold day?

775
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,280
No.

776
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,230
Stand firm.

777
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,230
Let go of your hands.

778
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,110
No.

779
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,760
What are you doing, Du Lingfeng?

780
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,560
Loosen your grip!

781
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,590
All right.

782
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,920
Let me tell you again.

783
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,710
I was in a bad temper last time.

784
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,470
Sorry.

785
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Stay away from me next time.

786
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,950
Our wrestling relationship

787
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,760
is over.

788
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,560
Why?

789
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,710
- No.
- I don't want to say it again.

790
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,000
Well,

791
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,800
what exactly has happened?

792
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,400
What happened

793
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,590
that made you say
our relationship is over?

794
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,040
- Xiaoci.
- Can't you knock it off?

795
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,760
Du Lingfeng,

796
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,710
we were not

797
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,880
related in any way from the beginning.

798
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,400
The wrestling relationship
is also made-up.

799
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,640
What's the point of being so serious?

800
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,350
Because I like you.

801
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:18,920
Xiaoci,

802
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,680
let's be together.

803
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,190
OK?

804
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,640
As I said before,

805
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,070
this is the end of it.

806
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,880
I handpicked this gift

807
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,560
to apologize to you.

808
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,470
I can't believe you make friends

809
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,350
with that kind of person.

810
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,150
Did I kind of overreact?

811
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,800
Let's be together.

812
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,080
Xiao…

813
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,630
Xiaoci,

814
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,710
did you and Du Lingfeng…

815
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,870
Men are a nuisance indeed.

816
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,760
Forget it. Go to bed.

817
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,360
Then I'll…

818
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,950
Xiaoci, I…

819
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,320
I'll go back then.

820
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,080
The temperature is just right.

821
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,230
At this time,

822
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,520
the little hedgehog must be sleeping.

823
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,280
Will he

824
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,360
take this as his home

825
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
when he wakes up?

826
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,280
You are so nice to him.

827
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,630
You've specially prepared
a home for him.

828
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,360
It's getting colder and colder.

829
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,950
I'm afraid he'll freeze in the cold.

830
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,870
Your kindness to him

831
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,000
shows you are kind-hearted

832
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,190
and loving,

833
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,120
and you have patience,

834
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,190
compassion and empathy.

835
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,630
This shows

836
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,600
you'll be even nicer to me.

837
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,390
Shen Qingyuan,

838
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,840
why are you still praising me?

839
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,710
Because I want you

840
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,600
to get better as early as possible.

841
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,670
It's time for the assessment match.

842
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,320
Let's go back.

843
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,800
It's about time

844
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,560
for livestreaming.

845
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,150
There's no time to go back
to change my clothes.

846
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,190
What shall I do?

847
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,710
Go back to the shooting team first

848
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,560
to borrow an outfit
from the female members.

849
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,120
(Restroom)

850
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,320
It seems to be locked.

851
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,520
What's wrong with you, Shi Xiaoci?

852
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,870
Keep your cool.

853
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,800
What are you guys doing?

854
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,040
Nothing.

855
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,120
Chen Hai,

856
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,470
we are all worried about you.

857
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,360
My grandpa lived to the age of 99

858
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,870
just because he was not meddlesome.

859
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,120
We are not being meddlesome.

860
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,840
We are taking pleasure
in helping others.

861
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,840
Indeed.

862
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,320
You are old for the sport

863
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,520
and have a poor family background.

864
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,040
If you can't achieve good results

865
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,150
in a short period of time,

866
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,710
what are you gonna do afterwards?

867
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,320
Don't say that.

868
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,560
Piss off.

869
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,950
Watch your language.

870
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:08,600
Let go of your hands.

871
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,430
I'm not afraid of you guys
even if I'm outnumbered.

872
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,560
Piss off when you are done
using the restroom.

873
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,840
No trash talk here.

874
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,870
Captain.

875
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,040
Go in first.

876
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,230
I'll guard the door for you.

877
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,600
Round 1

878
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,840
of Group 1 of the singles

879
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,150
is coming to an end.

880
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,360
Since

881
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,760
the final scoring method is used,

882
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,950
the full result of every shot

883
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,190
is 10.9.

884
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,430
10 shots amount to 109.

885
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,800
From the beginning to now,

886
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,910
shooter Shen Qingyuan

887
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,080
has been in the first place.

888
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,360
There's a saying which goes

889
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,760
"Good fighters have no
illustrious military achievements."

890
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,670
Get to the point.

891
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,950
He's so handsome!

892
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Let's not just

893
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,230
root for Shen Qingyuan.

894
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,800
Remember to give a like

895
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,430
to the anchor of our sports channel.

896
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,040
104.1!

897
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,150
Awesome!

898
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,900
Awesome!

899
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,710
Captain Zhou,

900
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,560
given his result,

901
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,080
we can't beat him at all.

902
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,000
This is only Round 1 of the singles.

903
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,760
Next

904
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,470
let's take a break

905
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,230
and wait for the start of Group 2.

906
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,230
Ladies and gentlemen,

907
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,950
please take a short break.

908
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,150
For the upcoming Group 2,

909
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,470
although there will be

910
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,760
no star athletes like Shen Qingyuan,

911
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,230
it looks like it's going to be
a closely fought battle.

912
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,760
Yes.

913
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Actually shooter Chen Hai

914
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,950
has been the No.2 seeded player

915
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,910
of Haiya Team.

916
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,040
You can trust his strength.

917
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,630
He's a late bloomer.
