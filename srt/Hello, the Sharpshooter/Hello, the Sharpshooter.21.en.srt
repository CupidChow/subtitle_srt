=Hello, The Sharpshooter=

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
=Episode 21=

35
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,559
- Long time no see.
- Indeed.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,760
You look great.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,639
Everyone is here.

38
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,360
Coach Liu,

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,040
a word, please.

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,800
Yeah. Sure.

41
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,199
Shen Qingyuan,

42
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,160
it's been a while.

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,080
All right.

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
You are still the same as before.

45
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,519
Too big for your boots.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,760
You didn't change at all.

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,400
Captain Zhou,

48
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,839
watch your language.

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,239
What do you mean by
too big for his boots?

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,959
Are you deliberately

51
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,120
targeting Captain Shen

52
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,519
because of what happened
in the last competition?

53
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,160
You should examine yourself

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,759
for your poor performance.

55
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:10,919
Yes.

56
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,160
But I only practice solo shooting,

57
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,080
unlike you guys

58
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,240
who do mixed team training
and rely on other's strength.

59
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,679
Do you think mixed team training

60
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,440
relies on one person to win the title?

61
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,639
No.

62
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,639
But we men

63
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,119
have inborn advantages

64
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:26,960
over you women.

65
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,800
Sorry, out of my professional habit,

66
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,399
I've inadvertently

67
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,600
recorded your conversation

68
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,399
just now.

69
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,240
Do you think I can release it?

70
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,160
It should be OK.

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,759
If such a recording is released,

72
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,279
the center of a storm of controversy

73
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,399
will certainly not be
our Haiya Shooting Team.

74
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,279
Right.

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,520
Besides, verbal sexual harassment

76
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,039
is also a topic of interest

77
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,399
of the general public.

78
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:48,919
Yes.

79
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,839
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

80
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,080
Loosen your hand.

81
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,679
Keep your cool.

82
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,520
What are you up to?

83
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,199
What are you doing?

84
00:02:59,399 --> 00:02:59,960
Shen!

85
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,679
Let go of your hand.

86
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,160
Knock it off!

87
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,679
Be mindful of your images.

88
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,639
Coach Zhang.

89
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:11,800
Coach Liu.

90
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,839
Hello.

91
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,800
Is he the one you adore?

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,679
Long time no see.

93
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,919
Long time no see.

94
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,679
Hello, hello, hello.

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,240
What great pomp!

96
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,399
It's my fault

97
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,360
for keeping you guys waiting
for so long.

98
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,399
Tang Xin from Rui Live?

99
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,800
Hello, Mr. Xu.

100
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,119
I'm in charge of livestreaming.

101
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:33,440
He's in charge of the technical part.

102
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,279
This is our first cooperation.

103
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,199
Your help is appreciated.

104
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,000
Mr. Zhou has talked a lot about you.

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hope we can

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,320
have pleasant cooperation this time.

107
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,080
You'll do great!

108
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:42,880
Sir,

109
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,080
I'll go and get photographic equipment.

110
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:44,960
Go on with your work.

111
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,919
Coach Zhang,

112
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,440
I'll go in first, OK?

113
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,520
He's really affable.

114
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,000
He's a big-name host after all.

115
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Of course, he's polite

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,919
and kind to people.

117
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,679
He gives me a feeling of kindness.

118
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:02,679
All right.

119
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,800
Let's check in too.

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,520
- OK.
- OK.

121
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,039
Let's go.

122
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,440
Coach Zhang and Coach Li,

123
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,800
these are your room keys.

124
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,600
- OK, thanks.
- OK, thanks.

125
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:14,960
You are welcome.

126
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,520
Coach Li,

127
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,559
this is your room key.

128
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,080
OK.

129
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,480
Shen,

130
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,239
check in

131
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,160
and let team members go to bed early.

132
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,200
We are going up first.

133
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,760
OK.

134
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,399
Zhou Yue.

135
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,119
- Bye, sir.
- Bye, sir.

136
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:22,600
When you are done with the arrangements,

137
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,640
- Bye, sir.
- go upstairs and go to bed early.

138
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:25,799
Hello.

139
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,679
The base currently

140
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,880
has two dorm areas in the east and west.

141
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,200
Both are on the 4th and 5th floors.

142
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,000
They are not much different.

143
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,160
You can choose
and fill out the form by yourself.

144
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,160
OK.

145
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,160
As a captain,

146
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,000
I must always have
my team members' interests at heart.

147
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,359
There must be differences
however slight they are.

148
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,440
You'd better let us know

149
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,279
what the differences are.

150
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,320
It's like this.

151
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,959
The dorm in the east
gets to see the sun in the morning.

152
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,880
The dorm in the west in the afternoon.

153
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:48,920
OK.

154
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,480
We'll take the eastern dorm then.

155
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:54,799
Sorry.

156
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,799
Haiya Shooting Team
has chosen the eastern dorm.

157
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,399
He filled it out without thinking

158
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
and he doesn't care about such trifles.

159
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
Just leave the eastern dorm to us.

160
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,079
Our team

161
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,959
doesn't need you to call the shots.

162
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,559
You are not calling the shots.

163
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
You are drawing lots randomly.

164
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,440
Well,

165
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,040
our captain is done drawing lots.

166
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,480
Do you have to ask our captain

167
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,079
to change his mind?

168
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,880
Indeed.

169
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,880
Captain Shen is indifferent to trifles,

170
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,640
but it doesn't mean he has no attitude.

171
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,119
After not seeing you for half a year,

172
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,679
when did Haiya Shooting Team

173
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,799
become

174
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,640
so united?

175
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,640
You admire us, don't you?

176
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,839
Admire what?

177
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,200
You are very much like a dog

178
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,959
protecting his master.

179
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,480
You are addicted to spewing trash talk.

180
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,200
How does this sound?

181
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,920
Let's leave it to the coaches to decide.

182
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,519
Miss Tang,

183
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm not the kind of man to bear grudges.

184
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,160
But just now

185
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,440
you took sides with Shen Qingyuan.

186
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,679
If you keep doing it,

187
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,720
aren't you afraid

188
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,880
our Southeast Team will pull out

189
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,279
of the partnership
with Rui Live afterwards?

190
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,679
Talk to me if you want
to change the dorm.

191
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,359
Don't provoke my people.

192
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,720
What happened?

193
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,519
What's going on?

194
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,160
Mr. Xu,

195
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,359
it's like this.

196
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,720
The two teams are bickering

197
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,519
over their dorms.

198
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,880
Zhou Yue is a little bit unconvinced.

199
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,119
OK, leave it to me.

200
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,959
Excuse me.

201
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:12,959
Excuse me.

202
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,480
Captain Zhou, Captain Zhou.

203
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
Come on, let's have a talk.

204
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,160
OK?

205
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,160
Is that guy

206
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,519
your acquaintance?

207
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,559
No.

208
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,239
We've met for the first time.

209
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,440
Western dorm, thanks.

210
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,519
OK.

211
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,480
These are the keys to the western dorm
for Southeast Team.

212
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,559
These are the keys to the eastern dorm
for Haiya Team.

213
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,760
Please keep them safe, captains.

214
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:57,799
Mr. Xu.

215
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,519
Let's go.

216
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,320
Take the keys.

217
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,279
We are media professionals.

218
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:01,880
Media professionals

219
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,279
should heed conversational skills.

220
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,079
Zhou Yue

221
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,320
is very keen on saving face,

222
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,720
so you have to persuade him

223
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,480
with image concerns.

224
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:09,799
I see.

225
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:10,600
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

226
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,239
You are welcome.

227
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,480
Tang Xin,

228
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,000
I've watched your livestream before.

229
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,079
Really?

230
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,440
It was really good.

231
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,000
You have

232
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,920
very strong

233
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,880
competition-reading abilities.

234
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,279
I've been a commentator

235
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,279
of shooting competitions for years,

236
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,399
and your knowledge content

237
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,320
and professionalism

238
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,640
are the best.

239
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm flattered.

240
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,239
Miss Tang!

241
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:32,920
Let's go.

242
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,160
Mr. Xu, I'm going first.

243
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,760
OK. Go.

244
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:36,880
I'm coming, I'm coming.

245
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,600
You've been talking for so long.

246
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,040
He's my senior.

247
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,640
I have lots of things to learn from him

248
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,279
in the coming days,

249
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,519
and he's quite a nice guy.

250
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Disingenuous.

251
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,720
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Go. Go. Go.

252
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,720
Here we are. Here we are.

253
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,920
Is it on this floor?

254
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,600
It's over there.

255
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:05,679
Over there.

256
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,799
Captain, your room is No.513.

257
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:07,760
No.513 is over there.

258
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,559
Captain, yours is over there.

259
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,760
I'm going over there first.

260
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,559
- Go. Go.
- Go.

261
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,279
This way.

262
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,720
What a jealous boyfriend!

263
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,359
Why is he even jealous

264
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,959
of a forty-year-old man?

265
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,000
Is he really angry?

266
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:26,679
Mrs. Shen,

267
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,399
our captain's mood

268
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,480
hinges on every word you say.

269
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,039
Make sure you

270
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,080
ease his worried mind.

271
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,280
Mine is over there.

272
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,719
- This one.
- This one.

273
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,960
This is not your room.

274
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
I want to take a tour around

275
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,280
an athlete's room.

276
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,760
Don't talk to that guy later on.

277
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,119
I promise

278
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,400
I'll never contact him

279
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,559
apart from working circumstances.

280
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:01,880
Shen Qingyuan,

281
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,080
why are you throwing a tantrum again?

282
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:15,479
As a punishment,
you are not allowed to see me.

283
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,960
Do some self-reflection.

284
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,520
My goodness!

285
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,400
What is this

286
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
classical princess-style

287
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,280
punishment?

288
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,479
(Shen Qingyuan, why are you so cruel?)
This guy really thinks of himself

289
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:26,640
as the male lead of an idol drama.

290
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,960
Shen Qingyuan,

291
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,599
why are you so cruel?

292
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,080
Every second without seeing you

293
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
is grinding torture for me.

294
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,440
Dr. Ding.

295
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,440
What brings you here?

296
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:09,799
This is for you.

297
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,119
Hope you can give me a chance.

298
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,960
Haven't I told you I'm married?

299
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,200
I know.

300
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,080
But I heard

301
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,559
you two have been separated
for a long time.

302
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,640
So now do you think

303
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,119
if I can…?

304
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,119
Thank you for your love.

305
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,159
But I have

306
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,080
no such plan at the moment.

307
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,200
Why?

308
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,799
Are you still thinking about him?

309
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
It has nothing to do with you.

310
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,440
Please go back.

311
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,400
I will not take the bouquet with me.

312
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,679
Take care.

313
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,599
After I graduated with my Ph.D.,

314
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,280
I gave up offers abroad

315
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,119
and came back to stay with you.

316
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,119
What did I do that for?

317
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,080
Wasn't it

318
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,440
just for our relationship?

319
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,599
We've been married

320
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,280
for no more than five years,

321
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,119
and why did we

322
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,799
become what we are like now?

323
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,280
Can't you

324
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,200
speak out about your problems?

325
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,919
We can face them together!

326
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,280
Don't analyze my micro-expressions!

327
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,559
Do you find it interesting?

328
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,880
Place these tripods

329
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,479
all

330
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,359
in a fixed position.

331
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,239
This place is equipped with laser sights

332
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,479
that can record

333
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,280
shooting moves with precision.

334
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,640
Remember to use them.

335
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,280
They are good in many ways.

336
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,000
OK.

337
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,080
This place is much more luxurious

338
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,039
than our university.

339
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,159
Tang Xin,

340
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,200
I happen to be looking for you.

341
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,520
Come to have a look.

342
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,440
Is this position OK?

343
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,880
Captain.

344
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,400
Captain.

345
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,080
Let's have a look.

346
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,960
OK, OK, OK.

347
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,640
It's quite good.

348
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,640
It enables observation

349
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,919
of the shooters' subtle movements

350
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,719
and appearance
of the round target numbers on camera.

351
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:48,280
Does it?

352
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,760
Stand here to feel it.

353
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,479
Look. Do you think so?

354
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,479
Captain,

355
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,119
where are you going?

356
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,400
To get my bearings around the venue.

357
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,280
There is a small problem

358
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,159
with your livestream.

359
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,159
Please go ahead.

360
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,039
I'll write it down.

361
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,679
In your livestream,

362
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,520
you put too much emphasis on game rules

363
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,200
and the use of jargon.

364
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Actually, we commentate

365
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,119
on such kind of niche sports competition

366
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,640
by starting with a story.

367
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,599
For example, the foreign shooter

368
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,200
Emmons

369
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,520
always misses the target
in his last shot

370
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
in every major competition.

371
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,440
Isn't that interesting?

372
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,440
We should tell such little stories

373
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,719
to arouse the public's interest

374
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,440
before providing a deeper insight

375
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
into a shooting competition.

376
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,039
You are right.

377
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Can I also

378
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,440
give nicknames to the shooters

379
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,880
to deepen the impression?

380
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,960
You are clever.

381
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:39,880
You draw inferences from one instance.

382
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,599
I've come to think

383
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,840
of your commentating style.

384
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,039
I liked watching shooting competitions

385
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,200
when I was in senior high school.

386
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,280
At that time, I liked

387
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,400
watching you commentating
on the matches.

388
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,840
I didn't expect
I'd see you in person now.

389
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,280
Did the real person disappoint you?

390
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:52,880
No.

391
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,520
By the way, Tang Xin,

392
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,840
maybe we'll have a chance

393
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,400
to be commentating partners this time.

394
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,359
Really?

395
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,880
People from the shooting sports center
have come.

396
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,760
I've got to meet them.

397
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,359
OK, Mr. Xu.

398
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:06,760
Get on with your work.

399
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,239
OK.

400
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,960
Hello?

401
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,479
Are you okay?

402
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,880
Are you used to the new shooting range?

403
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,640
Didn't you say
you were suffering grinding torture?

404
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,159
Why were you talking
so happily just now?

405
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,159
Shen Qingyuan,

406
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
do you want me
to suffer grinding torture so badly?

407
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,440
That's it then.

408
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,840
If I kept suffering grinding torture,

409
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,000
I'd become powder.

410
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,880
Wouldn't you also hate to see that?

411
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,039
Even so, you can't

412
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,159
have such a sweet chat with others.

413
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,679
Are you still being jealous of Xu Dian?

414
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,960
I

415
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,359
do adore Xu Dian very much,

416
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,719
but it's just

417
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:03,880
admiration and respect
between colleagues

418
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,200
with no other intentions.

419
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,640
Just as Jiang Yitian

420
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,520
adores you.

421
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,440
I didn't suspect

422
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,880
something was going on
between you, right?

423
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,280
It's normal for Jiang Yitian
to adore me.

424
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,760
The man you adore is abnormal.

425
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:18,599
No.1 Narcissist in the Universe,

426
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,000
do you think

427
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,119
you are the only person I can adore?

428
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,400
It'll be safer that way.

429
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,760
All right, all right, all right.

430
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:32,960
All over the world,

431
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,039
no,

432
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,479
all over the universe,

433
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,640
I adore Shen Qingyuan most.

434
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,159
Do you think this is OK?

435
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,200
I'm going for shooting practice.

436
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,320
Tang Xin,

437
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,440
come to my rescue!

438
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:17,359
Tang Xin.

439
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,559
You've come at long last.

440
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,440
Tell me quickly.

441
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,559
Where is Xiaoci at the moment?

442
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,400
Where is her dorm?

443
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,119
The girls' dorm.

444
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,000
Shouldn't you

445
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,280
ask her directly?

446
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,280
Well, she doesn't reply to me on WeChat.

447
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,559
I suppose she's unpacking her suitcase.

448
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,039
If you had come with the team earlier,

449
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,880
you would have known how the dorms

450
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,000
were assigned.

451
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:35,039
Don't get me started.

452
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,359
Tang Xin,

453
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,320
Goddess of Livestreaming,

454
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,840
can't you really tell me?

455
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,679
How do I not know

456
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,400
your trickeries…?

457
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,599
Let's do it this way.

458
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,239
Give me some advice

459
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:48,880
and I'll tell you

460
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,000
how the dorms were assigned.

461
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,880
No problem. Go ahead.

462
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:53,359
What trick up my sleeve do you want?

463
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,440
Is there any way

464
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,559
to make Shen Qingyuan happy?

465
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,640
What?

466
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Tang Xin,

467
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,520
you are the one who's doing it today?

468
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,039
You should know yourself first.

469
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,520
Although you are

470
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,799
an ordinary little girl

471
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,440
in my eyes,

472
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,400
for Shen Qingyuan,

473
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,159
you are the whole world,

474
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:21,640
no,

475
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,599
his one and only all over the universe.

476
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:25,840
So

477
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,640
if you want to make him happy,

478
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,880
there are plenty of ways to do so.

479
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,080
Shen Qingyuan

480
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
is just too emotional.

481
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,239
Something I say can make him happy

482
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:36,000
and probably sulky again
the next second.

483
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,039
Indeed.

484
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,840
You have to come up with something

485
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,000
that he can see at any time

486
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,799
and reminds him
of your goodness at any time.

487
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,440
Why don't you do this?

488
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,479
Make him a DIY gift.

489
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,039
It's better to make something

490
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,200
he can wear or put on wherever he goes.

491
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,520
Right.

492
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
The Spring Festival is coming soon.

493
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,479
Brother Du,

494
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,599
your wonderful idea
brings peace to the world.

495
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:05,920
You haven't told me

496
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,079
where Xiaoci's dorm is.

497
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,239
What's the point of waiting?

498
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:14,079
What if she doesn't come out

499
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,800
all day?

500
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,479
Look at the stuff in his arms.

501
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:18,920
It's quite cute.

502
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,880
No.

503
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,839
Xiaoci is so diligent.

504
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,439
I'm sure she'll come out for training.

505
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,479
But then again,

506
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,520
if I give this to her now,

507
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,599
I don't know what to give her

508
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,439
for the Spring Festival.

509
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,920
Xiaoci,

510
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,560
bombshell gossip!

511
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:40,520
Southeast Team's

512
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,599
stunning female shooter,

513
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,680
the one in the same placing as you,

514
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
did plastic surgery.

515
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:45,880
Did she?

516
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,359
Well, she's quite a looker.

517
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,680
I heard she had changed many parts.

518
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,239
Here, here and here.

519
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,400
They all went under the knife.

520
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,119
She probably set a high bar

521
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,000
for herself.

522
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,239
Well,

523
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,920
I admire such people a lot.

524
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,520
They dare to think and do it

525
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
without caring about how others feel.

526
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,640
So just

527
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,680
to be a little prettier than others,

528
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,199
she let her face
go under the knife so many times?

529
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,479
It hurts just thinking about it.

530
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,599
She didn't necessarily

531
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,160
want to compare with others.

532
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:12,959
Maybe

533
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,160
she just wanted to be more confident.

534
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:18,479
Well, Liu Xiang,

535
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,119
what era are we in?

536
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,160
Do girls still not

537
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,680
have the right to choose for themselves?

538
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:23,760
What's more,

539
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,479
does a girl make herself look better

540
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,959
just to please others?

541
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:26,920
Let me tell you,

542
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,599
it's time for you to change your mind.

543
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
That's right indeed.

544
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,760
You have more awakening awareness.

545
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,040
If I were a man,

546
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,160
I'd certainly take you as my wife.

547
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,800
You are beautiful, honey-mouthed

548
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,199
and so considerate.

549
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,839
All right. Go back quickly.

550
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:41,719
Go and unpack your belongings.

551
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,079
Got it.

552
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,839
Babe.

553
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:45,920
Bye.

554
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,160
Xiaoci.

555
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,160
What are you doing?

556
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,400
Why are you here?

557
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,319
You didn't reply to my messages

558
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,880
and I didn't know
where you were staying,

559
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,959
so I had to wait for you here.

560
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:24,920
This is for you.

561
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:26,160
Girls like it.

562
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,880
It's cute indeed.

563
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,239
Give it to other girls instead.

564
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,239
Well, Xiaoci.

565
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:34,520
Why?

566
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,959
Don't you have to take care
of your company business?

567
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,040
No, no.

568
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,400
Coming to see you is my business.

569
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,400
I just want to ask you

570
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,880
why you've been
giving me the cold shoulder these days.

571
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,239
Du Lingfeng,

572
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,199
we are not a match.

573
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,079
You don't have to

574
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,160
spend time and energy on me.

575
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:49,839
It's not worth it.

576
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,120
(No.64, Building No.33)

577
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:23,839
Would you like some help?

578
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:25,959
Thanks.

579
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,359
It's OK. Let me do it, let me do it.

580
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:29,760
It's quite heavy.

581
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:35,719
Thanks.

582
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,160
Excuse me,

583
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,640
are you Dr. Ding?

584
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,079
Do you know me?

585
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,199
I'm sorry for being abrupt.

586
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:44,959
I didn't expect

587
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:45,959
you were living in this community too.

588
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:46,800
This is my business card.

589
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,839
I'm a lawyer.

590
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,880
I always wanted

591
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,439
to book a counseling session with you.

592
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:52,959
Did you?

593
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:53,439
Yes.

594
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:54,839
I give counseling sessions

595
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,000
in the hospital every Friday.

596
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:56,560
You can

597
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,599
make an appointment in advance.

598
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,319
OK.

599
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,160
Well,

600
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,719
if I'd like to make an appointment

601
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,640
with you at ordinary times,

602
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,560
will you have time?

603
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,000
Like on holidays and festivals.

604
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,079
Don't get me wrong.

605
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:10,239
I book your counseling session

606
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:11,359
for my ex-wife.

607
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,359
So

608
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,239
do you have time now,

609
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,000
Dr. Ding?

610
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,160
What gift shall I give him?

611
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:26,800
I'm coming.

612
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,599
Move aside, move aside.

613
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,880
Tang Liqi?

614
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,479
Where did you get
so many body-warming patches?

615
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,719
And Ganmaoling Granules?

616
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,119
Body-warming patches?

617
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,760
Thank you, Qingyuan.

618
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,040
You are so sweet, Qingyuan.

619
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:55,760
How do you know

620
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,839
I happen to have caught a little cold?

621
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,800
Bring these to your sister.

622
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:02,119
They are not for me?

623
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,239
It's cold these days.

624
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,239
Tell your sister to stay indoors

625
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,160
and not to catch a cold.

626
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,520
Is that so?

627
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,239
Why don't you leave some to me?

628
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,800
Go easy on it.

629
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,280
Only this?

630
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,839
I'm your brother

631
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,800
and you give me only one patch?

632
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:36,599
Well,

633
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,520
the warm and sweet Ganmaoling Granules.

634
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,479
I deserve to have a pack of this.

635
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,520
That's enough
as a reward for running errands.

636
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,199
I knew

637
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,400
you and Qingyuan

638
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,040
were a perfectly-matched,
conscienceless couple.

639
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,359
Do you have a problem with that?

640
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,160
Nope.

641
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:55,560
It's mainly because

642
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I did a test recently

643
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,520
and found myself
to have a sister complex,

644
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,839
so I have to obey my sister.

645
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,520
I can't help it.

646
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,239
What have you been studying

647
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,599
all day long?

648
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,760
Get out of here quickly.

649
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,640
Go, go, go.

650
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,400
OK, OK, OK.

651
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,640
OK, OK. I'm going, I'm going.

652
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,400
Bye.

653
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,119
A gift

654
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,079
is really a big headache.

655
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,319
Gloves?

656
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,280
Scarf?

657
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,280
No, no. They are too common.

658
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,680
I promised Shen Qingyuan

659
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,560
to wait for him

660
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,719
to get into the Olympic Games.

661
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,079
Right.

662
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:53,560
I can give him this as a gift.

663
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,760
Why can't I hail a taxi?

664
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,239
What's going on?

665
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,119
Tang Xin.

666
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,199
Mr. Xu.

667
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,199
Are you going out?

668
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,880
The base is in the middle of nowhere.

669
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,599
Come on, get in the car.

670
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,439
Let me give you a ride.

671
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,239
Isn't it too much trouble for you?

672
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,160
Not at all.

673
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,280
Isn't it just a ride?

674
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,119
As it happens,

675
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,000
it's almost time for dinner.

676
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,079
We can have dinner together.

677
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,839
Disingenuous.

678
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,920
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

679
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Even so, you can't

680
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,319
have such a sweet chat with others.

681
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,839
Are you still being jealous of Xu Dian?

682
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,680
Mr. Xu,

683
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,680
I'm sorry.

684
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,239
The taxi I hailed is about to arrive.

685
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,439
I'm going for now.

686
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:48,280
Let's do it next time.

687
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,680
OK.

688
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,439
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

689
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:02,959
Miss,

690
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,719
you can't enter.

691
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,920
Why?

692
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,719
Do I look like a thief

693
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:06,599
or a robber?

694
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,560
You don't have an employee card.

695
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,959
You are not allowed to enter
as per regulations.

696
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,280
I'm here to see Xu Dian.

697
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Do you know Xu Dian?

698
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,800
If you know him,

699
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,040
you can contact him yourself

700
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,040
and ask him to get

701
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,839
a temporary employee card for you.

702
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,520
I must enter.

703
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,479
Miss, you…

704
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:21,800
Ai!

705
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,599
- So what?
- Ai!

706
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,079
You can't enter.

707
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,839
Get in the car.

708
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:37,760
Brother Xu.

709
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,040
Let's go. Buckle up.

710
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:40,520
OK.

711
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,520
Let's drink a toast first,

712
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,119
sir.

713
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,199
You still call me sir?

714
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,400
Xu.

715
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,680
Brother Xu.

716
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,479
What did you go
to the training base for?

717
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,959
I was missing you so much.

718
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,439
It's not that simple, is it?

719
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,119
I was kicked out of Rui Live.

720
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,520
Were it not for you,

721
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,400
I wouldn't even know

722
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,560
how to go on with my life.

723
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,599
You are my only benefactor.

724
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,359
It's not against the law to miss you.

725
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,719
What's gotten into you today?

726
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,160
Your mouth is smeared with honey?

727
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,880
Brother Xu,

728
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:48,520
you see,

729
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:50,319
your company is selecting presenters.

730
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,640
I have such a silver tongue

731
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,760
and I've been idle for so long…

732
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,599
Look at you.

733
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,599
Wasn't it good for you

734
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,599
to stay at Star Show back then?

735
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,319
That was because
a job with a state-owned company

736
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,719
provides stable income and job security.

737
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,800
And I could be near to you.

738
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,959
Don't you think so?

739
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:10,959
This type of show

740
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,239
really doesn't suit you.

741
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,400
As long as
there is something that suits you,

742
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,920
I'll certainly set it aside for you.

743
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,199
OK. I'll take your advice.

744
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:04,800
Hello.

745
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:06,640
Please show your ID.

746
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,119
OK. Go in.

747
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,119
What are you doing here?

748
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:16,959
I'm waiting for you.

749
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,400
It's freezing outside.

750
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,959
Did you go out with that guy?

751
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,319
Which guy?

752
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,199
He has a name.

753
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:25,280
Did you really go out with him?

754
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,760
No.

755
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,959
If you go out at such an hour again,

756
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,199
be sure to tell me to go with you.

757
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:33,599
Athletes

758
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,199
are not allowed to go out freely.

759
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,160
I can ask for a leave.

760
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:37,079
OK.

761
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,239
You win.

762
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,760
Be serious.

763
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,920
Sure.

764
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,680
Are you a supplier
of body-warming patches?

765
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,359
If you feel cold,

766
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:58,800
you can lean on me anytime you like.

767
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,959
Don't you feel cold in your face?

768
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,719
I feel cold in my fists.

769
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:09,920
See what you can do.

770
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,880
Cold in your fists?

771
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:18,959
You won't feel cold this way.

772
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,719
All right. Let's go.

773
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,079
How can I walk this way?

774
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,079
Just walk normally.

775
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,880
Just keep your eyes on where I'm going.

776
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,480
(Southeast Olympic Sports Center
Training Base)

777
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,119
Turn left.

778
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,800
Come to think of it, Shen Qingyuan,

779
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:37,959
what bullets

780
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,640
are you using now?

781
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,119
Haven't you used them before?

782
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,959
I was busy counting my results.

783
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:44,880
I didn't look carefully.

784
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,439
Air pistol bullets

785
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,719
leave no shell casings after shooting,

786
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,640
which makes it hard to observe.

787
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,239
Tell me more in detail.

788
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,319
Why are you suddenly

789
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:52,959
interested in this?

790
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,160
I'm going to commentate on matches.

791
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,719
I must constantly expand my knowledge.

792
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,959
People usually

793
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:58,920
are not interested in this.

794
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,880
Tell me more in detail.

795
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:05,160
4.5mm bee waist bullet,

796
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,959
thick at both ends
and thin in the middle,

797
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,479
is also called hollow bamboo bullet.

798
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:10,959
I'll keep it in mind.

799
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,680
By the way,

800
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,160
the bullet head is flat.

801
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,719
I've given you enough details.

802
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,199
You can even start making a handicraft.

803
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,839
Who says I'm gonna make a handicraft?

804
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:23,959
I didn't say that.

805
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,319
Ai,

806
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:37,839
I found you could

807
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,959
handle more alcohol now.

808
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:42,199
By the way,

809
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,400
for this winter training,

810
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,719
Rui Live has sent a girl

811
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,640
named Tang Xin.

812
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,599
Tang Xin has come?

813
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:52,959
Do you know her?

814
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,239
She's quite a nice girl.

815
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,199
I watched her livestream content before.

816
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:58,160
It was professional.

817
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,280
When I met her in person this time,

818
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,599
I found her modest, keen to learn

819
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:02,959
and clever.

820
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:05,760
Brother Xu,

821
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,599
she's the one who was lorded it over me

822
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,199
when I was at Rui Live.

823
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,319
You don't know

824
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,479
how she got promoted, do you?

825
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,079
She looks simple-minded.

826
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,280
Could there be something shady?

827
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,359
Between you and me,

828
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:25,079
between she and Zhou Zuguang,

829
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,479
it's exactly the same.

830
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,119
Flat-headed hollow bamboo bullet?

831
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,239
No.

832
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,079
I have to find a picture

833
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,920
for reference.

834
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,000
(No results for "flat-headed
hollow bamboo bullet" found)

835
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,880
Tang Xin,

836
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,079
are you in bed yet?

837
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,239
This is Xu Dian.

838
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,280
Not yet.

839
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,959
Mr. Xu,

840
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,680
how did you know my cellphone number?

841
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:21,000
You are

842
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,040
an important partner of mine

843
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,160
in recent days.

844
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,239
Of course,
I must heed your contact info.

845
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,839
The livestream of the shooting events

846
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,400
my company and the TV station
are working on this time

847
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,479
is a brand-new way of telecasting.

848
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,800
You may not be familiar with it.

849
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,640
Come to the venue early.

850
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,760
I'll help you get your bearings.

851
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,439
OK.

852
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,760
Thank you so much, Mr. Xu.

853
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,119
Don't

854
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:48,520
be so courteous all the time.

855
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,160
One's energy is limited.

856
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,400
If you set aside half of it

857
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,680
for being courteous and discreet,

858
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,000
you wouldn't have the energy

859
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,880
to learn hosting

860
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,959
and commentary skills from me.

861
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:03,239
Could I seek your advice on these too?

862
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,680
Sure.

863
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,400
I can meet such a nice senior.

864
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,760
I'm so lucky.

865
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,479
Don't toss and turn.

866
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:47,439
Fall asleep quickly.

867
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:49,760
No, I can't fall asleep.

868
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,160
I'm kind of unused to the bed.

869
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:54,560
Our captain has no such problem.

870
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,640
He's in super good condition
wherever he goes for competition.

871
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,560
If you improve your performance

872
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,040
and have a single room like Captain,

873
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,280
you can be in good condition as well.

874
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:02,880
Isn't that a "catch-22 situation"?

875
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:05,040
This won't do.

876
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,439
I'll go to see Captain tomorrow

877
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:08,560
and ask him for some advice.

878
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,840
It's freezing, freezing, freezing.

879
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,719
How do presenters

880
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,840
go through winters?

881
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:15,639
Shen Qingyuan.

882
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,919
What are you doing, Shen Qingyuan?

883
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:27,639
Take off your coat.

884
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:32,800
Knock it off.

885
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,280
I'm here to tell you to be on time for…

886
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,679
Do you want me to help you?

887
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:44,919
By the way,

888
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,919
put these things away

889
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,399
and handle them with care

890
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,639
when you move them onto the vehicle.

891
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,879
Put this stuff in order

892
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:51,719
- and take it to the vehicle.
- Hello, sir.

893
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,040
What's up?

894
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
I'm a technician

895
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,919
of Rui Live.

896
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,120
Do you need me to go up

897
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,919
and give you a hand?

898
00:35:57,919 --> 00:35:58,679
No, no.

899
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,919
We'll get the signal

900
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:01,040
in sync with your website,

901
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
and you'll only
have to do real-time messaging.

902
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,159
I see.

903
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Thank you then.

904
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,040
Wait a minute.

905
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:08,560
Wang.

906
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:10,000
Give me a headphone.

907
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,239
Here you are, Director Zhang.

908
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:12,879
Here you are.

909
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,280
Bring this headphone

910
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,360
to Miss Tang, the live streamer.

911
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:15,879
OK.

912
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:16,399
It's her first time

913
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,560
being a hostess on TV, right?

914
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,679
Make sure you remind her

915
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:19,919
to always listen to my cues,

916
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,600
all right?

917
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,199
OK.

918
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,080
Thanks.

919
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:22,600
Bye.

920
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,399
Bye, sir.

921
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,199
What's the matter, Director Zhang?

922
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,879
The child sent by Rui Live

923
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:31,840
doesn't seem to have much experience.

924
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:43,679
Hello.

925
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,479
Give these two mics and this…

926
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:45,800
OK.

927
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,639
…to him over there.

928
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,320
OK.

929
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,280
Leave this to me.

930
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,040
(Southeast Sports Bureau
2019 Mobilization Meeting)

931
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,520
Tang Liqi.

932
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,080
Tang Xin.

933
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,000
How are you getting on with it?

934
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,560
Not too bad.

935
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,919
I talked to the program director

936
00:36:58,919 --> 00:36:59,840
of the TV station just now.

937
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,080
They said there would be
no rehearsal this time

938
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,919
and we'd just do it.

939
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:02,879
It's OK.

940
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,719
You are not the keynote speaker.

941
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,439
Don't be nervous.

942
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,159
By the way,

943
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:06,800
the program director

944
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,639
asked me to give this to you.

945
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,560
Put it on while you are doing your job

946
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,639
and just follow his instructions.

947
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,439
I almost forget.

948
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,959
Was it cold when you came in

949
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:14,520
from outside?

950
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,800
I have a special trick.

951
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:17,600
What trick?

952
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
Did you ask me to take off my coat

953
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,800
just for this?

954
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,080
Yes.

955
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,560
Or what else?

956
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,360
Finished at last.

957
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:46,360
Here, try it on.

958
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,560
Isn't it warm?

959
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,040
So many.

960
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,199
Did Qingyuan do it for you?

961
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,600
He has a warm heart.

962
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,360
Here comes the signal
for pushing the station logo.

963
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,760
The number of new viewers
in the live room reached a record high.

964
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,159
Tang Xin,

965
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,600
show your best this time.

966
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,560
OK.

967
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,320
You two.

968
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,120
Who can give me a hand?

969
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,239
I'll go.

970
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:17,239
I… I'll go.

971
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,439
You work on the website.

972
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,320
OK.

973
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:21,719
Here, help me

974
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:22,479
to move this over there.

975
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:22,959
OK.

976
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,959
You two,

977
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,320
make sure you look through the details

978
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,439
to see if there's anything
that hasn't been taken care of.

979
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:27,320
Hurry up to look it through.

980
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,199
Devices! Be quick!

981
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,080
Hurry up.

982
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,080
Put it in the corner.

983
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,040
(Southeast Sports Bureau
2019 Mobilization Meeting)

984
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:33,479
OK.

985
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,879
Avoid eye-catching places.

986
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,919
Put the device in that corner.

987
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,239
Thanks.

988
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:38,800
No problem.

989
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:46,439
Tang Xin,

990
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:47,679
you dropped your headphone.

991
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,280
Thank you.

992
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:50,399
I was too careless.

993
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,040
It's only normal for your first time.

994
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,360
The biggest difference

995
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,040
in telecasting is

996
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,479
we have multiple camera stands.

997
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,719
So when you see

998
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,560
the cameraman intercutting scenes,

999
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,000
you should

1000
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,479
look out for the right camera stand.

1001
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,199
But…

1002
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:04,520
No worries. I know.

1003
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,080
The program director will cue you.

1004
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,000
So

1005
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,159
telecasting

1006
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,199
is different from livestreaming.

1007
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:09,800
There is

1008
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,040
a 20-second delay.

1009
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Even if you make a mistake,

1010
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,959
the program director will cut you out.

1011
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,760
I see. Thank you.

1012
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,199
Good luck. I think highly of you.

1013
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,919
Come to see me if anything comes up.
I'll get on with my work.

1014
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:20,760
OK, Mr. Xu.

1015
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:35,399
We are ready to start in ten minutes.

1016
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,919
Presenters, listen to my cues.

1017
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,919
Look at Camera Stand No.2.

1018
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,520
Let's do a sound check first.

1019
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:40,879
Camera No.1

1020
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,320
to the front row of seats
for the leaders.

1021
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,600
Camera No.2 to the athletes' seats.

1022
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,879
Focus on
intercutting scenes of Shen Qingyuan.

1023
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:50,520
Look, the mobilization meeting

1024
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,760
is quite imposing.

1025
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:01,479
Captain.

1026
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:05,679
I'll go over there first.

1027
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:08,879
Presenter, ready.

1028
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Look at Camera No.3.

1029
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,840
Five.

1030
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,360
Four.

1031
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,199
Three.

1032
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,879
Two.

1033
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:18,959
One.

1034
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,199
