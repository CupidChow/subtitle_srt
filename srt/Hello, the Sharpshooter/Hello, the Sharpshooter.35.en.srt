35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,239
Did I provoke him?

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,480
Dr. Ding,

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,919
what should I do?

38
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:41,639
Am I supposed to leave

39
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:43,000
or should I call 120?

40
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,519
I noticed yesterday

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,480
that he'd turn away from me
once he saw me.

42
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,760
But once

43
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,720
something bad happened to me,

44
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,000
he'd control his emotions

45
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:51,680
and force himself to look after me.

46
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,639
If I keep being around him,

47
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm concerned

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,120
that he may
be more and more depersonalized.

49
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:00,199
And his career may be…

50
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:00,839
Tang Xin,

51
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,199
please calm down.

52
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,080
The most important thing right now is

53
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,519
the helper needs

54
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,480
to share the patient's pain.

55
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,559
So for Shen Qingyuan's sake,

56
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,600
you have to stay strong.

57
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,160
Only with the help of your guidance

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,639
will Shen Qingyuan be willing

59
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,479
to come back
and take the psychotherapies

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,639
so that he can continue to shoot.

61
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:18,600
Dr. Ding,

62
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,800
I really don't know

63
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
what I'm supposed to do now.

64
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,800
Tang Xin,

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,119
you must affect Shen Qingyuan

66
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,119
with positive emotions.

67
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,720
Don't be scared.

68
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,240
Because you're the crux of his disease.

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,479
Every time he sees you,

70
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,559
it's like he's facing the trauma itself.

71
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,160
His agony

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,520
is his emotion
that has gone out of control.

73
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,839
So the constant positive emotions

74
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,320
from you

75
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,440
will help rectify his reaction.

76
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,679
Understand?

77
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,919
Okay, I understand.

78
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,320
Don't worry.

79
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,720
You can do this.

80
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,679
I have faith in you.

81
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,919
But if his condition worsens,

82
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,039
you let me know at once.

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,199
Yes, something is destined,

84
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,960
but I believe men can conquer destiny.

85
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,039
Men can conquer destiny.

86
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,320
Shen Qingyuan.

87
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:51,839
Shen Qingyuan.

88
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,399
Did you feed me

89
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,600
with medicine last night?

90
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,639
I was in deep sleep.

91
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,880
Was I difficult to look after?

92
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Put my coat on.

93
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,759
I'm not cold.

94
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,160
Shen Qingyuan.

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,000
(Low battery)

96
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,760

97
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,160

(Unanswered Calls: Dad Mom)

99
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,679
I know I shouldn't do this.

100
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,160
When I was young,

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,000
I hated to be forced to get up

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,279
by my parents.

103
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,880
But there's a saying.

104
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,559
No going hard,

105
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,519
no getting up.

106
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,519
Here I come.

107
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,959
You're so heavy.

108
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:23,880
I can't get you out.

109
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,839
I'll move the bed away, okay?

110
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,799
The bed is heavier than you.

111
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,839
Shen Qingyuan,

112
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,239
even though you don't speak to me,

113
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,040
I have ways to make you happy.

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,359
Shen Qingyuan,

115
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,600
welcome to Tang Xin's mini play.

116
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,600
This is the exclusive drama for you.

117
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,200
What play will it be?

118
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,160
I'll improvise, then.

119
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,079
Once upon a time,
there was a little hedgehog.

120
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,600
He was super aloof.

121
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,359
Just like you, Shen Qingyuan.

122
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,320
The hedgehog

123
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,839
was like a boss in the forest.

124
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,720
Because he was covered with spikes.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,480
No one would dare to get close to him.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,480
But over time,

127
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,239
the hedgehog felt

128
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,600
a touch of loneliness.

129
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,440
One day,

130
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,359
the hedgehog smelled

131
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,359
something weird.

132
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:35,959
That should be

133
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,480
the smell of destiny.

134
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,760
The hedgehog felt like

135
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,760
the duck had feelings for him.

136
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,839
So after long deliberation,

137
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,799
the hedgehog decided
not to be aloof anymore,

138
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,799
and chase the duck.

139
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,320
But the duck was startled.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
When the duck
saw the hedgehog for the first time,

141
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
he was still a small hedgehog

142
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,359
who had short and soft

143
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,320
spikes.

144
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
But now, the hedgehog had grown up.

145
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,920
He was covered

146
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,959
with pointy large spikes.

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,079
How would the duck
dare to get near him?

148
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,920
And

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
the duck had her own problem.

150
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,440
In her youth,

151
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,720
when the duck played with the hedgehog,

152
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
she accidentally lost

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,079
most of her feathers,

154
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,320
so later the duck

155
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,600
became featherless.

156
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,440
So all of her shortcomings

157
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,600
were fully exposed.

158
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,839
If the hedgehog didn't protect her…

159
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:31,079
My comedy turned out a failure.

160
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,480
It looks like

161
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,079
I lack talent in comedy.

take a leap and kiss him.

the call from your dad.

217
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,599
Won't you pick it up?

218
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,919
I'll speak to your dad
on your behalf, then.

219
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,159
Mr. Shen.

220
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,320
Qingyuan isn't

221
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,799
doing very well.

222
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:56,000
I'd like to tell you something.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,239
And I owe you and Mrs. Shen

224
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,719
an apology.

225
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,640
Shen Qingyuan's stress response

226
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,599
was caused by me.

227
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,520
I didn't expect the winter training

228
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,039
would become like this.

229
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,919
You didn't expect many other things.

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,559
Captain and Miss Tang's
romantic relationship

231
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,039
hasn't been smooth.

232
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,640
Don't feel so down, boys.

233
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,359
We can't just wait.

234
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,039
Listen, Tang Xin.

235
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,200
Now the top priority

236
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,559
is that Qingyuan gets
the best medical treatment.

237
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,400
His mother and I

238
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,960
will rush back to the country
as soon as possible.

239
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,280
Before that,

240
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,159
you'll have to

241
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,760
take care of him for us.

242
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,960
No problem, Mr. Shen.

243
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,039
Oh, Mr. Shen.

244
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,919
Do you still remember

245
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,440
what exactly happened

246
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,679
when Shen Qingyuan had the car accident?

247
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,880
Sorry, I don't really remember

248
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,479
what exactly happened.

249
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,039
But what I do have

250
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,200
are some police documents

251
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,000
about the car accident.

252
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,960
How about

253
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,320
I send them to you?

254
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,159
Okay.

255
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,640
Mr. Shen, bye.

256
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,280
Thank you.

Dr. Ding.

258
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,880
How long will it approximately take

259
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,799
for Shen to get well once he takes

260
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,840
the clinical psychotherapy

261
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,479
by your estimation?

262
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,479
I can't really say.

263
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,640
You know

264
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,039
that Shen Qingyuan has a record

265
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,799
of running away from
clinical psychotherapy before.

266
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,119
To be honest, Dr. Ding.

267
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,640
The team is facing pressure

268
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,840
from every direction.

269
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,239
The Chinese New Year is near.

270
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,200
The trial for national team

271
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,640
will be in April,

272
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,919
by then…

273
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,840
Let's put how I explain

274
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,880
to the university or the bureau aside,

275
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,039
I'm afraid it can cause

276
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,479
more damage to Shen.

277
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,599
He

278
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,119
had too smooth

279
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,200
of a career before.

280
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,320
A fallen prodigy

281
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,919
only has two options.

282
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,280
He either falls to the bottom

283
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,080
and becomes an ordinary guy

284
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,200
or

285
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,840
struggles out of it

286
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,200
and flies to higher places.

287
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,599
Which one

288
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,440
do you think Shen Qingyuan is?

289
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,559
Let's wait for the message

290
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,760
from Tang Xin for now.

291
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,640
(Coach Zhang)

292
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:36,919
Hello, Tang Xin.

293
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,000
Hello, Coach.

294
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,039
I spoke

295
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,239
to Shen Qingyuan's dad.

296
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,080
Glad to know.

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,159
But I

298
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,200
have to tell you that

299
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,400
the shooting team doesn't give shooters

300
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,280
very long Spring Festival holidays.

301
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:51,440
If Shen doesn't return to the team

302
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,840
after the holidays…

303
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,919
I see, sir.

304
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,599
I'll try to find the solution

305
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,679
as soon as possible.

306
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,919
Okay.

307
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,080
I'll help you

308
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,239
handle the pressure from the bureau.

309
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:03,840
I've seen

310
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,080
too many talented shooters

311
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,679
fall halfway through.

312
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:08,239
This time,

313
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,039
I'm willing to sacrifice my job

314
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,440

it is your tug-of-war with fate.

335
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,479
So please, get well.

336
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,760
Okay?

From south to north.

339

Shen Qingyuan.

343
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,080
Let's go back to Yongcheng.

344
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,080
Shen Qingyuan, look.

345
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,159
This is

346
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,400

00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,919
According to this,

348
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,799
you weren't running away.

349
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,159
You were on the way to save me.

350
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:55,960
Look.

351
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,239
You didn't run away.

352
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,919
You wanted to save me.

353
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,920
If you still don't believe me,

354
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,599
let's go

355
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,040
to the site of accident and verify it.

356
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,640
Okay?

357
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,000
Shen Qingyuan,

358
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,680
let's drop our luggage

359
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,439
at the hotel.

360
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,640
Then we buy some snacks

361
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,599
for Jujube.

362
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,599
We went out in a rush.

363
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,160
I'm worried that we didn't
bring enough food for him.

364
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,079
Jujube.

365
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,400
I thought he'd miss us.

366
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,199
So before I left,

367
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,239
I shipped him here.

368
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,359
We'll soon arrive.

369
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,599
It should be around here.

370
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:08,400
But we need to

371
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,560
spend more time finding the turn.

372
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,119
You know?

373
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,359
It's become so different
from what it was like in 2015.

374
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:15,920
Look over there.

375
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,119
The subway.

376
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,839
And the road is wider.

377
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,319
Are you sure it's this road?

378
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,560
I am.

379
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,680
A small path can grow.

380
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,599
Let's go.

381
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,000
This is the crossing

382
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:48,560
we'd always pass.

383
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,079
This should be it.

384
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,400
It's okay, Shen Qingyuan.

385
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,479
Look.

386
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,480
(Road Traffic Accident
Responsibility Confirmation)

387
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,079
All that you did at the time

388
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,160
was recorded
by this surveillance camera.

389
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,760
The car came from uphill,

390
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,560
and was driving south.

391
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,719
But you were going in
the wrong direction.

392
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:32,359
So the car hit right into you.

393
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,719
Shen Qingyuan,

394
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,839
I'm dead certain

395
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,760
that you were trying to save me.

396
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,199
You were running towards me.

397
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:50,959
Let's go up there.

398
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,680
Maybe it'll ring a bell.

399
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,719
Let me go!

400
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:22,280
Don't move!

401
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,400
Don't move!

402
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,520
On that day,

403
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,680
this is where I was…

404
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,400
Stop.

405
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,479
It's okay.

406
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,079
Shen Qingyuan.

407
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,479
After we took our selfie,

408
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,439
it didn't take us long
to walk to this place.

409
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,040
And then we ran into the robbers.

410
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,280
I think these two

411
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,040
had a criminal record,

412
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,760
so they hid here.

413
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,040
They heard us, and they…

414
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,040
Would you like to go and have a look?

415
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,400
No.

416
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,319
Tang Xin,

417
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,400
let's head back.

418
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,040
Shen Qingyuan,

419
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,079
it's good enough

420
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,560
that you walked me here.

421
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,400
Does it mean

422
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,199
you're starting to believe me?

423
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,439
Even if the evidence

424
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,239
that Zhou Yue provided is real.

425
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,119
A responsibility confirmation form

426
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,079
and a screenshot
of the footage of the car accident.

427
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,280
The two pieces

428
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,959
of real evidence

429
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,280
are enigmatically contradictory.

430
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,760
Does it mean

431
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,439
there's another explanation
about the whole thing?

432
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,680
Tang Xin,

433
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,040
why do you have so much faith in me?

434
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,920
You're such an idiot.

435
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,160
You still don't get

436
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
how I really feel.

437
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,920
It's because I love you.

438
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,719
When you're in love with someone,

439
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,800
how do you not

440
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,839
know who he is like?

441
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,400
He's nice to me,

442
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:48,839
and I've felt it

443
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,839
in my daily life.

444
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,479
And that

445
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:53,119
is something
that cannot be easily erased.

446
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,520
I love you,

447
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,359
so I trust you.

448
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,439
I'm sorry.

449
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,160
The moment you say sorry

450
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,199
makes me want to cry.

451
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,079
I won't say it again.

452
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,640
That's more like it.

453
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,680
You can't let me experience

454
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,560
such a hard time again.

455
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,359
Nor can you leave me behind again.

456
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:42,760
Thank you.

457
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,839
There you go. You're welcome.

458
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,199
Coming.

459
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,319
How do you know

460
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,479
I like Yoji nectar?

461
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,680
I didn't know.

462
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,439
My gut feeling told me to order it.

463
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,520
So

464
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,719
you haven't completely
lost your memory,

465
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,199
am I right?

466
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,400
Before,

467
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,199
you often took the bus
back and forth with me

468
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:23,239
to have the desserts here.

469
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,040
Yoji nectar was my favorite.

470
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,199
You teased me,

471
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,040
saying only kids love desserts.

472
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:36,800
Why don't you say something?

473
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,479
Being quiet is so not you.

474
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,680
It's good

475
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,479
to be quiet from time to time.

476
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,839
You have nothing to say to me already?

477
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,640
What do we do

478

Sure.

481

That's very likely.

Even if it is,

520
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,000
we go to our high school tomorrow

521
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,040
to recall the good old days?

522
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,119
Which way?

523
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,040
Where should we go?

524
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,520
You can't find the way back
to the school?

525
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,400
I was here before.

526
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,319
I just don't remember the way.

527
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,040
I suck at directions.

528
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
I'll check the GPS.

529
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,479
No.

530
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,959
There's a bus station.

531
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,479
- Quickly.
- Quickly, quickly.

532
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:20,520
Shen Qingyuan,

533
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:21,040
you're now

534
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,479
using your cellphone quite smoothly.

535
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,520
It's always good to be prepared.

536

538
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
(Yuying High School)

539
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,719
Shen Qingyuan, look.

540
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,040
The destination of the bus

541
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,000
is our high school.

542
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,520
You remember that?

543
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,199
Yuying High School of Yongcheng.

544
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,520
I do.

545
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,040
I also remember you said

546
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,040
that you went to No. One High School

547
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,680
in the south of the city.

548
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,719
Oops.

549
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,000
You know

550
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,319
I was messing with you, right?

551
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,400
Forget it. Forget it.

552
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,280
We're on this trip

553
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,520
of finding our real memory anyway.

554
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,239
Excuse me. Make way, please.

555
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,440
(Yuying High School of Yongcheng)

556
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:41,439
I remember here.

557
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,719
Especially that corridor.

558
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,680
When I trained in high school,

559
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,520
I'd only travel between

560
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,680
the classroom and the training gym.

561
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,800
About the rest,

562
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,640
my memory is kind of vague.

563
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,880
That's because all your important

564
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,040
memories about this place

565
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
were those you had with me.

566
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,640
So you don't really remember the rest.

567
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:01,520
Shen Qingyuan, you know?

568
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,959
Every girl has this dream

569
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:04,000
in a romantic relationship.

570
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,959
They all want to take their boyfriends

571
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,359
to the schools they went to.

572
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,199
The more unfamiliar
the boyfriend

573
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,479
is with the place,

574
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,119
the more fulfillment the girl gains

575
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,520
as his guide.

576
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,719
Let's go inside.

577
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,560
Stop. Stop there.

578
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,319
Who are you?

579
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,520
It's now the winter holiday.

580
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
You two don't seem like
the students here.

581
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,439
- We…
- Get out. Get out.

582
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:30,040
- W-We are…
- We are…

583
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,800
Out. Out.

584
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:33,520
Who are you two?

585
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:16,520
You know what?

586
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,040
Sneaking into the school
over the wall

587
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,880
is exactly what we'd do
when we were students.

588
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,319
Shen Qingyuan,

589
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,239
let me show you

590
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:27,680
what Yuying High School of Yongcheng
is really like.

591
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,800
Follow me.

592
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,400
Those two young people

593
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,880
look familiar.

594
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,520
(A Shooter of Our School Successfully Made It
into the National Junior Shooting Championship!)

595
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:50,880
Yes.

596
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,640
This is him.

597
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:53,839
Yes.

598
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:55,640

The basketball court.

601
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,479
This is

602
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:18,479
where I hit the ball
with my head countless times

603
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,359
before

604
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,920
a boy named Shen Qingyuan

605
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
caught the ball for me

606
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,520
for no reason.

607
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,119
Shen Qingyuan,

608
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,000
give it back to me.

609
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,560
Shen Qingyuan.

610
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,239
This is the teaching building.

611
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:53,920
This is

612
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,119
where I'd often

613
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,119
secretly watch you.

614
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,640
(CVS)
And here.

615
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,959
This is the CVS.

(Push)

617
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,599
What's special about it

618
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,439
is that this is

619
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,920
you bought me ice-cream
for the first time.

620
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,040
Too bad, it's the winter holiday.

621
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,520
Do you remember

622
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,959
you bought me ice-cream

623
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,439
at the Candy Carnival?

624
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:27,680
I do.

625
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,760
That was ice-cream for couples.

626
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:39,880
Look over there.

632
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:53,359
This is where I saw you

633
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,479
for the first time several years ago.

634
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:02,599
I doubt the authenticity

635
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,359
of the story.

636
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,199
Though I can't really remember it,

637
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,320
I always have a feeling

638
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,280
that the story has another version.

639
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,360
I think I paid attention to you

640
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,560
earlier than you thought.

641
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:14,919
My state

642
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,399
after our re-encounter
was the best proof.

643
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,360
So

644
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,399
there's no way I abandoned you,

645
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,159
right?

646
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,439
You two.

647
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,080
- Run.
- Run.

648
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,439
Stop running. Stop running.

649
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,719
Stop. Stop.

650
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,080
Where are you going?

651
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,879
I've locked the gates.

652
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,399
Sir,

653
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,879
we're sorry.

654
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,879
We shouldn't have sneaked in.

655
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,679
It's just

656
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,479
we used to study here.

657
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,879
It's a rare opportunity for us

658
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:54,600
to revisit our high school.

659
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,000
Sorry

660
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
that we caused you trouble.

661
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,399
Sorry.

662
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:03,840
I just remembered

663
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:06,919
you're Shen Qingyuan
from the shooting team,

664
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:07,399
aren't you?

665
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,840
And you're the little girl

666
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,199
who always

667
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:12,919
followed him anywhere he went,

668
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:13,800
aren't you?

Tang Xin.

670

Tang Xin.

671
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,320
You don't doubt my story now, right?

672
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,199
You came to see the shooting center?

673
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:21,719
Yes.

674
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:23,439
I'll open the door, then.

675
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,639
I'll show you around.

676
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,919
It's been so long.

677
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:26,600
Now that you're here

678
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:27,679
in your old high school,

679
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,800
we'll enjoy a proper tour.

680
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,000
- Come on.
- Thank you, sir.

681
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,439
Thanks.

Never mind, sir.

684
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:55,639
No need to open it.

685
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:57,959
What?

686
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,600
What's wrong?

687
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,239
Sorry.

688
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,399
(Shooting Center)
I mean, you're already here.

689
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:04,679
Just take a quick look.

690
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,120
Sir,

691
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:06,959
we came here in a rush.

692
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,080
We'll come back again
when the school is open.

693
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,239
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

694
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:09,840
Fine, fine.

695
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,560
You're welcome

696
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,159
to tour around the school.

697
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,679
Sure, sure.

698
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,439
Okay, okay.

699
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,199
See you next time.

700
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:17,719
What's the matter with you?

701
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,040
Shen Qingyuan,

702
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,360
do you remember

703
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,399
our promise

704
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,399
about the Olympics?

705
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:08,719
Xiaoci.

706
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,159
Coach.

707
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,840
Everybody else went home
to celebrate the New Year.

708
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,199
Why are you still here?

709
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,760
No worries. I'll train more.

710
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,399
This is the last year

711
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,199
of the Olympic cycle.

712
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:19,360
Our responsibility is heavy.

713
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,600
I'm kind of stressed.

714
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:21,520
But it's fine.

715
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,679
My home isn't far.

716
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,000
I can go home some days later.

717
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,919
Pack your stuff.

718
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:26,320
I have something to say to you.

719
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,239
Okay.

720
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,600
Xiaoci,

721
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:35,360
I'd like to hear

722
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,439
your plan for the future.

723
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,719
My plan for the future

724
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:39,959
is the same as before.

725
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,199
So is my desire to win.

726
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,520
There's something

727
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,040
that you can hold on to,

728
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,959
but if something

729
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,239
happens inevitably,

730
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,919
getting prepared in advance

731
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,679
for yourself is the best option.

732
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,879
You're a sensible girl.

733
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,919
Go home and think about

734
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,280
if you need

735
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,120
to make a change.

736
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,879
Will you put more effort
in the individual race

737
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:01,879
or will you find a new partner

738
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,840
to continue staying in the mixed team?

739
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,879
But no matter what decision you make,

740
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:06,800
you have my support.

741
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:08,199
Thank you, Coach.

742
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,159
I got it.

743
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,679
Coach Zhang,

744
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:19,760
have you lost

745
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,080
faith in Shen Qingyuan?

746
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:24,120
I do expect him to return,

747
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:26,639
but Haiya doesn't

748
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,919
need a shooter
who'd lose control of himself.

749
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,439
Even if he returns,

750
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,000
he'll have to show

751
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,280
that he's good enough
to stay on Haiya Shooting Team.

752
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:34,679
I see.

753
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,600
Coach said so?

754
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:52,800
Xiaoci,

755
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,879
I have been

756
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,439
reconsidering

757
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:57,080
when to quit.

758
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,360
What?

759
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,399
Want to be my new partner?

760
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,000
Are you teasing me?

761
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:07,239
I'm thinking

762
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,840
if I should delay my quit.

763
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,479
Though you have

764
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:12,560
a better rapport with Shen Qingyuan

765
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,800
than with me,

766
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:14,719
I am still

767
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,800
a fine shooter.

768
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,520
I can temporarily

769
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,399
serve as your training partner

770
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:19,959
until Shen Qingyuan

771
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:21,199
comes back in a good state.

772
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,639
I'm impressed

773
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,120
that you think this way.

774
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,879
I'm just worried about you.

775
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,280
I'm worried that you may lose hope.

776
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:35,159
I'm supposed to fulfill

777
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,360
my duty as your boyfriend,

778
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:37,199
aren't I?

779
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,320
So I'll begrudgingly

780
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,399
stick around a bit longer.

781
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:42,520
Don't feel stressed, okay?

782
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:44,360
Got it.

783
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,439
Let me go.

784
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:46,600
No.

785
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,280
Let me go.

786
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,679
No peeking.

787
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,439
Why so mysterious?

788
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,760
Just let me have a look.

789
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,320
No.

790
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,479
- One look. Just one look.
- No. No.

791
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:18,439
One look. One look.

792
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:18,800
Just one look.

793
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,000
Just one look.

794
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,800
- Just one look, please.
- No.

795
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,239
