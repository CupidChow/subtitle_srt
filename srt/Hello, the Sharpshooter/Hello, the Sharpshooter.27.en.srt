=Hello, The Sharpshooter=

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
=Episode 27=

35
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,519
Actually, shooter Chen Hai

36
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,879
has been the No.2 seeded player

37
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,839
of Haiya Team.

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,959
You can trust his strength.

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,559
He's a late bloomer.

40
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,480
(Did I hear it wrong?)

41
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,559
(It was Shen Qingyuan's voice.)

42
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,639
(Say a little bit more, please!)

43
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,959
(Has anyone recorded it?
Please give me the audio.)

44
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,839
Exactly.

45
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,760
Shen Qingyuan, who is watching the game,

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,160
helped with our commentary.

47
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,800
I wonder

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,440
if those who gave up
watching the qualification of Team B

49
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,680
will regret it.

50
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,679
This shot

51
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,279
was a little bit poor.

52
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:44,320
Stop.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,320
The second round is over.

54
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,520
Chen Hai,

55
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,839
I have something to tell you.

56
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,880
Zhou Yue from Southeast Team

57
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,039
ranks first.

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,160
Chen Hai ranks second.

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,399
After they two come back,

60
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,800
I'll take your place for five minutes.

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,320
I heard it.

62
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,600
You know what, Chen Hai?

63
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,679
You are

64
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,000
an excellent player.

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,679
Captain,

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,880
you don't need
to praise me deliberately.

67
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,080
Anyway,

68
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,320
when you found

69
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,440
you had a mental problem,

70
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,360
you tried to solve it actively.

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,080
You also didn't resist
the communication

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,639
with the psychologist.

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,679
Usually,

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
ordinary guys can't do that.

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,960
So, you're not inferior to anyone.

76
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,600
Don't be discouraged.

77
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,839
I heard you had

78
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,040
a suggestive sentence for yourself.

79
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,160
Think of nothing

80
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,880
and just shoot.

81
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,359
I trust you.

82
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,119
Come on.

83
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,320
I'm going, Captain.

84
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:58,640
Did you practice your praising skill

85
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,760
with Chen Hai?

86
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,119
It should have been

87
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:01,920
a specific skill for you.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,600
You did the right thing.

89
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,640
Shen Qingyuan,

90
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,559
you're behaving

91
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,600
more like a captain.

92
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,320
All right.

93
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,880
Female players will shoot.

94
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,839
I'll work on the livestream.

95
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,519
I haven't withdrawn from the team.

96
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,399
I must go and cheer

97
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,320
for my teammates.

98
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,839
Don't decline the dinner.

99
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,399
I'll be back after the game is over.

100
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,839
All right. I've arrived.

101
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,399
I'll talk to you later.

102
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:49,679
Nothing is wrong.

103
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,640
Get ready.

104
00:05:59,279 --> 00:05:59,679
Shoot.

105
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,440
(Non-bitter Lemon)

106
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,440
Bravo.

107
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,079
Awesome.

108
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,679
10.8.

109
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,040
Well done.

110
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,480
There'll be no problem.

111
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,519
She's too nervous.

112
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,040
4.2?

113
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,040
Did her pistol go off?

114
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,720
What's wrong with Xiaoci?

115
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,119
She...

116
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:25,320
Xiaoci.

117
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,480
Your safety flag.

118
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:40,359
Xiaoci.

119
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,119
Forget it.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,959
If she sees me, she'll feel worse.

121
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Why must I ask for a snub?

122
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,440
Here is the second-round assessment

123
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,160
for men's teams.

124
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,239
This time, Team B will shoot first.

125
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,679
Can we expect

126
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,000
another wonderful performance

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,279
and Shen Qingyuan's commentary?

128
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,679
Let's wait and see.

129
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,760
Think of nothing

130
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,239
and just shoot.

131
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,359
It's just the first shot.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,040
Don't be so nervous.

133
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,239
Think of nothing

134
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,720
and just shoot.

135
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,000
I can understand.

136
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,839
You're no longer young, after all.

137
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,839
One single shot

138
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:32,840
may decide

139
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,080
your athletic career.

140
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,760
They're going too far.

141
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,039
Zhang Yan,

142
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,200
you missed the target, didn't you?

143
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,599
What do you think you're doing?

144
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,119
You're going too far.

145
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,760
Stop.

146
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:45,599
Now,

147
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,640
there's a speech interference

148
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,320
with other players.

149
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,559
It's involved
in daily anti-pressure training

150
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,400
and the finals.

151
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,760
But now...

152
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,479
Think of nothing...

153
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,400
Shoot carefully.

154
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,840
If you fail to get a good score

155
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
and get expelled from the shooting team,

156
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:03,919
your mother's hospitalization expenses

157
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,760
will be gone, right?

158
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,000
What will you do, then?

159
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,039
...and just shoot.

160
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,599
Come on.

161
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,440
Be steady. Don't shake your hand.

162
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,400
Why is your hand shaking?

163
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,599
Could you shut up?

164
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,960
Didn't you do a good job

165
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
in anti-pressure training?

166
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Don't let me influence you.

167
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,640
Come on. Do a good job.

168
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Like I said,

169
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,840
if you fail to get a good score,

170
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,599
how can you pay

171
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,559
for your mother's hospitalization?

172
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,559
Would you cut it out, already?

173
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,159
Shen Qingyuan!

174
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,559
What happened?

175
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,640
- Captain!
- Captain!

176
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,359
Shen Qingyuan!

177
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:43,479
What happened? Is he all right?

178
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,840
- Captain.
- Captain.

179
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,760
Captain.

180
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,280
Suspension.

181
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,440
Chen Hai, the safety flag!

182
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,880
Go get the doctors.

183
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,640
- Captain.
- Captain.

184
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,880
(Non-bitter Lemon)

185
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,800
What happened?

186
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,799
Shen Qingyuan is wounded.

187
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,159
What's wrong?

188
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,919
What happened?

189
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,119
Shen Qingyuan was shot and wounded?

190
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,000
What are you looking at?

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,880
Stop rubbernecking.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,559
Get back to your work.

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,160
Why did that happen?

194
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,799
A pistol went off.

195
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,960
Shen Qingyuan's leg was shot.

196
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,359
Mr. Zhou.

197
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,920
(Non-bitter Lemon)

198
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,719
Captain.

199
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,320
Does it hurt?

200
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,000
Doctor,

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,919
is he seriously injured?

202
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,559
Luckily, it was an air pistol.

203
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,400
The bullet went through.

204
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,679
His bones

205
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,200
weren't wounded, though.

206
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,479
But muscle injury on the leg

207
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,840
can't be underestimated

208
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,640
for an athlete

209
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:36,840
who has to keep standing.

210
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,599
Now,

211
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,400
we can simply stop his bleeding
and bind up the wound.

212
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:41,760
I suggest he should be sent
to hospital in no time

213
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,520
for debridement.

214
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,880
Tang Liqi,

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,760
call the ambulance.

216
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,400
I didn't expect

217
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,479
such words to be so powerful.

218
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
The anti-pressure training
didn't help at all.

219
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,679
Without the best player,

220
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,000
Haiya Shooting Team
will be a very poor team.

221
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,239
Coach,

222
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,000
shall we continue?

223
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,919
Or shall we make it another time?

224
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,359
The assessment resumes

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,799
in five minutes.

226
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,239
All right.

227
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,159
Go get ready.

228
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,520
Stop shooting.

229
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,159
I called the ambulance.

230
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,919
It'll be arriving soon.

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,440
Zhou Yue

232
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:31,080
did that

233
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,000
just because he wasn't on our team.

234
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,919
During the team event,

235
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,799
you must shoot.

236
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,280
Don't make Qingyuan
get shot in vain.

237
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,919
Adjust your shooting condition

238
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,239
and get good scores.

239
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,760
So far, two rounds of qualification

240
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,919
have been over.

241
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,400
As for men's teams...

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,039
For the moment,

243
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,599
Shen Qingyuan is absent

244
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,039
from the second round

245
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,159
because of his injury.

246
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,960
But his score in the first round,

247
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,119
can make an exception

248
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:09,760
and get him

249
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,919
into the mixed team event.

250
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,239
No. 2 is

251
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,919
Zhou Yue from Southeast Team.

252
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,760
No. 3 is

253
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,599
Yang Xiaoling from Haiya Team.

254
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,679
Among women players,

255
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,159
No. 1 is

256
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,320
Yang Ling from Southeast Team.

257
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,039
No. 2 is

258
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,799
Chen Yueyue from Haiya Team.

259
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,479
Though highly-anticipated,

260
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,239
Shi Xiaoci

261
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,880
ranks third

262
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,840
due to her poor performance.

263
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,280
The gap between her and No. 2

264
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,479
can be nearly 20.

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,400
The coming mixed team event...

266
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,359
I'll shoot.

267
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,239
- Captain.
- Captain.

268
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,919
Have some rest.

269
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:49,679
Shen Qingyuan,

270
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,679
are you kidding?

271
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,400
Qingyuan,

272
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,799
you've proved yourself.

273
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,280
Go to the hospital first.

274
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,200
- Yeah.
- Captain,

275
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,799
go to the hospital.

276
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,919
But my teammates need me.

277
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,559
Doctor,

278
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,200
can you inject him with painkillers?

279
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,880
Athletes can't use painkillers.

280
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
How about the anesthesia needle?

281
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,679
It doesn't work on an open wound.

282
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,479
It's all right.

283
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,280
I can do it.

284
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,919
Captain, be careful.

285
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,119
Be careful.

286
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:12,960
Be careful.

287
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,880
Shen Qingyuan,

288
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,039
considering your wound,

289
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,320
you'd better go to the hospital.

290
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,559
Like you said,

291
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,320
my bones aren't wounded.

292
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,039
I'll bear it

293
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,799
and finish shooting soon.

294
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,000
Shen Qingyuan,

295
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,520
do you need to...?

296
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,119
All that matters now is

297
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,280
to cheer for my teammates.

298
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,239
Right?

299
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm your captain.

300
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,200
I must be responsible

301
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,559
for your scores.

302
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,880
Only when I help you

303
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,200
to get better scores

304
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,200
will you recognize me.

305
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,320
Right?

306
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,760
Come on, Shen Qingyuan.

307
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,320
Come on, Captain!

308
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,400
Come on, Captain Shen!

309
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,479
- Come on.
- Come on.

310
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,119
Be careful, Captain.

311
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,799
Captain Shen.

312
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,239
Xiaoci.

313
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:24,599
Do you remember

314
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,520
why we were assigned to the same team?

315
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,080
We were the best player

316
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,400
on our own teams.

317
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,119
The mixed event is new.

318
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,239
So, the best players

319
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,200
have to cooperate.

320
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,960
But think of the rifle team next door.

321
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,239
They fail to cooperate

322
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,280
as well as we do.

323
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,719
It's because you enjoy shooting.

324
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,239
You think it's wrong to enjoy shooting

325
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:49,559
and enjoy the victory?

326
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,520
At least, it doesn't accord

327
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,400
with athleticism.

328
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,679
It doesn't sound decent

329
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,119
or very respectable.

330
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:57,760
Every athlete

331
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,000
wants to prove himself.

332
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,320
But he can only prove himself,

333
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,039
relying on good scores

334
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:03,919
as well as

335
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,520
the undisguised desire to win.

336
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,320
So, burn up.

337
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,799
Take it as fuel

338
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,719
and driving force.

339
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Don't be discouraged.

340
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,479
I know.

341
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:20,679
My partner is

342
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,640
always like me.

343
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,359
Once she's on the shooting platform,

344
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:23,840
she sees nothing,

345
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,200
but the targets.

346
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:28,479
That's why I trust you so much.

347
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,640
I'm wounded now.

348
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,440
I may not be steady.

349
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,520
So, this time,

350
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,239
you control the pace.

351
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,080
Captain Shen,

352
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,000
I...

353
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,239
Don't ask questions before the game.

354
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,960
Assert yourself
with good performances.

355
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,880
Here I go.

356
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:11,960
Shen Qingyuan,

357
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,599
are you really all right?

358
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,599
Do you know

359
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,760
you look lovely when you cry?

360
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,080
Why are you still praising me

361
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,880
at such a moment?

362
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,960
Like you said,

363
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,440
I must be a good captain.

364
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,119
Mr. Zhou,

365
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,520
something big is going on. Look.

366
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,359
I'm looking.

367
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,000
Come on, Qingyuan.

368
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,559
Come on.

369
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,159
Come on, Captain.

370
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,760
Come on, Captain.

371
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,280
Come on.

372
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:56,640
Captain Shen.

373
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,839
Coach,

374
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,599
Shen Qingyuan is wounded.

375
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,719
But he still wants to shoot?

376
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,000
Now that he has made up his mind,

377
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
let him be.

378
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,520
Shen Qingyuan,

379
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,760
even if you lose to me today,

380
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,119
you won't be ashamed.

381
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,400
Don't worry.

382
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
I'm not as mean as you.

383
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,160
Scores count.

384
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,880
I didn't expect Shen Qingyuan

385
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,599
to be so tenacious.

386
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,160
Modify the headline

387
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,599
and promote the livestream.

388
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,000
The first shot of the mixed team.

389
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,439
On your marks.

390
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,400
The mixed team event

391
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,479
still adopts the counting of finals.

392
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,520
The male and female players

393
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,119
make 15 shots each.

394
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,520
30 shots in total.

395
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,400
Whoever has the highest scores wins.

396
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,239
Shoot.

397
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,520
Zhou Yue, 8.6.

398
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,280
Did Zhou Yue shoot

399
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,239
before he was

400
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,079
fully ready?

401
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,119
This isn't

402
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,439
what we expected.

403
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,199
But luckily,

404
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:24,239
Yang Ling from his team

405
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,079
performed normally.

406
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,520
She got 10.1.

407
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,280
Mind your own business.

408
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,199
So far, Shen Qingyuan

409
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,640
and Shi Xiaoci

410
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,479
haven't made their shots yet.

411
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,280
Is it

412
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,839
because of the accident just now?

413
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:50,880
Tang Xin,

414
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,359
do you have confidence in Shi Xiaoci?

415
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,040
Instead of that,

416
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,560
I prefer to say I trust her.

417
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I trust Xiaoci.

418
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I'm more convinced

419
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,319
that Shen Qingyuan
will trust his partner

420
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,560
as he always does.

421
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,319
I also believe

422
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
that they trust their pistols.

423
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,239
Awesome!

424
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,439
You've hit it.

425
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,640
Actually, I watched

426
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,599
the mixed team event

427
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,599
of Shen Qingyuan and Shi Xiaoci.

428
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,040
They cooperated very well.

429
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,920
But today,

430
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,839
Shen Qingyuan is wounded.

431
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,319
Let's wait and see

432
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,719
how Shen Qingyuan can perform.

433
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
10.9.

434
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,239
Perfect.

435
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,239
Unbelievable.

436
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,000
How did Shen Qingyuan do that?

437
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,839
He's wounded, anyway.

438
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:03,719
Actually,

439
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,239
to a player of air pistol,

440
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:07,839
slight shaking within a certain limit

441
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,959
can't be avoided.

442
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,839
Because we have heartbeats

443
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,079
and we breathe.

444
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,800
What they need to do is

445
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,079
to find the most stable
and accurate moment

446
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,640
with their muscle memory

447
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,000
when they shoot.

448
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
But Shen Qingyuan is trembling

449
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,839
because he's wounded, right?

450
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,119
So,

451
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,160
such a physical tremor

452
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,839
hasn't influenced his shooting

453
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,640
even if it hurts him.

454
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,400
Shen Qingyuan is born

455
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,040
to be a shooter.

456
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,119
That's right.

457
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,560
Shen Qingyuan and Shi Xiaoci

458
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,359
have the supreme cooperation.

459
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,959
Here comes the last shot.

460
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:21,439
We don't know why,

461
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,319
but Zhou Yue fails

462
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,599
to perform very well.

463
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,160
Possibly affected by him,

464
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,880
Yang Ling only got 9.1.

465
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,199
After her,

466
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,400
Zhou Yue got 8.

467
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,800
But Shi Xiaoci

468
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,119
got 10.5.

469
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,079
It's the last shot

470
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,280
of Shen Qingyuan.

471
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,359
I think

472
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,959
he doesn't need to shoot, right?

473
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,280
He'll shoot.

474
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,280
Now that he chose to shoot,

475
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,599
he won't give up.

476
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,520
The first shot was 10.9.

477
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,760
Right.

478
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,599
That's the feeling.

479
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,439
10.9!

480
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:23,920
10.9!

481
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,599
Yes, he got 10.9!

482
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,439
Let's congratulate the partners

483
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:32,839
on winning the first place unexpectedly

484
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:33,839
once again.

485
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,880
Bravo, Captain.

486
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,040
- Captain!
- Captain!

487
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,680
- Captain!
- Captain!

488
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,479
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

489
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:10,719
- Come over!
- Come over!

490
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,560
Be careful. Be careful.

491
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,880
Be careful. Be careful.

492
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,680
Be cautious.

493
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,959
Be cautious.

494
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,080
Don't hit his head.

495
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,640
It's your turn.

496
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,400
Promise me

497
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,000
that you'll win the team event.

498
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:39,640
Be careful.

499
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,280
- Hurry. Hurry.
- Quickly.

500
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,520
We can't let Captain Shen down,

501
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,160
right?

502
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,280
Captain Shen is my idol.

503
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,880
We can't let him down.

504
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,400
We can't let ourselves down, either.

505
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,640
I've been in shooting games

506
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,920
for nearly ten years.

507
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,040
Shen Qingyuan

508
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,760
had such a serious wound,

509
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,839
but he still stood firm.

510
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,439
I won't fall in this place.

511
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,800
Final of Men's Team Air Pistol,

512
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,800
the first shot.

513
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:39,839
Get ready.

514
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:40,760
Shoot.

515
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:02,640
Bravo.

516
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,920
So fast!

517
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:04,640
Oh my God.

518
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,000
Three members of Haiya Team

519
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,199
each got more than ten

520
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,680
for their first shot.

521
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,000
According to regulations,

522
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:10,680
the team event

523
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
also adopts the counting of finals.

524
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,319
Their scores will be judged

525
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,680
for the comprehensive assessment.

526
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:17,920
Go on.

527
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,479
Time to do the second shot.

528
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:20,880
The second shot.

529
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:21,920
Load your pistols.

530
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,119
Shoot.

531
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:44,760
Nice shot, Hai!

532
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,439
It took Chen Hai

533
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:49,040
a very short time to shoot.

534
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,359
It's not like him

535
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,920
when he's a late-bloomer player.

536
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:54,079
But he got an excellent score,

537
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:54,839
10.4.

538
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,400
What are you looking at?

539
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,680
What are you looking at?

540
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,719
Wasn't I telling the truth?

541
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:04,680
Now I believe

542
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,599
what Yang Zhou said.

543
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:06,640
Zhou Yue,

544
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,920
you'll get what you deserve.

545
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Jiang Yitian and Yang Zhou

546
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,680
got 10.2 and 10.6

547
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,560
in succession.

548
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,000
Haiya! Haiya!

549
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:32,479
- Haiya! Haiya! Haiya!
- Haiya! Haiya! Haiya!

550
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,160
They'll win.

551
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,439
Chen Hai made

552
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,319
better and better shots.

553
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,160
An experienced player like him

554
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,680
can't be underestimated.

555
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,599
Jiang Yitian and Yang Zhou

556
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,800
also presented their courage

557
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,680
as new players.

558
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,400
For the last shot,

559
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
they got

560
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,319
31.6 in total.

561
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,680
Are they still

562
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,959
what they were in the first round?

563
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,560
Quite impressive!

564
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,920
Shen Qingyuan,

565
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,239
lie down there and don't move.

566
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,239
They're cheering too loudly.

567
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,160
Isn't it good?

568
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,920
Chen Hai will be disturbed.

569
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,479
But he should be stronger.

570
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,239
We won!

571
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,959
Let's congratulate Haiya Men's Team

572
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,479
on winning the team event.

573
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,400
Hai.

574
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,959
Captain.

575
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:39,400
Captain.

576
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,000
Captain.

577
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,720
- Captain, we won.
- Captain.

578
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Captain, we won.

579
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,560
They won.

580
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,079
Good job.

581
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,680
- Captain.
- Captain.

582
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,640
- We won.
- We won.

583
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:50,719
We won.

584
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,760
Good job.

585
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,719
You feel happy, don't you?

586
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,560
One small step for winter training,

587
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,319
but one giant leap for our team.

588
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:04,959
Have some sleep.

589
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,319
When you wake up,
you'll be in the hospital.

590
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,680
Tang Xin,

591
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,479
you have to take care of me this time.

592
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,840
(Inpatient)

593
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,200
(Beds 15-17)

594
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:49,439
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

595
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,880
You want me to delete

596
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,479
the video of the assessment?

597
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,400
Yes.

598
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,920
The winter training base

599
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,239
doesn't want it to be widely known.

600
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,560
After all, it is not

601
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,239
a decent thing.

602
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,680
I can delete it.

603
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:29,920
But I'm afraid

604
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,719
it has been flashed around the Internet.

605
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,319
Deleting it won't help much.

606
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,199
We remain steady first.

607
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,359
As for the Internet thing,

608
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,359
let's respond accordingly.

609
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:39,920
All right.

610
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,760
What woke you up?

611
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:30,880
The pain.

612
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,560
Does the anesthetic no longer work?

613
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,839
Local anesthesia must be reported.

614
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:39,599
It's troublesome.

615
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,800
Then I didn't use it.

616
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,719
So, you took the debridement
in the operation room

617
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,400
without any anesthesia?

618
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,119
Now that you didn't use the anesthesia,

619
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,239
why did you pretend to be asleep?

620
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,760
Local anesthesia doesn't
make people sleep.

621
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:57,439
Little fool.

622
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,400
Shen Qingyuan,

623
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,239
when you're wounded,

624
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:02,760
you just...

625
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,160
Be careful.

626
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,640
Yes, when I'm wounded,

627
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,800
you're not going anywhere today.

628
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,479
Stay with me.

629
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:21,119
I have to go back to the company

630
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,920
to handle the livestream accident.

631
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,560
It's Mr. Zhou.

632
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,359
Wait a minute.

633
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,800
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

634
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,839
Tang Xin,

635
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,040
I thought about it.

636
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,599
Let's make a PR video

637
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,920
of Chen Hai.

638
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,520
What stories

639
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,439
does he have

640
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:56,479
to evoke public sympathy?

641
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,000
His family is poor.

642
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,839
But Chen Hai is

643
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,359
very proud.

644
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,599
I don't think he wants

645
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,880
to talk about it in public.

646
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:06,839
If he can't even hold it,

647
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,760
how will he bear all kinds of pressure?

648
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,560
Can we come up with

649
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
some other way?

650
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,599
What other way do we have?

651
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:13,839
It's a deal, then.

652
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,520
Persuade him until he says yes.

653

663

Mr. Xu.

664
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,880
Why do you have the nerve to come?

665
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,079
Mr. Xu,

666
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,400
what was I doing wrong?

667
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,560
Why did you fall out without a reason?

668
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,640
Why am I back at the company lately?

669
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,079
Don't you know?

670
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,760
Isn't it because

671
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,040
you're done with winter training?

672
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:21,880
You...

673
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,560
Why do you have the nerve
to mention that?

674
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,119
If you hadn't sent the photos

675
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,199
to Shen Qingyuan,

676
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,520
there wouldn't have been
so much trouble.

677
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:30,680
But...

678
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,599
But I recalled them.

679
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:36,520
How stupid you are!

680
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,160
He saved the photos.

681
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,040
Do you think

682
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,359
you can end up well?

683
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,199
Mr. Xu.

684
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,160
Mr. Xu,

685
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:46,479
I did that anxiously

686
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,760
only because I love you.

687
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:49,760
What's more...

688
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:50,719
Today, Shen Qingyuan

689
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:51,640
got what he deserved.

690
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:52,479
Look.

691
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,520
He was shot by his teammate.

692
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,920
Now, netizens

693
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,800
hold two opinions.

694
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,359
Some think

695
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,839
he deserved it.

696
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,880
I take some credit for it.

697
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,079
I told people

698
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,879
that he and Chen Hai had a fight.

699
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:12,919
Mr. Xu,

700
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,399
calm down

701
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,080
and don't be angry, okay?

702
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:17,760
Don't be angry.

703
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:19,800
Get in the car.

704
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,600
Why did the call take you so long?

705
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,800
Your accident is

706
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
spreading on the Internet.

707
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:08,679
It has a very bad effect.

708
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,399
We have to help take care of it.

709
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:14,879
I'm hungry.

710
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,360
It's lunchtime.

711
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,679
What would you like to eat?

712
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,439
I'll go buy some.

713
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,879
Anything is okay.

714
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:32,760
Wait for me.

715
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,879
Patient of Bed 16,

716
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:56,639
what do you want?

717
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,560
Excuse me.

718
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,040
Please give me some paper and a pen.

719
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:01,959
Thank you.

720
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,000
All right. Just a minute.

721
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,960
(Inpatient)

722
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:39,399
Before I'm back,

723
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:40,439
you got the table ready?

724
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,600
You must be starving.

725
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:43,879
I bought some porridge for you.

726
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,040
Wait a moment.

727
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,840
It's still hot.

728
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,919
But I want some now.

729
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,080
I'm so hungry.

730
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:51,639
Wait.

731
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,679
I'll cool it for you.

732
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,280
Here. Eat it.

733
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:19,800
Eat it by yourself.

734
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,639
Here.

735
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,439
What?

736
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,760
Is it very cold out there?

737
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:31,239
Your hand feels cold.

738
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,600
I'm not cold.

739
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,320
Come on. Have lunch first.

740
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,719
What?

741
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,199
Try some.

742
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,080
It tastes good.

743
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,439
Do you not like

744
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,000
such kind of food?

745
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,080
Your leg is hurt.

746
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
But your hand is all right.

747
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,399
Don't trick me into feeding you.

748
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,679
It's not hurt?

749
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,479
Shen Qingyuan!

750
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,399
If you hurt your hand deliberately,

751
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:25,439
I'll be angry!

752
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,280
Open your mouth.

753
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:45,800
It tastes great.

754
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,600
Such a compliment won't buy me over.

755
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,719
Look.

756
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,000
You're very skilled

757
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,360
at feeding me.

758
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,840
Your hand isn't shaking.

759
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,360
It means you're beautifully balanced.

760
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,159
After you practice praising people
for such a long time,

761
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,120
you still haven't made any progress.

762
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,639
Instead, you always stray
from the point.

763
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,520
But your compliments

764
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,320
have convinced Chen Hai.

765
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,760
You can only convince straight men.

766
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,600
Come on.

767
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,239
Have lunch.

768
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
Or it'll be cold.

769
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,239
By the way,

770
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:35,560
sign...

771
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,120
Sign this first.

772
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,879
(Party A: Shen Qingyuan)
What's this?

773
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:43,639
Don't bother ask.

774
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,600
Just sign it.

775
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,320
Do it.

776
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:07,520
The Equal Relationship Agreement

777
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,479
for Tang Xin and Shen Qingyuan.

778
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,719
Party A Shen Qingyuan

779
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,600
and Party B Tang Xin

780
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,520
willingly sign this agreement
after a friendly negotiation

781
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:17,479
during the hospitalization

782
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,439
to agree on equal obligations

783
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:20,120
and responsibilities

784
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,360
and start the accompanying relationship

785
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
during the hospitalization.

786
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,080
As agreed,

787
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:27,320
Party B Tang Xin's obligations are
as follows.

788
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:28,760
First,

789
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,399
when Shen Qingyuan is in hospital,

790
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:32,239
Tang Xin must always stay with him

791
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,239
unless she has to leave for a reason.

792
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,360
Second,

793
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,800
during the period,

794
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,639
Tang Xin must totally satisfy

795
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:39,919
Shen Qingyuan's reasonable demands.

796
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,560
Shen Qingyuan decides

797
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,040
whether the demand is reasonable.

798
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,280
Third,

799
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,560
when Tang Xin is unhappy,

800
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,600
she must tell Shen Qingyuan why.

801
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
What about your obligations?

802
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,320
Keep reading.

803
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,479
This is all.

804
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:01,399
What else?

805
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,080
Check more carefully.

806
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,520
(Shen Qingyuan's obligations)

807
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,879
Shen Qingyuan promises

808
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,479
to solve Tang Xin's problems

809
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:15,280
about life and work

810
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,840
during his hospitalization.

811
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:18,760
Shen Qingyuan's obligations.

812
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,399
