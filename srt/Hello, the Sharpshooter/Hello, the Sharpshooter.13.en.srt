but it's a little chubby.

41
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,319
She is timid and vulnerable

It's not a question but a request.

50

Please ask Shen Qingyuan

to call his third contact on WeChat

52

53

to edit today's video.

125
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,880

128
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,160
Did you find that

129
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,359
if there is a big sky

130
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,679
over your head,

131
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,720
you will be in a very good mood

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,839
and all your moodiness

133
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,640
will float into the sky?

134
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Are you in a bad mood?

135
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,200
I… I'm not sure, either.

136
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,000
I just feel empty

137
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:54,720
all at once.

138
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,839

139
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,079
Is that Rui Live over there?

140
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,679
Yes.

141
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,959
It looks so close.

142
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,440
It's obviously quite a long walk there.

143
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,279
It looks like 3 or 4km.

144
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:13,959
Well…

145
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,880
How far is our house?

146
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,359

147
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,920

148
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,480
Let's go then.

149
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,480
Wait a minute.

150
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,079
What is it?

151
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,200
A distance meter.

152
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,279
I borrowed it
from the flying saucer team.

153
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,920
I want to measure

154
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,000
the distance between us.

155

0.1m

162
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,200
is the distance that doesn't

163
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,160
make you nervous,

164
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,079
right?

165
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,359
Sorry.

166
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,239
Actually my stutter

167
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,519
has nothing to do with

168
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,079
how much you wear

169
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,079
and how far I am from you.

170
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,559
What does that have to do with then?

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,640
The… The problem lies with me myself.

172
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,399
So does your faint before?

173
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,000
Sorry.

174
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,720
I'm not ready

175
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,880
to tell you about it.

176
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,799
Is there anything good

177
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:19,920
at the canteen for today's lunch?

178
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:21,920
Are you hungry?

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,760
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

180
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,359
OK.

181
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,440
I… I'll be right back.

182
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,679
Sorry.

183
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,039
I… I've got to go back to the company.

184
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,000
Let me escort you.

185
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
(Rainbow Bear)

186
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,599
Hello, sir.

187
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:07,239
Go ahead please.

188
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,400
Zhou Zuguang,

189
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,799
what's going on?

190
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,520
Why do things keep going wrong

191
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,559
with your people?

192
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,080
The last one quit the job.

193
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,559
This one was not only exposed online,

194
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,400
now she's even

195
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
doing indecent livestreaming!

196
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,159
Sorry, sir.

197
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,799
I… I neglected my duty.

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,039
Please cool down for now.

199
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,200
I've been busy these days

200
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:29,119
and neglected to
supervise my subordinates.

201
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,479
But I assure you

202
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,159
such things won't happen again.

203
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,039
I'll certainly get to the bottom of it

204
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,919
and take it seriously.

205
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,200
Let me just say one thing:

206
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,200
If there's something wrong
with your people again,

207
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,200
you won't simply be given a demotion!

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,599
Mr. Zhou,

209
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,239
you called me in such a hurry.

210
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,359
What's going on?

211
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,880
I don't know for sure,

212
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,599
neither do I know if you know for sure.

213
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,200
Could it be my livestream

214
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,960
with Shen Qingyuan
the day before yesterday?

215
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,239
Come to have a look.

216
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,960
(Rainbow Bear)

217
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,359
This is the tip-off

218
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,679
the head office has received.

219
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,239
It's so indecent.

220
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,679
Did you really do this,

221
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,320
Tang Xin?

222
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,919
Mr. Zhou,

223
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,640
I've never done this

224
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,599
in front of a video camera.

225
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,880
I swear to you

226
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,200
I absolutely didn't do this.

227
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,359
Someone was playing a trick.

228
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:33,119
You've been

229
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:34,719
working with me for some time

230
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,799
and I do trust you a lot,

231
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,880
but with the evidence shown right here,

232
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,960
what can I do?

233
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,000
Mr. Zhou,

234
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,080
please give me some time

235
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,840
to prove my innocence.

236
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,039
The superior has called,

237
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,760
Tang Xin,

238
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,200
it's really

239
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,760
hard for me to give you more time.

240
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,440
(Qianyang 26)

241
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,080
(Are you all right?)

242
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,840
Tang Xin.

243
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,320
Tell me what's going on.

244
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:05,599
My livestream

245
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,840
was somehow edited

246
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,760
and reported to senior management

247
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,520
as indecent livestream.

248
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,000
Indecent?

249
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,599
You?

250
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,039
Indecent livestream?

251
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
What livestreaming video?

252
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,679
A video of me practicing rap
on my alternative account.

253
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,080
The one you made the night before last?

254
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:22,840
My goodness.

255
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,559
What's Mr. Zhou's attitude now?

256
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,359
He says

257
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,919
senior management has received a tip-off

258
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:28,840
and the video is suspected of

259
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,359
illegally disseminating indecent content

260
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:31,960
and needs to be dealt with seriously.

261
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,559
Oh gosh.

262
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,359
Let me see what to do.

263
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,799
What's going on

264
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,840
with your live room now?

265
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,080
I've deleted it

266
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,359
with not a single video left.

267
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,239
It's not there's nothing left though.

268
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,599
There are still a couple of

269
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,080
past-faced video clips
edited by netizens,

270
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:51,679
although they are in fragments

271
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,359
which can show nothing.

272
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,520
Tang Liqi,

273
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,000
are you still her brother?

274
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,520
What shall I do?

275
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,599
Xin,

276
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,280
someone

277
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,479
must have doctored this video.

278
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:02,840
In one way or another,

279
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,080
I'll definitely help you prove

280
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,599
the screenshot was edited,

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
but I need some time.

282
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,200
Why don't you hurry then?

283
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
OK. I'm going then.

284
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:15,200
Don't worry, Tang Xin.

285
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Mr. Zhou won't

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,960
make an announcement so soon.

287
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,200
Who are you here to see, sir?

288
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,599
I'd like to see Tang Xin.

289
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,080
She's in there.

290
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,000
Thank you.

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,679
You are welcome.

292
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,679
Who is he?

293
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,000
A new livestreamer?

294
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,239
What new livestreamer?

295
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,359
Isn't he the key target of livestream

296
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,840
of the sports team?

297
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,320
Shen Qingyuan?

298
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,960
What are you doing here?

299
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,280
I'm here to take Tang Xin for lunch.

300
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,719
Tang Xin…

301
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,679
Wang,

302
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,000
go get Tang Xin here.

303
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,719
OK.

304
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,719
I'll go and ask Mr. Zhou

305
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:03,719
for more time again.

306
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,159
She keeps giving me the feeling

307
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,400
of looking weird.

308
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,679
Is she the one
who notified you for Mr. Zhou

309
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,599
to delete your live room videos?

310
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,080
Tang Xin,

311
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,960
you have a visitor.

312
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,440
- I'm going for now.
- Go.

313
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,080
Right in time.

314
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:33,679
Here she is.

315
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,280
Do you want to see me?

316
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,440
I'll leave you guys talking.

317
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,039
Give me the schedule

318
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,840
for the next session early.

319
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,200
You haven't eaten, have you?

320
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,919
You can go yourself.

321
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,000
I've got something to see to.

322
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,239
No.

323
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,440
Eating is a must.

324
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,719
Exactly.

325
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,840
Do what brother-in-law says.

326
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,080
You are talking nonsense
regardless of where you are.

327
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,080
It's OK.

328
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Mr. Zhou has left already.

329
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,119
All right. Let's go for lunch.

330
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,679
This restaurant

331
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,359
is the most lightly flavored and comfy

332
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,080
of all restaurants near the company.

333
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,599
Since you want no strong flavors,

334
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,320
I suppose it suits you well.

335
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,400
Hello.

336
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,000
What would you like please?

337
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,080
I'll leave it to you.

338
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,960
This and this.

339
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,520
Thanks.

340
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,559
OK. One moment please.

341
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,239
Are you feeling unwell?

342
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,320
I'm gonna go and buy something.

343
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,719
It's OK. Let me go.

344
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,000
You stay here to occupy the seats.

345
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:10,840
Are you sure you are all right
while you are like this?

346
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,200
Well,

347
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:14,679
it's…

348
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
A natural cycle.

349
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,280
A natural cycle?

350
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:20,760
Well,

351
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:23,119
it's that thingy.

352
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,559
You don't have to tell me what it is.

353
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,440
It's OK.

354
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:32,679
I'll take a break

355
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,080
and buy it myself.

356
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,400
I'll buy it for you.

357
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,039
I happen to have something to buy.

358
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:47,119
It's too weird for you to go.

359
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,679
Just tell me

360
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,840
what to buy.

361
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:06,640
Forget it.

362
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,880
There's so little sense of boundary.

363
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,640
I'll just take him as

364
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,880
the past Shen Qingyuan for the moment.

365
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,479
He's bought it before anyway.

366
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,479
And he's just buying a…

367
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
(Body Care)

368
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,000
(Body Care)

369
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:42,959
A feel of cloud-like cotton.

370
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:45,839
What does it mean?

371
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,079
You're back.

372
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,119
Thank you.

373
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,040
Not this one.

374
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,239
This one.

375
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,760
Why did you buy so many?

376
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,800
They are the same brand.

377
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:17,959
They are made of pure cotton.

378
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,280
Good for your skin.

379
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,160
Thanks.

380
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,400
Hold on a second.

381
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,599
Th-Thanks.

382
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,479
Hello.

383
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:23,560
Hello.

384
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,719
Please swap this

385
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,680
for a cup of hot milk

386
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,000
and get me a pair of scissors.

387
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:27,880
OK.

388
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,280
Excuse me.

389
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,040
This is your hot drink.

390
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:48,880
Thanks.

391
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,599
And this.

392
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:51,920
What do you need the scissors for?

393
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,119
Take your medicine first.

394
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,239
Thanks.

395
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,199
Did anything happen today?

396
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,479
Take them with you
for the next few days.

397
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,959
Thanks.

398
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:32,760
Tang Xin.

399
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,719
You can loosen up

400
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,359
while being with me.

401
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,160
Lift the leg of your pants.

402
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,359
Aren't your shoes rubbing?

403
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,040
My shoes are always rubbing.

404
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,800
When I didn't have to work before,

405
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,760
my mother went shopping with me.

406
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,479
We could spend a whole afternoon

407
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,400
in a shopping mall,

408
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,079
trying one pair after another.

409
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,680
The other one.

410
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,199
Now I'm busy with my work

411
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,319
and have no time to go shopping.

412
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,239
When I see shop assistants peddling,

413
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,160
I feel too embarrassed to say no,

414
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,160
so I steel myself to buy them.

415
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,760
In the end, the shoes I bought
from shopping malls don't fit,

416
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,640
neither do the ones I bought online.

417
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,199
I'll buy them with you.

418
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,800
Tang Xin, you are back.

419
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:27,439
Whose blazer are you wearing?

420
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,079
Tang Xin!

421
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,680
Come here for a minute.

422
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:50,959
What is it?

423
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,719
I managed to ask the senior management

424
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,319
for a little time for you.

425
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,520
Make sure you find the evidence
as soon as you can.

426
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,160
Do you get it?

427
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,319
Mr. Zhou,

428
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
you believe me?

429
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,439
How could I not?

430
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,280
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

431
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,680
Did you go out for lunch

432
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,479
with Shen Qingyuan?

433
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,239
You guys are on good terms indeed.

434
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,760
You are even in the mood to eat
at such a time.

435
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,319
It's good you guys are on good terms.

436
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,800
But Tang Xin,

437
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,040
you must make full use of this advantage

438
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,719
and build a bridge of communication

439
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,599
between Rui Live and the shooting team.

440
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,199
Mr. Zhou,

441
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,119
I'll certainly bear that in mind.

442
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,640
All right. Don't waste your time.

443
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,760
Go and find the evidence quickly.

444
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,920
I can't save you if it comes up late.

445
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:45,439
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

446
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:57,959
Come in please.

447
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,359
What brings you here?

448
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,400
I was passing by,

449
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
so I drop in to check on you.

450
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,119
By the way,

451
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,880
how is your hand?

452
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,680
Much better.

453
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,599
Thank you for your concern.

454
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,000
No problem.

455
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,239
I…

456
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,400
Could I have some water?

457
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,920
Help yourself.

458
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,599
Do you have nothing particular?

459
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:51,680
Don't you want

460
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,920
to share your happiness?

461
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,479
When you were
at the shooting hall just now,

462
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,280
you were in such high spirits.

463
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,880
Over the recent years,

464
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,079
whenever you come to see me,

465
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,359
most of the times it is when your career

466
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,800
begins to pick up,

467
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:11,640
right?

468
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,560
But more often than not
after seeing you,

469
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,839
both my moods and my career

470
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,719
are going to show ups and downs.

471
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,479
I often suspect that

472
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,719
I seem to have the Oedipus complex.

473
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,640
After all, I lost my father

474
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,520
when I was very young.

475
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,160
But I don't know why

476
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,359
I like

477
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,560
you in your youth better.

478
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,719
That's a cliché.

479
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,359
It's all in the past.

480
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,239
Indeed.

481
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:58,719
After all,

482
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,400
I can draw conclusions

483
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
from these things myself.

484
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,680
Say, ten years ago,

485
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,400
you wouldn't be so unready

486
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,359
for responsibilities like you are now.

487
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,400
You would neither shift the blame

488
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,119
for problems with your career

489
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,959
or something else onto your wife,

490
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,319
nor set eyes on

491
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,439
your own business every day

492
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,479
and split hairs
over the smallest trifles.

493
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,319
I've got things to do. I'm off.

494
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,359
By the way.

495
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,280
It's officially been two years, right?

496
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,319
What?

497
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,599
Our separation.

00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:27,400
Look.

501
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:31,520
The point is this part of the face.

502
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,239
You see,

503
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,000
along the edge of the face,

504
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,920
apparently

505
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,239
there is a big difference

506
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,400
in the tone of the adjusted color.

507
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,199
And here.

508
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,239
Look,

509
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:41,479
the distribution and edge of the noise

510
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,479
are both abnormal.

511
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:43,959
These can be

Awesome.

You've found

515
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,920
the traces of editing so soon.

516
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,079
Not too bad.

00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,359
Ai?

521
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,400
Ai?

522
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,119
Qi,

523
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,079
you are quite something.

524
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,319
Lizi,

525
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,280
can you not call me

526
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,239
by such a countrified name?

527
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,439
Like a dog's.

528
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:11,800
Send this to me.

529
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,560
I'm gonna see Mr. Zhou.

530
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,640
No, no, no. Hold on a second.

531
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,040
Come with me first.

532
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:17,479
What's the matter?

533
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,079
Ai?

534
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,079
What's the matter?

535
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,560
Is there anything

536
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,880
you can't talk about in front of Lizi?

537
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,239
Can I talk about brother-in-law?

538
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,400
You are one sandwich short of a picnic.

539
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,479
How are you gonna explain the video clip

540
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,680
of brother-in-law baring his back?

541
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,000
That was real.

542
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,560
That was an accident.

543
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,959
Be it an accident or not,

544
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,359
now with their malicious editing,

545
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,760
it even looks like a porn video.

546
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,800
What's more, does Mr. Zhou know

547
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,479
you're living with your filming subject?

548
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,359
Let's do it this way.

549
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,079
Let's not bring up the video first.

550
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:01,839
Let's see what we can do

551
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,079
if Mr. Zhou has more questions.

552
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:03,719
All right?

553
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:05,040
OK.

554
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,079
I'll go to see Mr. Zhou

555
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,719
with the traces of editing first.

556
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,760
Let's talk about what Ai did later.

557
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,439
OK.

558
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,359
Captain Shen,

559
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:28,839
why are you

560
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,079
a bit flighty and restless today?

561
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,040
Because of Tang Xin?

562
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:34,719
A good relationship

563
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,839
should be a driving force

564
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,839
rather than a stumbling block for you.

565
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,239
If you go on like this,

566
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:38,839
I'll probably really

567
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:39,959
join the competition.

568
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,599
You won't.

569
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,239
Not necessarily.

570
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,199
Du Lingfeng,

571
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:53,680
are you upset about
not being able to enter the competition

572
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,680
or jealous that Xiaoci ignores you

573
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,640
and only clings to our captain,

574
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:58,920
or both?

575
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:00,000
Mr. Du,

576
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,040
take my advice.

577
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,560
In terms of personality,

578
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Xiaoci is on the strong side

579
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,199
and you are on the weak side.

580
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:07,599
Mr. Du, you can't overpower her.

581
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,520
It's none of your business.

582
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,880
Are you really upset?

583
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,119
Mr. Du doesn't even take a joke.

584
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,319
Let me go back to my old position.

585
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,959
Mr. Zhou, have a look.

586
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,359
What's this?

587
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,199
These places I've marked out

588
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,520
are very blurred images.

589
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,199
There are traces of editing.

590
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,160
What's more,

591
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,119
this is

592
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,680
the original photo
of the indecent image.

593
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,839
Aren't they exactly the same?

594
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:44,880
Mr. Zhou,

595
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,479
this person used Photoshop

596
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:48,119
to graft these indecent photos

597
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:48,680
onto

598
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,839
my livestreaming video.

599
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,800
As I said,

600
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,680
you wouldn't do

601
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,479
such kind of immoral things.

602
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:58,880
That's great.

603
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,640
Any other evidence?

604
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,359
Send it to me together

605
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,160
and I'll send it to the head office.

606
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,839
Nothing else.

607
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,520
Nothing?

608
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:11,839
Well,

609
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,880
what about the video afterwards?

610
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,880
Doesn't it show a man undressing?

611
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,119
Who is he?

612
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,199
How come he shows up

613
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,199
in your live room?

614
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:33,680
Tang Xin,

615
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,040
I know you are being

616
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,199
wrongfully accused over this matter.

617
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,800
But this

618
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,520
can only show the screenshot is fake.

619
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:42,920
You need to show

620
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,880
the video is fake as well

621
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,959
so that I can convince
the senior management.

622
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,199
You'd better find

623
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,800
the complete original video,

624
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:51,680
otherwise

625
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,199
it'll be easily refuted
by the informant.

626
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:54,680
Let's do it this way.

627
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,680
I'll try to buy you more time again.

628
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,079
But before the championship,

629
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:00,800
make sure you get

630
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,920
solid evidence,

631
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,560
otherwise…

632
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,599
You'll have to

633
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,680
hand over your work to Ai.

634
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,479
OK, Mr. Zhou.

635
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,000
You must know

636
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,319
handover doesn't just mean

637
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,160
for one competition.

638
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,640
If you can't prove

639
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
your innocence,

640
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,199
you may not

641
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,079
be able to do livestreams again.

642
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:23,839
I see.

643
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,680
All right, go.

644
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,000
By the way,

645
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,880
the video recording of partners

646
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,920
as we talked about before

647
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,000
must be done in the next day or two.

648
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,520
What are you doing here

649
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,359
instead of practicing?

650
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:13,400
As your B-plan,

651
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,160
I have to give back training time

652
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,839
to your A-plan

653
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,000
and you.

654
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,680
As I see it,

655
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,160
you are quite sensible.

656
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,640
I've become single

657
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,839
and you are still making fun of me?

658
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,599
Haven't you always been single?

659
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:29,839
Why do you pretend to be aggrieved?

660
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,680
Who says…?

661
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,160
Didn't I have you?

662
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,000
My… My blank target sheets,

663
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,400
buffet lunch boxes

664
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,199
and tissues.

665
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,599
Xiaoci,

666
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,599
I can't

667
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,520
have all this again, can I?

668
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Stop daydreaming.

669
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:47,599
The competition is over.

670
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,479
They are long gone.

671
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,439
Well,

672
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,560
can we

673
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,839
have lunch together?

674
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,439
Give me some guidance when you are free.

675
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Du Lingfeng,

676
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,199
I have a heavy task lying ahead of me,

677
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,160
and Captain Shen has given a very tight

678
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,920
training schedule.

679
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,400
I have no time to waste with you.

680
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,199
OK.

681
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,159
You guys don't know

682
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,520
blusher can be applied like this,
do you?

683
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:21,360
- Really?
- Applied to your knees?

684
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,360
Yes.

685
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,800
This can give a more girly feeling.

686
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,360
Ai.

687
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,159
I have something to ask you.

688
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:30,760
Ai,

689
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:31,800
we are going for now.

690
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:34,239
What's it regarding? Is it urgent?

691
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,800
I've got to apply this to my other knee.

692
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:37,959

both the man baring his back

731
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,800
So I suggest you guys
