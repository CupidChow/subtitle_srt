=Episode 25=

35
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:37,480
I can't even brace myself up for it,

36
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,639
let alone

37
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,080
find other victims.

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,400
Anyway, I need to put myself up there

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,480
and report him, right?

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,480
Tang Xin,

41
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:56,239
you don't have to.

42
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,440
Don't get hurt again

43
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,599
before

44
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,680
bringing him to justice,

45
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,080
understand?

46
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,440
If you need someone

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,919
to stand up against him with you,

48
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,960
I'll do it.

49
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,479
But you could be sued for libel.

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,320
No way.

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,119
I'll find the evidence,

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,279
the smoking gun.

53
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,800
But how?

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,199
Don't forget

55
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,080
I go to the Shooting Center every day.

56
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,559
I can get close to him.

57
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,479
What if he harasses you?

58
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,639
I'm tougher than you think.

59
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,639
I thought you aren't a pet person.

60
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,119
But you are.

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
Are you sure he's here?

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,199
I keep calling but still don't see him.

63
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,720
Relax. I've checked.

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,759
Cat food

65
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,839
works on him, too.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,960
He'll come out soon.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,759
Hedgehog.

68
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,800
Hedgehog.

69
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,399
Aren't you hungry?

70
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
I've got food here.

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,479
Hedgehog.

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,679
Hedgehog.

73
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,479
There you are.

74
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,119
Shen Qingyuan.

75
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,759
Eat up.

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,839
We'll bring you snacks every day.

77
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,320
Keep up the good work.

78
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,039
They're gonna have joint training later.

79
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,279
It's gonna be a long day for you.

80
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,839
It's our job.

81
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,800
You can count on us.

82
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,800
We'll get it done.

83
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:57,839
Well,

84
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,720
you'll probably work long hours.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Get yourselves some night snacks.

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,639
They're on me.

87
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,720
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

88
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,679
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

89
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:07,720
You all

90
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,880
have a lot to do lately.

91
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,960
Once the training is over,

92
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,880
you can relax.

93
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

94
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,519
Captain Shen,

95
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,040
let's go get the pistols.

96
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,799
So,

97
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,040
are there new plans

98
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,559
for the mixed team training?

99
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,279
No.

100
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,239
That doesn't sound like you.

101
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,760
Can you make some?

102
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,679
The training lately is too easy.

103
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,679
I need something more challenging.

104
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,640
We'll see.

105
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,600
(Firearm Sub-library)

106
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,839
The Gun Keeper

107
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,720
is responsible.

108
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,079
He tells us to watch the pistols closely

109
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,119
every time we come.

110
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,320
Safety is a top priority.

111
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:52,880
Hey,

112
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,519
I talked to Tang Xin yesterday.

113
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,079
About what?

114
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,239
That's our secret.

115
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Captain,

116
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,359
girls help girls.

117
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,880
You're Haiya's ace.

118
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,600
Focus on your training.

119
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,880
Leave the rest to me.

120
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:14,920
Zhang,

121
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,079
set up the cameras.

122
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,920
The four of you

123
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,799
divide among yourselves

124
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,920
which camera

125
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,679
is responsible for what.

126
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,880
Tilt down. Down.

127
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,679
Go up. I need more.

128
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,399
Yes.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,679
Perfect.

130
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,799
When they start to shoot,

131
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,519
we need close-ups.

132
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,000
Make sure we get enough.

133
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,040
You don't have to come.

134
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,440
Let me take you back.

135
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm fine.

136
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,440
I'll keep a distance from him.

137
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,640
As long as you're here,

138
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,640
I fear no one.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,119
Let me know if you need me.

140
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,040
OK.

141
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,920
Hurry up, guys.

142
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,359
Miss Tang.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,640
Mr. Xu,

144
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,839
didn't you already

145
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,920
livestream the Mobilization Meeting?

146
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,760
Are you here for more?

147
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,279
The audience

148
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,200
love watching you guys.

149
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,640
And we're here

150
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,880
to get more videos of the joint training

151
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,399
to be aired later.

152
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,399
Besides,

153
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,359
we want more than young people

154
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,519
to see you online.

155
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:45,799
Right.

156
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:46,279
Seniors are still used to

157
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,239
watching TV.

158
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:47,559
Yes.

159
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,359
They could use

160
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,559
passion and energy

161
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,440
from young athletes like you.

162
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,040
I'll give you close-ups.

163
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:53,880
Thanks.

164
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,239
Hey, Zhou.

165
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,760
Welcome to the Winter Training

166
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,480
of Haiya Shooting Team Part 2.

167
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,720
Today, I'm gonna

168
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,279
tour you around their base.

169
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,359
The local TV station

170
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,679
is filming the athletes, too.

171
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:17,160
Let's not

172
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,519
interrupt them.

173
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,040
Tang Xin.

174
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,079
Hello, everyone.

175
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,040
I'm Xu Dian.

176
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,399
May I borrow

177
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,359
Miss Tang for a sec?

178
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,559
Be right back.

179
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,519
Tang Xin,

180
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,200
we can do a collab.

181
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:33,079
Mr. Xu,

182
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,200
this isn't live,

183
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,760
but televised.

184
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,799
You don't need me.

185
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,519
I prefer to

186
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,000
work on my own.

187
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,399
Tang Xin,

188
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,480
you're wrong.

189
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,720
Watching them

190
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,880
training all day is boring.

191
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,040
We need some entertainment

192
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,959
in the middle

193
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,720
such as

194
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,000
an interview or whatnot.

195
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,720
Am I right,

196
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
guys?

197
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,000
And shooting matches...

198
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,640
Captain Shen,

199
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,200
chill out.

200
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,320
We'll be seeing each other more often.

201
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,600
I doubt it

202
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,279
if you don't

203
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,359
behave yourself.

204
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,160
You're young

205
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,839
and unsophisticated.

206
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,679
You should learn

207
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,480
how to talk to people.

208
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,959
Are you OK?

209
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,359
I'm good.

210
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
I'm just practicing deep breathing.

211
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,799
Let me walk you back.

212
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,359
I'd like to have a word with Xiaoci.

213
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,359
What's wrong?

214
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,039
Xiaoci,

215
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,719
stay away from Xu Dian.

216
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,599
I can handle him myself.

217
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,760
Don't get involved.

218
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,119
Are you worried

219
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,559
that I'm gonna be like Mata Hari

220
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,280
to seduce him

221
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,159
to get what I need?

222
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,280
I'm not joking.

223
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,039
Tang Xin,

224
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,719
this matter

225
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,760
isn't just about you.

226
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,840
Don't look at me

227
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,679
or stop me in there.

228
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,880
I don't wanna spook him.

229
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,479
Got it?

230
00:08:59,239 --> 00:08:59,840
Captain Zhou,

231
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:02,919
I don't think this is a good idea.

232
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,799
We're gonna be on TV.

233
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,479
We can't afford more embarrassment.

234
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,679
You hear me?

235
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,880
Yes, Captain.

236
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,000
I feel you.

237
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,080
Aren't we

238
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,679
going beyond the limit?

239
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,840
Is there ever a limit

240
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,919
in anti-pressure training?

241
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,479
I guess not.

242
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,799
Go down. Here.

243
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,520
Tilt.

244
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,479
What are you looking at, Tang Xin?

245
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,559
Why are you late?

246
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,400
Nothing.

247
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,359
You'd better go back online

248
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:46,960
and explain

249
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,080
why you logged out just now.

250
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,039
Give me your phone.

251
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,039
No way.

252
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,320
I need to protect my privacy.

253
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,520
Don't you have yours?

254
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,359
Why do you need mine?

255
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,280
I'm just gonna

256
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,039
use it for a while

257
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,760
for livestreaming.

258
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,559
I won't touch anything.

259
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,119
Promise?

260
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,880
Give it back as soon as you finish.

261
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,239
I'm only

262
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,119
giving it to you

263
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,080
because you look cute today.

264
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,559
Xiaoci, don't do anything rash.

265
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,799
Text me

266
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,479
before you take any actions.

267
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

268
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,799
Grandma!

269
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,479
And stop texting me.

270
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,479
I'm gonna record something.

271
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,000
I can protect you.

272
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,000
You don't need others.

273
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,479
Are you jealous?

274
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,880
I'm not.

275
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,159
I don't trust anyone else.

276
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Coach.

277
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,799
Coach Zhang.

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,679
Thanks for being here, Mr. Xu.

279
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,479
Just doing my job.

280
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,039
Coach Liu.

281
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,719
Thanks for coming.

282
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,400
- Coach.
- Coach.

283
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,679
Do you know what we're gonna do today?

284
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,479
- Joint training.
- Joint training.

285
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,280
I need you

286
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,239
to step up your game.

287
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,239
The provincial TV station will be

288
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,200
recording the entire session.

289
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,440
The footage will be used

290
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,119
in our winter training documentary.

291
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,200
You must work

292
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,320
120 percent harder,

293
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,559
got it?

294
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,320
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

295
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,320
Continue.

296
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,679
- Yes.
- Yes.

297
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,440
Focus on the athletes.

298
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,200
Capture everything.

299
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,400
Yes. Good.

300
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,400
You're familiar with
anti-disturbance training, right?

301
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,520
We're gonna

302
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,200
practice it.

303
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,080
Coach Zhang,

304
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,200
is your team OK with it?

305
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,320
Anti-disturbance training.

306
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,400
Good idea.

307
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,000
Your coach and I will arrange it.

308
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
You should focus on your training.

309
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,039
Come on, Coach.

310
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,440
No offense,

311
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,679
but we're better

312
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,000
at making noises than you.

313
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,440
Similarly,

314
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,559
your team

315
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,280
can do the same to us.

316
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,200
We can

317
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,119
switch places.

318
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,280
And

319
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,880
the TV station will have more

320
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,280
to show the audience.

321
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,280
Great.

322
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,320
I like that idea.

323
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,200
Coaches,

324
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,200
what do you think?

325
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,559
Fine.

326
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,559
What's that team

327
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,559
up to?

328
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,280
Anti-disturbance is routine training.

329
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,080
What else can they do

330
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,719
other than yelling and shouting?

331
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,200
Right.

332
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,200
As annoying

333
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,719
as it sounds,

334
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,559
it can be

335
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,320
of some help.

336
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,200
Go right!

337
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,400
Miss the shot!

338
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,320
It's good for you.

339
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,200
Good luck.

340
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,520
Ignore him, Jiang Yitian.

341
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,239
Yang Fan...

342
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,039
It's Yang Zhou.

343
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,080
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

344
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,000
Look here.

345
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,559
(Unlucky)
Believe it.

346
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,359
Yeah.

347
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,760
(Lucky)

348
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,119
Believe it.

349
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,359
Do believe it.

350
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,440
Excellent.

351
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,559
It's working,

352
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,400
Yang Fan.

353
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,640
Let's do crosstalk.

354
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:27,599
OK.

355
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,840
About what?

356
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,280
Let's

357
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,359
be creative.

358
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,320
Miss Tang Xin

359
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,400
from Rui Live

360
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
did the narration

361
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,840
in hip-hop, right?

362
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,679
Let's follow suit

363
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,679
and do hip-hop crosstalk.

364
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,599
Hip-hop

365
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,200
isn't for everyone,

366
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,520
but I'm a really good

367
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Tang Xin imitator.

368
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,960
Then let's see it.

369
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,440
It doesn't work on him.

370
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,440
1,000 yuan for less than 10 points.

371
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,039
Man,

372
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,320
you're weak.

373
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,679
This isn't

374
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,000
simple anti-disturbance training.

375
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,280
It's specially designed

376
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,039
for you.

377
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,159
Why?

378
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,840
Because you're so rich

379
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,320
that you had to borrow money

380
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,880
to pay your family's medical bills.

381
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,039
Camera One and Two, go.

382
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:00,919
Camera One and Two.

383
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,599
Stand Six.

384
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Camera One, in position.

385
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,560
Can you leave me alone?

386
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,680
There will be cameras

387
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,160
at the official competitions, too.

388
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,160
Move up the camera.

389
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,319
Get close-ups.

390
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,719
1,000, gone!

391
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:37,959
Jiang Yitian.

392
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,199
Jiang Yitian.

393
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,920
Anti-disturbance training

394
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,560
is louder

395
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,439
than others,

396
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,319
but it's backed

397
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,160
by science.

398
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,280
What?

399
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,400
None of your business.

400
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,239
Give it to me.

401
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,640
Sorry, guys.

402
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,479
My battery died.

403
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,359
Gotta go recharge it.

404
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,479
See you later.

405
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:04,439
Bye.

406
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:09,599
I'm here.

407
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:10,920
Tang Xin,

408
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,800
nature calls.

409
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,400
Is it over?

410
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,400
The team

411
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,599
seems a bit down,

412
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,359
so I cut it short.

413
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,479
Maybe another

414
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,760
hotpot party

415
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,640
will cheer them up.

416
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,599
I like

417
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,640
those mini cards

418
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
you created,

419
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,079
but all I see

420
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:58,959
is their strengths.

421
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,520
There are no weaknesses.

422
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:04,800
Message received.

423
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll add that part.

424
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:14,640
OK.

425
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,839
I see what happened.

426
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:17,839
Mr. Zhou,

427
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:18,640
in terms of the evidence,

428
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,520
should we...?

429
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,079
No.

430
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,640
Let me talk to Xu Dian first.

431
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,520
He and I go way back.

432
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,520
It's better

433
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,959
to solve it between ourselves.

434
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,119
Getting it out
won't do Tang Xin any good.

435
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,280
The adult world

436
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,439
isn't all black and white.

437
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,880
Here you are.

438
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:51,800
(Yang Zhou's Strengths and Weaknesses)
I wrote down

439
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,640
what I observed

440
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,599
during the livestreaming.

441
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,160
(Chen Hai's Strengths and Weaknesses)
There might be more.

442
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:56,959
Hey,

443
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,680
don't let them see it,

444
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,719
or they'll think

445
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:00,760
I speak ill of them.

446
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,880
Your cards are safe with me.

447
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,439
Is Yang Zhou

448
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,239
really that superstitious?

449
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,199
He's an

450
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,920
average shooter

451
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,280
who wishes to do better than that.

452
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,599
This kind of mindset

453
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,839
is hard to change.

454
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,079
Strength:

455
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,000
Honest.

456
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,040
Hobby:

457
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,079
Likes Captain.

458
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,199
That will do.

459
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,520
You've got a plan?

460
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,359
Yang Zhou,

461
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,400
give me your hand.

462
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,719
Come on.

463
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,680
That'll work even better.

464
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,640
(Lucky)

465
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,000
Do you trust me?

466
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,479
I do.

467
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,079
But

468
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,119
don't think

469
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,000
you can outdo yourself.

470
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,479
Winners of the shooting

471
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:23,119
aren't those who outdo themselves,

472
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,479
but those

473
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:26,000
who make fewer mistakes.

474
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:28,079
Keep urging yourself to do better

475
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,319
will only cause more pressure,

476
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,760
which is why

477
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,560
you shoot well at first

478
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,439
but can't win

479
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,839
at the end.

480
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:37,000
As the pressure piles on,

481
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,160
you start to

482
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,439
make mistakes

483
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,239
and get fewer and fewer points.

484
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,239
Anyway, this lucky charm

485
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:44,239
will make sure

486
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:45,319
you shoot normally.

487
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,880
Thank you, Captain.

488
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,000
Start shooting.

489
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,920
Captain.

490
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,560
Jiang Yitian,

491
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,239
take these.

492
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,479
What are they?

493
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,599
MP3 player and earphones.

494
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,719
I had them record the background sound

495
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:28,839
of the shooting game

496
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,959
and put it in the player.

497
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:30,959
Listen to it

498
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,079
on a loop.

499
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,479
It'll calm you down.

500
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,239
Also,

501
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,199
give Chen Hai a copy, too.

502
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:37,319
Got it. Thanks, Captain.

503
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:37,880
I will.

504
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:42,640
Captain,

505
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,560
can you

506
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,359
give me some space?

507
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,160
Sure.

508
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,560
What's your score?

509
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:18,640
9.6.

510
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,400
Mine is 9.8.

511
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,079
It's working!

512
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,439
Captain gave me

513
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,319
- a lucky charm.
- Yeah.

514
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,400
He also gave me these.

515
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,560
You can listen to it, too.

516
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:29,760
Let's go.

517
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,479
Yeah.

518
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,000
Let's see

519
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,439
how well you can do.

520
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:40,400
Don't be scared.

521
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,479
Sure.

522
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,920
Take this.

523
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:44,680
Just

524
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,760
watch and learn.

525
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,239
Don't drop it,

526
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,640
Yang Fan.

527
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,199
Let's go.

528
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,920
What's the plan?

529
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,680
You don't know?

530
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,839
I was just

531
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,959
trash talking

532
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:13,959
to intimidate them.

533
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,760
Where's Du Lingfeng?

534
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,160
We need him.

535
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,719
Hey...

536
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:21,760
I'm gonna call him.

537
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,439
Take this for me.

538
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:39,839
Hello?

539
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:40,719
It's me,

540
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,599
Boss Du.

541
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,319
Didn't you

542
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,479
promise me

543
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,359
that you'd

544
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:47,000
focus on shooting?

545
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,920
I've seldom seen you

546
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,839
at the base.

547
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,680
Where are you?

548
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm too busy

549
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,959
reflecting on myself.

550
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,479
Gotta go.

551
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,640
There's something more important

552
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,239
to do.

553
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,479
We can talk about training later.

554
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,560
Wait... Hello? Hello?

555
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:04,920
He hung up.

556
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:06,000
Mr. Du,

557
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,239
this is the dress you ordered.

558
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:08,400
Good choice, sir.

559
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,719
It's a seasonal limited edition

560
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:10,239
and the best

561
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,520
we've got here.

562
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,680
Thanks.

563
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:15,760
Let me walk you out.

564
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
Go right! Right!

565
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,479
Off target.

566
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:20,680
Steady. Stop shaking.

567
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,400
Zhou Yue.

568
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,239
Zhou Yue. Zhou Yue.

569
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,719
Raise your hand slowly.

570
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,160
Stop, stop.

571
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,000
Stop.

572
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,760
Stop. You're shaking again.

573
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:30,760
- You're trembling.
- Raise your gun.

574
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,000
Too soft.

575
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,640
Straighten your arm.

576
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,920
Wrong. Go right.

577
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,839
Up a little bit.

578
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:38,880
Zhou Yue, move.

579
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,040
Don't miss it.

580
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,760
Zhou Yue, move.

581
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,359
Zhou Yue.

582
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,479
Don't hurt their legs.

583
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,079
Zhou Yue.

584
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:49,199
Mr. Xu.

585
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
Uh...

586
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,359
You got a minute?

587
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,560
Can we talk outside?

588
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:57,599
Sure.

589
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
(Staircase)

590
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,560
Xiaoci,

591
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:22,880
what's up?

592
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,160
Mr. Xu,

593
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,800
don't you think

594
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,040
girls got less time than boys

595
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,199
on TV?

596
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,920
I know.

597
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,959
But my hands are tied.

598
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,000
Shen Qingyuan is the star after all.

599
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,880
True,

600
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,599
but I'm just

601
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,640
as good as him.

602
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,359
And I'm his partner.

603
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,920
They asked him

604
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,719
to join the national training team

605
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:46,880
without even

606
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,040
considering me.

607
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,439
And he was the athlete representative

608
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,439
at the Mobilization Meeting.

609
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,560
Isn't that too unfair?

610
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:58,160
Usually, girls are

611
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,680
easily left out.

612
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,640
Can you give us

613
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,680
more shots this time?

614
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,640
Well...

615
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,920
Mr. Xu,

616
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,640
I saw it.

617
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,800
You told the cameramen

618
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,640
who the target was.

619
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,400
OK, OK, OK.

620
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,800
That was different.

621
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,640
That was special.

622
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,880
Those were highlights.

623
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,479
Mr. Xu,

624
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,239
do you think

625
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,040
I'm not photogenic?

626
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,760
No. Of course not.

627
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,040
I wanna be on camera!

628
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:30,959
I demand

629
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,040
an explanation.

630
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,040
Are you sure?

631
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:51,920
Shi Xiaoci,

632
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,839
I've been covering sports for years.

633
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,959
I rise from the bottom.

634
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,640
I've seen tons of dirty tricks.

635
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:03,959
Meanwhile,

636
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,119
I've learned many secrets, too.

637
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,800
Those reports

638
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,880
of your shooting games

639
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,560
years back

640
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,640
are nothing new to me.

641
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,760
I know you well.

642
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,280
You look different now, don't you?

643
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,800
Shi Xiaoci,

644
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:24,599
others don't

645
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:26,920
know that,

646
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,800
but I do.

647
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,040
So?

648
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,000
Don't throw yourself at men.

649
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,160
We find that cheap.

650
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:39,359
Those who play hard to get

651
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:42,400
are my type.

652
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,599
Shi Xiaoci...!

653
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,119
Shi Xiaoci, you...!

654
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,440
(Zhou Zuguang)

655
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,520
Xiaoci, are you OK?

656
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,680
Xiaoci,

657
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,880
talk to me.

658
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:42,959
Look,

659
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,680
although we're in the same city,

660
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,160
we haven't got to meet each other

661
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,680
until

662
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,760
this time.

663
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:51,760
Yep.

664
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,520
You look good.

665
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,199
Your media background

666
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:56,920
is serving you well.

667
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,640
That's very nice of you to say.

668
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,439
But I'm no match for you.

669
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,000
You're famous

670
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
in this circle

671
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,479
while I've just

672
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,160
got started

673
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,599
in livestreaming business.

674
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,880
I have to thank you
for this cooperation.

675
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,000
Tang Xin said you helped her a lot

676
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,680
while I was occupied earlier.

677
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,359
I owe you one.

678
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,599
How about this?

679
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,119
Let us

680
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,520
treat you to lunch.

681
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,719
Sorry,

682
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:29,680
can't do it today.

683
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,599
I have a business appointment.

684
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:33,000
Please

685
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:33,959
give us a chance.

686
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:35,079
Tomorrow is also fine.

687
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,760
I'll be straight with you.

688
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,839
This lunch is never gonna happen.

689
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,400
Come on.

690
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,839
Don't be like this.

691
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,719
We're friends, aren't we?

692
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,560
Enough.

693
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,119
Drop your act.

694
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,680
You're being overprotective.

695
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,319
Why do you care so much about them?

696
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,880
That chick you hired

697
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,920
almost talked my ear off.

698
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,000
So annoying!

699
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,719
I've had enough.

700
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,280
I'm here today to...

701
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,560
Well,

702
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,280
it's all for

703
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,560
a better cooperation

704
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,479
in the future, you know.

705
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,239
Clearly, you've

706
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,319
learned your lesson

707
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:17,680
and you don't wanna

708
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,280
lose your asset again, right?

709
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,239
Honestly,

710
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,959
you're a poor judge of character.

711
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,400
Those you've hired

712
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,280
are too dumb.

713
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,119
The last one

714
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,400
was too stubborn.

715
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,359
And this new girl,

716
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:30,839
fragile as she seems,

717
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,640
she's a nuisance.

718
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,400
The last one?

719
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,079
Lin?

720
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,479
Did she leave the TV station

721
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,000
because of you?

722
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:47,079
Zuguang,

723
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,760
you failed as their mentor.

724
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,040
Girls in this circle

725
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,079
should know better

726
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,800
to go higher!

727
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,319
How dare you!

728
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,479
You harassed her

729
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:00,560
which was why she left

730
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,880
without saying anything, right?

731
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:02,599
Back off!

732
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,359
Are you nuts?

733
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,839
She was your assistant,

734
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:10,079
a key member of your team.

735
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,199
Stop pretending you don't know.

736
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,319
We all take the bus.

737
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,520
If you don't,

738
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,760
then get out of the way!

739
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:53,719
Tang Xin.

740
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,199
Xiaoci, where are you?

741
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:57,199
I'll meet you there.

742
00:32:59,199 --> 00:32:59,719
I...

743
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:00,640
Just tell me.

744
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,560
- I'm...
- No need.

745
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,719
It's almost lunchtime.

746
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,199
I'm not gonna go back there.

747
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,239
OK.

748
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:09,599
See you in the afternoon.

749
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,520
See you then.

750
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,520
Captain Zhou,

751
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,239
Shen Qingyuan is a stone.

752
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,280
Nothing can affect him.

753
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:22,560
And with his help,

754
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,760
others are motived, too.

755
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,040
I didn't see that coming.

756
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,719
Words alone

757
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,000
can't hurt him

758
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,359
at all.

759
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,439
Let's go have lunch.

760
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,719
Didn't you see her?

761
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:40,439
You hit her.

762
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,520
Apologize now.

763
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,199
I'd see her

764
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,199
if she were taller.

765
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,280
What's that supposed to mean?

766
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:46,719
Hey, don't touch me!

767
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:48,079
Stop, all of you!

768
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,520
What do you mean you didn't see her?

769
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
You hit her on purpose!

770
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,439
Apologize now!

771
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,160
What's it to do with you two?

772
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,119
Are you picking a fight?

773
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,560
Is that what it is?

774
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,599
I simply passed by

775
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,760
while you guys were chatting.

776
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You came all over here

777
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,760
to start a fight!

778
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:02,760
Now,

779
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,239
apologize to her.

780
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,479
What's this? Be fair, OK?

781
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,159
Are you picking on my man?

782
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,760
Are you OK?

783
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,120
Shen Qingyuan,

784
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,719
you're unreasonable.

785
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:14,600
You think you're in charge

786
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,399
whenever

787
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:16,360
and wherever you are?

788
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,959
Who's stirring up trouble

789
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:19,959
whenever

790
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,120
and wherever he is?

791
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,639
Stay out of it.

792
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,479
Who the heck are you?

793
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,560
Put up

794
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,760
or shut up.

795
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,800
Let our pistols talk.

796
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,159
Captain.

797
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,080
Sure.

798
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,120
Good. Let's do it.

799
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,040
You wanna see which team

800
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,080
can handle the noise better?

801
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,560
No problem.

802
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,080
Let's battle it out.

803
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,000
Right?

804
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,919
- Yeah.
- No problem.

805
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,040
Wait.

806
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,159
You scared?

807
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,120
Ask yourself that.

808
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:44,840
We have yet

809
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,959
to finish

810
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:46,600
today's routine training.

811
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,080
Our coach will come to check it later.

812
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,280
As the captain,
it's my job to see to it.

813
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,399
Meanwhile,

814
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,879
you could use more time

815
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,000
to practice your skills

816
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,879
for the upcoming test.

817
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,439
Better not fail it.

818
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,840
That's not your concern.

819
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,600
The selfish ones like you

820
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:01,560
only

821
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,399
care about themselves in training.

822
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,879
Unlike you,

823
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,199
Captain Shen helps us as much as he can.

824
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:06,600
Right?

825
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,320
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

826
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,439
OK. Captain,

827
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:10,800
can you check my posture?

828
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,120
Let's go.

829
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,159
Relax your shoulders.

830
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:25,919
Begin.

831
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,520
Listen, just focus.

832
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,320
Eyes on the target.

833
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,800
Don't look away.

834
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:43,439
Your feet.

835
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:45,239
Mr. Zhou.

836
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,959
Shen Qingyuan.

837
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,000
Mr. Zhou is here.

838
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,280
Mr. Du.

839
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:55,080
Hi.

840
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:56,679
What brings you here?

841
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,919
I just found time

842
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,040
from my tight schedule.

843
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
We didn't get to sit down

844
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,840
and talk.

845
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,040
Now that you're here,

846
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
let me buy you a drink.

847
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,600
Sorry.

848
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,520
Not today.

849
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,280
Maybe next time.

850
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,320
- OK.
- Sure.

851
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,719
Is that for your girlfriend?

852
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,239
Maybe she will be

853
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,239
if I play my card right.

854
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:16,679
I see.

855
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,600
Good luck!

856
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:19,280
Thanks.

857
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,959
OK. See you.

858
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:20,479
See you.

859
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,600
Xiaoci!

860
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:30,479
Xiaoci,

861
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,959
I've thought about what you said.

862
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,040
You're right that I'm self-centered.

863
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,919
I just say what I like

864
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,479
without considering others' feelings.

865
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,919
I'm sorry that I offended you

866
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,280
and

867
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,040
I handpicked this gift

868
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,679
to apologize to you.

869
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:47,399
You know Xu Dian?

870
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:49,639
Xu...

871
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,479
Yeah.

872
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:51,760
We're friends.

873
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,760
Xiaoci...

874
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:54,479
I can't believe

875
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:55,320
you make friends

876
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,120
with that kind of person.

877
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:58,560
Du Lingfeng,

878
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,399
I'm disgusted.

879
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,520
What... what's wrong?

880
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,399
What's...?

881
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,840
What's it to do with him?

882
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,000
Xiaoci!

883
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:17,959
You're good.

884
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,040
I've never been such a simp

885
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,080
in front of anyone but you.

886
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,919
What more do you want?

887
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,959
I'm out!

888
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,000
The worst thing is

889
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,719
we lack direct evidence...

890
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,800
Captain Shen,

891
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,600
Tang Xin

892
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,120
was watching me all day

893
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:58,000
because I was trying to

894
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,000
get new evidence against Xu Dian.

895
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,280
But that man

896
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,439
is a fox.

897
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,159
I didn't get anything useful

898
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:06,679
except for this.

899
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,600
Don't throw yourself at men.

900
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:18,120
We find that cheap.

901
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,600
Those who play hard to get

902
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,320
are my type.

903
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:30,280
It doesn't prove anything

904
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,439
but a famous anchor on TV like him

905
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,360
making such a

906
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,199
sexism remark

907
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,040
gives us leverage.

908
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,639
As long as it's useful,

909
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,639
those insults are worth it.

910
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:44,159
Thanks for everything.

911
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:45,639
Too bad,

912
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:46,959
this is

913
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,360
all we've got.

914
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,959
In order to make a move,

915
00:38:51,439 --> 00:38:52,479
we still need photos or videos,

916
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:53,399
that kind of thing.

917
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,520
I wish I could do more.

918
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,159
I'll send you the recording.

919
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:01,639
See you.

920
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:02,639
Thanks.

921
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:03,639
No problem.

922
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:10,159
If you need photos,

923
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:11,760
I have some from others.

924
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,439
Show me.

925
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,560
(Milk Tea Lover)
(Milk Tea Lover recalled a message.)

926
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,439
She recalled the message.

927
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:22,479
You know who sent it?

928
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:24,639
No idea.

929
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,800
(Milk Tea Lover The message is sent
but rejected by the receiver.)

930
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:29,760
I think

931
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,959
that's Ai's old account.

932
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,879
We gotta make something out of nothing.

933
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,280
You wanna see me?

934
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,479
What do you want now?

935
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:08,879
Just give you a heads-up.

936
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,879
I'm gonna report you.

937
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:14,840
On what ground?

938
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:16,080
You got any proof?

939
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,320
If you don't,

940
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:19,560
I can sue you for slander.

941
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:21,080
Oh?

942
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,040
Let's hear it.

943
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,399
Don't throw yourself at men.

944
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,639
We find that cheap.

945
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,399
Those who play hard to get

946
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,159
are my type.

947
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,560
That was a joke.

948
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:37,320
Not to mention

949
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,879
you and Shi Xiaoci are on the same team.

950
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:39,919
You colluded with each other

951
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:40,840
to set me up.

952
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,719
And that girl...

953
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,719
What if I've got photos

954
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,080
and a witness?

955
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,280
You mean Tang Xin?

956
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,320
It's Ai.
