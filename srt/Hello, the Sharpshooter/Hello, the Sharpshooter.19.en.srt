00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,280
I will wear it.

175
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:20,320
But Xiaoci,

176
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,960
why do I never see you

177
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,919
wear a dress?

178
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
What else do you want to see?

179
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,200
Don't bother.

180
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
Fine. We won't disturb you.

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,760
We'll leave you alone.

182
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,840
Live streamer.

183
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,239
Am I not

184
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,520
wearing properly?

185
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:41,840
Your suit

186
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,119
doesn't fit the theme of the shooting.

187
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,479
Luckily, I'm well prepared.

188
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,479
Here.

189
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,479
Today,

190
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,960
I've brought a dozen of suits.

191
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,359
Come and have a look.

192
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,440
Look. Check that.

193
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,280
Sport style.

194
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,320
Business style.

195
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,159
And...

196
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,760
Some with Lingda trademark.

197
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,239
You can consider

198
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,520
doing some product placement.

199
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,159
Let's do this.

200
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,200
Put on this T-shirt

201
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,119
and the jeans.

202
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,359
Let's do the leisure style first.

203
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,200
Fine.

204
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,559
So, something terrible

205
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,440
refers to his jealousy.

206
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,159
What did you say?

207
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,440
Nothing.

208
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:19,640
By the way,

209
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,479
I've brought my swimming trunks.

210
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,679
Be serious.

211
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,440
Come on.

212
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,200
I just think

213
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,760
we can try a different style.

214
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,119
Don't you want to see my pectoralis

215
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:29,200
or abdominal muscles?

216
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,119
I quit.

217
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,520
Shen... Shen Qingyuan!

218
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,280
Du Lingfeng,

219
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,239
put it on, too.

220
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,320
Shen Qingyuan.

221
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,520
Why are you sitting here?

222
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,919
You'll easily catch a cold
sitting on the ground.

223
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,679
Get up.

224
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,679
You haven't had lunch, right?

225
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,039
Shall we go...?

226
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,599
Are you being jealous?

227
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,599
He's jealous.

228
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:39,479
What did you say?

229
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,360
(Vinegar)

230
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,520
(Vinegar)

231
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,359
What are you looking at?

232
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,640
(Vinegar)
Life on your team is quite hard.

233
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,919
There's strict diet management.

234
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,200
When he's hungry,
he can only draw a vinegar jar

235
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,119
to satisfy his appetite.

236
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,280
It's my fault.

237
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,640
I should have told you before.

238
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,280
But I didn't

239
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,679
make a decision until last night.

240
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,840
Is that true?

241
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,640
You know Du Lingfeng.

242
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,119
He likes to show off.

243
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:23,760
And he often plays tricks.

244
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,400
Unlike you...

245
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,760
You're a mature player.

246
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,119
Put up with him.

247
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,919
How about

248
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,679
rewarding you after we're back home?

249
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Deal, then.

250
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,039
Don't go back on your word.

251
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,080
Let's go.

252
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,559
Why don't you put make-up on his face?

253
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,400
Me?

254
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,919
He wasted a lot of time

255
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,719
and we're running out of time now.

256
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,640
Go help him.

257
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,119
Good idea.

258
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,440
One make-up artist for each of us.

259
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,200
It'll be efficient.

260
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,359
Fine.

261
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,280
I'll try my best.

262
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,679
Mr. Gao,

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,239
could you hold the fill light for me?

264
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,119
Fine. Be right there.

265
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:11,599
Thank you.

266
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,359

First, single photos.

342

Me?

Mr. Gao...

347
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,920
I've got a backup camera.

348
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:16,520
You can use it.

349
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,479
You look quite stiff.

350
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,400

Yes, relax. Relax.

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,439
Okay. Nice.

522
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,400
Make a different pose.

523
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:08,239
Captain Shen,

524
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:10,000
be a little bit happier.

525
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,160
Get ready.

526
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,000
One, two, three.

527
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:15,560
Okay. Come on.

528
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,199
The last three photos.

529
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,079
Stand face to face
and point your fingers like a pistol

530
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:33,680
for one photo.

531
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,280
Come on. Get ready.

532
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,920
Okay. One, two, three.

533
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,560
Well done.

534
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,880
Here. Turn to me.

535
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,439
Point your fingers like a pistol.

536
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:44,199
One more photo.

537
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,680
As if in a war,

538
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:48,479
I was afraid of the uncertainty
in the old days

539
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:51,680
and I also had expectations.

540
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:52,880
(Moments)
Now,

541
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,680
the bullet has finally
pierced into my chest

542
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,560
and stuck to my heartbeat

543
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,920
as well as my pulse.

544
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,119
Will it

545
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,160
bear sweet fruits?

546
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,640
Perfect.

547
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,359
Thank you for today. Time to knock off.

548
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,119
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

549
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,000
You're welcome.

550
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,040
What?

551
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,439
You checked my phone just now.

552
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,400
So...

553
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,239
Shen Qingyuan,

554
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,400
you need to learn something.

555
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:28,920
Say it.

556
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,560
During human interactions,

557
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,239
after you fail to do something,

558
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:32,839
you don't need

559
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,959
to repeat it.

560
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:34,920
That's not for sure.

561
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,920
As long as I'm patient enough,

562
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,239
I will...

563
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,719
You will what?

564
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,959
I will wait till you fail.

565
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,560
He's indeed the most heartless guy.

566
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,439
Shen Qingyuan, in this case,

567
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,040
don't blame me for being heartless, too.

568
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,560
(Xiaoci
Xiaoci, you...)

569
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,959
Go take a rest.

570
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,239
I'll go help them.

571
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,000
Let me help you.

572
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,560
Don't bother.

573
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,040
I don't want you
to make trouble instead.

574
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,040
Go take a rest.

575
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,839
Mr. Gao, Ms. Wang,

576
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,920
how can I help?

577
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:03,680
No, no.

578
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,520
Go for some rest.

579
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:10,880
(WeChat)

580
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,960
(Captain Shen's Exclusive Wingman Group)

581
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,000
Xiaoci.

582
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,199
What?

583
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,400
You never

584
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,719
kept any secret from me.

585
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,520
Tell me.

586
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,239
What secret do you have lately?

587
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,959
Every adult has a secret.

588
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,040
Is it about Du Lingfeng?

589
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,160
You know what?

590
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,719
Don't have true feelings for him.

591
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,439
After Shen Qingyuan is

592
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:43,560
in a relationship with Tang Xin,

593
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,319
he shoots

594
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,319
much better.

595
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,479
Is it the same case

596
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,520
with you

597
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,119
and Du Lingfeng?

598
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,239
What kind of man is Du Lingfeng?

599
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,280
How many times
has he been a trending topic?

600
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,800
How many hobbies has he had?

601
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,040
How many girlfriends has he had?

602
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,000
Even when he made an investment,

603
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,599
he withdrew it three days later.

604
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,839
Do you really think

605
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,959
he'll be interested in you
beyond three months?

606
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:03,760
I'm not likely

607
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
to be interested in him

608
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,880
beyond three months, either.

609
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,760
You're indeed awesome, Xiaoci.

610
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:13,439
I used to admire you

611
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:13,920
due to your contempt

612
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,280
for everybody.

613
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,280
Actually, I'm very worried about you.

614
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,119
I don't want a playboy like him

615
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,640
to ruin your reputation.

616
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,239
Alright. I'm relieved now.

617
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:22,880
Keep it up.

618
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:42,959
I'm sorry.

619
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:44,640
Thank you.

620
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:49,000
How do you like this place?

621
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,599
Du Lingfeng,

622
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:50,599
when you're with me,

623
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,119
you don't need to have showy plans.

624
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,479
I'm just trying

625
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:55,920
to impress you.

626
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,119
This is the private restaurant

627
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:58,959
you mentioned?

628
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,239
How do you like it?

629
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:02,800
You'll know how good it is.

630
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:03,680
Come on.

631
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,760
My opinion isn't important.

632
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,479
Whether you like it matters.

633
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,760
Here.

634
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,400
Sir,

635
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,319
your dishes are all served.

636
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,199
Okay. Thank you.

637
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:27,800
Xiaoci,

638
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,920
I often visited this restaurant.

639
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,760
It never receives new customers.

640
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,359
The dishes taste good.

641
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,119
Would you like to try them?

642
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:34,959
Sure.

643
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,640
Here.

644
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:38,839
Thanks.

645
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:40,199
And this.

646
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:41,680
This.

647
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,160
Some of this for you, too.

648
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,439
Enjoy.

649
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,560
Du Lingfeng?

650
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,839
Xi... Xiyun?

651
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,719
Are you having lunch with your friend?

652
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,319
Long time no see.

653
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,000
I wondered if I got the wrong guy.

654
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,800
How's your father?

655
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,079
He's very well.

656
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,119
I'll leave you alone, then.

657
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,239
I have an appointment.

658
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,119
Okay.

659
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,119
Bye-bye.

660
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,479
How do they taste, Xiaoci?

661
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:16,160
Not bad.

662
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,599
Here. Try some of this.

663
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,119
The traffic was terrible.

664
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,119
Look, Du Lingfeng is over there.

665
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:29,800
Mr. Du?

666
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,520
It's really you!

667
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,479
You don't remember me?

668
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,319
Who are you?

669
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,239
I'm Mary's good friend.

670
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,800
Xiyun is my friend, too.

671
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,520
Mary.

672
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:42,520
I...

673
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,280
May I have your contact number?

674
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,000
I'd like to thank you.

675
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,079
No.

676
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,000
It's not very convenient.

677
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,920
I'm having lunch with my friend.

678
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,439
I won't bother you, then.

679
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,280
Xiaoci,

680
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,839
do the dishes taste good?

681
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,199
They can't be as good as your life.

682
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,520
It's a restaurant

683
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,479
where new customers are never received.

684
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,359
It indeed receives friends only.

685
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,079
Looks like

686
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,719
the girlfriends you had

687
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,800
aren't made up.

688
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:13,640
Come on.

689
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:14,880
They are made up.

690
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,839
I've never lied about that.

691
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:17,199
Don't get me wrong, Xiaoci.

692
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:18,839
Why would I get you wrong?

693
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,719
You and I

694
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:20,719
aren't in a relationship, anyway.

695
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:24,239
Didn't we agree to have
a wrestling relationship?

696
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,160
Xiaoci,

697
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,199
do you think

698
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:34,880
I'm a very bad guy?

699
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,439
What kind of girl

700
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,719
on earth do you like?

701
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,760
There are always
beautiful girls around you.

702
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:41,760
They wear long dresses

703
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
or short skirts.

704
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,239
They're of all kinds.

705
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,359
I like your type.

706
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
You're natural and elegant.

707
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,680
Those girls can't be as good as you.

708
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,560
They're artificial.

709
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:56,839
Dresses?

710
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,400
I like it when you wear pants.

711
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,959
I think you're very distinctive.

712
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,040
You're perfectly cool and sexy.

713
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,160
I love it when you wear pants.

714
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,680
You're too fat to wear a dress, anyway.

715
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,040
Fatty Shi,

716
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,560
the more you eat, the fatter you'll be.

717
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,920
The fatter you are, the more you'll eat.

718
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:14,719
- Fatty girl. Fatty girl.
- Fatty girl. Fatty girl.

719
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,680
So, you think

720
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,319
I shouldn't wear dresses?

721
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,319
There's nothing wrong

722
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,560
with the quest for perfection.

723
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,680
Girls make huge efforts

724
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,040
and pay great prices privately.

725
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:28,439
You don't need to complain.

726
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,319
Right.

727
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,920
There's nothing wrong
with the quest for perfection.

728
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,479
But it's not right

729
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,199
to use it as a bargaining chip.

730
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,160
So in your eyes,

731
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
a girl pursues perfection

732
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,599
only to flatter a man

733
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,280
and use it

734
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,439
to marry a rich guy?

735
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,160
No.

736
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,599
I don't mean that.

737
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,079
What do you mean, then?

738
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,599
I mean

739
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,079
I don't like girls

740
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,560
with a strong purpose.

741
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,079
I adore natural girls

742
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,280
like you.

743
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:00,760
In my eyes,

744
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,400
you're always the most beautiful.

745
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,359
You're a girl

746
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,439
with pretty features.

747
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,400
And you look

748
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,680
very pleasing.

749
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,119
So,

750
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,040
you only like my appearance?

751
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,239
You think I'm just eye candy.

752
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:19,760
No, no.

753
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,359
- Xiaoci, I don't mean...
- I overestimated you.

754
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,479
Enjoy the lunch yourself.

755
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:23,000
Xiaoci...

756
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,719
What do you think of the photos?

757
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:50,640
Just so-so.

758
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,040
Without constructive feedback,

759
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,560
don't bother to comment.

760
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,560
I'm just good

761
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,640
at commenting on Qingyuan's photos.

762
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,479
How shameless!

763
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,599
Tell me the truth.

764
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,119
Did you establish a group chat

765
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,119
for Shen Qingyuan?

766
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,199
No.

767
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,840
I didn't.

768
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,280
Xin,

769
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,399
I saw

770
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:16,520
what you posted yesterday.

771
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,479
It looked emotional.

772
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,520
I should have

773
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,000
excluded you.

774
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,040
It's too late.

775
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,120
Don't try to cover it up.

776
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,959
I already saw it.

777
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,560
Is the post so sensational?

778
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,360
(People Who Liked the Post)

779
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,520
Captain,

780
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,120
how much more shall I put in?

781
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,920
(Tang Xin's Preferences)

782
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,520
Liu's Spicy Hot Pot.

783
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,360
Just so-so.

784
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,200
(Tang Xin's Moments)

785
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,639
"Listening to the patter of raindrops,

786
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,959
I feel so good."

787
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,919
She doesn't like the rain, does she?

788
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,199
Captain,

789
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,040
we usually post

790
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,760
just to record

791
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
our moods.

792
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,439
Maybe she was walking along the road

793
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:00,760
on a rainy day

794
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,719
and when a car passed,

795
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:02,679
it spattered her with raindrops.

796
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,959
She must have been upset then.

797
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,239
But this time, she had a day off.

798
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,439
She certainly felt happy.

799
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,600
Anyway,

800
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,679
making a form like this

801
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,560
won't work.

802
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
I can at least sum something up

803
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,320
from the data.

804
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,159
Let's go on.

805
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:17,959
Why is Miss Tang so crazy

806
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,320
about posting?

807
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,280
By the way,

808
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,760
use the statistical function

809
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,560
to count up

810
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,360
her mood frequency.

811
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,239
Then I have to

812
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,439
do the form again.

813
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,919
And what did you just say?

814
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,040
What function?

815
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,199
This.

816
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,399
This formula.

817
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:40,479
You know a lot of functions, don't you?

818
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,639
Oh, no.

819
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,280
We're doomed.

820
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,879
What's wrong?

821
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,560
Miss Tang's posts are gone.

822
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,879
You did it?

823
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,439
Why do you think it was me?

824
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,320
Then what's wrong with it?

825
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,120
I'm sure...

826
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:04,239
I'm sure she knew we were viewing

827
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,840
and then she hid her posts

828
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,600
so that we could no longer check them.

829
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,560
I'll ask her about it.

830
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,560
(Why?!)

831
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,000
Your tone

832
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,320
is too terse.

833
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,479
Recall it. Send another message.

834
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,640
(Recall)

835
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:22,919
Too terse?

836
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:23,959
Yes.

837
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,760
(I'm sorry.)

838
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,600
Sorry?

839
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:30,360
Come on, Captain.

840
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,479
You didn't do anything wrong.

841
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,879
You sound too humble.

842
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,399
Shall I recall it?

843
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,639
Here. Here.

844
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,560
This.

845
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,360
(You recalled a message.)

846
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:43,479
Send a normal one.

847
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,880
(Baby, am I bothering you?)

848
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,399
Captain,

849
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,320
isn't this message

850
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,399
too cheesy?

851
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,280
You will make her think

852
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,439
that your account is hacked.

853
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:54,919
What...

854
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,600
Recall it. Quickly.

855
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,520
(You recalled a message.)

856
00:36:58,879 --> 00:36:59,639
Shall I send another one?

857
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,040
Just ask her

858
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,080
why she has hidden her posts.

859
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,879
Posts...

860
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,400
(Why did you hide your posts?)

861
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,880
(Shen Qingyuan recalled four messages.)

862
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:19,879
Shen Qingyuan,

863
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,439
what on earth are you doing?

864
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:32,520
Captain,

865
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,560
I don't think

866
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,719
I can help you this time.

867
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,760
The setting for posts

868
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,360

00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,399
What do I do, then?

870
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,919
You have an excel sheet

871
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:41,199
we made together,

872
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,239
right?

873
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,879
Based on the sheet,

874
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,120
you can think about

875
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
how to make Miss Tang happy.

876
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,600
When she's happy,

877
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,320
she will certainly

878
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,639
make her posts visible to you.

(Tang Xin's Moments)
I've cleaned my new room

884
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,879
because I want a fresh start

885
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,280
in my life.

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,800
Why is that man a little bit weird?

888
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:20,919
Hello?
