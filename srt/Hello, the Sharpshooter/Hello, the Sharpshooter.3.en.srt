=Episode 3=

35
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,599
Am I seeing it right

36
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,879
that Captain Shen is lost in thought?

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,319
Captain,

38
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,239
what's on your mind?

39
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,199
Is it Miss Tang?

40
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,279
Talk to me if you need

41
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,239
relationship advice.

42
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,199
I'm like the girl whisperer.

43
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:06,080
I'll tell you everything I know.

44
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,720
Mind your own business.

45
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,839
Captain,

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,440
let me show you

47
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,800
real magic.

48
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,880
Watch it.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,839
Don't blink.

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,639
This is catnip.

51
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,559
Wait and see.

52
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,559
A bit will do.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,759
Here, kitty.

54
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:33,880
Look.

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,800
See?

56
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,039
What's going on?

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,199
Cats

58
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,440
love catnip.

59
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,080
A tiny bit of it

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
is enough to lead them

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,679
to you from afar.

62
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:44,360
Why?

63
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,399
That's the magic

64
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,279
of the so-called

65
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,279
pheromones.

66
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,039
Pheromones?

67
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,039
I picked that up

68
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,199
from the book.

69
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,279
(Pheromones)
It says

70
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,479
males,

71
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,559
once smelling

72
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,240
pheromones in females

73
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,960
are attracted to them instinctively.

74
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,839
And something about apex predators

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,199
and weak prey

76
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,880
and whatnot.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,679
Anyway,

78
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,919
it's just like

79
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,679
you two.

80
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:17,679
Here.

81
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,479
This cutie pie is crazy about it.

82
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,639
Is there a way

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,119
not to be affected by pheromones?

84
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,240
See for yourself.

85
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,520
Of course not.

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,960
It's scientifically

87
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,919
proven.

88
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,399
A natural instinct.

89
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,160
Here's more catnip.

90
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,919
Hi, Coach.

91
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,839
- Coach.
- Hello, Coach.

92
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,800
Coach.

93
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:48,440
Coach.

94
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:49,160
Coach.

95
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,720
Can I skip the celebration?

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,759
Why?

97
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,559
I'm needed elsewhere

98
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,839
and I'd like a day off.

99
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,600
Why isn't Hai coming?

100
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,720
I guess he's sitting this one out.

101
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,600
Chen Hai,

102
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:08,880
you've been an athlete

103
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,960
for eight years, right?

104
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,080
Unlike the younger ones,

105
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,000
your body starts to decline

106
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,279
at this age.

107
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,160
If you can't get your head

108
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,279
in the game

109
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,480
and focus on training,

110
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,359
you'll never end up

111
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,279
in the top three.

112
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
I understand, Coach.

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,520
(HY & RUI Celebration)

114
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,600
Coach Zhang.

115
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,040
Mr. Zhou.

116
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,040
Welcome!

117
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,959
Pleasure to be here.

118
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Good to have you here,

119
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
everyone.

120
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,799
This place is awesome!

121
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,200
Tang Xin,

122
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,040
take them to their seats.

123
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,600
OK.

124
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,320
Guys, follow me.

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,000
Coach,

126
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,000
this way, please.

127
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,760
- Hey!
- This way.

128
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,519
Coach.

129
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:03,880
Hey,

130
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,640
where's my seat?

131
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,480
This way, please.

132
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,079
Is there a way

133
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,720
not to be affected by pheromones?

134
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,200
Of course not.

135
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,119
It's scientifically proven.

136
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:17,959
A natural instinct.

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,959
Follow me.

138
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,279
Sit here.

139
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:29,959
OK.

140
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,600
Thanks.

141
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,440
What?

142
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
Shen Qingyuan,

143
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,440
that thing about us...

144
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:06,799
Do you always

145
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,079
use the same washing powder?

146
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,239
You have

147
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,239
a special scent.

148
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:13,760
I don't use washing powder,

149
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,519
but soap.

150
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,119
I'm honored

151
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,640
to be part of this celebration tonight.

152
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,559
First, I'd like to congratulate

153
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,200
Shen Qingyuan on winning
the Championship.

154
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,959
- Yeah! Nice!
- Congrats!

155
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:36,640
- Captain!
- Good job!

156
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,239
Now,

157
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,440
relax and have fun.

158
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,799
Rui Live

159
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,320
has specially prepared

160
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,519
alcohol-free wine

161
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,119
for all of you.

162
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,799
Drink as much as you can.

163
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,239
- Fantastic!
- Good!

164
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,440
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

165
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,040
Cheers!

166
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:02,920
It's good.

167
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,239
- Hai! Hai!
- Hai.

168
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,040
- Let's drink.
- Cheers!

169
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:10,559
Coach Zhang,

170
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,920
I hate to

171
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,359
spoil the mood,

172
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,200
but it was our fault

173
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,920
that we failed to

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,920
kill those rumors online

175
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,839
when they first appeared.

176
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,799
I apologize for that.

177
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,040
We will do

178
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,679
anything we can

179
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,640
to make it up

180
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
to you.

181
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,799
No need.

182
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,679
What's not is not.

183
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,519
Fine.

184
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,679
I wish our cooperation

185
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,399
a complete success

186
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,559
and good luck

187
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,679
to your team.

188
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:40,600
Knock 'em dead!

189
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,679
The food is so good.

190
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,480
Coach Zhang,

191
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,239
we'll be counting on you

192
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:53,440
in the future.

193
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,720
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

194
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,679
Hi, Captain Shen.

195
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,679
I'm a member of Rui Live.

196
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,920
I watched your game.

197
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,959
You were so calm

198
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,880
and did an excellent job!

199
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,519
To your victory.

200
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,279
Sorry.

201
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
Please excuse me.

202
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
Sorry, one sec.

203
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,559
- Mr. Zhou.
- Mr. Zhou.

204
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,320
Thank you for everything.

205
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,520
You didn't follow me here

206
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,080
just to

207
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,119
get fresh air, did you?

208
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,440
I came to apologize

209
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,200
for the fake news about us.

210
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:49,840
Sorry about that.

211
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,440
I never meant to

212
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,919
cause you any trouble.

213
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,760
I don't care.

214
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,719
But I do.

215
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,719
I thought I'd get fired

216
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,000
for my mistake on camera,

217
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
but

218
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,799
Mr. Zhou gave me a second chance.

219
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,919
So

220
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,359
we'll be seeing each other a lot

221
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:08,200
at work.

222
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,039
I know I said

223
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,520
to never see you again, but...

224
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,599
I promise

225
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,080
I won't harass you

226
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,280
or let our past...

227
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,159
What are you talking about?

228
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
Nothing happened between us.

229
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,760
Hey, aren't you

230
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,320
that shooting champion Shen Qingyuan?

231
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,880
Can we take a photo together?

232
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,599
Just one,

233
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,400
please?

234
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:28,840
Here.

235
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
Sorry. Sorry.

236
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:33,320
Wait!

237
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,880
Here you go. Two Sleepless Night.

238
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,520
Try this.

239
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,559
We can't talk business

240
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,440
in a bar.

241
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,599
You've got rejected twice.

242
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,080
That can't feel good.

243
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,559
This place might cheer you up.

244
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,400
I'm fine.

245
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,440
Stop pulling a long face.

246
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,640
The sports star thing is a gimmick.

247
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,760
There's no need for a pro.

248
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,840
I mean

249
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,000
the trained ones

250
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,520
aren't necessarily better.

251
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
You're

252
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,599
a trained shooter yourself, aren't you?

253
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
I remember

254
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,000
you did well

255
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,159
as a student in the States.

256
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,760
Why not promote yourself?

257
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,400
You don't need others.

258
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:40,880
Dad,

259
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:42,520
how do you like my idea?

260
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,200
Not bad.

261
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm glad you can think outside the box.

262
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,239
Lingda

263
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,440
is a time-honored brand.

264
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,840
Their endorser

265
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,200
must be connected to the Olympics.

266
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,760
Got it, Dad.

267
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,119
Welcome to The Summer Land!

268
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,159
Your fantasy

269
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,280
is about to begin.

270
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,520
This way, please.

271
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,359
Have fun!

272
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,200
Guys,

273
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,640
enjoy yourselves!

274
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,239
Bye!

275
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,640
Do you know

276
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,239
the fox spirit story?

277
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,760
No.

278
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,239
Once upon a time,

279
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
a scholar was traveling at night

280
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,520
and arrived at a big house.

281
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
He enjoyed kind hospitality there

282
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,719
as if in a dream.

283
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,520
When he woke up the next day,

284
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,880
he found himself in the wild

285
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,479
surrounded by rocks and dirt

286
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,239
instead of gold and silver.

287
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,520
I feel like living in a dream now.

288
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,200
You aren't.

289
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,520
Everything is real.

290
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,320
Look.

291
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,520
They've got an ad here.

292
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,000
(The Summer Land
Stalls for Rent)

293
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,239
Let's go.

294
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,640
Ice cream!

295
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,880
Come and take a look!

296
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,960
We've got all kinds of flavors.

297
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,880
Would you like one?

298
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,719
Do you want it?

299
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:07,880
No ice cream for athletes.

300
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,880
I'd like a yogurt one.

301
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,280
OK. Just one sec.

302
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,359
How much?

303
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,520
20 yuan.

304
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,479
Wait.

305
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,719
Two for one

306
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:29,520
for couples.

307
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,359
You can have one more.

308
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,960
We... We are not.

309
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,119
Come on.

310
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Ice cream!

311
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,960
How much?

312
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:49,840
20 yuan.

313
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:51,919
I...

314
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,559
Shen Qingyuan,

315
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,039
you're famous now.

316
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
If you don't wanna see your name

317
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,239
on the trending topics list tomorrow,

318
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,719
better put them on.

319
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,719
Just do it.

320
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,440
Thanks.

321
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,919
Darts!

322
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:10,919
Wanna have a try, Miss?

323
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,400
Come on, Shen Qingyuan.

324
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,520
You can do it.

325
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,119
This is

326
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,440
similar to shooting.

327
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:17,960
I'll play.

328
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,000
Give me the darts.

329
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
OK. Here you are.

330
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,640
Darts!

331
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:35,479
That's not even close.

332
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,200
Let me try again.

333
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,280
Darts!

334
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,440
Enough! You can stop now.

335
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,799
Dart King!

336
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,960
No, no, no. I'm not done yet.

337
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,840
Sir, more darts.

338
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,640
OK.

339
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:09,960
Well done!

340
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,559
Congratulations!

341
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,640
You won our special prize,

342
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,960
a bear.

343
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,440
Thumbs up to your boyfriend.

344
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,000
Thanks.

345
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:19,919
You're welcome.

346
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,280
Let's go.

347
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,080
Hello, gorgeous,

348
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,039
it's me.

349
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:32,960
Good to

350
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,919
see you again.

351
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,000
Here are

352
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,039
two love candies.

353
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,799
What are they for?

354
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,359
Put the two candies together

355
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,919
and you'll

356
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,760
be able to

357
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,719
tell your love fortune.

358
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,599
Males,

359
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:56,799
once smelling

360
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,440
pheromones in females

361
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,119
are attracted to them instinctively.

362
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,200
It's just like

363
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,000
you two.

364
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,160

381
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,080
Morning, Captain.

382
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,840
Morning.

383
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,320
Where did you and Miss Tang go

384
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,440
in the middle of the celebration?

385
00:16:58,719 --> 00:16:59,359
Training.

386
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,440
What?

387
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,359
That was lame!

388
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:03,840
I expected

389
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,079
something fun.

390
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
See you.

391
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,920
(Qianyang 26)

392
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,800
Tang Xin,

393
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,800
that signed LOI
with Haiya Shooting Team

394
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,040
makes you officially one of us.

395
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,079
Thanks.

396
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,479
Want some crispy winter jujube?

397
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,839
If not, I'll empty the whole bag.

398
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,280
Thank you.

399
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:36,800
What's bothering you?

400
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,040
Nothing.

401
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,680
Darling,

402
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,439
it's written

403
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,239
all over your face.

404
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:48,719
Lizi,

405
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,479
I've seen him again.

406
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,359
The one who dumped you?

407
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,119
No, he didn't.

408
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,959
I'm sure he left for a reason.

409
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,439
Oh, save it!

410
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,680
He hasn't contacted you once

411
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,880
since he went AWOL.

412
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,920
Stop defending him.

413
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,959
When I saw him this time,

414
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,239
he seemed to be

415
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,520
a different person.

416
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,760
The way he talked

417
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,040
and his behavior

418
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,160
have totally changed.

419
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,160
Even so,

420
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
I still...

421
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,359
Like him?

422
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,040
I can't help it.

423
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,160
Listen to yourself.

424
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,239
I just don't want you

425
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,599
to get hurt again.

426
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,800
I trust him.

427
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,520
You're incorrigible!

428
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
Just follow your heart.

429
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,319
Hey,

430
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:36,959
I'm going to

431
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,079
the Shooting Team to shoot more videos.

432
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,040
Gotta run.

433
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,680
(You two are inseparable.
Your fate is intertwined.)

434
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:53,560
Hi, guys,

435
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,920
Rui Live again.

436
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,319
You've watched

437
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,439
their game on my channel earlier.

438
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,760
What I have for you today

439
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
is their training vlog.

440
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,319
They're

441
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,000
air rifle shooters.

442
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,560
10m Air Rifle

443
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,760
is a common

444
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,000
shooting event

445
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,520
that has entered the Olympic Games.

446
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,000
Similar to Air Pistol,

447
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:18,880
shooters have to go through

448
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,959
qualifications

449
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,319
before finals.

450
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,599
The air rifle is heavy.

451
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,560
It needs to be held with both hands.

452
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,920
Look,

453
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,640
their leather suits

454
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,760
are sharp, aren't they?

455
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
They're unusually thick

456
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,160
and heavy

457
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,959
to isolate the heartbeat

458
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,000
and maximize the stability.

459
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,239
Unlike the Air Pistol target,

460
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,560
the 10m Air Rifle target

461
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,160
is only the size of a 1-yuan coin.

462
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,199
Shooters can only see a black dot

463
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,800
from where they stand.

464
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,079
That makes this event

465
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,400
extremely challenging.

466
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
It tests precision

467
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
to the extreme.

468
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,920
Here we have the new shooters

469
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,280
of Haiya University.

470
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,280
They're doing

471
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,719
aerobic exercise

472
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,239
such as running

473
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,400
and cycling.

474
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,760
I can't

475
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,079
keep up with them

476
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,719
to show you one by one.

477
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,959
But coming next

478
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,560
is 10m Air Pistol

479
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,719
of which Haiya is

480
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,479
the defending champion.

481
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,560
Stay tuned

482
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,160
to today's highlight.

483
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,280
Shen Qingyuan,

484
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,160
here's something for you.

485
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,000
Congratulations!

486
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,560
And this, too.

487
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,719
Thanks, but no.

488
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,680
The shooting event

489
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,160
usually takes hours,

490
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,479
so it's physically challenging,

491
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,400
too.

492
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,959
And our training

493
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,560
combines aerobic

494
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
and anaerobic activities.

495
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,239
Swimming...

496
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,520
Swimming

497
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,560
is one of them.

498
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,079
We have experts

499
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,719
to time us

500
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,800
and keep track

501
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,079
of our condition.

502
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,119
But in the past,

503
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,239
running and lifting weights

504
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,640
were the only options

505
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,599
which caused repetitive strain injury

506
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,280
to many athletes.

507
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,160
Right now, we've upgraded

508
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,520
and diversified the training methods

509
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,680
to running, intervals,

510
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,520
speed play,

511
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
cycling

512
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
and swimming.

513
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,560
As a result,

514
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,000
our physical fitness

515
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,760
- and strength
- Shen Qingyuan.

516
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,400
are improved greatly

517
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,319
and comprehensively

518
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,319
in multiple dimensions.

519
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,079
It's OK. We got you.

520
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,760
Be careful.

521
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,680
Slowly.

522
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,479
Are you OK?

523
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,400
I'm good.

524
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,520
What happened?

525
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,079
I stepped back with the camera

526
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,160
and fell.

527
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:27,959
Jiang Yitian,

528
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:28,800
why didn't you stop me?

529
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,040
I didn't know you'd fall.

530
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,319
What happened?

531
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,280
- Captain.
- Captain.

532
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,959
Coach asked us

533
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,479
to do a training vlog on Rui Live.

534
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,959
I was working with Miss Tang.

535
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,560
Are you done?

536
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:42,479
Are you OK?

537
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,199
Captain Shen

538
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:46,880
can take it from here.

539
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,680
We still

540
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,760
have training to do.

541
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:49,880
See you.

542
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,800
Let's go.

543
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,160
Let's get started.

544
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,680
Take a look

545
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,439
at the script.

546
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,319
All good.

547
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,839
Your ears look red.

548
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,880
Are you burning up?

549
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:25,880
Let me check.

550
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:44,520
Thanks.

551
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,439
No problem.

552
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,479
I'm ready if you are.

553
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:51,520
OK.

554
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,439
Sorry,

555
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,760
gotta powder my nose.

556
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,000
Let's thank Shen Qingyuan
for telling us so much.

557
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,800
That's all

558
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,119
for today.

559
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,479
See you next time.

560
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,479
Thanks for your help.

561
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,880
Have a seat.

562
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,640
Do you know pheromones?

563
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,000
What's that?

564
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,920
The book says

565
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,040
males,

566
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,920
once smelling

567
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,920
pheromones in females

568
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,880
are attracted to them instinctively.

569
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,079
What?

570
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,560
Like cat and catnip.

571
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,040
It's addictive

572
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,920
and irresistible.

573
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,760
What's your point?

574
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,880
I think I'm addicted to you.

575
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:36,119
Let's go.

576
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,599
Time for the training.

577
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,439
Hello, again.

578
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Get out.

579
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,239
Sorry. My bad.

580
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,239
We should start

581
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,479
charging visitors.

582
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
I'm

583
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,760
a big spender.

584
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,359
Do you enjoy piling things up?

585
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
You were piling shell casings

586
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,760
the last time we met at the game.

587
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,400
It's to test

588
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,479
new shooters' balance,

589
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,359
stability

590
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,479
and ability to shoot under pressure.

591
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,400
No wonder you're the top female shooter,

592
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,680
Xiaoci.

593
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,920
How did you know my name?

594
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,959
Everyone on campus

595
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,400
was talking about you

596
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,199
wherever I went.

597
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,599
Not as much as

598
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,839
others talk about you.

599
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,719
10.5.

600
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,760
I can teach you

601
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,800
if you want,

602
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,199
but don't get your hopes up.

603
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,439
You might never be as good as me.

604
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,560
Maybe next time.

605
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,719
- Coach.
- Hello, Coach.

606
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,119
Start your training.

607
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,640
Hello, Coach Zhang.

608
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,800
Du Lingfeng?

609
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:18,800
Yes, I am.

610
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,520
What brings you here?

611
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,719
Coach,

612
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,199
a word, please.

613
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,439
I have nothing to say to you.

614
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,000
Give me one more chance.

615
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,760
Let's talk somewhere else.

616
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,239
It won't take too long.

617
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,640
Fine.

618
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,640
- Thanks.
- Follow me.

619
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:37,079
Sorry, Coach,

620
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,160
do you mind

621
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:39,359
waiting for me outside?

622
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,319
I'll meet you there.

623
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,160
Thanks.

624
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,160
I know

625
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,520
Women's 10m Air Pistol world record

626
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,479
is 10 points higher than men's.

627
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,880
That's fine.

628
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,199
Men always

629
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,719
go behind women.

630
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,400
That's not embarrassing at all.

631
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,079
That sweet talker

632
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,119
is so full of himself.

633
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:16,920
I thought

634
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,319
you were working with Jiang Yitian.

635
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,800
Why am I only seeing Shen Qingyuan?

636
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,760
Too late. Stop hiding it.

637
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,359
I'm not.

638
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:26,640
He showed up

639
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,439
in front of my camera.

640
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:30,760
Shen Qingyuan ticks all the boxes.

641
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,719
He's cute and talented,

642
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,920
much better than the one

643
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,160
you're obsessed with.

644
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,839
You like him?

645
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,479
Of course.

646
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:45,040
You too?

647
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,719
No!

648
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,199
He's a rare catch.

649
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,839
Don't let him go.

650
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,560
Can we be together?

651
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,839
We're trying to

652
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,439
keep things professional at work.

653
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,719
What's the problem?

654
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,040
This is the 21st century.

655
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,880
We can work and date

656
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,520
at the same time.

657
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,160
When did you

658
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,719
have your love fortune told?

659
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,719
Girl, you hit the jackpot!

660
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,640
Really?

661
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:19,760
(You two are inseparable.)
You're inseparable, OK?

662
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,599
Clearly,

663
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,640
you two are meant to be.

664
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,160
A match made in heaven.

665
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Go get him!

666
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,319
Nice!

667
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:37,920
Nice!

668
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,239
What's with the girls outside?

669
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,959
They're Captain Shen's fans.

670
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,319
He's become so popular

671
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:58,920
after winning

672
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,439
that they're showering him with gifts.

673
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,040
Yeah.

674
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,239
That's right.

675
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,439
Check this out.

676
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,760
Those girls

677
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
are Captain Shen's Stans.

678

(Shen Qingyuan's Super Topic)

679
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,079
He's got his own

680
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,239
Super Topic.

681
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,439
Nice!

682
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:13,680
You lazybones!

683
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,560
What are you doing?

684
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:15,800
Coach.

685
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,119
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

686
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:16,599
Coach.

687
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,000
Start shooting.

688
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,119
Relax your shoulders.

689
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,079
Watch your breath.

690
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,479
Relax your shoulders.

691
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,319
Watch your breath.

692
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,560
Hey,

693
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,520
a girl with the ID Go to Tree Hole

694
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,199
says,

695
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:00,880
"Look,

696
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,359
(Shen Qingyuan's Super Topic)
I'm so sick of her."

697
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,040
Who is that?

698
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,599
Something is wrong. Look.

699
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,000
Isn't that Miss...? Miss Tang?

700
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,640
What's wrong?

701
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,880
Nothing.

702
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,000
Continue.

703
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:57,680
So,

704
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,520
what you gotta say about this photo?

705
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,360
(Shen Qingyuan's Sight)

706
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,319
When you guys were

707
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,959
drinking during the celebration,

708
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,959
he and I hung out together.

709
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:08,760
So?

710
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,119
Are you dating or not?

711
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:16,880
What a shame!

712
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,640
Alright.

713
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,079
Lay low for a while

714
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,599
until this thing blows over.

715
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,839
Is there anything I can do?

716
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,800
I'll handle it.

717
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,880
Go prepare for your next episode.

718
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,680
I can still

719
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,839
do it?

720
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,880
Of course.

721
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,560
You and Shen Qingyuan

722
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,479
are tied together.

723
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:35,280
He's

724
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,719
our star.

725
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,160
Go back to work.

726
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:54,439
Yes.

727
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,079
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

728
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:57,239
What's up?

729
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,040
Coach Zhang,

730
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,839
I'm calling to tell you

731
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,439
that someone took photos

732
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,760
of Tang Xin

733
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,520
and Shen Qingyuan together

734
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,599
during our celebration.

735
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,439
Some thought they were dating

736
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,760
and made rude statements online.

737
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,520
I suggest we post

738
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
a clarification together.

739
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,680
What do you think?

740
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,599
Are they

741
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,839
seeing each other or not?

742
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:17,359
I've checked with Tang Xin

743
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,800
and she said no.

744
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,680
They aren't a couple.

745
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:22,760
Maybe you should ask your boy, too.

746
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:23,920
OK.

747
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,439
I'll see what I can do.

748
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:26,719
Sure.

749
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,640
Keep me updated.

750
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,199
I will. Bye.

751
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:42,920
Xiaoci,

752
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:43,719
come here.

753
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:44,280
Yes.

754
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,400
What's wrong, Coach?

755
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,880
How is

756
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,119
Qingyuan doing lately?

757
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,640
He's fading

758
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,400
ever since the last game,

759
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
but he'll soon bounce back.

760
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,760
Is he distracted

761
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,560
by that livestreamer?

762
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,760
I have no idea.

763
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:12,959
I see. Go back.

764
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,079
Wait.

765
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,199
I want you to spend more time

766
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,119
with Qingyuan.

767
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,199
You're partners.

768
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:20,640
Teamwork is everything.

769
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,719
Try to help him

770
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,319
get back on his feet.

771
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,439
Yes, Coach.

772
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,760
I'll do my best.

773
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:38,560
Don't panic.

774
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,800
Mr. Zhou will take care of it.

775
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,079
Everything will be fine.

776
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:42,920
It was my fault.

777
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,079
I was too careless.

778
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:44,719
Don't blame yourself.

779
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:45,880
You did nothing wrong.

780
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,239
The trolls are to blame.

781
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,119
Will this affect

782
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,280
our department?

783
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,160
They're pinning everything

784
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,520
on Rui Live.

785
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,160
Will the boss let us go

786
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,439
in rage?

787
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,479
No way.

788
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,280
I heard

789
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,599
Mr. Zhou calling

790
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,040
the Shooting Team

791
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,280
to post a statement together.

792
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,000
What statement?

793
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:06,920
Something like

794
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,280
you two are just partners at work.

795
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,600
It's routine.

796
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,280
Hey, man, throw it back.

797
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,399
Get the ball, man.

798
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,199
Thanks.

799
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,399
Coach.

800
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,760
Sit with me.

801
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,520
Let's talk.

802
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,520
Qingyuan,

803
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,479
you've never

804
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:02,360
let your attention wander in training.

805
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,239
What's going on?

806
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,919
I hate to bring this up,

807
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:09,959
but are you distracted

808
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:11,679
by that livestreamer?

809
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,800
Be honest with me.

810
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,120
Are you

811
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,760
dating her?

812
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,800
No.

813
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,600
Why were you

814
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,719
seen together during the celebration

815
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,399
that day?

816
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,399
You aren't

817
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,560
the active type.

818
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,239
Let me put it this way.

819
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,120
I don't wanna interfere

820
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,280
in your relationship,

821
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,679
but you should know

822
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:39,600
that you're born

823
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,159
a shooter.

824
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,120
You can go a long way.

825
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:44,639
A city champion is just a start.

826
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,600
You can compete in provincial games,

827
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,399
National Games, the Asian Games,

828
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,639
even the Olympic Games.

829
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,800
I've seen enough talents

830
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,000
fall halfway

831
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,800
and I don't want you to be like them,

832
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,639
you know?

833
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,320
Yes, Coach.

834
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,919
I'll never allow anything

835
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:07,159
to interfere with shooting.

836
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,959
I trust you.

837
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,320
Rui Live and I will explain it for you.

838
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:40,760
There she is.

839
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,959
The one in the photo with Shen Qingyuan.

840
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,399
She seems fine.

841
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:44,280
How could she do this?

842
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,399
She's such an attention seeker.

843
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:46,159
She enjoys the spotlight.

844
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,399
- Let's go.
- OK.

845
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,000
Let's go!

846
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,360
Come on!

847
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,479
It's pouring down.

848
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,040
Yeah.

849
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:53,919
Dry yourself.

850
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,159
Thanks. I can do it.

851
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,600
Shen Qingyuan,

852
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,159
have you read those comments online?

853
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,639
Just ignore them.

854
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,840
My company

855
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,120
is probably gonna post a statement

856
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,800
to draw a line between us

857
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,120
and prove we're only partners at work.

858
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,760
That's not my idea

859
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:44,959
but to calm the situation

860
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,080
online.

861
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:52,080
I've thought about you a lot all day

862
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,199
even when

863
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,320
I was shooting.

864
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,040
That's never happened before.

865
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,679
Take this.

866
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,520
What are you doing?

867
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,560
You're like catnip.

868
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,919
Addicted as I am to you,

869
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,959
I can't allow you

870
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:27,320
to distract me from shooting.

871
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,239
It's time to draw a line between us.

872
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,320
What happened before is a mistake.

873
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,399
Nothing will happen

874
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:37,280
between us.
