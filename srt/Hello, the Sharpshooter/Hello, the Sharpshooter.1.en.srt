35
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:47,000
This is the final live show

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,080
of National Shooting Championship.

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,800
Eight shooters are involved

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,279
in the chase for the championship.

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,800
They have come here

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,919
after accumulating the points

41
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:54,879
for one year.

42
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,680
In a shooting competition,

43
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:00,360
the accuracy and mentality
are important.

44
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,080
So is luck.

45
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:07,120
I support Shooter No.7!

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,520
Double lucky number seven.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,080
As we all know,

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,320
in many places,

49
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
number seven is a lucky number

50
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,919
as a symbol of perfection.

51
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,399
We can see

52
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,639
this shooter is on Platform No.7.

53
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,080
And the girl cheering for him

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,279
in the auditorium

55
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,800
has a seven on her hoodie, too.

56
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,880
At such a decisive moment,

57
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,960
will this girl

58
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,279
be his Luck Fairy

59
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,559
for today?

60
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,080
No!

61
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,559
I'm... I'm sorry, Tang Xin.

62
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,240
Are you all right? I rent this car.

63
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,559
I can't drive it smoothly.

64
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,440
I'm fine. I'm fine.

65
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,240
Have we arrived?

66
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,639
Yes. Yes.

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,119
Thank you, Lizi.

68
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,279
Wait.

69
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,160
Did you

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,479
dream of him again?

71
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,119
That guy left you several years ago.

72
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:53,000
Why are you still thinking of him?

73
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm not.

74
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,759
This is out of my control.

75
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,199
And dreams mean the opposite, right?

76
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,960
Don't let me know who he is.

77
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,759
Or I'll beat him up.

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,679
Shall I

79
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:06,559
ask Mr. Zhou

80
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,720
to let me stay with you?

81
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,559
Don't.

82
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,520
Mr. Zhou always

83
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,360
has a bad impression of me.

84
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,119
If I hang you up

85
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,039

86

I won't ever be a regular employee.

87
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,639

88
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,720
and fly back today.

You make sense.

90
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:17,679
I'll return the car

91
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,559
and go to the airport.

174
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,560
(The loaded weight
mustn't exceed 1,400g.)

175
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,119
Check our pistols again.

176
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,359
Without a solution,

177
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:38,200
what's the point

178
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,320
of shouting here?

179
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,239
Excuse me.

180
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:40,679
Make way, please.

181
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,880
Make way. Make way, please.

182
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,119
Make way, please. Thank you.

183
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,920
Excuse me.

184
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
No way.

185
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,440
Is there any problem with the scale?

186
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:52,760
Come on.

187
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,720
Don't point the gun at me.

188
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,200
Chen Hai,

189
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,079
why did you point the gun at him?

190
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,079
Are you trying to get fired?

191
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,600
What does that mean?

192
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,239
What's wrong?

193
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,079
It's the plum rain season.

194
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,519
Our pistols got damp

195
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,279
and they're overweight now.

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,519
The competition is starting soon.

199
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,799
Please give us more time

200
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,959
so that we'll think of a solution.

203
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,600
By the way, Zhou,

204
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,440
according to our coach,

205
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,239
the ace shooter of Haiya University

206
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,040
wears No.7 uniform.

207
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,559
Can it be him?

208
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,440
Captain,

209
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,559
where are you going?

210
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,279
If we stay and do nothing,

211
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,679
will it help?

212
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Shen... Shen Qingyuan?

213
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,600
What happens

214
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,760
when Airflow C

215
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,079
meets Airflow D?

Shen Qingyuan.

217
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,079
Explain it.

218
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,880
Shen Qingyuan.

219
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,919
Did you call me?

220
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,840
You don't remember me?

221
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,080
Were we in a game before?

222
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,919
No.

223
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,840
I am...

224
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,760
A team follower?

(Name: Tang Xin Company: Rui Live

A media worker?

227
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,239
In winter of the Northern Hemisphere,

228
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,520
when the warm and light

229
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
tropical airflow

230
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,280
meets the cold and heavy

231
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,320
polar airflow...

232
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,359
It's just like how I met you.

233
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,520
My emotions began

234
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,440
to be affected by you, too.

235
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:23,919
What are you talking about?

236
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,159
Class is over.

237
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,200
Hey,

238
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,880
come out, please.

239
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:37,559
You're Tang Xin, right?

240
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,280
I'll remember you.

241
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,799
If you want an interview...

242
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,520
Captain.

243
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,400
Captain.

244
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,119
Have it with him.

245
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,400
Hi, Miss Tang.

246
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,239
Shen Qingyuan.

247
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,119
Anything else?

248
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,960
Are you all right?

249
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,599
I mean...

250
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,320
I've got something else to attend to.

251
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,239
Miss Tang,

252
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,760
what's your relationship

253
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,679
with our captain?

254
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,520
It's your first cooperation with him?

255
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:31,960
I thought you and he had...

256
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,039
It's our first cooperation.

257
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,359
I noticed that you were sad

258
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,359
and I was trying to comfort you.

259
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,280
Why?

260
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,479
You have no idea.

261
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,239
Captain Shen's

262
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,599
with serious face blindness.

263
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,440
People think

264
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,599
he can't remember faces.

265
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,200
Actually,

266
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,520
he just focuses too much on the training

267
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
that he isn't interested

268
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
in anything else.

269
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,440
Also, he's quite unsocial.

270
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:49,840
So,

271
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,599
he can remember some faces

272
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:52,400
and some names.

273
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,840
He just can't match them

274
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,799
in no time.

275
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:55,960
He can't?

276
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,799
Sounds like you've known him before.

277
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,440
Yeah.

278
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,640
I met him in a competition

279
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,280
during high school.

280
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,159
So,

281
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,440
I got to know him earlier

282
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,080
than other team members.

283
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,919
Can I ask you some questions

284
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,200
about Shen Qingyuan?

285
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
I'll commentate
on the competition, after all.

286
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,400
You're asking the right person.

287
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,200
Fire away.

288
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,080
How's his shooting condition?

289
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,559
Captain Shen

290
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,640
is not only skillful,

291
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,440
but also very consistent.

292
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,679
Then do you know

293
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,760
how he was doing

294
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,679
before he joined

295
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:23,840
Haiya Shooting Team?

296
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,559
I don't know about that.

297
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,520
Let's go.

298
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:30,719
Ahead of us,

299
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,200
the gymnasium is on the left.

300
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,359
When we go straight,

301
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,080
we'll see the Preparation Site
for shooters.

302
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,880
Would you like to go and have a look?

303
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,440
All right.

304
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,280
What are you doing?

305
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,280
Dismantling the pistol.

306
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,919
After you remove the holster,

307
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,919
what if it influences

308
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,559
my shooting accuracy?

309
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,679
Now that we have to win,

310
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,159
this is the only solution.

311
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,599
Chen Hai, take it easy.

312
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,919
This is indeed the only solution.

313
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,000
Ahead of us

314
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,559
is the Preparation Site.

315
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,239
Here's the office

316
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,359
where shooters
have their pistols inspected.

317
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,000
Captain,

318
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,479
according to the almanac,

319
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,599
today is an off-day.

320
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,440
Don't break it.

321
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,400
(Equipment Inspection Office)

322
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:13,640
Excuse me.

323
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,440
May I get in?

324
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:14,960
- Sure.
- Thank you.

325
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,440
Thank you.

326
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,479
Please wait a minute, Miss Tang.

327
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,359
Next.

328
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:19,840
Captain,

329
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,000
how's it going?

330
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,239
Captain.

331
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:40,840
Captain?

332
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,400
Captain?

333
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,599
Where's Miss Tang?

334
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,200
Come on, Tang Xin.

335
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,400
Why are you hiding?

336
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,560
(Shooting Finals Pavilion)

337
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:00,880
Hello.

338
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,960
Your identity card, please.

339
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,440
All right. Come on in.

340
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,960
(National Shooting Championship)

341
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,440
Ten minutes for polishing

342
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,239
and several more minutes
for getting used to the new weight.

343
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:25,359
It's enough.

344
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,880
Captain Shen

345
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,760
easily got 10.5.

346
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,520
Note the time.

347
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,280
Time to hand in your pistols.

348
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,280
No more practice?

349
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,799
One shot is

350
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:19,599
enough for me.

Hello, everybody.

of a competition

355
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,479

Here's the testing moment

359
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,119
before the qualification.

360
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,559
Adult shooters are divided
into two teams for the qualification.

361
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,840
Thirty shooters in total.

362
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,200
Fifteen shooters for each team.

363
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,119
Each shooter

364
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,799
has 15 minutes for testing.

When the competition officially starts,

367
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:19,039
a shooter should make 60 shots

368
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,000
within 75 minutes.

369
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,960
Integer points will be recorded.

370
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,200
Only the top eight shooters

371
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,559
can progress to the final.

377
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,359
The air pistol

378
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,919
isn't the gun

379
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,320
you see in gunplay films.

380
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,599
It's triggered
by the pressure of the cylinder

381
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,719
with limited force.

382
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,440
So, there's only 10m air pistol event.

383
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:06,760
However,

384
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,280
the shooter has to hold the pistol
with only one hand

385
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
and it's hard to stabilize it.

386
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,919
There are great demands

387
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:12,960
for shooters' postures and movements.

388
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,039
This shooter...

389
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Looks like his pistol was
just dismantled.

390
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,520
It seems like

391
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,000
he hasn't adapted
to the pistol's weight yet.

392
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,559
His posture and mentality

393
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,479
are very unstable.

give her a...?

No. That's too expensive.

Our university

418
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,599
gave us an order, right?

419
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Look at this girl.

420
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,680
She sounds professional.

421
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,640
What's her name?

422
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,000
I didn't dare to notice her name,

423
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000

426
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:39,880
Did you call me?

427
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,800
You don't remember me?

428
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,520
I've got

429
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,719
such a big memory problem.

430
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,920
I'm afraid I need Dr. Ding.

431

Will Dr. Ding come today?

432
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,839
Dr. Ding is a psychologist.

433
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,959
She can't heal an IQ problem.

434

anything else

444
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,000
besides shooting?

445
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:05,640
Oh, yes.

- Tang Xin?

She's very professional.

450

451
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,119
uses professional terms,

452
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:14,920
but the way she does the livestreaming

453
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,359
is also good.

454
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:15,760

00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,319
You always say that.

520
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,760
But he's your partner.

521
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,839
I met him this morning

522
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,359
and he looked fine.

523
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,680
So, I've been relieved.

524
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,319
But I care about him.

525
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,880
I care about you as well as him.

526
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,479
Please.

527
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,319
Fine, then.

528
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:33,280
But wait.

529
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,839
Wait until the final.

530
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,520
The qualification is boring.

531
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,000
It'll be a waste of my time.

532
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,400
So much for this.

533
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:39,920
I'll hang up.

534
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:43,160
- Shen Qingyuan!
- Shen Qingyuan!

535
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,200
(Come on! Haiya, sure to win!)
- Come on! - Shen Qingyuan!

536
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,120
(Come on, Shen Qingyuan.
Fight for the champion!)

537
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,840
(Fighting, Southeast Shooting Team)

538
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,960
(Come on! Haiya, sure to win!)

539
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,280
(Haiya, sure to win!)

540
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,760
(National Shooting Championship
Team B of Men's 10m Air Pistol Qualification)

541
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:11,719
What follows is

542
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,400
the qualification for Team B.

543
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,119
I suggest you relax.

544
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,560
Because scores of the qualification

545
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,479
are not carried forwards...

546
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,479
Why is it her again?

547
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,680
...to the final.

548
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,520
The qualification

549
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,079
is only for places in the final.

550
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,079
Here's your water.

551
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,079
With my love.

552
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,000
Thank you.

553
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,959
Dear Shen Qingyuan,

554
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,199
wish you a good performance
in the basketball match.

555
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,439
I'll be watching you.

556
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,439
You wrote it?

557
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:55,719
It's for you.

558
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,800
If only one day you could broadcast it

559
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,239
and cheer for me personally.

560
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,760
Shooter No.7 Shen Qingyuan

561
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,439
is from Haiya Shooting Team

562
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,359
just like Shooter Chen Hai

563
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,920
of Team A.

564
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,319
Hope you'll cheer for him.

565
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,199
Eight.

566
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:24,599
However,

567
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,920
it seems like

568
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,760
his pistol has the same problem

569
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,479
as Chen Hai's.

570
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,479
It's possible that...

571
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,880
He's the ace shooter of Haiya.

572
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,040
But can he still do a good job?

573
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,400
Nine.

574
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,880
I feel something is wrong with Captain.

575
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,079
I'd be happy

576
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,920
if good scores astonished me.

577
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
But nine...

578
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,760
To some certain shooter,

579
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,119
it can't be

580
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,719
a very desirable score.

581
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:23,760
Perfect!

582
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:24,800
Everybody,

583
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,959
please support Shooter No.7 with me.

584
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,119
Here's the result

585
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,160
of Shen Qingyuan's qualification.

586
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,319
94 for Round 1.

587
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,800
99 for Round 2.

588
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:13,920
97 for Round 3.

589
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,319
98 for Round 4.

590
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:16,719
98 for Round 5.

591
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,239
98 for Round 6.

592
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,227
(Team A 1st Zhou Yue 582)
584 in total.

593
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,239
(Team B 1st Shen Qingyuan 584)
584 in total.

594
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,959
He's won the first place
of the qualification,

595
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,760
followed by Zhou Yue,

596
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,160
who's in second place.

597
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,640
He got 582 in total.

598
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,920
It was a very close finish.

599
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
What's wrong?

600
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,880
Talented as Shen Qingyuan is,

601
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,439
he should have done better.

602
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:38,760
Shooters are leaving.

603
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,400
Like those

604
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,920
who are at the top of the world,

605
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,160
Shen Qingyuan

606
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,359
may be a brilliant shooter

607
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,439
who's born to be looked up at.

608
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,359
However...

609
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,400
Maybe I'm too radical.

610
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,719
I just don't think

611
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:59,280
he gave full play to his talent.

612
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,359
Maybe we have to wait until the final.

613
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:03,479
The final

614
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,079
will start in 15 minutes.

how good Chinese shooters can be.

00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,640
I'd like to ask

691
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,000
where National Shooting Championship

692
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,520
is held today.

693
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,319
In B1.

694
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,239
A1. C1...

695
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,520
Wait.

696
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,319
Excuse me.

697
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,239
How can I get to B1?

698
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm going there, too.

699
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,800
Follow me.

700
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,920
Thank you.

701
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,400
(Shooting Finals Pavilion)

702
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,800
Dear audience,

703
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,400
(National Shooting Championship)
we're watching

704
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,920
(Men's 10m Air Pistol Final)
Men's 10m Air Pistol Final

705
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,599
of National Shooting Championship.

706
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,359
The shooter

707
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,800
on Platform A

708
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,560
is Shen Qingyuan

709
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
of Haiya Shooting Team.

710
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,000
It's also his first time

711
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,599
to be in a championship,

712
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,760
on behalf of the golden team.

713
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,800
(Come on, Shen Qingyuan!)
His performance

714
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,199
is worth looking forward to.

715
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,719
The shooter on Platform B

716
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,680
is Zhou Yue of Southeast Shooting Team.

717
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,239
Different from Shen Qingyuan,

718
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,719
Zhou Yue is young,

719
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,920
but he's a veteran shooter.

720
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,520
All right. Next,

721
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,800
let's wait and expect

722
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,680
the shooters' wonderful performances.

723
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,479
(Come on, shooters from Nan'an!)
- Come on! - Come on!

724
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,560
- Be sure to win! Be sure to win!
- Be sure to win! Be sure to win!

725
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,640
- Come on!
- Come on!

726
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,680
What are you doing?

727
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,400
Are you a fan?

728
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,160
I'm a sports live streamer.

729
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,280
You should know a lot

730
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,199
about shooting competitions, right?

731
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,839
A little bit.

732
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,079
I have some confusion.

733
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,040
Do you know

734
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,160
who the best shooter is?

735
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,160
Shen Qingyuan

736
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,119
of Haiya Shooting Team

737
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,079
and Zhou Yue of Southeast Shooting Team.

738
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:01,839
Why did you ask?

739
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,839
Actually, I came here

740
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,800
to pick a shooter.

741
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,400
I have an advertisement

742
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,760
that needs an athlete endorser.

743
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, I see.

744
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,239
But you don't

745
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:10,680
look like a man

746
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,920
who does such legwork.

747
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,199
Come on.

748
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm just an ordinary guy.

749
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:17,119
A young man worrying about work.

750
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,560
Everybody is ordinary.

751
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,839
Work is hard.

752
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,319
You sound like

753
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,839
you have a problem with work?

754
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,160
I'm doing worse than you.

755
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,640
I'm still an intern.

756
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,560
Whether I can become a regular employee

757
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
depends on today's livestreaming.

758
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,119
Xiaoci?

759
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:34,880
Xiaoci.

760
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,479
What are you coming for?

761
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:36,640
You have a competition this afternoon.

762
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,239
Coach, I just think

763
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,400
watching Captain Shen's competition

764
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,640
will help me get into the zone better.

765
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,239
Besides,

766
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:42,560
I can learn from him.

767
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:44,439
Be seated.

768
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,359
- Move over.
- Move over.

769
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,280
Move over. Move over.

770
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,119
You're quite a rare audience.

771
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,280
Do you finally realize

772
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,680
that Captain Shen looks
more handsome from here?

773
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
I have something to ask you.

774
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,719
Has Captain Shen

775
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,119
got to know anyone new lately?

776
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,239
No.

777
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,199
It's sharp-eyed of you, Xiaoci.

778
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,520
You know what?

779
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,400
Look at the girl back there.

780
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,560
She's the live streamer

781
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,479
from Rui Live.

782
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,040
Have you met that girl?

783
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,520
Did Captain Shen fall in love with her

784
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,880
at first sight?

785
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,800
What are you talking about?

786
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:25,000
If Shen Qingyuan

787
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,920
fell in love with a girl,

788
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,760
the Olympic Games

789
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,239
would be held in odd years.

790
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:29,119
Come on.

791
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,319
You never treat Captain Shen

792
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,880
as a promising young man

793
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,040
in his prime.

794
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,719
I not only ignore his gender.

795
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:36,719
In my eyes,

796
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,160
he isn't even a human.

797
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,439
What is he, then?

798
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:41,920
A shooting machine.

799
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,280
He's born to shoot

800
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,520
and he lives to shoot.

801
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:48,760
This is my best compliment

802
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,719
for someone of the same occupation.

803
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,560
You don't understand, do you?

804
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,719
But today,

805
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:55,760
I don't even understand
this shooting machine.

806
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,040
Shen Qingyuan.

807
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,359
Hello.

808
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,479
I'm Zhou Yue.

809
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,079
You're great.

810
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,400
In the qualification,

811
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,000
you used a temporarily refitted pistol

812
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,640
to do

813
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,880
such a good job.

814
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,520
You're really something.

815
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,000
You don't know about the situation.

816
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,439
It's your first time in a championship.

817
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,239
Usually, experienced shooters

818
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,400
do not show

819
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,920
his full strength

820
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,199
in the qualification.

821
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,640
Because in the final,

822
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,640
he would be stressed out,

823
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,079
get in confusion,

824
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,839
and fail to get a good score.

825
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:44,760
You won the second place.

826
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,079
Only in the qualification.

827
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,079
It doesn't represent the final result.

828
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Considering your capability,

829
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:54,880
you can only be in second place

830
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,000
whether you keep a low profile or not.

831
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,119
Let's wait and see.

832
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,199
Like I just said,

833
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,359
scores of the qualification

834
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,520
are not carried forwards to the final.

835
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,599
So, for the eight shooters

836
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,839
in the final,

837
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,000
they'll start from zero.

838
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,359
Yet it's the biggest attraction

839
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,599
of the final.

840
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,560
As for the other attraction...

841
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,199
Is he staring at me?

842
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,040
The final only takes half an hour.

843
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,599
It's especially pacey and exciting.

844
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,079
Two rounds of five shots
for each shooter.

845
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,959
Then comes the elimination round.

846
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,280
One shooter will be eliminated
after two shots

847
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,479
until the champion is crowned.

848
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:49,800
Look.

849
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,119
The shooters have started.

850
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,960
(Zhou Yue: 10.2)

851
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,800
(National Shooting Championship
1st Zhou Yue 10.2 5th Shen Qingyuan 9.6)

852
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,479
I guess you all know

853
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,320
that Shooter No.7 Shen Qingyuan's pistol

854
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,840
was temporarily refitted.

855
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,280
So, I assume

856
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,919
that he isn't used to the pistol yet.

857
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,360
- Good!
- Bravo!

858
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,159
- Bravo!
- Nice shot!

859
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,080
Hello. Your identity card, please.

860
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,600
Come on in.

861
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,760
Coach.

862
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,080
Dr. Ding.

863
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,000
Dr. Ding.

864
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,360
You also detected the problem, I guess.

865
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,600
He's indeed affected by her.

866
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:11,879
Who are you talking about?

867
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,360
Who? Who's affected?

868
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,479
Wait. Where are you going?

869
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,560
I'm going with you.

870
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,440
(Come on, Shen Qingyuan!)

871
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,080
Hello.

872
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,199
Hello.

873
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:38,840
Miss Tang,

874
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,040
this is Xiaoci

875
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,800
of our shooting team.

876
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,879
Could you do us a favor?

877
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:43,600
What is it?

878
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,840
Could you leave the gym

879
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
for the moment?

880
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,760
But why?

881
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,679
Because our captain...

882
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,320
Let me explain.

883
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,320
Miss Tang,

884
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:02,760
because of you,

885
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,159
Captain Shen can't focus.

886
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,399
She's working.

887
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,479
She can't leave.

888
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,679
Besides,

889
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,120
what does your captain's performance

890
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,760
have to do

891
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,679
with this girl?

892
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,440
(Zhou Zuguang)

893
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,040
Intern,

894
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,959
how's your work?

895
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:27,879
Mr. Zhou, I've just arrived.

896
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:29,000
The man to pick me up hasn't come yet.

897
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,719
By the way, Mr. Zhou,

898
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,320
stop calling me Intern,

899
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,080
will you?

900
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,760
I have a name. I am...

901
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,959
There are so many interns.

902
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,919
How can I remember all the names?

903
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,080
(Name: Zhou Zuguang Post: Manager
of Rui Live Capability: None)

904
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,239
But I'm going to be
a regular employee today.

905
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,760
It's your last day of internship.

906
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,679
But if you mess it up,

907
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,159
you won't be a regular employee.

908
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,919
I'm sorry,

909
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,479
but I have a mission to do.

910
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:53,560
I can't leave the gym

911
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,399
before the livestreaming is over.

912
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,800
The first round of the final is over.

913
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,320
(1st Zhou Yue 103.8 6th Shen Qingyuan 102.4)
Here comes a crueler part,

914
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,239
the elimination round.

915
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,360
The second round is starting.

916
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,239
If it continues,

917
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,080
Shen Qingyuan will

918
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,120
lose the game.

919
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,840
I'm sorry,

920
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,360
but please cooperate with us.

921
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,040
Thank you.

922
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,919
Can I really affect him?

923
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:24,040
Why do you bother about them?

924
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,159
Miss Tang,

925
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,959
please do us the favor.

926
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:34,800
Hey,

927
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,520
could you take my seat?

928
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,120
I can do the livestreaming behind you.

929
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,159
Then he won't see me.

930
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:39,840
Okay?

931
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,399
Me?

932
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,040
But Miss Tang...

933
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,320
She's already helping.

934
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,479
What else do you want?

935
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:47,879
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

936
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:48,639
Fine. Thank you.

937
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
Thank you, Miss Tang.

938
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:57,479
Let's go.

939
00:37:58,919 --> 00:37:59,600
Thank you.

940
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,800
This guy looks familiar.

941
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,040
The elimination round officially starts.

942
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,040
(Shen Qingyuan, Zhou Yue)

943
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,640
(National Shooting Championship
1st Zhou Yue 114.5 4th Shen Qingyuan 112.3)

944
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,560
Shooter No.37

945
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,159
and No.19 are eliminated.

946
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,639
The first place

947
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,560
is still Zhou Yue
of Southeast Shooting Team.

948
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:46,439
Shen Qingyuan of Haiya University

949
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:47,439
may be a little bit nervous

950
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:48,600
because it's his first time

951
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:49,760
in a national competition.

952
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
He now ranks fourth.

953
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,399
Let me hold it.

954
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,439
Thanks.

955
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,840

(Gao Zhenxuan: 131.5)

No.39 Shooter has been eliminated.

961
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,280
Be quick. Be quick.

962
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,159
Come on. Be seated.

963

No.7 Shooter Shen Qingyuan

964
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:35,439
stopped shooting.

965
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:36,560
I guess

966
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,639
he's having a problem.

967
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:38,360
What's wrong?

968
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
Something's wrong with the trigger.

969
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
Something's wrong with the trigger?

970
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,479
What's going on?

971
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:50,840
I'll communicate with your coach.

972
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,679
(The live streamer is away.)
What's going on?

973
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,239
What's the matter?

974
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:16,360
What happened?

975
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,040
It's interrupted.

976
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,080
No.7 Shooter

977
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,679
has a failure of the trigger.

978
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,199
It's permissible.

979
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,000
He can restart shooting

980
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,959
after his pistol is fixed.

981
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,920
(Female)

(Zhou Zuguang)

983
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Come on. What are you doing?

984
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,120
Why is the livestreaming interrupted?

985
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,800
Do you know

986
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,199
it's the biggest taboo?

987
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,159
Not a single livestreaming

988
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,080
can be interrupted!

989
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,120
Don't you know that?

990
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,199
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

991
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,520
I...

992
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,840
You promised me

993
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,439
that you would complete the mission.

994
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,840
It's our first time

995
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,120
to try a traditional
sports livestreaming

996
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,080
with Haiya University.

997
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,879
If you fail it,

998
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:18,479
our whole team

999
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:20,080
may be dissolved!

1000
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,719
I shouldn't have left

1001
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,000
such an important mission

1002
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,800
to you.

1003
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:24,800
But if

1004
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,959
I continue the livestreaming,

1005
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:26,959
Haiya Shooting Team

1006
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:28,080
can't be the champion.

1007
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,159
Will this kind of livestreaming

1008
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,239
still be a success?
