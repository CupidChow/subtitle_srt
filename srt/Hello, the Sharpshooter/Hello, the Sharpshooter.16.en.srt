35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,319
Xiaoci,

36
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,120
I know I have many flaws

37
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,639
and I can be very childish.

38
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,879
And I know I'm just a backup.

39
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:01,800
But

40
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,400
I've been changing for the better.

41
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,599
Could you give me a chance?

42
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:18,199
Sorry for what I said last time.

43
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,919
I shouldn't have said that about you.

44
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,399
Mr. Du.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,199
Xiaoci.

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,199
- Mr. Du.
- Xiaoci.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,839
Time to play the game!

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,520
Well...

49
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,440
Jiang... Jiang Yitian is calling us.

50
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,320
Let's go.

51
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,960
Du Lingfeng, where did you go

52
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,800
with Xiaoci?

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,559
We looked for you but didn't find you.

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,240
Jiang Yitian,

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,639
what have you brought?

56
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,919
Here you go.

57
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:37,800
Come on.

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,919
You've brought so many snacks.

59
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,000
Then what's the punishment?

60
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,520
A thoughtful guy like me

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,720
will not only have Plan A.

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,080
There's a Plan B.

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,360
What is it?

64
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,960
Smell it.

65
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:53,919
Here.

66
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,520
It's mixed

67
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,000
with light soy sauce, thick soy sauce,

68
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,160
vinegar,

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,199
a little juice,

70
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,000
a bit of mustard,

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,960
and a little bit of sesame oil.

72
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,240
Only a little bit.

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,240
Disgusting.

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,919
Get ready.

75
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,279
Three.

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,279
Two.

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,720
One.

78
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,519
- Mr. Du.
- Mr. Du.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,600
Mr. Du.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Come on.

81
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,440
Which do you pick,

82
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,279
truth or dare?

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,640
Dare.

84
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,600
Dare?

85
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:33,519
Did you

86
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,720
pick it only because

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,399
you knew what I was going to ask?

88
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,880
You have no idea.

89
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,160
I'm just being generous

90
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,279
to warm the game up.

91
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,079
In this case,

92
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,880
let's think about

93
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,040
what we shall ask Mr. Du to do.

94
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,279
After all,

95
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,160
he's a man of the world.

96
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,079
I've got an idea.

97
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,679
Say it.

98
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:48,760
Let's have Mr. Du

99
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,839
stand on the main road of our school

100
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,079
and yell at Xiaoci,

101
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
"I'm a pig. I'm a pig.

102
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm really a pig. "

103
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,160
Good idea.

104
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,040
Good idea.

105
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,079
- Come on.
- Fine.

106
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,279
You've got tricks.

107
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,519
You flatter me.

108
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,359
Come on, Mr. Du.

109
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,079
Do it.

110
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,000
- Mr. Du. Mr. Du.
- Mr. Du. Mr. Du.

111
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,239
Wait and see.

112
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
It's just a game, Mr. Du.

113
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,279
Don't be serious.

114
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:07,920
Yeah, it's just a game.

115
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,640
Just go. Go.

116
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,880
- Pay your bet.
- Come on, Mr. Du.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,399
Pig...

118
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,000
Be louder.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,320
You must make Xiaoci hear you.

120
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,239
What's more,

121
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,119
how can you only say pig?

122
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,920
You should complete the sentence.

123
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,440
Right.

124
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm a pig. I'm a pig.

125
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,679
I'm really a pig.

126
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,799
All right. I heard you.

127
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,519
Come back.

128
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,279
Very well, you two.

129
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:37,880
Don't let me get back at you.

130
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Come on. Turn it.

131
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,000
Come on.

132
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,000
My turn, isn't it?

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,880
All right. Turn it.

134
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
- Captain Shen. Captain Shen.
- Captain Shen. Captain Shen.

135
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,959
- Captain Shen. Miss Tang.
- Captain Shen. Miss Tang.

136
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,920
- Stop calling us.
- Captain Shen. Miss Tang.

137
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,480
Captain Shen.

138
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,519
- Captain Shen.
- Captain Shen.

139
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,279
Captain Shen. Captain Shen.

140
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,000
Captain Shen,

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,040
which do you pick,

142
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,000
truth or dare?

143
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,119
I sincerely recommend you

144
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:00,880
to pick dare.

145
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,559
to pick dare.

146
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:01,959
Right.

147
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,760
Dare.

148
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,720
All right.

149
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,279
In this case,

150
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,239
I've got a mission for you.

151
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:10,559
Among us,

152
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,440
pick someone
who is the farthest from you

153
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,440
and entwine your fingers with her.

154
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,440
Then look into her eyes

155
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,359
and say something affectionately.

156
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:26,760
Give it to me.

157
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,040
This?

158
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,239
I mean the liquid.

159
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,160
Here it is.

160
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,600
But what do you need it for?

161
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,119
I choose to be punished.

162
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:41,880
What? You don't need to.

163
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,359
Don't...

164
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:43,799
Just a little bit.

165
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,119
It's enough. Enough.

166
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:44,920
Only a little bit.

167
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,519
Captain, don't drink it up.

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,959
Drink slowly, Captain.

169
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,720
Have some water.

170
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:52,839
No.

171
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,399
My turn, isn't it?

172
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Oh, you two.

173
00:06:59,480 --> 00:06:59,959
Miss Tang.

174
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:00,720
Miss Tang.

175
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,679
Truth or dare?

176
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,920
- Tang Xin...
- I'll drink Rio.

177
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,959
Take it easy.

178
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,440
Come on. No one is forcing you.

179
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,239
Drink slowly.

180
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,600
My turn, right?

181
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:13,880
Miss Tang,

182
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,079
why is it you again?

183
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,519
Errand girl.

184
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,440
You have such bad luck.

185
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,359
We indeed share the same luck.

186
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,399
We both pointed at ourselves.

187
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,959
I'll drink more Rio.

188
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,160
Here I go.

189
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,200
Why do you always drink?

190
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,239
I'll keep drinking it.

191
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,440
I will.

192
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,640
Don't.

193
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,040
It's still liquor.

194
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,720
Don't drink too much.

195
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,959
You've drunk several tins.

196
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,399
Drink no more.

197
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,040
Shen Qingyuan!

198
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,160
I'm all right.

199
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,559
I'll ask you a question.

200
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:46,959
I won't listen.

201
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,040
You're drunk.

202
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,679
I'm not.

203
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,119
Be a good girl!

204
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,799
Shen Qingyuan,

205
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,200
why do you always bully me?

206
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,079
It's what you always do.

207
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,799
Do you have any idea?

208
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,519
Every time you push me,

209
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,359
I have to step back.

210
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,600
It keeps happening.

211
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,399
You did that before.

212
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,640
And you're still doing it.

213
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,519
Are you addicted to bullying me?

214
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:23,880
Do you remember

215
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,440
the fireworks display?

216
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,279
You no longer stammer?

217
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,959
I don't stammer when I'm drunk.

218
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,760
I haven't bullied you lately.

219
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,440
What fireworks display do you mean?

220
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,200
See?

221
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,479
You don't remember anything.

222
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,000
You don't remember anything,

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,679
but to bully me.

224
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,440
Shall we... shall we call it a day?

225
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,359
It's almost time.

226
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,039
Right. Right.

227
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,640
Here are so many things.

228
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,479
We have to clean the place up.

229
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,400
You can leave first.

230
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,440
Captain Shen,

231
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,520
walk Miss Tang back.

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm... I'm going back to my dorm.

233
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
I'll take my leave, too.

234
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,200
Be careful.

235
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,400
Again, we'll do the cleaning work alone.

236
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,919
Right.

237
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,799
And the game we designed

238
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,880
didn't work out.

239
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,520
♪Doll and bear dancing♪

240
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,320

241

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,159
♪It nodded one two one♪

245
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,320
Little Bear, look.

246
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,880
Is that a four-leaf clover?

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,200
What?

248
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,200
Look. A four-leaf clover.

249
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,880
It represents

250
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,520
good luck, doesn't it?

251
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,119
Little Bear,

252
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,440
we've found good luck.

253
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:01,760
Tang Xin,

254
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:03,679
let's get back home.

255
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,359
I've found good luck.

256
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,159
Why does he still not remember?

257
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,119
Is it because

258
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,320
I haven't plucked it yet?

259
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,679
Be careful.

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,640
Tang Xin.

261
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,000
Stop playing. It's getting pretty late.

262
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm not playing.

263
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,919
I just want to pluck
the four-leaf clover.

264
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,320
Why must the Doll

265
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,599
pluck the four-leaf clover?

266
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,919
Because

267
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,200
it represents good luck.

268
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,200
After I pluck the four-leaf clover,

269
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,880
I'll have good luck.

270
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,840
Little Bear will have good luck, too.

271
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:42,840
Why does the Doll

272
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,440
want Little Bear to have good luck?

273
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,359
Because she likes him?

274
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,159
Of course.

275
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,359
The Doll likes Little Bear

276
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,159
and that's why she dances with him.

277
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:56,760
But she declined him

278
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,200
when he confessed his love to her.

279
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,039
Because she was scared.

280
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,159
Of what?

281
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,119
She feared

282
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,359
that Little Bear didn't really love her,

283
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,760
but only wanted to solve

284
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,200
the pheromone problem.

Shen Qingyuan,

300
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,679
if only you were Little Bear.

301
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,000

308
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,919
Captain,

309
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,440
I have planned to stop

310
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,000
being your tutor of love.

311
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,080
Why?

312
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,280
You aren't very savvy.

313
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,520
What does that mean?

314
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:12,760
Today,

315
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,159
it was a heaven-sent chance for you.

316
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,000
But why didn't you seize it?

317
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,159
Think about it. For example,

318
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,000
you had a great chance today.

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,520
It doesn't often come.

320
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,479
If you missed

321
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:21,119
this chance,

322
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:21,520
you may not have

323
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,760
a second chance.

324
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,280
Jiang Yitian.

325
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:25,239
What?

326
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,359
I've got something serious to tell you.

327
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,520
Serious?

328
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,280
I'm all ears.

329
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,000
Shen Qingyuan.

330
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,719
What happened yesterday

331
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,960
was just a dream, right?

332
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,960
Hope it wasn't true.

333
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,320
Or I would be totally disgraced.

334
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,119
Three things.

335
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,359
First,

336
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,960
the breakfast is on the table.

337
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,039
Remember to have it.

338
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,280
Second,

339
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,880
we don't have a lot of training today.

340
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,400
I've asked for leave for you.

341
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Stay at home for a good rest.

342
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,760
Third,

343
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,479
do you remember the Candy Carnival

344
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:34,159
we visited before?

345
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,559
At nine tonight,

346
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,599
I'll be waiting there for you.

347
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:37,960
Do come.

348
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,919
Wasn't the Carnival removed?

349
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,599
Hello, sir.

350
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,679
Welcome to I Do.

351
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,000
What kind of rings

352
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,679
would you like?

353
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,799
We have finished rings for couples

354
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,640
and customized rings for weddings.

355
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,799
Do you want one for your girlfriend

356
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,039
or for your wife?

357
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,000
May I have a look at this?

358
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:23,200
Sure, sir.

359
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,679
This is

360
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,119
our latest series.

361
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,679
The designer

362
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,640
has integrated

363
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,520
the trademark of I Do

364
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,239
into the beautiful shape

365
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,280
of the four-leaf clover.

366
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,239
It represents infinite luck

367
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,799
in romantic love.

368
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:54,880
I gotta go.

369
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,840
Come on. Assemble.

370
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,599
Coach.

371
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,359
The Winter Training Camp

372
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,359
called this afternoon,

373
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,200
asking us to give them

374
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,320
the roster of participants.

375
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:08,239
Unless something special

376
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,200
happens,

377
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,880
everyone here should participate.

378
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,719
Here are the registration sheets.

379
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,960
Get one piece back and fill it.

380
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,320
Ask your captain to hand them out.

381
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

382
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,840
Where's your captain?

383
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,960
Coach Zhang,

384
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,400
immediately after the training was over,

385
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,280
Captain Shen left.

386
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,960
That's not right.

387
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
He used to be the last to leave.

388
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,119
Why did he leave so early today?

389
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,479
I guess he's going on a date

390
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,599
with his girlfriend.

391
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,880
Girlfriend?

392
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,159
Why is Tang Xin absent?

393
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,840
Miss Tang also

394
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,679
has a date with her boyfriend.

395
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,200
Boyfriend?

396
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:52,799
Chen Hai.

397
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:53,760
Come over.

398
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,400
Hand out the sheets.

399
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,119
Okay.

400
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,320
Dismiss.

401
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,400
- Goodbye, Coach.
- Goodbye, Coach.

402
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,080
- Goodbye, Coach.
- Bye.

403
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,880
Give me one.

404
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,520
Is Miss Tang really in a relationship

405
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,280
with Captain Shen?

406
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,160
Get one for me.

407
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,839
After tonight,

408
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,400
they'll be in a relationship naturally.

409
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:11,800
I racked my brains

410
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,560
to come up with such a good plan.

411
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,079
I'm sure it'll work.

412
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,040
Good.

413
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,920
Have a look, lady.

414
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,040
Thank you.

415
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:33,479
Perfect plan?

416
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,199
Are you trying to give me a leaflet?

417
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,319
Come with me.

418
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,359
This is my magic candy bag.

419
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:18,959
I'll give you

420
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,640
two candy love sticks.

421
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,000
What is a candy love stick?

422
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,199
When two candies are made one,

423
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:23,599
you will find

424
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,640
the love secret

425
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,880
that belongs to you alone.

426
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:38,800
Hi.

427
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:40,479
Hi.

428
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,199
Shen Qingyuan,

429
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,599
why are you wearing this?

430
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,119
I'm... I'm not Shen Qingyuan.

431
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm Little Bear.

432
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,239
Doll,

433
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,920
will you dance with Little Bear?

434
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:00,520
Tang Xin,

435
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,839
I'm going to say something.

436
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,479
Please keep it in mind.

437
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,199
Little Bear

438
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:12,160
likes the Doll

439
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,400
and then he dances with her.

440
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,959
It's not for the pheromone.

441
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,920
But Little Bear is stupid.

442
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,560
He thought

443
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,959
he was influenced by the pheromone.

444
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,319
But actually, he fell in love with her

445
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,719
long ago.

446
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,760
So, let me dance with you.

447
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,680
No matter how long you want it,

448
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,880
I'll dance with you.

449
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,000
Shen Qingyuan,

450
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,920
take off the costume.

451
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,800
It must be stuffy.

452
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,760
You no longer stammer?

453
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:48,920
Maybe one day,

454
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,800
when you reconfirm
his feelings for you again,

455
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,920
your stammering problem

456
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,640
will be truly solved.

457
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,640
So, you don't stammer

458
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,520
because you're nervous to see me,

459
00:20:59,359 --> 00:20:59,920
but because

460
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
I haven't confessed

461
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,760
my love to you.

462
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,479
That's not true.

463
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,599
I don't know why,

464
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,880
but in my mind

465
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,319
was the scene
where you were in the costume.

466
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,119
The candy is nearly melting.

467
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:17,920
Taste it.

468
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,800
Shen Qingyuan.

469
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,079
This is the good luck

470
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,359
that belongs to me.

471
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,160
I'm going to give it to you.

472
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,160
Beside you

473
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
are two gods of luck.

474
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:46,520
So, in case of any problem,

475
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,319
don't be scared.

476
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:49,319
I'll be there for you.

477
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,400
You've made progress, Doll.

478
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,119
You didn't push me away.

479
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,239
We'll always be together, right?

480
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,920
Shen Qingyuan,

481
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:50,079
I'm sorry.

482
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,359
I...

483
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,520
It doesn't matter.

484
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,800
There will be ample time.

485
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,560
(Qianyang 26)

486
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,800
Morning, guys.

487
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,160
- Morning.
- Morning.

488
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:24,359
Tang Liqi. Tang Liqi, here.

489
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,640
Candy.

490
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,319
- Why?
- Candy.

491
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,880
Thank you.

492
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,599
Share them with others.

493
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,199
Here.

494
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,000
Lizi.

495
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,959
Good morning, Tang Xin.

496
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,280
Here it is.

497
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,640
All right. Thank you.

498
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,079
Candy.

499
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,199
- Here.
- Thank you.

500
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,359
Morning.

501
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,119
Good morning.

502
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:52,839
Morning.

503
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,080
("All-round" toothbrush)
(Cleaner and softer)

504
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:02,840
(Teeth whitening and fresh breath)
(Cool type for sweethearts)

505
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:07,000
Isn't it the electric toothbrush

506
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,199
that is very popular

507
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,599
with couples?

508
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,119
It's said to be pretty and practical.

509
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:13,040
Tang Xin,

510
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,280
what happened?

511
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,400
Looks like you've got a boyfriend.

512
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,119
I'm so jealous.

513
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,560
I also expect someone

514
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,640
to buy me an electric toothbrush.

515
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,599
Even thinking of it feels sweet.

516
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,479
His confession to you in public

517
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,920
was passionate enough.

518
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,119
So,

519
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,400
what did Shen Qingyuan do again?

520
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,439
Mr. Zhou.

521
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:45,359
We talked about it.

522
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,959
The partnership of Shen and Du

523
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,319
has finally drawn some attention

524
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,439
on the Internet.

525
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:50,920
When people are paying attention

526
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,680
to Rainbow Bear...

527
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,959
When I'm away these days,

528
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,520
take care of the case

529
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,239
and advance it.

530
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,839
Okay.

531
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:58,640
What's more...

532
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,319
The rap thing.

533
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,160
Isn't it great?

534
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:02,359
Think more carefully about it.

535
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:02,920
Mr. Zhou,

536
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,359
I no longer stammer.

537
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,719
I'll work hard, too.

538
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:07,560
Don't let me do the rap livestream,

539
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,280
will you?

540
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,439
Come on.

541
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,920
You're still not career-minded enough.

542
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,040
The candy tastes good.

543
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,680
Do you have more?

544
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,000
I'll put some in your office later.

545
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,160
It's enough.

546
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,119
Leave them to me.

547
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,239
We'll be there for only two days.

548
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,959
Why do you bring so many things?

549
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,400
What if I'll stay for a long time?

550
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,959
You don't care, anyway.

551
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,040
Just go.

552
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,040
You know...

553
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,359
We're going back

554
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,280
to pretend to be a loving couple.

555
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:13,839
We can't let others see

556
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,760
that you don't even want

557
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,880
to sit beside me.

558
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,359
No one

559
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,400
will care about that,

560
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,439
but you.

561
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,239
Go.

562
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:46,000
Here we go.

563
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,199
Tang Xin, we're leaving.

564
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,439
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

565
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,439
Bye-bye.

566
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,680
Okay. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

567
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,119
Bye-bye.

568
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:13,920
Shooting is an event

569
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,839
that requests a peaceful mind.

570
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,680
If we force them

571
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,640
to be partners

572
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,280
only for business,

573
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,719
isn't it inappropriate?

574
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,439
Besides, they still

575
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:27,040
don't get along very well.

576
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,400
I don't know what the problem is.

577
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,599
Why do I keep staring at him?

578
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,600
(Tang Liqi)

579
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:46,959
Tang Xin,

580
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,560
cherish your boyfriend.

581
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:49,880
He's the captain

582
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,199
of Haiya Shooting Team.

583
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:51,839
In my eyes,

584
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,640
he's the best player
for the Olympic Games.

585
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,359
Don't be his burden.

586
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,000
You're back so early today.

587
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,199
It feels weird.

588
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,119
We've been living together.

589
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,560
Why am I still so nervous?

590
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:36,439
What are you going to do?

591
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,640
As for the relationship,

592
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,520
I have no practical experience.

593
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,599
But I have

594
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,119
enough theoretical knowledge

595
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,359
to give you some advice.

596
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,319
What are you doing?

597
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:49,160
Nothing.

598
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,000
I'll go put my bag down.

Not yet.

00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,920
Why are you so good at cooking?

629
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,560
Dishes in the foreign country taste bad.

630
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,359
Then I learned to cook.

631
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:53,839
After I became an athlete,

632
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,640
I couldn't eat dishes

633
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,680
in the restaurants.

634
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,359
I get it.

635
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,040
Shen Qingyuan,

636
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,880
you joined the shooting team
later than other members.

637
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,199
But why are you the captain?

638
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,359
I shoot very well.

639
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,719
Then you can be the captain?

640
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,839
I also

641
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,520
look handsome.

642
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,000
I didn't know

643
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,079
you could be so narcissistic.

644
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,199
Get ready for dinner.

645
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,479
It's a little bit hot.

646
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,040
Leave it to me.

647
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,520
Get the dishes out.

648
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:37,959
Here.

649
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,280
Tang Xin,

650
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,160
shall we post

651
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,079
in the Moments

652
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,119
and announce it?

653
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,400
Announce what?

654
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,280
Our relationship.

655
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,280
According to Jiang Yitian,

656
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,599
girls love to do that.

657
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,239
Or shall we use
the couple profile photos?

658
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,439
You even know that?

659
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,280
Shall I post something, too?

660
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,199
Young men also love that, I guess.

661
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,800
What shall I post?

662
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,160
Just post

663
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,400
"Shen Qingyuan is my boyfriend."

664
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,439
So straightforward?

665
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,920
Or just post

666
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,520
"I'm Shen Qingyuan's girlfriend."

667
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,800
Why don't I

668
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,239
capture a screenshot
of your WeChat page

669
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:23,920
and fill it

670
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,400
with marks of my name?

671
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,079
What do you think?

672
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,760
Good idea.

673
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:29,959
What are you doing?

674
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,560
(Shen Qingyuan, Tag: Friend at work)

675
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,000
Isn't it the wrong tag

676
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,239
for me?

677
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,000
(Boyfriend)

678
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,760
(Shen Qingyuan, Tag: Boyfriend)

679
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,320
(Shen Qingyuan, Tag: Boyfriend)

680
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,800
You did a little change on the tag.

681
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,439
But it looks weird.

682
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,839
You'll get used to it soon.

683
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,479
Today's topic is

684
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,560
the duty of the captain.

685
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,600
(The duty of the captain)

686
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,680
Shen Qingyuan,

687
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,439
what's the duty of the captain?

688
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,280
A captain supervises the team members

689
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,359
to complete the missions

690
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,119
assigned by the coach.

691
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,160
How?

692
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:21,920
By calling the roll.

693
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,319
And then?

694
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:26,439
What else?

695
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,800
Let me put it this way.

696
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,479
If some members

697
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:31,680
complete the missions

698
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:32,760
but still fail

699
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,640
to make any progress.

700
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,079
What's the point

701
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,119
of being the captain?

702
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,680
Are you referring to Jiang Yitian?

703
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,479
Take him as an example.

704
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,280
He's careless personally

705
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,920
and he doesn't want progress.

706
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,920
Then he's in more need

707
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,119
of your help.

708
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,359
Why does the coach

709
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:51,119
set goals for the team?

710
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,000
He wants the team

711
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,239
to make progress.

712
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,640
What is

713
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,920
your practical significance

714
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,800
as the captain?

715
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,920
The captain

716
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,239
should supervise his team members

717
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,280
to make progress.

718
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:05,640
The last point...

719
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,160
Why is this

720
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,159
a course of human communication?

721
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:11,040
Because if someone can't
fulfill his duty

722
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
when he holds an office,

723
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,959
others won't recognize him.

724
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:14,800
Didn't we agree

725
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,719
to help the team members
stick together

726
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,679
and be happy?

727
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,239
Let's help the weakest members

728
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,520
to be acknowledged.

729
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,800
Go for it, Shen Qingyuan.

730
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,040
After a man gets in a relationship

731
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,879
with a girl,

732
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,040
he has to accept orders

733
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,320
from her wholeheartedly.

734
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,679
But what's the difference

735
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,919
from being an employee?

736
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,439
What's the difference?

737
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,239
Your girlfriend will reward you.

738
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,760
A fist bump can't make me go for it.

739
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:51,120
What else do you want, then?

740
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,560
Do you really not know?

741
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,120
Do you get it now?

742
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,280
I'll go wash the dishes.

743
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:42,679
Coach,

744
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,280
you asked to see me?

745
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,840
Have a seat.

746
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,600
Shen,

747
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
the winter training is coming.

748
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,919
Before that,

749
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,760
there's a unified 10K running test.

750
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,080
It's the weak event of our team.

751
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,199
So recently,

752
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,959
I want to enhance physical training

753
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,439
and strengthen the disciplines.

754
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,639
You and Tang Xin...

755
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,199
Coach,

756
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:05,439
nothing will

757
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,800
influence my shooting state.

758
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:08,760
And I promise you.

759
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,360
This time, I'll supervise

760
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,639
and make sure
the whole team will be qualified.

761
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,800
In this case,

762
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
I'll wait and see.

763
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,280
Make arrangements for this afternoon.

764
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,040
Okay.

765
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,600
Go ahead.

766
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,399
I've been exhausted these days.

767
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,320
I've got a backache.

768
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,080
You know what?

769
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,800
Today,

770
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,919
Captain talked to me.

771
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:33,719
Seriously?

772
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,800
Very impressive.

773
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,520
Congratulations.

774
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,120
Yeah.

775
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,639
I don't know

776
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,840
what was wrong with him.

777
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,600
When he saw me,

778
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
he greeted me naturally.

779
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:42,959
Do you really need

780
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,120
to be so overwhelmed?

781
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,360
Anyway,

782
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,600
shooting is a single-person event.

783
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,840
You're competitors to each other, right?

784
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,080
You're wrong.

785
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,080
Whether we can shoot well

786
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,879
depends on our capability.

787
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,320
But the team atmosphere

788
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,120
mostly depends

789
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:58,120
on our captain.

790
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,800
That's right.

791
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,719
Everybody wants a relaxing atmosphere.

792
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,000
Now you know

793
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,199
why you can't make progress, right?

794
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:13,879
Get in the gym.

795
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,360
I have something to announce.

796
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,800
What? What?

797
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:24,560
Later,

798
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,840
I'll lead you

799
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,719
to practice 10K running.

800
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,600
It can't be true, Captain.

801
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:30,600
Captain,

802
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,159
if I complete 10,000 meters,

803
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:34,600
I can't raise the pistol for three days.

804
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:35,399
Yeah.

805
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,679
There's a 8K running test
for the winter training.

806
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:39,479
I'll help you
improve your physical condition.

807
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:41,159
The schedule will be posted later.

808
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,840
But Captain...

809
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,959
- Captain.
- Captain.

810
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,840
No!

811
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:49,120
Jiang,

812
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,360
you're close to Captain.

813
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,479
Go persuade him

814
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:52,959
not to be so serious.

815
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,159
How can I persuade him?

816
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,120
Speaking of shooting,

817
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm a mere replacement.

818
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,280
I don't dare to annoy him.

819
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:00,239
Captain suddenly cares about us.

820
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,479
It's so sweet of him.

821
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:03,600
I don't think I can bear

822
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,520
such thoughtful concern.

823
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,919
Hope we'll have good luck.

824
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,280
Xiaoci,

825
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,600
this is a little present for you.

826
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,280
Thank you for encouraging me like that.

827
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,080
It's so kind of you.

828
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,320
I just hate to see it

829
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,239
when a girl is bullied.

830
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:37,879
It's not that.

831
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,520
We weren't familiar before.

832
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,560
But without hesitation,

833
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,320
you trusted me.

834
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,320
I was very moved.

835
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,560
Don't you fear

836
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:45,760
that I did it deliberately

837
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,719
so that I could get closer to you?

838
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,040
You're not that kind of girl.

839
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:51,879
Now I finally understand

840
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:53,320
why Shen Qingyuan adores you.

841
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,560
Because you're simple.

842
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,040
You can easily be seen through.

843
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,560
Xiaoci.

844
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,600
- I've got one question...
- Tang Xin.

845
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,000
Does this present

846
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,600
mean that you take me

847
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,639
as your friend now?

848
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:08,040
Of course.

849
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,479
Of course I want you to be my friend.

850
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,760
But you're too good for me.

851
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:11,560
I'm afraid you don't want

852
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,439
to be my friend.

853
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Don't feel inferior.

854
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,080
Everyone has

855
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,520
their strengths and weaknesses.

856
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,439
So do I.

857
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,159
Actually I know

858
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,040
what you wanted to ask.
