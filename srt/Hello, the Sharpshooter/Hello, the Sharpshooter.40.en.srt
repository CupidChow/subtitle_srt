Look at Captain. Look.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,399
In the first round of the qualification,

39
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,479
Shen Qingyuan

40
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,240
got 90 in total.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,880
Among 15 players,

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
(No.15 Shen Qingyuan)
he ranks last.

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,679
The number one is

44
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,800
Bachchan.

45
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,960
Has Captain not adjusted

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,199
his state yet?

47
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,960
Please trust Shen Qingyuan.

48
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,919
When using a new gun,

49
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,399
he isn't shooting smoothly yet.

50
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,399
I believe he will shoot

51
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,679
better and better.

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,960
Also, it's just a qualification.

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,119
The scores of the qualification

54
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,399
are not carried forwards to the final.

55
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,279
He must at least progress to the final.

56

Among 15 players,

57
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,440
only the top eight
can progress to the final.

Captain has got hope.

67
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
He's getting

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,679
higher and higher

69
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,279
in the ranking.

You were standing for the livestream.

73
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,480
Are you tired now?

74
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,880
You must be tired.

75
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,359
Some of your teammates

76
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,079
complained to me

77
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,799
that with so little time
for preparation,

78
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,079
you had to do more night training.

79
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,959
Every one of you was kind of exhausted.

80
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,200
Not really.

81
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,320
We practiced long-distance running

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,440
and it helped a lot.

83
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,239
Is Bachchan

84
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,480
a little bit revengeful?

85
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,880
I saw him

86
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,200
glare at you during the qualification.

87
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,440
Should you watch out for him?

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:01,799
You think

89
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,000
he can be my threat?

90
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,279
I can't help noticing him.

91
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,040
Forget about him.

92
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,480
Shall I pound your back

93
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
and squeeze your shoulders?

94
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:13,559
My shoulders are just stiff.

95
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay,

96
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,399
my dear superstar.

97
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:17,760
To make you

98
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,559
shine in the competition,

99
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,920
I'll do my best to serve you.

Harder.

102
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,119
Not that hard.

103
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,920
- Captain.
- Captain.

104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,239
- Captain.
- Captain Shen.

105
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,279
Congratulations.

106
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,720
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

107
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,920
Congratulations, Captain Shen.

108
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,520
- You're awesome.
- Yeah.

109
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:41,880
Wait.

110
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,640
Isn't it too early to celebrate?

111
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,279
This is only the qualification.

112
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,200
Because of his poor performance
in the first round,

113
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,640
he ranks the seventh only, right?

114
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,239
What are you talking about?

115
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,079
However,

116
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,600
we mustn't encourage others

117
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,559
but discourage our own captain.

118
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,320
- Right.
- Okay.

119
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,040
Look.

120
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,839
So many people are cheering for you.

121
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,480
Right?

122
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,519
We have great strength.

123
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,359

124
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,359
you'll win.

125
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,559
- You'll win.
- You'll win, Captain Shen.

126
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,320
- You'll win.
- You'll win.

127
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,119
Come on, Captain Shen.

128
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,440
Well,

129

you're in a good state.

130
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,679
I'll do better.

131
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,480
Don't always think about how to shoot.

132
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,239
Just follow your heart.

133
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,559
It'd be better if you shoot as you wish.

134
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,119
I'll keep it in mind.

135
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,519
Captain, Captain,

136
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,760
I trust you.

137
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,600
You're first struggling

138
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
and then you will soar.

139
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,239
Even thinking of it makes me excited.

140
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,079
By the way, Captain,

141
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,119
I had a dream last night

142
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,040
where you flew up in the sky

143
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:33,839
higher

144
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,760
and higher.

145
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,519
When I got up this morning,

146
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,359
I had my dream explained.

147
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,359
Trust me, Captain Shen.

148
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,640
You'll be the champion.

149

All right.

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,239
Be quiet, you two.

151
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,160
Just be quiet.

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,559
Captain won't find us noisy.

153
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,079
Will you, Captain?

154
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,720
Will you?

155
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
A little bit noisy.

156
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,359

160
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,320
don't you feel

161
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,519
that you don't belong here?

162
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,839
Look at the fangirls behind you.

163

They're watching you.

164

You know what?

165
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,559
The more they look at me,

166
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,519
the better impression

167
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,880
they will have of Xiaoci.

168
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,040
Can it be

169
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,480
your so-called advertising?

170
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,079

Getting jealous?

177
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,119
Tang Xin.

178
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,119
There you are.

179
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:31,679
Xiaoci.

180
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,320
Did he

181
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,519
tease you again?

182
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,679
When he watched the game with me,

183
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:35,799
he kept nagging.

184
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:37,920
He didn't.

185
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,279
I'll get to business.

186
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,560
Come on!

187
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,040
Shen Qingyuan, come on!

188
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,280
- Come on!
- Come on!

189
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,760
- Come on!
- Come on!

190
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:02,920
This is

191
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,200
the final

192
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,959
of Men's 10m Air Pistol.

193
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,279
Who will be the world gun king?

194
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,760
Let's wait and see.

195
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,640
Load.

196
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:20,839
Shoot.

197
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,240
(No.8 Shen Qingyuan)

198
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,159
Is there anything wrong with Bachchan?

199
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,920
(No.7 Shen Qingyuan)

200
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:31,599
No.7 again?

201
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,960
He still has a problem

202
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
with shooting smoothly.

203
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,200
But it doesn't matter.

204
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,640
Tang Xin, think positively.

205
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
Seven is Qingyuan's lucky number.

206
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,679
He has just eliminated

207
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,479
seven players.

208
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
During this round,

209
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,200
he doesn't rank the last.

210
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,960
As long as he isn't out,

211
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,359
he will make it.

212
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,400
Right?

213
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:49,400
Next round of point race.

214
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,280
Hope you won't worry

215
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,320
about Shen Qingyuan.

216
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,520
In the final,

217
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
everybody will be

218
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,919
trying his best.

219
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,799
The first two rounds are point races.

220
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,479
As long as Shen Qingyuan
gets better scores

221
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:09,440
in the second round,

222
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,159
he can improve his ranking.

223
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,000
Plus,

224
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:13,880
I hear

225
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,799
a good performance in the beginning

226
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,719
will not help much.

227
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,520
It may make the player

228
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,239
have fancy ideas

229
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,200
that he'll be the champion.

230
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,200
It's harmful, instead.

231
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,400
I need to test him.

232
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,320
Coach.

233
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,840
I don't know.

234
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,880
Why is the game suspended?

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,799
Mr. Bachchan

236
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,719
asked to suspend the game

237
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,200
and have a temporary doping test

238
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,919
on Shen Qingyuan.

239
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,080
He thinks that Shen Qingyuan

240
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,520
has been way too calm.

241
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
It makes him different

242
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,119
from what he is in the background check.

243
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,200
He was very likely

244
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,239
to have taken dope

245
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,280
during the qualification or the break.

246
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,559
How's that possible?

247
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,479
The game is suspended.

248
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,440
What is Bachchan up to?

249
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,159
- He's got no evidence.
- He sounded so sarcastic.

250
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,719
You two,

251
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,159
take Player No.7
to have the doping test.

252
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,119
Okay.

253
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,559
Hello. Excuse me.

254
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,039
Player No.7,

255
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,280
please go with us.

256
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,760
This way.

257
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,440
What's going on?

258
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,680
This is never allowed.

259
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,800
This is ridiculous!

260
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Aren't they bullying Shen Qingyuan?

261
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,960
(Game is suspended.)

262
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,080
The show is gonna be
much more interesting.

263
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,720
Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.

264
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,520
Why hasn't the result come out yet?

265
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,919
Take it easy, Tang Xin.

266
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,599
It'll come out soon.

267
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,518
(Are you kidding me?
A shooter took dope?)

268
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,160
(Is he going to make his career stink?)

269
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,080
The dope

270
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,239
shooters take

271
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,440
is technically a sedative.

272
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,880
But I'm sure you believe Shen Qingyuan

273
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,400
as far as I do.

274
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,320
Funny.

275
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,479
Qingyuan is such a calm man.

276
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,479
Why does he ever need a sedative?

277
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,000
(Test Report)

278
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,200
There's nothing wrong

279
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,200
with Shen Qingyuan's test.

280
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,000
The game continues.

281
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,919
I knew it.

282
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,039
Shen Qingyuan would never

283
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,039
do such a thing.

284
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,720
- Come on!
- Come on!

285
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,200
Shen Qingyuan.

286
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,840
It's for you.

287
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,719
With my love in it.

288
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,520
How do you know I want this?

289
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,640
I certainly know.

290
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,000
I've got a magical bag.

291
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,159
From now on,

292
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,599
I'll be the one

293
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,760
who gets everything ready.

294
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,920
(Ranking)

295
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,400
He's back in the perfect state.

296
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,000
(Ranking)

297
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,039
I knew it.

298
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,599
Captain will win.

299
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:19,119
Shen Qingyuan's scores

300
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:19,919
lead all the way.

301
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,280
(Shen Qingyuan 10.9)
Looks like the dope case

302
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,479
hasn't disturbed him at all.

303
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,559
Let's get ready

304
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,080
to applaud and cheer for him.

305
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,360
(Ranking)

306
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,000
Stop.

307
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,119
- What is he doing?
- What's going on?

308
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,799
What happened again?

309
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,320
Something's wrong with his pistol?

310
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,840
What's the problem?

311
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,640
Something's wrong with the pistol.

312
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,719
Let me check.

313
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,919
Something's wrong with his last shot.

314
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,840
The referee is inspecting the pistol.

315
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:22,080
If it is an impermissible fault

316
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,719
of the player,

317
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,159
the score won't count.

318
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,119
An impermissible fault

319
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,159
means a problem

320
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,840
that can be controlled by the player.

321
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,840
For example, he didn't flick
the safety catch

322
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,039
or he loaded the wrong bullets.

323
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,320
(Game is suspended.)

324
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,159
In shooting,

325
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,320
not only the mentality and technique
are important,

326
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,960
but also the luck.

327
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,880
As far as I can remember,

328
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,880
Shen Qingyuan is

329
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,320
always lucky.

330
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,119
It's a permissible fault.

331
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,200
He can shoot again
after repairing the pistol.

332
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,959
It's a permissible fault.

333
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,359
He can shoot again

334
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,199
after repairing the pistol.

335
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,719
Miss Livestreamer,

336
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:23,199
do you think

337
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
this accident

338
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,959
will disturb Qingyuan?

339
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,719
He's Shen Qingyuan.

340
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:28,719
He's playing for our nation

341
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,319
and he will do that in the future.

342
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:30,839
He won't

343
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,079
be scared by such a little accident.

344
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,119
You make sense.

345
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,640
The repair work is done.

346
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,719
The game continues.

347
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,119
- I was freaked out.
- I was freaked out.

348
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,480
(Shen Qingyuan 10.9)

349
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,359
- Captain Shen.
- Bravo!

350
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,199
Shen Qingyuan's scores

351
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,040
will not keep you

352
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,319
on tenterhooks.

353
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,160
(Ranking)

354
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,680
A successful shooter may not be famous.

355
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,199
What do you think?

356
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,479
It's now the second round

357
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,560
of the elimination.

358
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,640
(No.6 Shen Qingyuan)
Shen Qingyuan made five shots.

359
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,680
50.2 in total.

360
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:53,959
For the two rounds,

361
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,479
he got 97.8,

362
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,599
ranking sixth.

363
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,359
The gap between him

364
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:58,920
and the fifth player...

365
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:00,880
Luckily,

366
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,319
just 0.2.

367
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,400
He's made progress.

368
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,479
There's still a big gap

369
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,400
between him and the number one.

370
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,199
(No.4 Shen Qingyuan)
Lee Jae In

371
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,839
who used to rank the second

372
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,560
suddenly got 7.6.

373
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,599
He's ranking the fifth, instead.

374
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:31,560
Shen Qingyuan

375
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,079
ranks fourth now.

376
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,199
Come on.

377
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,199
Come on, Captain Shen.

378
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,359
(No.4 Shen Qingyuan)
Lee Jae In

379
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,719
made two fightback shots.

380
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,199
He outstripped Shen Qingyuan again

381
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,040
and ranks second.

382
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,839
Every shot from now on

383
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,439
may be very risky.

384
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:15,319
But I have confidence in Shen Qingyuan.

385
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,680
Look.

386
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,199
Shen Qingyuan is the only one,

387
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:19,920
among the four players,

388
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,119
who doesn't look at the screen.

389
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:21,920
Do you know

390
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
what it means?

391
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,119
Because shooting is just like life.

392
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,439
After all,

393
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,479
every shooter challenges himself.

394
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,600
(No.3 Shen Qingyuan)

395
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:40,359
Shen Qingyuan

396
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,560
outstripped the German player

397
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,719
who ranked the third

398
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,640
with 0.3 more than him

399
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,920
and progressed to the medal round.

400
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:45,479
Now,

401
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,880
he has only 0.2

402
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,439
less than Lee Jae In.

403
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,840
(No.3 Shen Qingyuan)

404
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,599
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

405
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
(No.2 Shen Qingyuan)

406
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,680
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

407
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,800
Lee Jae In won the bronze medal.

408
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,439
Shen Qingyuan and Bachchan

409
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,599
have progressed to the last round.

410
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:30,760
- Come on!
- Come on!

411
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,199
- Come on!
- Come on!

412
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:34,479
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

413
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,520
(No.1 Bachchan 223.1)
(No.2 Shen Qingyuan 221.1)

414
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,199
Bachchan made his second shot,

415
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:14,160
(No.1 Bachchan 234 No.2 Shen Qingyuan 232)
and got 10.9.

416
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:17,359
The gap between them is

417
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,079
two points.

418
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,640
If you ask

419
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,520
whether I'm still confident
in Shen Qingyuan,

420
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,359
my answer will be

421
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,800
yes.

422
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,160
Always yes.

423
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,959
Because the confidence in a player

424
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,439
shouldn't be stuck

425
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:46,479
in only one game,

426
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,439
but in

427
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,839
his longer-term future.

428
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,719
Shen Qingyuan,

429
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,160
you will have

430
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,040
the best future.

431
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,239
He's looking for the best pose.

432
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,280
Actually, I can feel

433
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,280
that Shen Qingyuan is getting used

434
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,239
to his new gun.

435
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,920
(Shen Qingyuan 10.9)

436
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,479
10.9!

437
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,520
Captain Shen!

438
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,239
There's the last shot to make.

439
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,680
Where is the data of my second shot?

440
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,120
(No.1 Bachchan 234)
(No.2 Shen Qingyuan 232)

441
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,959
No data?

442
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,160
Mr. Bachchan asked

443
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,880
why there was no point

444
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,239
for his second shot.

445
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Bachchan made his second shot

446
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,520
at Shen Qingyuan's target.

447
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,400
Sir, you shot his target.

448
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,680
Bachchan made his second shot

449
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,719
at Shen Qingyuan's target.

450
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,599
Maybe we can congratulate...

451
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,200
(Shen Qingyuan 10.9)

452
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,319
Stop.

453
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:27,680
I now declare

454
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,640
the champion of this competition is

455
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,719
Player No.7 Shen Qingyuan!

456
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,560
10.9!

457
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,599
Shen Qingyuan got 10.9!

458
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,280
He didn't

459
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,719
slack off because of the mistake

460
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,520
his rival made.

461
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,119
He made the full shot.

462
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,239
Shen Qingyuan is the champion!

463
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,119
Qingyuan, Qingyuan.

464
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,040
I knew he would win.

465
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,000
Qingyuan won!

466
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:48,800
Captain.

467
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,479
See you around.

468
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,520
- Captain.
- Captain.

469
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,160
I knew you would get back

470
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,880
to your best state.

471
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,040
He was doing better.

472
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,719
Shen Qingyuan.

473
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,800
Shouldn't you say something

474
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,719
to me?

475
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,119
Congratulations, Shen Qingyuan.

476
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,719
- Kiss.
- Kiss.

477
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:17,560
- Kiss. Kiss.
- Kiss. Kiss.

478
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,880
(Hello, The Sharpshooter)

479
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,640
Can it be a message

480
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,560
from Shen Qingyuan?

481
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,520
How do you know?

482
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,839
Good.

483
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,040
In today's show,

484
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,640
we want you

485
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,599
to talk more

486
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,880
about Shen Qingyuan.

487
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,959
For example,

488
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,079
which one of you loved the other first?

489
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,280
Is it okay to tell us?

490
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:46,479
Um...

491
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,199
It doesn't matter.

492
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Don't be afraid of speaking up.

493
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,599
The point is

494
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,520
that Shen Qingyuan and I

495
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,400
have still been arguing about it.

496
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,640
Sometimes he said

497
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,560
he fell in love with me

498
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,599
many years ago.

499
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,319
But sometimes he said

500
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,040
he was attracted

501
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,400
by my pheromone.

502
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:05,400
Sometimes he just denied them.

503
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
He's indeed unreasonable.

504
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,479
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,479
I shouldn't have said that.

506
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,079
I guess

507
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,800
I fell in love with him first.

508
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:17,040
How did you

509
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,319
get to know each other?

510
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,040
It's a long story

511
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,839
to tell.

512
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,959
You're Tang Xin, right?

513
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,599
I'll remember you.

Next,

546
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,800
after the friendly competition,

547
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,119
Shen Qingyuan will face

548
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,040
the more stressful

549
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,239
Olympic selection.

550
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,920
What do you think of it, Miss Tang?

551
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,520
I believe Shen Qingyuan

552
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,280
will be admitted to the Olympic Games.

553
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:58,280
Mr. Zhou,

554
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,880
say something.

555
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,599
Since we focused

556
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,599
on promoting the shooting event,

557
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:06,880
the monthly views of Rui Live

558
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,640
have been over 80 million.

559
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,640
We've had a firm foothold

560
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,920
in short videos and livestream.

561
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,160
I have to stress

562
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:16,400
that we don't

563
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,160
use sports events

564
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,319
as a tool to develop our company.

565
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,199
Instead,

566
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,199
I hope

567
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:22,760
the growing Rui Live

568
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,239
will make more people know

569
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,040
about such a sports event

570
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,199
which is worth paying attention to

571
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,040
and makes us prouder.

572
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:32,000
In 2021,

573
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,400
the Olympic Games will be held.

574
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,040
Hope more people

575
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,280
can watch the moment

576
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,439
when Chinese shooters
get the first gold medal

577
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,760
through Rui Live.

578
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,239
After talking about your career,

579
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,439
can you tell us something

580
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,680
about your personal life?

581
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:52,079
Actually, I just

582
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,359
got divorced.

583
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:55,719
I'm sorry.

584
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,040
It's okay if you don't answer.

585
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,239
It doesn't matter.

586
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,479
I won't avoid

587
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:02,599
sharing with you

588
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,280
my busted relationship.

589
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,319
The relationship is over.

590
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,239
But it may be

591
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:11,160
another kind of new start.

592
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:12,400
What does that mean?

593
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,520
Sorry.

594
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:14,800
I mean

595
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,640
I feel sorry for my last relationship.

596
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:18,439
But I feel lucky, too.

597
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,079
From that relationship,

598
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,160
I learned a lot.

599
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,599
I got to know

600
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:25,439
my shortcomings.

601
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,680
I'm curious

602
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,560
about what kind of relationship

603
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,199
has given you such feelings.

604
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:32,880
Can you tell us about it?

605
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,479
When a man is young,

606
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,359
he usually mixes his career

607
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,280
with his feelings.

608
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:41,599
For example,

609
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,719
when he has a successful career,

610
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,079
he will feel

611
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,560
that the whole world is lovely.

612
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,199
But when he fails,

613
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,079
he will feel

614
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,119
that everyone around him

615
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,719
has betrayed him.

616
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,119
I used

617
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,800
to be

618
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,319
such a childish man.

619
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:07,239
But no one is obligated

620
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,319
to wait until you grow mature.

621
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,599
When I think about it now,

622
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,880
she's right.

623
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,319
When lovers support each other,

624
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
they'll make people jealous.

625
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,199
But to a man

626
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:20,920
who is nearly 40,

627
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:23,599
he should be abandoned once

628
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,000
before he really changes

629
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,479
and grows mature.

630
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,880
So, I'd like to thank her.

631
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,880
I hope she'll have
more and better choices

632
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,599
in her future life.

633
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,599
Looks like you've let go of her.

634
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,640
Of course.

635
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,119
If I didn't let go of her,

636
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,319
how could I chase her again?

637
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,920
I believe I'll still be the leading role

638
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,920
in my next relationship

639
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,719
and we will have a happy ending.

640
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,160
(Will you and I
have a different ending?)

641
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,560
(Hello, The Sharpshooter)

642
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Why hasn't he come back yet?

643
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
I wonder if he's admitted.

644
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,520
Hope he's super lucky for that.

645
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,479
Miss Livestreamer,

646
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
stop hanging around.

647
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,640
Seriously?

648
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,520
Look at me.

649
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:02,599
I'm waiting for Xiaoci, too.

650
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,119
But am I nervous? See?

651
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:07,880
You know what?

652
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,919
Don't call me at this moment!

653
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:09,679
Do you get it?

654
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,679
Mr. Du,

655
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
are you sure you're not nervous?

656
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,120
Don't worry, Tang Xin.

657
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,439
Qingyuan is in a good state now.

658
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
And it's the point system.

659
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,639
There can't be any problem.

660
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,919
Right. I'm not nervous.

661
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,399
Shen Qingyuan will make it.

662
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,320
Is that them?

663
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,639
At last, they're back.

664
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:27,760
Wait.

665
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,959
Why do they look

666
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,120
so depressed?

667
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,239
Oh, no.

668
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,360
Did they fail to be chosen?

669
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,679
I don't think so.

670
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:43,399
It's okay, Shen Qingyuan.

671
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,679
Try harder next year.

672
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,520
No Olympic Games next year.

673
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:48,600
Look.

674
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,919
I don't even know how to make you happy.

675
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:51,600
However,

676
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,679
I don't like to wait

677
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,399
either for you or the Olympic Games.

678
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,479
What's wrong with you?

679
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,399
What happened?

680
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Qingyuan has been chosen.

681
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,040
Why do you look so sad?

682
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
- He's chosen?
- He's chosen!

683
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,760
I thought you weren't chosen.

684
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,239
I didn't say that.

685
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,080
You just imagined.

686
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,760
Xiaoci.

687
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,399
What about you, Xiaoci?

688
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,000
It doesn't matter.

689
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,159
You'll get more chances,

690
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:16,679
Xiaoci.

691
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,040
- Cheer up. Cheer up.
- Cheer up. Cheer up.

692
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
Cheer up. Cheer up.

693
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,000
- Cheer up.
- Cheer up.

694
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:23,639
Cheer up.

695
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:26,879
- Cheer up.
- Cheer up.

696
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,760
Let me take you somewhere.

697
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:42,239
Take it easy, Xiaoci.

698
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
When you can't be the Olympic champion,

699
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,439
you can at least be
the general manager's wife

700
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:46,479
for a few years first.

701
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:48,760
You can't wait, I guess.

702
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,120
That's right.

703
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,760
I can't wait.

704
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,679
We'll be engaged, get married,

705
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,760
have a baby, and do many other things.

706
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,239
Time to say "I do" first.

707
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,760
Who will say that?

708
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,399
You must say yes.

709
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,479
I kissed you, anyway.

710
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,120
People are watching.

711
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,960
(Yacht Warehouse)

712
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:23,239
Why did you take me here?

713
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:26,439
Tang Xin,

714
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,239
let's take step by step.

715
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,439
What's this step, then?

716
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,600
It's the step in my dream.

717
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,600
And it's the step

718
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,919
I should have taken long ago.

719
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:42,879
You said

720
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,479
you fell in love with me first.

721
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,360
I doubted it.

722
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,760
Now, I can responsibly

723
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,239
tell you

724
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:52,919
that I fell in love with you first.

725
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,840
Have you done your homework?

726
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,399
No.

727
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,280
What about you?

728
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,080
I have.

729
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,120
I haven't.

730
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,760
Do it yourself.

731
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
You don't know
how to solve that problem?

732
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,239
How does it look?

733
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,239
Does it look good?

734
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,239
Does it?

735
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:10,639
Yes.

736
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,199
It's too expensive. I can't afford it.

737
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:13,959
Oh, my god. It's so expensive.

738
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,520
Tang Xin, you love it?

739
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,239
Let time keep the beautiful things

740
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:27,159
and let beautiful things fill our lives.

741
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,040
Class begins.

742
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,320
Get back to your seats.

743
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,080
Hello, sir.

744
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,000
Would you like a watch?

745
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,959
I want a silver pocket watch

746
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,239
with pattern.

747
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:47,760
Sir,

748
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,679
here are two pocket watches.

749
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,840
Which one do you prefer?

750
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,159
This one.

751
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,239
Okay.

752
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,520
This one is

753
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,120
a pocket watch

754
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,159
of the limited edition.

755
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,360
So, it's a little bit expensive.

756
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:13,159
Is it a present for a girl?

757
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,919
If you really like her,

758
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,239
you can buy it

759
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:20,080
in another way.

760
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,239
We're recruiting part-time workers.

761
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,399
Would you like to be one?

762
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,560
Okay.

763
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,199
Shen Qingyuan,

764
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:39,760
the shopkeeper

765
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,719
asked me to give this to you.

766
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,639
The advance payment

767
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,520
has been taken

768
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,120
from your pay.

769
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:48,760
The balance

770
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,000
has also been deducted

771
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,159
as a bonus for your recent work.

772
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,159
The pocket money is yours now.

773
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,239
Thank you.

774
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:56,959
The girl you like

775
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:57,959
must be very happy.

776
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,120
Wish you a good relationship!

777
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,399
Can the fireworks

778
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:10,760
be your extra surprise for me?

779
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,360
Guess.

780
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,439
I didn't figure out

781
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,679
why I had kept

782
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,479
this pocket watch.

783
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,719
Not until the day
I got back my memories

784
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:53,479
did I know

785
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,520
that it was a love present

786
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,919
I prepared for you that year.

787
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,040

I used to think you were dazzling.

798
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,320
The close I got to you,

799

the more disturbed I felt.
