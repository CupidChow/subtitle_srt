=Hello, The Sharpshooter=

=Episode 9=

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,559
I mean, I thought

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,599
you never care about others

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,599
and that you'd kick away

38
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,800
whoever disturbs you.

39
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,040
So you slapped the mosquitoes

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,319
around me on purpose?

41
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,800
It smells so good.

42
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:59,120
Did you cook those dishes for me?

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,720
Thank you,

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,319
Shen Qingyuan.

45
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,520
A sudden bombing?

46
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,039
Even the competitions
allow trial fire.

47
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,240
Tang Xin.

48
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,360
Just... Just go take your shower.

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,839
Why are you staring at me?

50
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,479
I...

51
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,679
He barely hesitates.

52
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,440
Could it be...?

53
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,080
Yeah.

54
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,279
I can take the opportunity

55
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,160
to spur him a little,

56
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,039
so his weak points are exposed.

57
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,639
If you keep staring at me like this,

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,119
you'll lose more games.

59
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,360
Yes.

60
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,199
I took that bad shot

61
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,880
because I didn't see you.

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,000
Why did I bring this up?

63
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,559
What to do?

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,320
It's so hard to dislike him.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,759
Instead, I feel like...

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,440
I once

67
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,759
saw him as my totem.

68
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,440
However, now,

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,639
the totem has perished.

70
00:03:59,119 --> 00:03:59,759
No.

71
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,039
If it continues,

72
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,880
there will be side effects.

73
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,520
The internal 2v2 match

74
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,600
will be three days later.

75
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,600
You get yourself ready
for the livestreaming.

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,959
No. I won't have time.

77
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,040
Dr. Ding,

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,959
can you

79
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,320
try another treatment plan on me?

80
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,559
Something faster.

81
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,160
I'll see you tomorrow.

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,679
I think he's asleep.

83
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,920
He's still awake.

84
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,200
Would he think

85
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,640
I'm doing something weird?

86
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:44,880
What if

87
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,079
he keeps asking me questions?

88
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,239
Shen Qingyuan,

89
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,880
I have a request for you.

90
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,480
Can we please

91
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,760
talk a little less?

92
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,559
If you really

93
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,880
need something,

94
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,559
please send me
a WeChat message, okay?

95
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:14,760
Postscript.

96
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,799
My WeChat account is

97
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,839
candy0122.

98
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,600
I followed Jiang Yitian's advice,

99
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,279
and as expected, things have gone
in the opposite direction.

100
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:50,799
Add me.

101
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,200
Add me now.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,399
He's against it?

103
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,519
But come to think of it,

104
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:03,959
I didn't really see him

105
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,559
use a cellphone.

106
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,480
He...

107
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,679
He never used one.

108
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,359
He even checks the time

109
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,040
the old-fashion way.

110
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,959
What do I do now?

111
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,880
A modern person

112
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,640
who doesn't have a cellphone?

113
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,559
It's absurd.

114
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,839
But if he doesn't have a cellphone,

115
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,720
he'll come over and let me know.

116
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,559
No, no.

117
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,200
I'm sure he has one.

118
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,959
Or else, how does
his coach contact him?

119
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,399
Can we please

120
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,320
talk a little less?

121
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,400
I'd rather he doesn't come

122
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,080
in case I stutter again.

123
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,760
Candy.

124
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,719
0122.

125
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,799
Look, Captain came so early.

126
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,599
So diligent.

127
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,799
It's still early.

128
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,719
Captain is already here.

129
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,359
Look. Look.
He's been training for a while.

130
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,719
- Morning, Captain.
- Morning, Captain.

131
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,559
Morning.

132
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,559
He's almost emptied two boxes.

133
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,400
You've been here

134
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
for about an hour, right?

135
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:40,799
I mean, he's

136
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,799
living outside the dorm.

137
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,799
Listen to me.

138
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,080
You know what?

139
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,880
Captain must have been enhanced

140
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,479
by the power of love.

141
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,000
Think about it.

142
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:49,359
He's a single-minded guy.

143
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,320
He will present his
best performance

144
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,440
and state

145
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,640
to his love.

146
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,479
Love?

147
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,400
Training is the most
important thing.

148
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,039
What's with the dark circles?

149
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,320
Dark circles?

150
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,200
Captain?

151
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,119
What?

152
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:06,840
Captain,

153
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,919
last night, you...

154
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,280
What are you trying to say?

155
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,039
You were with Miss Tang?

156
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,320
Ca-Captain?

157
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:24,559
Hey, Captain.

158
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,520
Captain.

159
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,239
What?

160
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,760
My advice worked,

161
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,840
didn't it?

162
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,359
Before we get to that.

163
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,760
How do I add someone on WeChat?

164
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,559
WeChat?

165
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,359
Just scan someone's QR code

166
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,599
or add the person's WeChat account.

167
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,880
This.

168
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,479
What?

169
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,119
I'll help with it.

170
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,400
I can't believe you don't know this.

171
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:51,799
I say, Captain,

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,039
you're like an old man

173
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,440
getting confused about smart phones.

174
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
You don't have WeChat on your phone?

175
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,919
Isn't making phone calls

176
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,679
the purpose of a cellphone?

177
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,919
So can WeChat.

178
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,080
And WeChat

179
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,559
even allows you to make video calls.

180
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,280
Video calls?

181
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,119
You see? Even Coach Zhang has it.

182
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,119
We've got a group, too.

183
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:05,679
Look.

184
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:11,440
How about I pull you into the group?

185
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,039
Okay. Good to know.

186
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,000
Look.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,760
You add someone

188
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,599
by hitting the plus button
on the top right corner,

189
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,719
then you add a friend

190
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,440
by typing

191
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,960
the WeChat account
or phone number in it.

192
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,559
Oh.

193
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,280
Who is it that you are going to add?

194
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,359
I can help you do it.

195
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,719
Wait.

196
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,000
If someone asks you

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,359
to add her,

198
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,679
and

199
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,119
requests you to talk less.

200
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,239
What does it mean?

201
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,919
Someone asks you to add her

202
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,000
but talk less?

203
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,919
WeChat is a communication tool,

204
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,520
you know.

205
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,320
If the person wants to communicate
with you

206
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,760
without talking too much,

207
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,119
maybe she doesn't want to see your face.

208
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,559
Unlikely. Who wouldn't like
to see your face?

209
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,119
Or maybe it's her way

210
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,359
to euphemistically express

211
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,280
the wish to keep a distance from you.

212
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,080
But it's unlikely, too.

213
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,840
The first scenario
is more unlikely, though.

214
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,200
Captain.

215
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,320
Please let me add your WeChat.

216
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,359
So I can give you more advice.

217
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,080
Please?

218
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,239
More advice?

219
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,080
Listen to me.

220
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,840
I don't want any more advice from you.

221
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,599
Please give me another chance.

222
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,280
I'll give my best shot.

223
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,599
To honor my reputation
as Wikipedia about girls

224
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,119
and Captain's good buddy.

225
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,119
Please give me some credit.

226
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,520
Morning, everybody.

227
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,679
- Morning, Tang Xin.
- Morning, Tang Xin.

228
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,479
- Morning, Tang Xin.
- Morning.

229
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,039
Morning.

230
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,039
Morning, Tang Xin.

231
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,679
Morning.

232
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:32,640
Morning.

233
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,239
Tang Xin.

234
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Am I late again?

235
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,000
No.

236
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,239
Please give me a minute.

237
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,760
Let me introduce

238
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,919
our new colleagues.

239
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,080
Ai.

240
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,559
She'll be in charge
of content livestreaming.

241
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,280
She might be new,

242
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,719
but she's actually quite experienced.

243
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,239
I'm new to the company.

244
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,440
I hope you kindly

245
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,359
help me as much as you can.

246
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,119
Welcome.

247
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,840
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

248
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,200
Why did the top livestreamer
of Star Show

249
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,679
come to join us?

250
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,479
Please pay attention

251
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,520
to the hot topics online.

252
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,119
She used to be a live

253
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,239
singer and dancer.

254
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,520
She was super hot.

255
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,440
Tang Liqi.

256
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,880
A social-recruited intern.

257
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,880
He's our front-end developer.

258
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,520
If you need any help

259
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,840
with your computer,

260
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,320
you can go ahead and ask him.

261
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,880
Looking forward to working with you.

262
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,440
Thank you.

263
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,119
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

264
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,760
Another Tang?

265
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,760
And he kind of looks like you.

266
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,080
By the way.

267
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,359
Tang Liqi

268
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,719
is Tang Xin's little brother.

269
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,440
Yeah. Yeah.

270
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,679
Tang Xin is my sister.

271
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,559
You've got a little brother?

272
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,479
Wonderful, Tang Xin.

273
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,599
Two talented young people.

274
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,080
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

275
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
One is an excellent commentator.

276
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,760
The other is a computer genius.

277
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,119
Talented youths.

278
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,119
Keep your chin up.

279
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,359
All right, everybody, get back to work.

280
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,559
What are you doing here?

281
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,239
Bye.

282
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:14,880
Tang Xin.

283
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,640
I watched your livestream before.

284
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,520
Very professional.

285
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,479
Thank you.

286
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,880
This

287
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,960
is your desk.

288
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,599
Thank you.

289
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:23,559
- Hello.
- Hello.

290
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,640
Mr. Zhou,

291
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,599
may Miss Tang be my coach?

292
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,640
And I'd also like

293
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,440
to get myself settled.

294
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:29,239
Okay.

295
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,799
Very eager on the first day.

296
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,719
Tang Xin,

297
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,239
please take her to the shooting team,

298
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,400
and share the essentials
about sports livestreaming

299
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,719
with her.

300
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,119
Thank you.

301
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,039
Tang Xin.

302
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,039
Okay.

303
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,119
I made an appointment with Dr. Ding.

304
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:45,840
What now?

305
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,039
All right.

306
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,760
You can both

307
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,679
learn from each other.

308
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,880
Got it?

309
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:52,960
Get to work.

310
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,400
Sure, Mr. Zhou.

311
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:57,840
Ai.

312
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,239
I'll take you to your desk.

313
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,080
Come on.

314
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,479
Tang Liqi.

315
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,479
It doesn't feel right.

316
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,200
Wait a sec.

317
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,679
Much better.

318
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:35,799
Hi.

319
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,599
How are you?

320
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,119
So? Are you charmed?

321
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,080
Would it

322
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:43,320
work?

323
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,400
I swear it will.

324
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:46,599
It's the ace shot in wooing

325
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,679
called wall bam.

326
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
The key

327
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,119
is your deadly eyes.

328
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,520
Lock your eyes with hers.

329
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,239
Keep your arms steady.

330
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,840
Hold your body, lean in slowly.

331
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,799
Speak in an overbearing voice

332
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,439
that makes you

333
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,400
unquestionable.

334
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:06,800
These are

335
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
the essence

336
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,920
of my love book.

337
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,000
It always works.

338
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,280
You tried?

339
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,400
No.

340
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,040
I learned it from romance dramas

341
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,640
and...

342
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,839
Anyway, it will work.

343
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,920
It is true.

344
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,400
But one more thing.

345
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,000
When you do this,

346
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
you speak less.

347
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Keep a cool face.

348
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,199
But these are

349
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,479
your inborn characteristics.

350
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,839
- The eyes.
- Yes, deadly eyes.

351
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,560
Deadly.

352
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,400
Lock your eyes with hers.

353
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,880
Steady arms.

354
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,920
Hold your body.

355
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:38,560
Lean in slowly.

356
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,599
Unquestionable voice.

357
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,199
Um...

358
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,000
Captain is pretty studious.

359
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,359
Actually,

360
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,000
I need to learn more details.

361
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,079
Just in case.

362
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,280
Xin.

363
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,000
The company is so generous.

364
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,239
Free snacks at work.

365
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,920
Your favorite crunchy winter jujube.

366
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,520
Lie low, will you?
You just got hired.

367
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,599
Boy,

368
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,160
you really have grown.

369
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,319
I'm alright.

370
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,479
Only 6-foot tall.

371
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,959
Less than 1 foot taller than you.

372
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,520
Tell me.

373
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,520
What is it about?

374
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:20,760
Nothing.

375
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,479
Just the task assigned by my college.

376
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,599
I tried several companies

377
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,880
and this one gave me the best offer.

378
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:25,959
So here I am.

379
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,680
You came to work as an intern

380
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,199
in a city so far from home

381
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:30,680
just because of this?

382
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,719
I want the truth.

383
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,160
Mom is worried about you.

384
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,199
How are our parents?

385
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,400
Pretty good.

386
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
They're both in good health.

387
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,560
Do you have

388
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,599
a place to live?

389
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,199
Do you have an empty bed for me?

390
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,400
No.

391
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:51,719
Don't worry, Xin.

392
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,599
I won't be a liability.

393
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,880
I've got a place to live.

394
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,359
Xin,

395
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,959
Mom asked me to give you something.

396
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,959
Send me your address,

397
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:00,800
and I'll mail the stuff to you.

398
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:02,839
Tang Liqi.

399
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:03,959
This is your name card.

400
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,239
Mine?

401
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,400
Thank you. Thank you.

402
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,239
Thank you.

403
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:08,439
Xin, look.

404
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,800
We are now co-workers.

405
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,520
Handsome, right?

406
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,439
Focus on work.

407
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,560
Am I handsome or not?

408
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,920
Just work hard.

409
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,239
No more slacking off. Go to work.

410
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,319
Shoo!

411
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,079
Good job to myself.

412
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,560
Another expansion of the team.

413
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:26,079
Zhou Zuguang,

414
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,319
keep going!

415
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:38,719
In your heart,

416
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,599
only work

417
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,160
and your ambition matter, right?

418
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,640
Because right now,

419
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,599
this is all I have got.

420
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,560
So many famous athletes.

421
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,719
Isn't she the famous

422
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,359
Olympic champion?

423
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,920
She was on this team before?

424
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:08,719
Yes.

425
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,199
Haiya Shooting Team

426
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,560
isn't one of those
regular university teams.

427
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:12,439
Many athletes

428
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,359
return to the university

429
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,760
to study while continue being an athlete

430
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,040
after becoming champions.

431
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,640
After all the champions

432
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,800
graduate from the university,

433
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,040
who will be the best on the team?

434
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,199
(Honorary Certificate)
Shen Qingyuan?

435
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,719
But he's only an air pistol shooter.

436
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,359
There are also air rifle shooters

437
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,640
on the team.

438
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,160
Let's go.

439
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,040
Hi.

440
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,239
Tang Xin.

441
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,400
Hi.

442
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,680
Eyes, arms,

443
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,839
and the voice.

444
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,040
Tang Xin,

445
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,400
this is Shen Qingyuan, right?

446
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,199
Yes.

447
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,839
He's the main role

448
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,560
in our livestream.

449
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,199
You have a chat.

450
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,520
Make your acquaintance.

451
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,359
I've got other stuff to do.
See you later.

452
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,479
Hello, Shen Qingyuan.

453
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,560
I'm Ai.

454
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,680
I'm Tang Xin's co-worker.

455
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,760
(Mental Health)

456
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:30,479
Come in.

457
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,119
Dr. Ding.

458
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:33,439
Come on in.

459
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:36,040
Sit down.

460
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,439
Dr. Ding.

461
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,880
Finding his weak point

462
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,400
doesn't seem a good way.

463
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,479
What's the matter?

464
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,199
I tried my best.

465
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:47,439
But Shen Qingyuan is perfect

466
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,839
on every aspect.

467
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:49,839
He gave me no chance

468
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,199
to find his weak point.

469
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,959
Soon,

470
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,280
I'll be fired.

471
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,079
Stuttering

472
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,000
is a physiological disease

473
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,839
caused by the problems

474
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,359
in the central nervous system.

475
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,640
Your case

476
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,079
is due to mental stress.

477
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,199
Just calm your mind,

478
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:08,839
and you'll soon be cured.

479
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,959
Give yourself a little more time.

480
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:13,680
Haste makes waste.

481
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,239
But

482
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,479
Mr. Zhou won't give me more time.

483
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,680
Two days later,

484
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,280
I'll be the commentator
of their internal match.

485
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,839
If I can't even handle this,

486
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,479
my career will be over.

487
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,040
So how about

488
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,719
we make sure you handle this.

489
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,040
Can you sing?

490
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,760
A stutterer doesn't stutter

491
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,719
when singing.

492
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,079
So

493
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:37,640
if you can't

494
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,839
face Shen Qingyuan calmly,

495
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,359
why don't you

496
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,280
try singing?

497
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:44,000
Sing in front of Shen Qingyuan?

498
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,079
That would be awkward.

499
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
There are ways that are not awkward.

500
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:50,479
For example...

501
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,800
Captain Shen,

502
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,040
can we have a chat?

503
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,560
If I'm disturbing you,

504
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,880
I can sit there and wait.

505
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:56,839
Sorry, we can't.

506
00:22:58,239 --> 00:22:59,880
Captain Shen, are you hungry?

507
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,959
I've got snacks.

508
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:01,560
No.

509
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,119
You cannot cross this line.

510
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,239
Sorry.

511
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,520
That's too bad.

512
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,319
I got these from the staff lounge.

513
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,400
It is said

514
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,040
this is Tang Xin's favorite snack,
the crunchy winter jujube.

515
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,400
How smart of me.

516
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,239
I just joined the company,

517
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,119
and I've already known

518
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,400
what her favorite snack is.

519
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,000
Athletes don't have snacks.

520
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,599
What do you have, then?

521
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,760
Pressure.

522
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,319
Hi, guys.

523
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:39,680
I'm Ai.

524
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Tang Xin's colleague.

525
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,719
Hi, Miss Ia.

526
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,079
Oh, sorry.

527
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,119
Hi, Miss Ai.

528
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,040
I'm Jiang Yitian.

529
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,719
I'm a replacement shooter.

530
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,359
I'm Yang Zhou,
a replacement shooter, too.

531
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,319
Want some snacks?

532
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,040
- No, thank you.
- No, thank you.

533
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,680
I came to prepare myself

534
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,719
for the livestream

535
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:53,520
in the future.

536
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,800
But your captain
doesn't want to speak to me.

537
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,239
I'm a bit concerned.

538
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,760
Don't be concerned.

539
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,199
That is how our captain is.

540
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:01,680
He focuses too much on the training.

541
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,400
But the livestream will be just fine.

542
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:04,959
Glad to know.

543
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,640
I thought I did something wrong.

544
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,439
Because he seems

545
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,239
nice to Tang Xin.

546
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:10,719
Tang Xin?

547
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,040
You can't compare

548
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,760
yourself with her.

549
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,400
She went through thick and thin

550
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,800
with Captain Shen.

551
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:17,439
Thick and thin?

552
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,079
What happened?

553
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,760
You don't know?

554
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,800
Let me tell you,

555
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,680
something happened between

556
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,400
Captain Shen and Miss Tang Xin.

557
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,560
The team

558
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,880
made an announcement about that.

559
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,800
This?

560
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,040
I know this.

561
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,400
But it's said

562
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,400
that it was Rui Live's hype.

563
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,520
- A hype?
- A hype?

564
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,439
If that's the case...

565
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,920
I'm only gossiping.

566
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,680
Please keep it to yourself.

567
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,199
If my boss knows,

568
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,239
I'll be in trouble.

569
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,760
I knew it.

570
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,359
Miss Tang Xin and Captain Shen...

571
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,280
I knew it.

572
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,959
Miss Tang Xin and Captain Shen

573
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,680
went out together that day.

574
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,280
Really?

575
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,119
How are things going
between them now?

576
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:55,959
Their relationship

577
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:58,160
is only a bit closer than strangers.

578
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,040
They're in a collaboration.

579
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
And that's it.

580
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,479
It's about time.

581
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,280
We need to head to the canteen.

582
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,959
We've got training this afternoon.

583
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,119
We're off.

584
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:07,680
Okay, okay.

585
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,400
Thank you.

586
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,359
- Go have your lunch.
- No problem.

587
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,040
Okay, bye.

588
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,319
Sorry.

589
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,000
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

590
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:13,959
What was that?

591
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:14,560
What were you thinking?

592
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:14,880
What?

593
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Why can't I bring it up?

594
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
Everybody knows what's going on

595
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,760
between Captain and Miss Tang Xin.

596
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,479
But you can't let it all out

597
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:19,479
in front of a stranger.

598
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,239
You want more rumors

599
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,400
about her?

600
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:24,520
In my love book,

601
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,719
there's this aphorism,

602
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,439
pretty girls

603
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,199
like that

604
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
are all poisonous apples

605
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
from which
we should keep our distance.

606
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,479
Welcome to our high-end snack shop

607
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,640
where hundreds of kinds

608
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,400
of snacks are optional.

609
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,479
What would you like?

610
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,839
Would you like to try one?

611
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,520
It tastes good.

612
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,199
Sir.

613
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,239
Are you purchasing for yourself

614
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,479
or as a gift?

615
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,680
A gift.

616
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Good taste, sir.

617
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,599
Many people

618
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,079
buy this for their
girlfriends as a gift.

619
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:02,359
I'll take a box, then.

620
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,319
Okay.

621
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,520
Check-out is this way.

622
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,920
Singing isn't easy, either.

623
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,920
What do I do in the afternoon?

624
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,359
I can't just sing

625
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,640
every time I see him?

626
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,520
Tang Xin,

627
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,880
I'm starving.

628
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,319
Sorry. Sorry.

629
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,640
I'm coming.

630
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,359
I'm famished.

631
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,319
Be quick.

632
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,680
What...? What's wrong?

633
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,599
Deadly eyes.

634
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:46,880
Lock your eyes with hers.

635
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,479
What?

636
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,000
What are you doing?

637
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,719
You are acting weird.

638
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,680
Keep your arms steady.

639
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,800
Hold your body.

640
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,719
Lean in slowly.

641
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,040
Distance, please.

642
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,479
This is for you.

643
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:29,640
I thought you were...

644
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,160
Why did you startle me?

645
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:41,839
Xiaoci.

646
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,479
Can I,

647
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:44,959
a replacement,

648
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
contribute in the 2v2 match?

649
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,479
You sit on the bench for now.

650
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,319
Shen Qingyuan and I

651
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,359
are established partners.

652
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,479
Any reckless change

653
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,880
at this moment

654
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,439
would increase risk

655
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,359
in real games.

656
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,280
You don't need to change.

657
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,439
I'll adapt myself to your pace.

658
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,680
Plus,

659
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,359
no one can compete with

660
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,280
you and Shen Qingyuan.

661
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,599
Why don't you pair up with me,

662
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:06,839
so we can compete

663
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:07,800
with Shen Qingyuan's team?

664
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,479
In a competition,

665
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,719
I don't have time for games.

666
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,000
Also, get this,

667
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,839
Shen Qingyuan

668
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,599
won't pair with anyone else.

669
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:28,560
Hey, hey, hey.

670
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,400
Move aside.

671
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,160
You want some?

672
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,160
Captain Shen,

673
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,479
I've got some family business.

674
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,079
I want half a day off.

675
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,880
Coach wouldn't approve it so easily,

676
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,079
so it's more convenient
to speak to Captain.

677
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,239
But he and Captain

678
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,199
never get along.

679
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:47,000
I bet there's something odd going on.

680
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,119
It can't be.

681
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:50,400
Thanks.

682
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:53,959
Hai.

683
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,359
Captain Shen.

684
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,439
How is it going?

685
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,599
I think I need more practice.

686
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,280
You can't rush it.

687
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:10,400
You need to take it slowly.

688
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,400
I'll teach you another thing.

689
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,359
Gifts.

690
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,119
About gifts.

691
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,000
Different gifts

692
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,959
have different meanings.

693
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:20,359
The more precious one thing is,
the more meaningful.

694
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,280
For instance,

695
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,160
when an Olympic champion

696
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,160
gifts their beloved one

697
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,359
the gold medal

698
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,160
to express their feelings,

699
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,000
that means a lot.

700
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,000
Very true.

701
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,800
Which one?

702
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,000
Captain,

703
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,479
you just keep your trophies in a box?

704
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:42,839
Or elsewhere?

705
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,800
You're the man.

706
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,599
I give you that.

707
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,719
No.

708
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,479
You have a load of these.

709
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,959
So it isn't special enough.

710
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,839
It's valuable

711
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,680
when it's special and exclusive.

712
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,680
Captain Shen,

713
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,359
do you have anything else?

714
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,199
Look at this.

715
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Give me that. Give me that.

716
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,239
First place.

717
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:09,400
A good shooter

718
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,400
owns many meaningful things, huh?

719
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:12,920
But of all the stuff,

720
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,839
which one is the most precious?

721
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:20,680
To me,

722
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,719
this is the most precious one.

723
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,280
Let me see.

724
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,600
(2015 National Junior Shooting
Championship)

725
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,959
This is a good one.

726
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,760
This is very good.

727
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,439
This has accompanied you

728
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,880
throughout your career.

729
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,640
This is good.

730
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,959
Captain, this is the one.

731
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,119
This is the gift.
Hand it to her straightforwardly.

732
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,199
Are you dumb?

733
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,160
If you do so,

734
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,479
your feelings are given away,

735
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,000
so the girl will feel the pressure.

736
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,280
You need a reason

737
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,880
so that the girl won't turn you down.

738
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,479
While she accepts the gift,

739
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:46,719
she gets your gesture.

740
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,439
Got it?

741
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,839
You never seem so serious

742
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:50,479
about the training.

743
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,880
But you know these drills quite well.

744
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,239
What do you know?

745
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:55,439
It's called comprehensive development.

746
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:58,119
The champion of 2015.

747
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
So meaningful.

748
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,439
I wish I were a girl.

749
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
How do you like the canteen?

750
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,479
Not bad, right?

751
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:11,680
So good.

752
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,560
The food for athletes

753
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,520
has to be good.

754
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,319
Yeah, right.

755
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,160
Want some?

756
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,040
- Definitely no, Captain.
- No.

757
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,400
- You mustn't agree to his request.
- Thank you.

758
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,560
- Du Lingfeng, I told you...
- No.

759
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,800
Mr. Du, please listen to me.

760
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
It's impossible

761
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,760
for you to be

762
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,959
Xiaoci's official shooting partner.

763
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:29,119
How about we let Mr. Du
have a go?

764
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,880
After he loses the game,

765
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
he'll shut up.

766
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,079
Right?

767
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,640
He doesn't have the courage
to change his partner.

768
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,239
What do you mean?

769
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,239
Shen Qingyuan

770
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,640
is an aloof, haughty,

771
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,599
and arrogant guy.

772
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:41,800
Other than Xiaoci,

773
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,680
no one can put up with him.

774
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,119
That's not necessarily true.

775
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,119
Captain Shen.

776
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,239
What do you think?

777
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,640
I'm fine either way.

778
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:55,880
What do you mean, "fine either way"?

779
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,319
It means

780
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,280
our captain

781
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,000
takes you

782
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,719
and your request very lightly.

783
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:06,439
Hey, errand girl.

784
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,439
Tell me.

785
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:09,959
Should I compete

786
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,280
with Shen Qingyuan in the 2v2 match

787
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,119
three days later?

788
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,199
You should.

789
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,319
To ensure some suspense,

790
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:27,959
should I

791
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,280
pair up with Xiaoci?

792
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,160
It will be pointless anyway.

793
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:32,760
You can't win.

794
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Let's try.

795
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,479
Who will be your partner?

796
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,040
Her.

797
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:49,599
Tang Xin?

798
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,680
To compete with you,

799
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
I need an amateur as my teammate.

800
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,920
That's how we play it fairly.

801
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,920
Shen Qingyuan,

802
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,839
you've got balls.

803
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,199
You're too weak.

804
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,439
Fine.

805
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,359
So be it.

806
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,119
Let's see who the winner is.

807
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,760
I... I...

808
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,839
This is decided.

809
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,359
Objection overruled.

810
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,599
This is for you.

811
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,760
All right.

812
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,000
Get back to the training.

813
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,359
Captain.

814
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,880
That was smart.

815
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,599
So were you.

816
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,239
But will Miss Tang Xin

817
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,599
actually participate in the match?

818
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,000
I've got it under control.

819
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,680
- Go.
- Go.

820
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,360
Xiaoci,

821
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,959
are you mad?

822
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,800
Du Lingfeng,

823
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,879
we must win this.

824
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:24,199
No problem.

825
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,680
(2015 National Junior Shooting
Championship)

826
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,120
I'm good.

827
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,760
Let's go.

828
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,320
Okay.

829
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,040
Tang Xin.

830
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,239
If you are in the match,

831
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:48,080
what about the livestreaming?

832
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,760
I have no choice.

833
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,080
You saw that.

834
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,639
Would you like to try it?

835
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:55,479
Me?

836
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,760
Can I?

837
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,840
Thank you, Tang Xin.

838
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,520
Thank you so much.

839
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,560
I didn't expect

840
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,239
to livestream

841
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,159
so fast.

842
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,439
In this case,

843
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,760
this will be

844
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,479
a friendly match

845
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:10,280
between Rui Live and Haiya University.

846
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,959
It must be an eye-catcher.

847
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,239
But I wonder

848
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,280
if Mr. Zhou would get mad.

849
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,600
I'll write down the script

850
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,800
and make a list of terms
for your reference.

851
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:20,919
Great.

852
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:21,800
Thank you, Tang Xin.

853
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:22,959
Let's go.

854
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,080
Thank you, Tang Xin.

855
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,479
How come this is a white target?

856
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,120
You care about the points too much,

857
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,399
so your shots aren't stable.

858
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,080
I asked Coach

859
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,320
to change your target

860
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,239
so that you focus on shot density more.

861
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,879
Say ten shots,

862
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,320
even they are all on the rim,

863
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,159
it's better than
sprinkled on the target.

864
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,479
Xiaoci,

865
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:53,959
you are so nice to me.

866
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:55,919
Don't let me down.

867
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,840
Tell me,

868
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:00,919
can I now

869
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:01,840
be promoted

870
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,679
to your official partner?

871
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,639
Instead of daydreaming,

872
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,000
why don't you do a 200-shot practice?

873
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,159
It'll help you realize your dream.

874
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:16,719
Xiaoci.

875
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:17,560
No problem.

876
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,439
Have faith in me.

877
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:36,879
Now you can

878
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:37,879
cross the white line.

879
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,159
Put these on.

880
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,479
Can I really

881
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,719
fire these guns?

882
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,280
Why don't you speak?

883
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
I have informed our coach.

884
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,280
The grip is customized,

885
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,239
but my hand is small.

886
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,479
It doesn't fit.

887
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:50,560
Since it's a match,

888
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,320
you need to practice.

889
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,239
I'll work it out for you.

890
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,399
Just take a shot.

891
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,080
Tang Xin.

892
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,959
A good name.

893
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,959
Shooting is, in fact,

894
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,360
a process of heart cultivation.

895
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,639
Aim the rear sight

896
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:14,040
at the front sight

897
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,080
and point it at the bull's eye.

898
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Three points on the same line.

899
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,360
Try it.

900
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,040
7.2. Far miss.

901
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,439
Carry on.

902
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,919
What is he looking at?

903
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:50,639
