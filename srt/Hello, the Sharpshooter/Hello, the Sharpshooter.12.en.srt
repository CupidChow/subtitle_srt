Tang Xin,

36
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,919
were you livestreaming
with your alt account?

37
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:40,319
Since when have you

38
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,279
started stuttering?

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
It's been a couple of days.

40
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,239
You really make me worry about you.

41
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,559
Don't make a fuss over it.

42
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,360
I didn't mean to stutter.

43
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,000
What's going on, Tang Xin?

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,160
Ai wanted to see you.

45
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,120
She asked me to give you a message.

46
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,480
Mr. Zhou reminded you to delete

47
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,040
all the videos
in the live room of your alt account.

48
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,639
Mr. Zhou rebuffed rap livestream.

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,399
Did Ai give him

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,559
the pernicious advice?

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,119
I don't think she is a simple girl.

52
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,039
What do you think, Tang Liqi?

53
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
I've found it early.

54
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,559
Though Ai

55
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,479
looks gentle

56
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,360
and cute,

57
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,080
and gets along with people quickly,

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,279
she harbors some evil intentions.

59
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,759
I've seen through you,

60
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,960
you scheming girl.

61
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,880
When we were with Mr. Zhou just now,

62
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,000
I thought she looked weird.

63
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,119
She called me when I was

64
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,440
doing livestream last night.

65
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,839
But...

66
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,119
Forget it.

67
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:32,960
I'd better consider

68
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,320
how to change the livestream plan.

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,919
Come on, Tang Xin.

00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,559
Liqi and I

71
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,800
will keep an eye on Ai.

72
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,720
Don't worry about it.

I'd rather not.

81
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,399
I want to have some
hot and sour noodles

Yeah.

99
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,359
Do you try to convince me?

100
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,440
Really?

that invite viewers
to do all kinds of tests.

Do you think in livestream,

176
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,440
what kind of interaction

177
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,760
is attractive?

178
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,399
Gifts.

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,760
Shower them with
expensive virtual gifts,

180
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,519
and the livestreamers would
say thank you

181
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,160
and satisfy your

182
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,079
additional requirements.

183
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,279
I didn't ask how to
attract the livestreamers.

184
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,119
I...

185
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,440
It occurs to me!

186
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,160
No.

187
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,359
You...

188
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:50,399
How do you know that?

189
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,519
I...

190
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,399
I've heard of it.

191
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,320
Heard of it?

192
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,160
He doesn't even use WeChat.

193
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,119
How does he know virtual gifts?

194
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:12,839
Captain.

195
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,839
I want to take a personal leave
for the second training class

196
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,679
this afternoon.

197
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,440
(Request for Leave)

198
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,679
I won't permit the leave.

199
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:28,279
Why?

200
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:28,920
This week,

201
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,239
you've already taken a leave.

202
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,760
Everyone has training missions

203
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
each week.

204
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,039
You must complete yours.

205
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,400
Shen Qingyuan,

206
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,440
ordinarily

207
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,679
you just ignore me.

208
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,239
As soon as I ask for your help,

209
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:41,919
you put on the captain's look.

210
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,159
Could you stop doing it?

211
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,159
It's not about

212
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,679
whether I help you or not.

213
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,640
- Besides...
- Shen Qingyuan.

214
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,799
Chen Hai may

215
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,760
have something urgent.

216
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,440
Why don't you ask him...?

217
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Mind your own business.

218
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,799
Anyway, you approve
my application for leave.

219
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,880
Next month,

220
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll catch up
with the training schedule.

221
00:08:59,239 --> 00:08:59,919
Not possible.

222
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,559
Will you sign it or not?

223
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:04,880
I told you

224
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,760
I wouldn't approve it.

225
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,440
Go to practice.

226
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:09,919
Hey, guys.

227
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,840
What are you doing?

228
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,359
Yeah.

229
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,280
Let's not argue.

230
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,679
Won't you sign it?

231
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,799
Fine.

232
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:20,760
Fine.

233
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,599
Hai.

234
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,919
- Hai.
- Hai.

235
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,039
Captain,

236
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,919
don't be angry with him.

237
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:28,679
Hai

238
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,239
may really have something urgent.

239
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:30,760
Yeah.

240
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,679
Hai used to

241
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,679
practice very hard.

242
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,919
Are you scared?

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
When an emergency like this happens,

244
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,280
Captain Shen, shouldn't you

245
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,559
find out the reason?

246
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:42,679
I will

247
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,799
report it to the coach

248
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,359
and ask him to handle it.

249
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,520
Go to practice.

250
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:22,760
Hello.

251
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,640
Mr. Zhou.

252
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,760
I've sent you

253
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
the new plan.

254
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,280
Do you think it's good enough?

255
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,520
Yes. It's good.

256
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,919
But you'd better

257
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,559
add the rap

258
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,440
in it.

259
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,159
I've watched it.

260
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,000
It turns out well.

261
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:36,919
Really?

262
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,880
There's another thing.

263
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,679
You should do rap in the livestream

264
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
on the 2v2 match tomorrow.

265
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,119
When it's time for you to show up,

266
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,400
Ai will replace you.

267
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,559
OK.

268
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,440
Wait.

269
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,919
Anyway, we should strike
while the iron is hot.

270
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,400
Tang Xin.

271
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,919
I'll remember

272
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,799
your efforts.

273
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,520
Your image can be reversed in future.

274
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,880
Focus on the work for now.

275
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,440
Mr. Zhou,

276
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,440
I'll try my best.

277
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,679
The prize of the raffle

278
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,719
is a chance
to ask Shen Qingyuan questions.

279
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,520
But how can I

280
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,760
persuade Shen Qingyuan?

281
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,239
Are you going home?

282
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,760
Go home?

283
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,799
Why don't you ride a bike recently?

284
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,440
We get too close while riding a bike.

285
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,679
He remembers my words.

286
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,200
This is not the way home.

287
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,000
We've run out of rice.

if you don't ask him now.

349
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,000
I...

350
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
I'll do livestream tomorrow.

351
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:24,000
Would you do me a favor
and answer some questions?

352
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
To help you in livestream?

353
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,200
Is there any remuneration?

354
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:30,880
Money?

355
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,559
Think it over again.

356
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,000
Remuneration?

357
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,880
Shen Qingyuan,

358
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:47,679
what exactly do you like?

359
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,280
Could you tell me?

360
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,400
Couldn't you figure it out?

361
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,400
I'll just name one.

362
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,840
Tang Xin.

363
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,119
I like whatever you give me.

364
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,039
Is it OK

365
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,440
if I make you breakfast tomorrow?

366
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:10,640
OK.

367
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,760
Xiaoci,

368
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,559
what do you

369
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,000
think of my ready position

370
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:54,760
this time?

371
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,080
Not bad.

372
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,520
Are you tired?

373
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,799
I'm not tired with you watching me.

374
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:03,960
Wait for a second.

375
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
As soon as she goes away,

376
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,400
I begin to feel tired.

377
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,479
Xiaoci.

378
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,799
We're well acquainted.

379
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Let's spare the courtesy.

380
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,760
You don't have to prepare
so many love letters, either.

381
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,960
Look what these are.

382
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,520
Love letters.

383
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,320
Why isn't there any word?

384
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:53,719
Xiaoci,

385
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,679
you've printed all my recent

386
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,159
training records, haven't you?

387
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:01,599
We used to use paper targets

388
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
at the range.

389
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:04,359
So I kept these as souvenirs

390
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,599
out of habit.

391
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,319
The electric target

392
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,760
is advanced enough,

393
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:10,199
but it lacks

394
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,920
a sense of ritual.

395
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,000
Xiaoci,

396
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,359
rest assured.

397
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,319
I will treasure it.

398
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:21,839
It doesn't matter.

399
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,479
What matters is to remember that

400
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:24,520
I like to win.

401
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,199
Talking about that,

402
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,280
the fun of competition

403
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,719
seems not just to

404
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:32,719
defeat each other.

405
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,800
Don't you think the process

406
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
of winning is fun, too?

407
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,719
I never thought about

408
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,560
the questions before.

409
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,040
But hearing what you said,

410
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,400
it seems...

411
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,479
In fact,

412
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,319
you're good at it yourself.

413
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,719
If it weren't for you,

414
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I wouldn't realize

415
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,920
it would also be fun even you couldn't

416
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,319
clear the game without damage.

417
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,680
Without damage?

418
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,760
Let's play games together
when we get time.

419
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:58,560
OK.

420
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,400
However,

421
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,160
to win still matters most.

422
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,599
I didn't expect that
you snap your fingers

423
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,560
better than boys.

424
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,640
Because I like to win.

425
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:16,439
Treasure girl.

426
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,319
Wait.

427
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,000
Why do I get nervous

428
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,000
watching this for a while?

429
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,160
Why does every face

430
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,760
look like Xiaoci to me?

431
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,800
The so called breakfast

432
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,760
is some warm milk?

433
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,920
Here are

434
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,199
two pieces of bread.

435
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:03,920
I'll make breakfast next time.

436
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,839
Captain Shen.

437
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,599
Are you holding Miss Tang's things?

438
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,239
No, no.

439
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,359
The thermos cup is mine.

440
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,079
But the milk inside

441
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,280
is his.

442
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,520
Milk?

443
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,160
We've never seen him drinking milk.

444
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,760
Yeah.

445
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,160
Let alone warm milk

446
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,319
in a cartoon thermos cup.

447
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,719
It's really different

448
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:21,680
to have someone look after you.

449
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,959
Don't get me wrong.

450
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,040
This...

451
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,439
This is the remuneration.

452
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,680
Remuneration?

453
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,199
I've almost

454
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:29,800
got goose bumps.

455
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,920
Do you still play the trick

456
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,880
of remuneration?

457
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,160
Miss Tang,

458
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,119
do you stutter?

459
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,400
She's nervous around me.

460
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,880
Thanks.

461
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,359
Love of worship.

462
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,319
So sweet.

463
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,680
Miss Tang.

464
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,920
We're going to change first.

465
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,719
See you at the shooting hall.

466
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:49,119
OK.

467
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,239
(Locker Room)
- Come on. - Come on, Captain.

468
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:56,920
Come.

469
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,439
Do you need a hand?

470
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:57,839
No, no.

471
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,439
I can do it myself.

472
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,160
- I gotta go.
- Thanks.

473
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,479
OK. Bye.

474
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,280
Bye.

475
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,839
Morning.

476
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,760
Tang Xin, morning.

477
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,520
Tang Xin.

478
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,760
You must do your best today.

479
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,520
No matter the livestream or the game,

480
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,319
you must do your best.

481
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,760
I'll help you.

482
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,000
Thanks.

483
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,400
I'm sorry.

484
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,680
We agreed that
you would do the livestream.

485
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,239
It doesn't matter.

486
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,239
Mr. Zhou told me

487
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,239
your rap plan

488
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,119
was particularly effective.

489
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,479
Especially when

490
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,800
you're popular,

491
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,280
you should do the livestream.

492
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,400
As for me,

493
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,239
there are always opportunities.

494
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,439
Don't worry about it.

495
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,400
I'm going to get prepared.

496
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,119
OK. Go ahead.

497
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,560
Ai.

498
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,959
Come here. I want a word with you.

499
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,119
Captain Shen,

500
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
you've been with

501
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Miss Tang for so long.

502
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,280
Why don't you tell her how you feel?

503
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,319
You should be together.

504
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,479
Yeah, Captain Shen.

505
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,479
Tell her how you feel!

506
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,719
Does it count

507
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,400
only if I do it?

508
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,359
Of course.

509
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:00,839
Wait.

510
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:01,400
Captain.

511
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,160
I have another word to say.

512
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,719
Aren't you going to

513
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,680
tell her how you feel right now,
are you?

514
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,439
Is there any problem?

515
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,719
There surely is.

516
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,599
There is a big problem.

517
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,000
- Come on.
- Sit down.

518
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,839
As a friend of girls',

519
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,640
I'd like to help you out
with any queries.

520
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,040
When you're with a girl,

521
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,839
you can make a few mistakes,

522
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,239
as long as you're shameless,

523
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,040
you'll always fix them.

524
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,520
Yeah.

525
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,319
But there is one mistake

526
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,400
you mustn't make,

527
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,760
which is to tell her
how you feel casually.

528
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,599
You must have a plan.

529
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,160
A detailed plan.

530
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:33,000
It has to be novel, romantic.

531
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,079
You must take her by surprise

532
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,439
and win with one move.

533
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:36,599
You have to find

534
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,359
a nice day, too.

535
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,280
Captain Shen, rest assured.

536
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,160
I'll take care of it.

537
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,079
I must find you

538
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,000
an auspicious day.

539
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,760
I guarantee you'll win success.

540
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,400
How about this,

541
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,839
as the witnesses of love

542
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,760
between you and Miss Tang,

543
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,119
Yang Zhou and I

544
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,520
will take the responsibilities

545
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
to make an unprecedented plan

546
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,680
for you to profess your love to her.

547
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,280
What do you think?

548
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,479
You'll like it.

549
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,160
Captain Shen,
if there are any more problems,

550
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,880
feel free to tell us.

551
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,319
We'll solve them all.

552
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,119
Solve them all.

553
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,040
Focus on the training.

554
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,520
Don't think about such things.

555
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,199
The provincial competition
will begin next week.

556
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,199
Shall we make the plan or not?

557
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
After the competition.

558
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,079
We'll have fun.

559
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,400
Xiaoci.

560
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,119
Didn't you

561
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,439
plan to frustrate Du Lingfeng badly

562
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,439
and wish him to lose?

563
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,599
I'm a part of the competition, too.

564
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,319
So I want him to win.

565
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,880
What if he

566
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,079
keeps pestering you in future?

567
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,199
Do you really want him to win
all the time?

568
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,479
Don't be exaggerated.

569
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,640
Besides,

570
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,400
I didn't think of the future.

571
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,239
Do you have confidence?

572
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,359
I can't believe I don't have it.

573
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,000
Are you nervous?

574
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,359
How can I be?

575
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,400
As we know,

576
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,599
before the official competition,

577
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:04,239
no coach will

578
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,359
bring up the word nervous,

579
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,760
in case the player will be stressed.

580
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,439
Are you stressed?

581
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:10,880
Dear lady,

582
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:13,000
I'll thrive under your pressure.

583
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,040
It's weird.

584
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,839
I used to think you were glib.

585
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,920
Now thinking about it,

586
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,160
the prerequisite of being glib

587
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,040
is that you're smart enough.

588
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,439
Distance tests a horse's stamina;

589
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,079
time reveals a man's heart.

590
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,280
Enough.

591
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,000
There's some time
before the competition.

592
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,479
Let's practice mindfulness.

593
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,439
Yeah.

594
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,760
Remember,

595
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,599
regard the body

596
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,119
as your own lab.

597
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Find a way to get along with stress

598
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,119
and reach your potential.

599
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,439
Straighten up.

600
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,000
Don't be stiff.

601
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:57,199
Take three deep breaths,

602
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,680
then think back.

603
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,319
If you lose this time,

604
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,239
we'll have no future.

605
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,280
How is it going?

606
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,520
Wi-Fi connection isn't strong here.

607
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,199
Let me check.

608
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,280
Tang Xin.

609
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,199
What did Ai

610
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,160
tell you just now?

611
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,640
She just encouraged me.

612
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Don't be fooled by her.

613
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,479
I know.

614
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,839
I think she's weird, too.

615
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,000
How so?

616
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,280
I don't know.

617
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,160
Tang Xin.

618
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,640
Get it ready.

619
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:08,239
Yeah.

620
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,839
Can I take you somewhere?

621
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,640
- Captain.
- Miss Tang.

622
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,199
The game will begin soon.

623
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:19,839
Where are you heading?

624
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:20,400
Yeah.

625
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:21,560
Got something to do.

626
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,680
(Workshop)

627
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,640
Here, have a try.

628
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,640
The grip is a little big.

629
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,239
Give me a minute.

630
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,199
Miss Tang.

631
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
Have you noticed it?

632
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,160
Captain Shen

633
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,359
is very happy today.

634
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,680
Really?

635
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,000
I think he's always like this.

636
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,439
He's poker-faced.

637
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,119
Take a closer look.

638
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,640
Did you see?

639
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,520
The rising corners of his mouth.

640
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,920
I've never seen Captain Shen

641
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,119
so happy before.

642
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,160
It's not just happy.

643
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,239
It's wild with joy

644
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,680
or a hearty laugh.

645
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,319
You are

646
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,640
the microscope of Shen Qingyuan.

647
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:56,520
No, no.

648
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,160
Miss Tang,

649
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,160
you're the catalytic agent
of Captain Shen.

650
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,199
I'm his schedule consultant.

651
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,400
What are you talking about?

652
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,880
Nothing, Captain Shen.

653
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,680
Come here and try.

654
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,079
The treatment for Olympic champions.

655
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,760
Let's go.

656
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,239
Give them a minute. Hurry.

657
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,520
Don't be nervous.

658
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:36,959
I'll try my best.

659
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:43,560
The Wi-Fi still doesn't work.

660
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,479
How is it going?

661
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,280
Mr. Zhou, why are you here?

662
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:53,640
I'm a little worried. Got to check up.

663
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,719
What are you doing?

664
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,479
The Wi-Fi connection

665
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,599
isn't stable.

666
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,119
I'll take a final test.

667
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Hurry up.

668
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,079
OK. It will be ready soon.

669
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,520
Coach.

670
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,000
Hi, Coach.

671
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,119
Coach Zhang.

672
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:26,800
Mr. Zhou.

673
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:27,680
Thank you very much.

674
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
Thank you for arranging

675
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
the 2v2 match.

676
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,199
We should let them compete more.

677
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:32,920
It's good for them.

678
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,040
Tang Xin, come on.

679
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:36,280
Sorry to bother you.

680
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,640
She is our livestreamer.

681
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,959
I don't know how she got involved.

682
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,439
Don't blame Tang Xin for it.

683
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
I heard from the guys.

684
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,719
Young people are all proud.

685
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,199
It's normal if they have issues.

686
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,239
As their coach,

687
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,119
I can't force them.

688
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:49,719
Both of them are stubborn.

689
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,640
Fine, then.

690
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,760
Let's regard it

691
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,520
as an extra training for Shen Qingyuan.

692
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,079
It's almost time.

693
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:56,719
Talk to you later.

694
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,599
Go ahead.

695
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:01,800
Considering

696
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,400
the particularity of the match,

697
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,280
the rules will be different from

698
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,959
those of the normal competition.

699
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,479
The two groups

700
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:11,199
take turns to shoot
within the time limit.

701
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,479
You have three minutes to test.

702
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:23,800
Are you ready?

703
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:24,760
Just a minute.

704
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,400
Have a look.

705
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,280
Take a look.

706
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,280
All friends, welcome.

707
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,000
Welcome to Rui Live.

708
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,719
Haiya University

709
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:43,560
2v2 shooting match

710
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,959
shouldn't be missed.

711
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:47,640
What's the outcome of Shen-Du match?

712
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,359
Look forward to your participation.

713
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,199
You're in charge of editing

714
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,680
Tang Xin's fast-paced video.

715
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,520
OK.

716
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:07,719
Thank you.

717
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:07,959
OK.

718
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:08,719
Go ahead.

719
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,719
Scores are to be calculated.

720
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,719
The match begins.

721
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:28,880
Ready?

722
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,040
Go!

723
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,880
Nine.

724
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,160
Du Lingfeng has made

725
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,640
a spurt of progress.

726
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:57,599
But Du Lingfeng

727
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,719
just shoots for fun.

728
00:30:58,719 --> 00:30:59,680
I'm with Captain Shen.

729
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,680
Don't mind it. Focus.

730
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,199
- 4.
- 4.

731
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,640
4 from Miss Tang.

732
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:20,439
It's good enough
she didn't miss the target.

733
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:21,880
Don't worry.

734
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:23,359
I got your back.

735
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:28,160
Hello.

736
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,400
Welcome, everyone.

737
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,359
I'm Ai, the substitute host.

738
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,760
The first round

739
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,400
of Rui Live Friendly Match

740
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,119
of Haiya Shooting Team

741
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,359
is over now.

742
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:40,479
At present, the points of

743
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,880
Du Lingfeng and Shi Xiaoci

744
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,040
are way ahead.

745
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,760
Our prediction pool

746
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
is about to close.

747
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:48,920
Friends who haven't
made predictions yet,

748
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,520
please hurry up.

749
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,239
Fans of Shen Qingyuan's team,

750
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,319
don't get discouraged.

751
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,560
Let's cheer

752
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,560
Host Tang Xin up.

753
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,760
Host Tang Xin.

754
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,439
Hi.

755
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,079
- Don't worry.
- Now I announce

756
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,400
the result of

757
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,199
- the first round raffle...
- Shoot at your pace the next round.

758
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:12,800
Who's the winner?

759
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,000
The second round begins.

760
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,479
Ready?

761
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,520
Go!

762
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:25,280
I'll shoot first.

763
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:30,839
Why do Captain Shen

764
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,520
and Xiaoci shoot first this round?

765
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,880
A pro face-off. A decisive battle.

766
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,079
10.8.

767
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,319
Awesome!

768
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,920
He saved his own time

769
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:09,199
to give me a breathing spell.

770
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:23,879
How come Miss Tang's points

771
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,280
strike back suddenly?

772
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,760
I got it.

773
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,959
Captain Shen must have

774
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:28,760
secretly recorded

775
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,479
the average shooting time of Miss Tang.

776
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:31,639
That's why he would shoot quickly

777
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,479
rather than shoot steadily.

778
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:33,199
Right.

779
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,919
Sounds reasonable.

780
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,639
Look.

781
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,000
Things are looking bad over there.

782
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,879
Du Lingfeng has a problem

783
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:38,959
with stability and endurance.

784
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,719
His points declined.

785
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,120
If Du Lingfeng

786
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,199
hits a 2 in this round,

787
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,399
- there will be hope.
- 2.

788
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,560
Miss.

789
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:37,520
Miss.

790
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,520
Stop shooting.

791
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,919
Now I declare

792
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,360
the winner of the 2v2 match

793
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,399
is the group of

794
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:53,159
Shen Qingyuan and Tang Xin.

795
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,639
- How did Xiaoci lose?
- Captain won.

796
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,000
Hello.

797
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,239
Dear fans and friends,

798
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,320
now the match

799
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,679
has come to a conclusion.

800
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,399
- Good shooting.
- But the livestream will continue.

801
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:11,600
Please don't leave.

802
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,159
We have prepared

803
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,159
pretty little presents for you.

804
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:20,439
All right.

805
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
You've both had enough fun.

806
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:25,600
Should you

807
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,399
prepare for

808
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:27,320
the provincial competition next?

809
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,320
I've made

810
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,239
a training plan.

811
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,320
Captain Shen,

812
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,000
we're reliable partners to each other.

813
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,760
Keep it in your mind.

814
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,199
Don't worry, Captain Shen.

815
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,280
I'll get well prepared

816
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,199
for the provincial competition.

817
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,280
Shen Qingyuan.

818
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,600
Come with me.

819
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,120
Please wait a minute.

820
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,800
The Q&A will begin soon.

821
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,560
Shen Qingyuan is in position.

822
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,680
(Wall of Fame)

823
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,399
Are you in the mood

824
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,280
to play basketball
right after the match?

825
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,000
Pass it to me.

826
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:29,560
Except for the last shooting,

827
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,080
you did a good job today.

828
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,239
I was surprised.

829
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,479
Don't just stand there holding the ball.

830
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,639
But I held Xiaoci back.

831
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:44,800
Her performance was almost perfect.

832
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,879
You've never lost, have you?

833
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,639
Especially losing

834
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,439
after efforts.

835
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,360
I'm not young any more.

836
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,360
No more playing.

837
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,159
I know,

838
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,040
to professional players,

839
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,479
grade is a matter of principle.

840
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,919
I've just switched to shooting.

841
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,000
I still fall far short.

842
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:12,399
But I'll keep trying.

843
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,959
Practice more.

844
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
You're not even close.

845
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:17,439
You've already joined the team.

846
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,439
What else can you do
except for practicing?

847
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:20,040
Old man,

848
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,120
what do you mean?

849
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:22,080
Old man?

850
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Who's the old man?

851
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:24,239
Your manners?

852
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:24,879
Go.

853
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:25,560
Coach.

854
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,040
Coach.

855
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,320
Next,

856
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,959
let's get to another question

857
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,800
It's brought up by a fan

858
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,360
who has won the prize.

859
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,840
The question is,

860
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:41,560
what kind of girl

861
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,479
do you like?

862
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,520
(What kind of girl do you like?)

863
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,719
The girl I like...

864
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,080
The girl I like

865
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,479
doesn't have long hair.

866
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,080
She has a small face,

867
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,639
but it's a little chubby.

868
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,560
She is timid and vulnerable

869
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,800
but positive and optimistic.

870
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:13,520
Does he talk about me?
