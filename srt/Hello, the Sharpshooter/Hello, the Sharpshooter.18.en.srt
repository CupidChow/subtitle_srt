=Hello, The Sharpshooter=

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
=Episode 18=

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,599
I'm very gratified as his teacher.

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
He's finally learnt to draw inferences
from what I've taught him.

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,040
It's just pathetic

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,440
for us singles

39
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:44,519
who have to be hit hard by such PDA

40
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,839
after running 10,000 meters.

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
This is unfair. This is unfair,

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,120
Jiang Yitian!

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm gonna get some benefits

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,279
from Captain too.

45
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,239
Don't, don't, don't.

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,319
Aren't you seeking death

47
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,360
by confronting him head-on?

48
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,440
But I have a trick up my sleeve.

49
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,440
Yang Xiaoling,

50
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,040
your results have improved this time,

51
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
but you need to keep up the good work.

52
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,680
OK.

53
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
You've lagged behind
in your results this time, An Quan.

54
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,959
I see, Captain.

55
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,559
Miss Tang.

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,960
What are you guys doing?

57
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Livestreamer and Wonder Woman
Miss Tang.

58
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,759
I'm flattered.

59
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,399
That's not the way to do it.

60
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,320
Miss Tang.

61
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,600
Can you guys act normal?

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,440
With Captain drilling us
every day like this,

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,240
how can we

64
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,399
act normal again?

65
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,039
Your results have improved this time,

66
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,279
but you need to keep up the good work.

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,679
With winter training around the corner,

68
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,880
he's doing it to make you guys

69
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,919
pass the physical fitness test

70
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,399
in due course.

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,360
But with such

72
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,600
high-intensity training every day…

73
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,119
Yes.

74
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,800
My heart is about to stop beating.

75
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,000
Exactly.

76
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,559
With some reward

77
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,800
and encouragement,

78
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,279
we can fly even higher.

79
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:55,839
Yes.

80
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,839
That makes sense too.

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,479
Shall I put in a word for you?

82
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,839
- Really?
- Really?

83
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Have some crispy winter jujubes.

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,279
To replenish your energy.

85
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,919
You love jujubes so much,

86
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,479
but why did you run away

87
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,679
when I gave you some back then?

88
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,679
I was just being nervous.

89
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
Do you find

90
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,399
the weather is getting
colder and colder?

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,600
Is it?

92
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,039
So I just crave…

93
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,720
Give me a second.

94
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,520
Give me your hand.

95
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,240
Give it to me.

96
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,040
Do you still feel cold?

97
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,640
My feet aren't cold.

98
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,679
My feet aren't cold.

99
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,399
Once it gets cold,

100
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,959
I just crave instant-boiled meat.

101
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,239
With the fire burning hot

102
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,720
and the brass pot gurgling

103
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,679
and bubbling.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,799
The thought of it

105
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,359
makes me feel warm all over my body.

106
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
I'll take you
to have some at the weekend.

107
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,480
OK.

108
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,720
But

109
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,839
can you bring your team members along?

110
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,200
What for?

111
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,799
They've been training so hard recently.

112
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,320
A treat from you

113
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,720
can give a boost to their morale.

114
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,359
We can eat out

115
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,359
at any time,

116
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
but the team members

117
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,600
are about to start winter training.

118
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:16,440
If you don't treat them now,

119
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,320
there will be no time to do it later.

120
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,679
Indeed.

121
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,359
But my treat

122
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:26,760
should at least

123
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,239
come with a reward.

124
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,720
Why are you getting more and more…?

125
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,320
Shen Qingyuan,

126
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:39,760
let's play a game.

127
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:41,959
OK.

128
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,239
Come on.

129
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,359
Sit here.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
Do you often do blind shooting

131
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,079
during your training sessions?

132
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,079
Darkness

133
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,760
can sharpen one's sensory perception.

134
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,000
Guess

135
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,480
where I am.

136
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,679
You are…

137
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,640
Here.

138
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,519
Did I guess right?

139
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,799
Did I guess right?

140
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,640
Yes.

141
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,160
Don't rush.

142
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Wait a minute. Right away.

143
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,160
I'm gonna give you a reward now.

144
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,640
Come on, open your mouth.

145
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,040
Open it.

146
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,799
Open wider.

147
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,640
Are they sweet?

148
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
Are you playing me for a fool?

149
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,119
Tang Xin, stop!

150
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:06,600
Shen Qingyuan!

151
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,559
You mustn't give orders to me.

152
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,480
All right.

153
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,959
Well…

154
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,839
You give orders to me then.

155
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,640
That'll work too.

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,679
You order…

157
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,640
order me to catch you.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,559
Don't run.

159
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,440
Stop running.

160
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:23,679
Don't run.

161
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,959
You can't catch me. You can't catch me.

162
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,000
Come on, come on, come on.

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
- You can't catch me.
- Stop running.

164
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,279
What are you drawing?

165
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,880
I'll be done in a minute.

166
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,399
I'm gonna make you

167
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,200
an evaluation sheet.

168
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
I'm happy today,

169
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,760
so I'll give you a check mark.

170
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,200
So

171
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,559
only if I get seven check marks

172
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:58,960
will your no

173
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,919
become yes?

174
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,000
That's not what I meant.

175
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,200
But you can see it that way.

176
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:18,680
Come on, come on, come on.

177
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
- Cheers!
- Let's clink our glasses.

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,400
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

179
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,000
You are so generous, Captain Shen.

180
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,919
You are so generous, Captain Shen.

181
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,840
Shall I boil some spinach for you?

182
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,960
Do you like bamboo shoots too?

183
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:30,799
Yes.

184
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,320
Who doesn't want to be taken care of?

185
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,880
Yes.

186
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,559
What do you like to eat?

187
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,039
I'm OK with anything.

188
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,799
Help yourself.

189
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Do you want to take care of me?

190
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,840
Who doesn't want to be taken care of?

191
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,479
Thanks.

192
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,799
We singles are going to die
of envy today.

193
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,599
Xiaoci.

194
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,000
What do you like to eat?

195
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,080
Guess.

196
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,000
You have such fair skin.

197
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,599
You must love Chinese yams.

198
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,239
And?

199
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,119
You have such bright eyes.

200
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,599
You must love carrots.

201
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,159
Your hands are so cold.

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,239
Let me boil some duck blood curds
for you.

203
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,520
Aren't you ruining the atmosphere?

204
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,919
I can make it good again if it's ruined.

205
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,239
Your guesses are all wrong.

206
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,640
I love meat.

207
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,119
I'll pick up meat for you.

208
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,559
Excuse me,

209
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,640
could I have some vinegar?

210
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,719
This is too cloying.

211
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
Sit down, sit down.

212
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:53,640
Captain.

213
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,919
During these days,

214
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,919
although I keep complaining
our training is too hard,

215
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,799
I'm really grateful to you
from the bottom of my heart.

216
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,039
Were it not for you,

217
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,960
I'd probably muddle along

218
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,599
and get myself

219
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,599
kicked out of our shooting team.

220
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,599
It is you

221
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,400
who keep me motivated.

222
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,159
Here's to you.

223
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,200
I'm drinking juice,

224
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,039
but why do I feel

225
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,520
I'm a bit drunk?

226
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,359
How can you get drunk with juice?

227
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,919
Captain Shen,

228
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,640
here's to you too.

229
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,359
Despite my name Yang Zhou,
[*Zhou means boat in Chinese]

230
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,559
water is the missing element in my fate.

231
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,440
I did fortune-telling for myself

232
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,799
and found that God would send me

233
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,159
someone with water elements in his name.
[*Qingyuan means clear water in Chinese]

234
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,559
Thank you, Captain Shen.

235
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,880
Captain Shen.

236
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,280
Without further ado,

237
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,359
I'll just say one thing.

238
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,960
Both of us are

239
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,280
the cream of the crop in our own field.

240
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,200
There's kind of

241
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,119
a sympathetic bond between us.

242
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,799
Come on, let's drink a toast.

243
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,200
Here's to you too.

244
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,479
My good partner.

245
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,640
Come on, come on, come on, together!

246
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,679
Let me join the fun too.

247
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,080
Go easy on alcohol.

248
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,520
Stop where you should.

249
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,239
Captain,

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,280
today, let me drink a toast to you too.

251
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,119
Hai is raising his glass.

252
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,280
Hai is raising his glass.

253
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,359
I call you captain today

254
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,559
sincerely from my heart.

255
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,400
I'll see you in the final.

256
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,960
What a good atmosphere!

257
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,679
What a good team!

258
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,000
Come on.

259
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,799
Let's have a drink together.

260
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,200
Come on, come on, come on.

261
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,479
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Another glass to drink after this one.

262
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,559
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

263
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,520
What are you busy doing?

264
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,000
You've spent the whole day making it.

265
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,239
Look.

266
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,960
This is our kitchen.

267
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,640
Where you often make breakfasts for me.

268
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,320
And this.

269
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,000
This is the Wuchang Rice

270
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,359
we bought from the supermarket
last time.

271
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,760
Why do you make this?

272
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,840
Because I always want to have

273
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,919
a house of my own.

274
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,400
Watching it getting built

275
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,320
step by step,

276
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,799
it's like this house

277
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,919
really belongs to me

278
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,400
and it makes me very contented.

279
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,520
I mean,

280
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,000
why

281
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,520
do you make these little things?

282
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,080
They are my happy memories.

283
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,440
I hope

284
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,039
they can fill up my house.

285
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,880
So your happy memories

286
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,679
all have me in them?

287
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,559
Shen Qingyuan,

288
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,599
knock it off.

289
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,760
I'm almost done.

290
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,440
Let me help you.

291
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,440
This little bear is you

292
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,520
and this is me.

293
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,799
I hope

294
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,280
we can stay together all the time

295
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,760
like the two of them.

296
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,400
Is there

297
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,840
something missing from your handicraft?

298
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,479
What?

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,599
The thing

300
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,039
you asked me to buy last time…

301
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,599
Shen Qingyuan!

302
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,359
You…

303
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,799
You are getting more and more frivolous.

304
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,799
Your wish will come true.

305
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,520
Pause for a second.

306
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,119
I have some good news for you.

307
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,520
Shen Qingyuan

308
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,440
has been picked
for the national winter training team.

309
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,719
- Congrats, Captain Shen!
- Congrats, Captain Shen!

310
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,719
Congrats, Captain Shen!

311
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:14,239
Congrats.

312
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:14,960
Congrats, Captain Shen!

313
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Captain Shen is a sharpshooter.

314
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,840
He's the winner

315
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,679
of the national individual

316
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,559
shooting championship.

317
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,960
Such a result
is sure to gain him direct entry.

318
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:20,840
Exactly.

319
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,599
Thanks to Shen's results

320
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,239
in the shooting championship,

321
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,760
he's exempted from the tryouts

322
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,559
and directly enters

323
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,400
the national sports training base.

324
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,239
I've been dreaming

325
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,640
of joining the national training team

326
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,440
to feel what it's like.

327
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,280
Individual endowment

328
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,359
can only be admired.

329
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:34,599
Next,

330
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,080
Shen will train

331
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,599
with seeded players
from all over the country.

332
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,039
The time will come
when an up-and-comer has to go.

333
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,520
But for you,

334
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,440
it is a good opportunity.

335
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:43,760
Go.

336
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,799
- Go for it, Captain Shen!
- Captain Shen, go for it!

337
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,599
- Go for it, Captain Shen!
- Captain Shen, go for it!

338
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,039
Well…

339
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,119
All right, go on with your training.

340
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,400
Remember

341
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,479
to follow Captain Shen's example.

342
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,599
- OK.
- OK.

343
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,119
OK.

344
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,760
Go on with your training.

345
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,080
Captain Shen,

346
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,440
we hate to let you go.

347
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,039
Who's gonna supervise us

348
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,960
once you go?

349
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,760
Yang Zhou and I

350
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,239
have finally managed

351
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,080
to improve our results a little bit.

352
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,239
What are we gonna do if you go?

353
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,200
Shooting is a solo event after all.

354
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,520
Ultimately you have to rely on yourself.

355
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,559
To say nothing of this,

356
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,280
even Coach Zhang

357
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,119
can't bear to let you go.

358
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,559
Didn't you hear him sighing

359
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,599
when he left?

360
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:18,840
What's more,

361
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,960
it's not

362
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,119
the official national team list now.

363
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,000
A lot of famous shooters

364
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,520
used to train

365
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,119
with local teams.

366
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,039
Our team is just as good.

367
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,359
Tang Xin,

368
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,359
come with me, please.

369
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:33,679
Here, Tang Xin.

370
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:34,640
Take a seat.

371
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,880
Have a cup of water or tea.

372
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,919
No, thanks, sir.

373
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,119
Here, have some water.

374
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,039
Thanks.

375
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:41,640
Sir,

376
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
what is it you want to see me about?

377
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,559
Nothing particular.

378
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,599
Just for a casual chat.

379
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,719
I heard

380
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,119
Shen is in good form these days.

381
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,159
His performance has improved.

382
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,479
He's even learnt
to care about his teammates

383
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,919
and is acting more like a captain.

384
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,840
The credit goes to you.

385
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,919
No.

386
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,960
It's all because you taught well.

387
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,840
No, no.

388
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,679
When Dr. Ding gave me

389
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,960
this protocol at first,

390
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,359
I was quite hesitant.

391
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,640
But the facts convinced me.

392
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,160
Tang Xin,

393
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,319
I hope

394
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,319
you can help Shen achieve more.

395
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,640
As you know, he is

396
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,239
a very talented athlete.

397
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,160
If everything goes well,

398
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,880
he should have no problem
joining the national team.

399
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,199
He's likely

400
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,359
to shine on the world stage

401
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,199
and win glory for our country.

402
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
I'm reluctant to let him go as well,

403
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,400
but for the good of Shen,

404
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,479
I have to let him go.

405
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,560
After all, it concerns his prospects.

406
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,239
Training at the national team level

407
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:27,839
is different

408
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,839
from the training we are doing here.

409
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,199
All right.

410
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,560
Go back and help him

411
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
to pack up.

412
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:37,800
And bring the registration form

413
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,719
to him.

414
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
(Registration Form for Tests of High-level
Athletes Recruited Nationwide in 2019)

415
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,319
Miss Tang,

416
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,199
you've taken so many photos
of Captain Shen.

417
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,160
He's been picked
for the national training team.

418
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,239
Aren't you happy?

419
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,680
Of course, I am.

420
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,880
There's no need to worry.

421
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:14,839
Captain Shen

422
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,239
is not a fickle man.

423
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,400
And the training team

424
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,520
has a lot of heavy training to do,

425
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,680
so he'll have no time

426
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,199
to flirt with other girls.

427
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,239
I know.

428
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,280
That's not what I'm worried about.

429
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:30,680
What are you worried about then?

430
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,880
Maybe I kind of hate to part with him.

431
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,439
After so many years of separation,

432
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,560
we've managed to be together again.

433
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,680
Little did I think

434
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,199
we'd part again soon.

435
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,400
A few months will pass quickly.

436
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,640
Captain,

437
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,520
Miss Tang is in a bad mood.

438
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,479
I reckon
she has a separation anxiety disorder.

439
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,040
After all, you've just been together.

440
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,040
She hates to part with you.

441
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,280
What's wrong?

442
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,239
Nothing.

443
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:28,920
Here.

444
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:30,359
This is your registration form.

445
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,119
Keep it safe.

446
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,719
If I join the training team,

447
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,040
I'll have to go

448
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,280
to another city for training.

449
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,359
I heard about it.

450
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,959
You are going to train
with seeded players

451
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:43,760
from all over the country.

452
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,319
But I'm sure

453
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:46,839
you'll be fine.

454
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,640
Shen Qingyuan

455
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,000
is the best wherever he goes.

456
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,199
Do you want me to go?

457
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,079
Of course.

458
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,839
Here, your registration form.

459
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:58,560
Have a look.

460
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,079
I'm starting off as soon as this week.

461
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,920
We'll have to make preparations then.

462
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,000
It'll be quite a few months.

463
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,280
We've got lots of things to prepare.

464
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,199
Look through
the registration form first.

465
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,599
I'm going to the bathroom.

466
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:40,839
Xiaoci?

467
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,000
Hate to part with him?

468
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,680
No.

469
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,719
It's a good thing to be picked

470
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,000
for the national training team.

471
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:06,880
Is it?

472
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,239
All right.

473
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,119
Send my congrats to Captain Shen.

474
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,239
I'm off for now.

475
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,719
Xiaoci,

476
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,680
you…

477
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,239
Don't worry.

478
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,880
The national training team list is not

479
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,040
the official national team list.

480
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,319
Members have to go through selections

481
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,400
to join the national team.

482
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,400
I'll join too later.

483
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,359
Livestreamer, don't be upset.

484
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,280
Here, wipe off your tears.

485
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,760
Who wants your sweat-absorbing tissue?

486
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:01,479
Xiaoci didn't take it

487
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,520
when she came out just now, did she?

488
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,280
I have plenty of tissues.

489
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,880
I could see Xiaoci was in a bad mood.

490
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,040
Why don't you spend some time with her?

491
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,439
It's OK.

492
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,760
Xiaoci and I

493
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,920
are in sweet love at the moment.

494
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,599
She's only being sad for a moment.

495
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,640
When Shen Qingyuan is away,

496
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,839
she'll have plenty of time

497
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,719
to spend with me.

498
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,719
Do I even have to worry

499
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:22,479
I can't heal her wound and pain?

500
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:26,640
Livestreamer.

501
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:28,839
Don't be upset.

502
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,520
It's not separation by death.

503
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,719
In the coming days,
when you want to pour out your trouble

504
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,959
or when you want to drink,

505
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,160
remember

506
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,280
to come to me anytime you like.

507
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,000
What are you doing?

508
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,199
Shen Qingyuan,

509
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:41,079
are you being overly jealous?

510
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:42,839
I was comforting her just now.

511
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,800
Look at her,

512
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,640
in what way is she better than Xiaoci?

513
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:48,959
In what way is she not good?

514
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,920
She's good. She's good.

515
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,680
She's good in every way.

516
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,920
So you just latch onto her.

517

can you not be so old-fashioned

578
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,079

Shen Qingyuan is leaving

has just started to show momentum.

If Shen Qingyuan

611
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,959
goes to the national training team,

612
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,119
not only will we fail
to promote the duo,

613
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,800
what's the point of doing it

614
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,199
while the rising star is gone?

615
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,199
The national training team

616
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,520
is certainly off-limits to us.

617

The national training team list

620
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,640
is not the final list
of the national team.

621
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,920
In the end, members will be finalized

622
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,760
through selections.

623
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
So Shen Qingyuan

624
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,959
can still stay here for training

625
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,959
and things will be fine

626
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,280
as long as
he can pass the final selection, right?

627
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,439
Mr. Zhou,

628
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,400
this is something

629
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,680
that concerns his prospects.

630
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,439
We can't just think about ourselves.

631
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:52,280
Right.

632
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:58,160
If he doesn't go,

633
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,280
the rising star

634
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
will probably become

635
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,479
a has-been.

636
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,119
Then there's only one way left.

637
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,719
Help me squeeze

638
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,520
the final value out of Shen Qingyuan.

639
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,760
Squeeze him dry?

640
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,880

Do you have to be so "thirsty"?

646
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,079
What am I thirsty for?

647
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,040
I just want
to squeeze Shen Qingyuan dry.

648
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,920
Squeeze Shen Qingyuan dry?

649
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,199
Sorry, sorry.

you stop focusing

672
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:43,760
Right.

673
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,199

are you

00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,560
What's the big deal?

688
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,640
Is this what makes you anxious

689
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,800
to the point
of having an endocrine disorder?

690
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,439
It's a bit hard to squeeze him dry.

691
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,319
But we businesspeople

692
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,119
all do something called
stocking up at low prices.

693
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:08,880
Right.

694
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:10,160
Stocking up.

695
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,239
Doesn't it make sense?

696
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,079
At least it can tide you over

697
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,160
his winter training period.

698
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,800
I think

699
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,079
it's better

700
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,880
to stock up on the goods of your duo.

701
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:18,959
How does this sound?

702
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,319
I'll have a set of life portrait photos
taken for you guys

703
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,800
and post one from time to time

704
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,760
to keep up the popularity.

705
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,439
What do you think?

706
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,599
Sounds good.

707
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,719
How shall I pose before the camera?

708
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,400
How fast she's going!

709
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,199
Are you here to see me?

710
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,239
No.

711
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,719
Yes.

712
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:44,680
No?

713
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,599
You were contacting him yesterday.

714
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,079
Him?

715
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:52,760
Du Lingfeng.

I'll have a set of life portrait photos
taken for you guys

and post one from time to time

719
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,199
Of course not.

720
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:05,359
Don't guess blindly.

721
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,719
Well, I've got things to do.

722
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,640
I'm off.

723
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:10,439
You are here to see me indeed.

724
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,520
Shen Qingyuan,

725
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,280
why are you like a broken record?

726
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,120
Remember your check mark.

727
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,959
See you at home.

728
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,919
Are you guys

729
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,360
acting as the Gods of Door?

730
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:26,639
You are blocking the way here.

731
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,919
We are not the Gods of Door.

732
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,800
- We are…
- We are…

733
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,239
- Shen's Exclusive Wingman Group.
- Shen's Exclusive Wingman Group.

734
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:34,879
How can I help?

735
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,040
Mr. Du,

736
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,639
out of the utmost kindness,

737
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,520
I suggest you

738
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,399
stay far away from Miss Tang.

739
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,959
The farther, the better.

740
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,639
Because Miss Tang

741
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:46,479
has been tagged by Captain Shen.

742
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,080
What?

743
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,360
Tagged?

744
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,520
Yes, as it says on the internet.

745
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,000
Their pheromones match

746
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,399
with one-to-one exclusive tagging.

747
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,439
So

748
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:57,080
Captain Shen belongs to Miss Tang.

749
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,919
For the same reason,

750
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,159
Miss Tang belongs to Captain Shen.

751
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,280
You two

752
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:07,760
are worrywarts.

753
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,439
Have you found a way?

754
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:24,879
Thank you so much for your idea.

755
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,280
Now give me a laptop,

756
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:27,479
and I can save the Earth.

757
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,159
You deserve to be our Rui Live's

758
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,479
livestreamer with the biggest increase
in fan base.

759
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,080
You nailed it so soon.

760
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
You rock!

761
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:37,040
HR brought the letters just now.

762
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,280
They are from your fans.

763
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,879
There are even people
who send hand-written letters nowadays.

764
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:42,320
They must be showing
their true feelings.

765
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,560
Remember to read them
when you have time.

766
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,080
OK.

767
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,000
(Plan for Themes
of Shen-Du Duo's Photo Album)

768
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,439
Tang Xin,

769
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:56,320
we are going first.

770
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,520
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

771
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,399
Tang Xin, I'm off.

772
00:36:58,399 --> 00:36:59,479
- Bye.
- Bye.

773
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:00,800
Bye.

Why are you so late?
