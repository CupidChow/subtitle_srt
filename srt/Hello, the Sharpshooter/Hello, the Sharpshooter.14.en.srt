=Episode 14=

35
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:40,480
So?

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,519
Have you found a way

37
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,360
to recover the data?

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,239
You mean

39
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,279
we can only

40
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,639
prove the photo was forged?

41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,360
It's fine.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
It was my fault.

43
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,080
I know.

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,519
If I'm defined

45
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,839
as R-rated,

46
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:06,160
I won't be able to livestream again.

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,119
I have accepted the reality.

48
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,320
Don't worry about me.

49
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,240
You?

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,119
R-rated livestreaming?

51
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,080
Is your boss blind?

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,399
You heard everything?

53
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,199
Did you see Hai?

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,000
No.

55
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:43,080
Captain Shen reported
his early leave last time,

56
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,600
and Coach let him off.

57
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,160
If he runs late again,

58
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
he'll be written up.

59
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,839
Yeah.

60
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,679
Chen Hai is late.

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,039
He'll be punished
according to team rules.

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,199
C-Captain Shen. Captain Shen.

63
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,800
- Captain.
- Captain.

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,320
Wait a minute.

65
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
I'm sure

66
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,440
he's late

67
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,360
because of some sort of emergency.

68
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll call him

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,839
to ask him to rush over.

70
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:58,759
Right, right, right. Call him at once.

71
00:02:59,119 --> 00:02:59,720
Captain Shen, trust me.

72
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,759
I'll scold him.

73
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,679
What is wrong with him?

74
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:08,919
He's picked up.

75
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,880
Hai, what are you doing?

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,720
The training is about to begin.

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,679
You're supposed to be here.

78
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,639
Captain is mad.

79
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,639
Hello.

80
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,639
This is Double-gun Club.

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,119
Do you wish to speak to Coach Chen Hai?

82
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,240
He left his cellphone here.

83
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,240
C-Coach?

84
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,679
Coach?

85
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,480
- Hai is a coach now?
- He's a coach?

86
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,279
Captain.

87
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,039
Tang Xin,

88
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,440
you can't give in.

89
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,360
You must dig out the truth.

90
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,039
Never give up. You know?

91
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,479
Thank you.

92
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,039
Sometimes,

93
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,320
you do need to be blindly persistent.

94
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,520
If you need

95
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,440
any of my help,

96
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,000
just let me know.

97
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,160
Thank you, Xiaoci.

98
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,320
It's okay.

99
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,679
I'm off to the training ground.

100
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Why isn't Hai here yet?

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

102
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,160
Hai.

103
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,880
Where were you?

104
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,640
Where is your cellphone?

105
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,920
I for-forgot to bring it with me.

106
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,760
Just go and explain yourself

107
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,640
to Captain Shen.

108
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,320
You left your cellphone at the club.

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,799
And it just happened

110
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,760
that everybody heard it.

111
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,399
Yes.

112
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,880
What did he say?

113
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,519
Nothing.

114
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,000
Just tell him that you're sorry.

115
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,040
Yes. Apologize properly.

116
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
C-Chen Hai is here.

117
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
You get it figured out first.

118
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,519
Captain.

119
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,119
Sorry

120
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,799
for running late for training.

121
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,880
You can punish me.

122
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,320
Are you working

123
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
as a personal trainer at a club?

124
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,679
Silence means yes.

125
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,839
Yes.

126
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
I am working as a personal trainer.

127
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,119
Write me up.

128
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:20,920
Hai…

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,040
Being late is a small error

130
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,799
while working as a personal trainer
is a serious violation of team rules.

131
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:26,000
Look at your behavior and status.

132
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:26,880
It's a waste of team resources

133
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,119
having you in the winter training.

134
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,679
What do you mean?

135
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,119
Shen Qingyuan, back off!

136
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,119
Hai.

137
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,519
Hai, calm down.

138
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,559
You and Coach Zhang can talk it out.

139
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:40,959
With a humble tone.

140
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,399
Why would I talk it out with him?

141
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,279
A waste of team resources?

142
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm on the team

143
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,920
because I'm a good shooter.

144
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,040
Did you ever

145
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,160
have any respect for me,
Shen Qingyuan?

146
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,600
Hai.

147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,920
I'll inform Coach Zhang right now

148
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
that you aren't
going to the winter training.

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,839
Shen Qingyuan.

150
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,519
- Hai!
- Hai.

151
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:11,920
- Captain.
- Captain.

152
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,119
Captain, are you okay?

153
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,160
- Captain.
- Captain, are you okay?

154
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
Are you okay?

155
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,160
- Are you okay?
- Captain.

156
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,160
- Chen Hai,
- Hai.

157
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,040
look what you did!

158
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,279
You hurt his arm.

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,040
Why didn't you dodge?

160
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,279
He's a man.

161
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,359
It's just a minor injury.

162
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,160
What's the big deal?

163
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,160
Du Lingfeng,

164
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,079
what do you know?

165
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,880
The upper arm of the gun-holding hand

166
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,720
is everything

167
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,399
to a shooter.

168
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,119
Let's go to the infirmary.

169
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:40,839
I'm okay.

170
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:44,239
Captain.

171
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,279
All right, enough.

172
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,399
Get back to the training.

173
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:56,920
Xiaoci,

174
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
why did you defend him?

175
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,640
I think Chen Hai

is the aggrieved one.

177
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:01,640
He just kicked him out
of the winter training

178
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,040
without a proper reason.

181
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,640
That was totally inhuman of him.

182
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,399
Du Lingfeng,

183
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,079

00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,559
Shooting is a solo sport.

In fact, all of us will go.

275
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,039
There must be a reason

276
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,280
for Chen Hai to act like that.

277
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,239
This will be a one-off thing.

281
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,559

282
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,679
hurtful words

283
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,320
like a waste of resources later.

284
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,520

I'm not the only one who would feel bad.

Don't worry.

292
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,559
Captain Shen won't do it.

293
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,840

294
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,919

You're back.

298
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,799
Please let me through.

299
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,039
Please, Hai.

300
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,359
Captain is going to say sorry.

301
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,039
No need.

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,400
I'm getting out
of the crappy place anyway.

303

304
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,960

305
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,479
Don't be ridiculous.

306
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,039
Hai.

307
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,520
Hai,

308
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,039
please think it over.

309
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,880
I'm sure you're aware

310
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,119
that we were enrolled
as sports students.

311
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,599
Right, Hai.

312
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,239
Quitting the team means
you're dropping out of the university.

313
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,760
A Haiya University master's degree

314
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,239
is valuable.

315
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,200
Captain,

316
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,359

317
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:10,799
Miss Tang,

318
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,039

319
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,479
Just try to keep Chen Hai here.

320
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,320
Hai, give it a second thought.

321
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,119
Can't you help Captain Shen

322
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,000
talk Hai around?

323
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:25,880
It's pointless.

324
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,479
Because he doesn't have
the willingness to win.

325
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,840
I have.

326
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,039
You think

327
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,159
I don't want to train hard?

328
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,080
I had more extra training

329
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
than each and every one of you!

330
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:48,799
You think

331
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,880
I work as a personal trainer

332
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,840
because all I care about

333
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
is money, right?

334
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400

335
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,320
I didn't have to

336
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,840
hold the pistol

337
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,599
with the aim of the prize money.

338
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,440
Hai.

339
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,400
I wish

340
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,320
I could be a shooter
of pure aspiration, too.

341
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,919
You're having a financial problem?

342
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,599
- Captain.
- Captain.

343
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,799
I didn't mean to tease you.

344
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,280
Hai.

345
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,320
He didn't mean by that.

346
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,919
He was just being blunt.

347
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,719
- Hai.
- Hai.

348
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,960
He just left like that?

349
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,599
Shen Qingyuan.

350
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,400
About this thing,

351
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,320
you'll have to deal with it on your own.

352
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,320
What happened?

353
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,239
Nothing.

354
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,239
An accident.

355
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,039
Shen,

356
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,320
about Chen Hai,

357
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,200
you know, right?

358
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,520
I wonder how their conversation is.

359
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,799
I bet

360
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,400
it isn't over.

361
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,200
Really?

362
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,599
Yes, it was Chen Hai's fault,

363
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,840
but everything happens

364
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,080
for a reason.

365
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,679
I know you.

366
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,080
You are not a trouble-maker.

367
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,080
Young people have frictions.

368
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,000
That's normal.

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,760
But it can't grow into antagonism.

370
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,960
You're the captain.

371
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,200
I hope,

372
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,520
on condition that the training
goes unaffected,

373
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,080
that you try to coordinate.

374
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,919
But with Chen Hai,

375
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,200
I was only following the rules.

376
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,760
I never wanted him

377
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,599
to quit.

378
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,039
Well, sometimes,

379
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,159
you can bend the rules a little.

380
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,239
The rules

381
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:52,679
are to help you train better.

382
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,200
If they are counterproductive,

383
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,479
then they aren't really fulfilling
the purpose.

384
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,280
Am I right?

385
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,239
I see.

386
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,599
But don't feel pressured.

387
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:01,719
I'm only offering you a tip.

388
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,320
You do what you think is the best
with Chen Hai.

389
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,159
Okay?

390
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,599
Alright,

391
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,320
you do your thing, then.

392
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:11,719
Okay.

393
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:22,599
- Captain.
- Captain.

394
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,119
H-How did it go?

395
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,000
Coach said

396
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,320
I could handle it myself.

397
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,280
So…

398
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,719
Are you going

399
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,799
to get Chen Hai back on the team?

400
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,320
Shen Qingyuan?

401
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,719
Who has Chen Hai's address?

402
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,760
Me. I have it.

403
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,840
9 o'clock tomorrow morning,

404
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,799
you lead the way.

405
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:49,679
You got it.

406
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,960
You said

407
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,840
Chen Hai acted like that

408
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,080
for a particular reason.

409
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,280
Let's figure it out together.

410
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:02,760
Sure.

411
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,479
That's all you said?

412
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,719
It hasn't been quiet within the team.

413
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,839
After this thing gets sorted,

414
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,800
I'll work out a way

415
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,719
to discipline the kids.

416
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,599
You just gave him the form?

417
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,319
It didn't count as I didn't sign it.

418
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,160
After years

419
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,439
of hanging out with young people,

420
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,319
you're like

421
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,520
one of them, too.

422
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,839
Yeah.

423
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,000
It isn't easy

424
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,319
to deal with those kids.

425
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,959
They're like the spring.

426
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:27,920
They're super sensitive.

427
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,680
You need to appease them
before you discipline them.

428
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,079
It's good

429
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,319
that they try to sort it out
by themselves first.

430
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
But how come you're so confident

431
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,239
that Shen Qingyuan can handle it well?

432
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,479
Just give him a chance.

433
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,079
I'll clean up his mess if I have to.

434
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,319
Tang Xin is with him.

435
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,800
I think he's good.

436
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,520
Dr. Ding,

437
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
as the team's

438
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,800
mental-health counselor,

439
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,079
you aren't supposed to encourage
any romantic relationship.

440
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,079
I know. I know.

441
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,839
I'll turn a blind eye to it.

442
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,319
As long as they get good results,

443
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,520
I'll keep my lips sealed.

444
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,239
This video

445
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,959
should be the last piece of my work

446
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,800
that is related to the shooting team.

447
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,439
I'd like to edit it well

448
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,520
over the weekend.

449
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:33,520
I'll see it

450
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,959
as a summary

451
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,599
of my previous endeavors.

456
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:12,920
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

457
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,479
I've received

458
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:15,239
the mashup.

459
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,079
I didn't expect you
to be so highly effective.

460
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,239
You finished the editing so fast.

461
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,760
Yes, Mr. Zhou.

462
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,119
It's my job.

463
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,280
Is there a problem?

464
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,920
I'll fix it.

465
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,199
No, no.

466
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,119
It's pretty good.

467
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,560
You're still the same.

468
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:33,719
Tang Xin.

469
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,719
How about you get some rest

470
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:36,959
at home for the time being?

471
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,479
The verdict is on the way.

472
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Okay, Mr. Zhou.

be superstitious?

480

Where is he going?

Is he going to the university
to say sorry?

It's not the right direction.

Go.

some strange diseases?

pay the full amount as soon as you can.

Could you please

513
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:03,839
pay me next month's

514
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,079
coaching fee upfront?

Mr. Chen,

517
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm really sorry,

518
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,319
but the club

519
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,119
made certain rules.

520
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,599
And a part-time trainer

521
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,640
isn't our regular employee,

522
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,880
so I really can't

523
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,199
pay you upfront.

524
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,239
I'm really sorry.

525
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,160
It's… It's okay.

526
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,839
Thanks anyway, Mr. Liu.

527
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:27,719
No problem.

528
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,319
Mom.

529
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,479
Why did you get out of your ward?

530
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,359
Son,

531
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,880
I don't want the treatment anymore.

532
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,000
Let's go home.

533
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,239
I'll take my time
getting better at home.

534
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,400
It costs too much money here.

535
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,400
Mom,

536
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,920
I've told you so many times

537
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,319
that you take the medical treatment here

538
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,160
and think about nothing else.

539
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,239
I've sorted out the money problem.

540
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,079
Really?

541
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:55,880
Yeah.

542
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,400
Trust me.

543
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,719
Let's get back to your ward.

544
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,719
Why aren't you at the training center?

545
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,680
I'm an excellent shooter.

546
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,119
My captain said

547
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,119
that I could skip training for two days.

548
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,400
Don't worry about me.

549
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:09,880
Thank you, Son.

550
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,599
Hey, would they

551
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,000
get into a fight in there?

552
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,000
I'd better get inside and check.

553
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,160
What are you talking about?

554
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,199
- Captain.
- Captain.

555
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,040
How was it?

556
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,359
Let's get back to the campus.

557
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,760
Inform the team members

558
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,560
to gather at the shooting center
one hour later.

559
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,520
Let's go.

560
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,239
Go.

561
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,440
(Haiya People's Hospital)

562
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:51,760
That's why.

563
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,400
No wonder he's in short of money.

564
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,520
What can we do?

565
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,000
A donation.

566
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:03,079
Okay.

567
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:04,359
Captain, I'll be the first.

568
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,040
- Come on.
- Here.

569
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,400
I'll scan it.

570
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,040
- Come on.
- I'll scan it, too.

571
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,760
Me, too.

572
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,079
Let's scan the code.

573
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,520
If Hai doesn't return,

574
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,199
then there goes

575
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,199
- my allowance.
- Me, too.

576
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,719
I've made the transfer.

577
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,520
I'll scan it, too.

578
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,040
Done.

579
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,760
You're quite thoughtful.

580
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,280
Our live streamer taught you?

581
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:28,920
How much more does he need?

582
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:29,880
I'll cover it.

583
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,040
Way to go, Boss Du.

584
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,640
Why didn't you say so earlier?

585
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,920
So that I wouldn't make the transfer.

586
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,520
You should've said it earlier, Boss Du.

587
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:35,760
So generous!

588
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,599
Boss Du, can we get a refund?

589
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,119
Thank you, Du Lingfeng.

590
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,520
- Thank you, Boss Du.
- Thank you, Boss Du.

591
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,760
- Thank you, Boss Du.
- How generous of you, Boss Du!

592
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,840
Yes, very generous of you.

593
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,439
Here.

594
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,560
Okay.

595
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,319
Hello.

596
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,520
I'm here to pay the bill.

597
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,280
Wait a minute.

598
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,719
Sorry, I don't have enough money.

599
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:08,400
But take all I have, please.

600
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,719
I'll pay it off the next time.

601
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:11,160
Mr. Chen,

602
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,040
your mother's medical bill

603
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,079
has been paid off.

604
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,599
P-Paid off?

605
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,280
Yes.

606
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,880
A Mr. Shen paid for it.

607
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:26,920
9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

608
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,959
Training in the shooting center.

609
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,880
I knew you were here.

610
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:58,959
What's wrong?

611
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:01,439
Have you noticed

612
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:02,640
there's something wrong

613
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,680
about Tang Xin?

614
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,680
What do you mean?

615
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,280
It's about her job.

616
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,800
Why isn't Hai here yet?

617
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,800
What?

618
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,520
Hai.

619
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:38,640
Chen Hai.

620
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,520
Hai.

621
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,800
Hai.

622
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,839
You're back.

623
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,560
You're back.

624
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,760
Hi.

625
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,160
One can't be judged by appearance.

626
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,079
You have your difficulty,

627
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:03,760
and I didn't know it.

628
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,439
Look.

629
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,959
Captain Shen
has gotten much more mature.

630
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,719
He took the initiative
to make an apology.

631
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,760
Yeah, Hai.

632
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Just stay.

633
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,319
Do you really

634
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,160
see this as a crappy place?

635
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,680
- Yeah.
- Stay.

636
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,199
No.

637
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,640
I never saw it

638
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,560
as a crappy place.

639
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,959
I was just mad.

640
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:24,880
Hai.

641
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,319
You have been

642
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,280
training so hard.

643
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,920
It would be a shame if you quit.

644
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,479
Right.

645
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,560
We've helped

646
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,800
solve your money problem.

647
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,400
Now it's your turn

648
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,640
to make a choice.

649
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,319
To be a personal trainer

650
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,760
or to stay here

651
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,400
to earn greater honor?

652
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,040
- Hai.
- Stay.

653
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,280
- Hai, please stay.
- Just stay.

654
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,680
- We can't be without you.
- We need you.

655
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,319
I'll stay.

656
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:52,439
Great!

657
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,239
Terrific!

658
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:57,839
Great.

659
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,280
Another happy ending.

660
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,520
Thank you
for paying off the medical bill.

661
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:03,000
I'll pay you back.

662
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,079
Don't thank me.

663
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,560
Everybody

664
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,800
made a donation.

665
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,719
Oh, yeah.

666
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,439
And Du Lingfeng.

667
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,800
He contributed a lot.

668
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:11,439
Yes.

669
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:20,199
Thank you all.

670
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,760
- Come on, Hai.
- It's fine.

671
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,640
Hai.

672
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,760
If you have any problems ever again,

673
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,160
just tell us.

674
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,959
Yeah.

675
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,400
I told you, right?

676
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,040
We leave no one behind.

677
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,439
Right.

678
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,280
Leave no one behind.

679
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:33,880
If you

680
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,359
need anything at the hospital,

681
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,119
just let me know.

682
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:37,400
I know the dean pretty well.

683
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,199
Just speak to Boss Du.

684
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,599
After all I said and did,

685
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,479
can I really stay?

686
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:53,280
- Sure.
- Of course.

687
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:54,920
But

688
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,760
I'll still write you up.

689
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:02,359
Captain Shen,

690
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,680
that's harsh.

691
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,640
You saved it for the final hit.

692
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,719
A team member broke the rules,

693
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:06,599
so I surely need to write him up.

694
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,079
It was my mistake.

695
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,680
I accept it.

696
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,079
And I'll make up

697
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,000
for the training that I missed.

698
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,199
Okay.

699
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,000
When Chen Hai just joined the team,

700
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:17,439
he was the best.

701
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:20,040
In the Youth Games six years ago,

702
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,959
he won the first place.

703
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:21,640
He was

704
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,119
promising as Shen Qingyuan now.

705
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,599
Let's start the training.

706
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
- Keep your chin up.
- Keep it up, Hai!

707
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,400
- Keep it up, Hai!
- We believe in you, Hai.

708
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,280
- Keep it up!
- Go for it, Hai!

709
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,079
- Keep it up!
- Keep it up!

710
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,000
Training time, Hai.

711
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,520
Training time.

712
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,199
Have some water.

713
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,599
Now that this is sorted out,

714
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,760
next should be our business.

715
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:45,959
Our business?

716
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,239
The shoe-shopping.

717
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,040
We made an agreement

718
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,479
that I'd go with you.

719
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,239
And then?

720
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,640
Chen Hai is in a single-parent family.

721
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,119
He's an introvert.

722
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,319
He's an old-school shooter

723
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,079
that grew up in a quiet environment.

724
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,640
But after London Olympic Games,

725
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
in order to cater to the audience,

726
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,000
the Shooting Sport Federation

727
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,599
changed the rules.

728
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,079
Audience is encouraged
to cheer for the shooters.

729
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,560
Chen Hai can't really
accommodate himself to it.

730
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,239
So ever since then,

731
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,680
he's been in an unstable state,

732
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,319
and he never won
any good places in games.

733
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,199
But he always trains hard.

734
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:22,560
He never gives up.

735
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,760
So this time…

736
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,319
A while ago,

737
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,719
his mother had a serious illness.

738
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,079
I just learned about it.

739
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,719
He's a withdrawn boy

740
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,160
who likes to shoulder the burden
on his own.

741
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,040
We have this rule

742
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,319
that no one on the team is allowed
to work as a personal trainer.

743
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,040
But it pays well.

744
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,479
So he secretly got a side job.

745
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,880
And as you've already known,

746
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,800
Shen caught him.

747
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:46,239
I feel sorry for the boy.

748
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,319
Was there no follow-up

749
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,040
psychological intervention

750
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,079
in relation to Chen Hai's mental health?

751
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,839
We didn't pay attention to that before.

752
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,719
Maybe now,

753
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:56,839
we still have a chance.

754
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,839
Not to mention he and I

755
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,040
share a similar past.

756
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:02,000
You?

757
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,319
You never heard

758
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,160
that during therapy,

759
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,760
a psychologist

760
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,640
needs to moderately expose

761
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,599
some of his weak points

762
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,719
so it's easier

763
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,319
to gain the patient's trust?

764
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,520
But I won't share

765
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,839
my past with you, though.

766
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,439
You know, Dr. Ding,

767
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,280
only the best survives
in the shooting team.

768
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,520
It can't be helped.

769
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,719
But I always try to keep as many

770
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,079
potential medal-winners as I can.

771
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,319
Deep down,

772
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,319
I have my own judgment.

773
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:31,839
So please,

774
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,959
if possible,

775
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,800
just talk as much as you can

776
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,479
with those kids in private.

777
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:38,479
Sure.

778
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,719
How do you like the shoes?

779
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,319
D-Do they look nice?

780
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,959
Yeah. Yeah.

781
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,160
They make your skin look whiter.

782
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,319
Do they fit?

783
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,319
Of course, they do!

784
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:52,959
Look.

785
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,280
It's made of the softest material.

786
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:02,959
Too hard.

787
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,520
Sorry.

788
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,800
Let's try another store.

789
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,199
Okay.

790
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,640
Thank you.

791
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,040
S-Sorry.

792

They feel okay.

793
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,959
Try to walk around if you like them.

794
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:21,839
See if they hurt your feet.

795
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,959
Good. I'll take them.

796
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,119
Got the new ones?

797
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:37,640
Yeah.

798
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:38,680
Fetch a new pair for me, please.

799
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,280
- Thank you.
- Okay.

800
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,640
How do you like your new shoes?

801
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,560
