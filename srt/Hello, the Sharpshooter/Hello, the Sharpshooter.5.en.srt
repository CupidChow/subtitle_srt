=Episode 5=

35
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,559
Xiaoci.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,319
You are coming...

37
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,959
Right toward me.

38
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:51,800
Of course.

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,160
You are the sponsor.

40
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,480
I certainly

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,080
should be active.

42
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,760
Right?

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,959
I'm flattered.

44
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,760
You are

45
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,040
making me awkward.

46
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,080
Actually, shooting

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,440
has been my dream.

48
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,760
Xiaoci,

49
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,080
how will you repay me?

50
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,040
Before that,

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,600
report your information

52
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,960
of age, weight, and height to me.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,839
Hug?
[*"Report" is a homophone of "hug" in Chinese.]

54
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,279
Be calm.

55
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,679
You are a shooter.

56
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,759
When did you switch to taekwondo?

57
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,520
Fill it out yourself.

58
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,000
What is it?

59
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,479
Come. I have something to tell you.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,800
What is it?

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,000
Xiaoci,

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,960
why are you striking up an acquaintance

63
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,880
with Du Lingfeng?

64
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,240
He's crazy about headlines.

65
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,080
Don't you know?

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,240
I'm not one of his acquaintances.

67
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,399
Who are you fooling?

68
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,919
You were punching him like a sandbag
just now

69
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,039
and he didn't even punch back.

70
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,399
Is that what you call acquaintance?

71
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,399
I found you have

72
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,479
very dangerous thoughts.

73
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,800
Beware of falling victim

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,559
to domestic abuse.

75
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,559
You are obviously the domestic abuser
at the moment,

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,479
OK?

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,800
All right, there is no abuse.

78
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,320
Let me give you a hug, OK?
[*"Abuse" is a homophone of "hug" in Chinese.]

79
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,559
But you must not
maintain contact with him often.

80
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:17,520
He's a notorious

81
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,639
playboy.

82
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,199
How could I not know that?

83
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,880
Since you know that,

84
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,360
you should stay further away from him.

85
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,240
He's a danger.

86
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,039
Now he's our teammate.

87
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,559
How can I keep him at a distance?

88
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,520
Is it hard to do so

89
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,279
if you want to?

90
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,320
But

91
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,559
such a playboy like him

92
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,119
deserves to be trampled on by someone.

93
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,600
What? You are gonna ruin him?

94
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,440
Trample on.

95
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,639
Trample on.

96
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,080
When it comes to trampling on him,

97
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,000
nobody is better than you are.

98
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,479
You just

99
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,839
concentrate on your training.

100
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,399
Don't worry so much about me.

101
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,960
All right.

102
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,119
(Du Lingfeng)
Hey, guys.

103
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,720
(Du Lingfeng)
Sharp-eyed and level-headed shooter

104
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,759
Du Lingfeng reports arrival.

105
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,759
Mr. Zhou.

106
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm back.

107
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,559
From the dejected look on your face,

108
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:14,839
all right,

109
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,160
no need to ask.

110
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,720
What's the reason?

111
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,720
He says…

112
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,399
You are an eyesore to him.

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,480
Why don't you ask him for me

114
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,920
how to not be an eyesore?

115
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:32,799
Mr. Zhou,

116
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,640
why don't we try

117
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,799
other sports?

118
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,640
Like the city marathon

119
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
yesterday,

120
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,399
which I think was well received.

121
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,880
As I've told you umpteen times,

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,119
we are different from other

123
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:42,920
livestreaming platforms.

124
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,079
Rui Live is pursuing
a more professional,

125
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,559
longer-term route.

126
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,559
That's why I keep stressing the need to

127
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:48,399
align with the Olympic Games,

128
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,720
align with the Olympic Games.

129
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,000
I see.

130
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,720
All right, you can go.

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
I'll see what I can do.

132
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,519
Mr. Zhou's team

133
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,760
is having such bad luck.

134
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,160
How can that be?

135
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,720
I heard just today that

136
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,359
Du Lingfeng entered

137
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,559
their partnership shooting team,

138
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,519
which is a trending topic
on social media.

139
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,160
It's not their partnership team.

140
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,760
Now Lingda Group

141
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,040
is going to cut off
their broadcasting rights

142
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,200
and senior management is discussing

143
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
how to stop the loss.

144
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,000
It's very likely

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,440
they'll cut off funding to Mr. Zhou

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,320
and call it quits.

147
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,600
Now without the two marquee names

148
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,760
of Haiya and Shen Qingyuan,

149
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
their team is sure to be cancelled.

150
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,000
Mr. Zhou,

151
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,959
I'm sure we'll make it.

152
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,160
I'll go and talk to Du Lingfeng again.

153
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,279
OK. I'll wait for your news.

154
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
How's it going now?

155
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,760
I'll go and talk to Du Lingfeng again.

156
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Good luck, Tang.

157
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,839
You look weak,

158
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,079
but I know you are a tough cookie.

159
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,079
Thank you, Lizi.

160
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,559
By the way,

161
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,720
you said you were feeling unwell
just now.

162
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,720
Remember to take this with water later.

163
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,600
Ganmaoling Granules?

164
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,640
That's very sweet of you.

165
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,040
By the way,

166
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,480
I haven't asked you about the anti-fan.

167
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,279
How are you getting on with that?

168
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,959
Not much.

169
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,679
She's still hurling abuses at me
on Super Topic.

170
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,200
That's not what I'm talking about.

171
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,119
I mean,

172
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,959
how are you getting on

173
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,679
with Shen Qingyuan?

174
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,880
Has your relationship been affected?

175
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,880
Don't bring him up.

176
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,320
I won't care about him anymore.

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,399
Ours is a working relationship at most.

178
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,000
What's going on?

179
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
(No.2 Canteen)

180
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:51,880
How come you have chicken livers

181
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,600
but I don't?

182
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,320
Here you are.

183
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,559
Xiaoci,

184
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,239
don't you think

185
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,359
our quality of life on campus

186
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,600
needs to be improved?

187
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,239
Isn't it too bland now?

188
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:14,920
What has that to do with you?

189
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,760
A little bland indeed.

190
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,839
That's why we want a sponsor

191
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,760
to improve

192
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,519
our living standard for us.

193
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,119
OK.

194
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,399
Do you know?

195
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,239
Last year an entrepreneur

196
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,119
donated a new building

197
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,440
to our university.

198
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:28,799
Well,

199
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,200
can we

200
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,440
set a small target first?

201
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,679
- 100 million?
- 100 million?

202
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,839
Well,

203
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,559
we should start with

204
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,559
improving the individual quality
of life,

205
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:44,200
shouldn't we?

206
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,320
Say, the food.

207
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,559
Food is the first necessity of people.

208
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,359
Our canteen

209
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,959
is one of the best quality.

210
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,799
Indeed.

211
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,000
It's good enough.

212
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,040
Hi, where are you?

213
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
I'll be right there.

214
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,519
I'm coming.

215
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,200
Come here.

216
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Here, put them here.

217
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,880
Look. Look.

218
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,920
- So many.
- So many.

219
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:14,480
Lay them all on here.

220
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,279
Isn't this over-the-top?

221
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,640
So many takeouts.

222
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,799
So many takeouts.

223
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,000
Isn't this too much?

224
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,119
Too over-the-top.

225
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,160
All right, all right, all right.

226
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,519
You've taken so much trouble.

227
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,760
It's nothing.

228
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,119
I mean

229
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,840
there's something even more troublesome.

230
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,479
I have a piece of great news for you.

231
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,280
We are athletes,

232
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,719
so we are not allowed to eat takeouts.

233
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,640
Right?

234
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

235
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,039
But don't be upset.

236
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,200
I think your takeouts

237
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,679
may come in handy for something.

238
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
For what?

239
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:56,919
Which

240
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:57,840
social media platform do you think

241
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,159
we'd better upload a video to?

242
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
As long as it has Mr. Du in it,

243
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,119
it's OK to upload it anywhere.

244
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,039
It's lunch for you guys.

245
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't take them away.

246
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,479
Xiaoci,

247
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,440
wait for me.

248
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,760
Ten minutes.

249
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,239
Captain,

250
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,760
I didn't see Miss Tang

251
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
come to our team.

252
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,119
Didn't you go to see her yesterday?

253
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,760
Eat.

254
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,320
But she went out at such a late hour.

255
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,640
In case something happened to her…

256
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
She came today.

257
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:57,479
I obviously didn't see her.

258
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,280
Eat.

259
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,599
Captain,

260
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,599
you and Miss Tang

261
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:06,320
are…

262
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,119
As I see it,

263
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,719
if there is really something
weighing on your mind,

264
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:15,719
don't bottle it up.

265
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,440
You see,

266
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,599
the food you eat goes to your stomach

267
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,599
where it can be digested.

268
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,200
But all those

269
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,159
messy moods,

270
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,200
if you swallow them,

271
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,840
they can't be easily digested.

272
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,039
Let me ask you.

273
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,599
If there is someone

274
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,840
who treats you as a stranger,

275
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:29,080
what are you gonna do?

276
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,599
Then I'll make the first move.

277
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,479
Just like me,

278
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,239
I followed you around every day

279
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,679
and upgraded myself from a stranger

280
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,559
to a friend of the Captain.

281
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,919
If this person also avoids you,

282
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,799
what are you gonna do?

283
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,919
Then take it one step at a time.

284
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,840
First show a gesture of goodwill

285
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,159
by doing her a favor every now and then

286
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,960
and talking to her

287
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,559
to make her feel

288
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,479
your existence.

289
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,599
You see,

290
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,080
I was just taking one step at a time,

291
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,159
one step at a time,

292
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,479
to walk into your heart.

293
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,440
Captain,

294
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,919
the person you are talking about,

295
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,440
could it be Miss Tang?

296
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,000
Eat.

297
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,719
Here. Have a piece of meat.

298
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,080
Thank you, Captain.

299
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,479
Why is Captain Shen so handsome?

300
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,159
Even his side face looks so handsome.

301
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,799
Do you want to go over and sit a while?

302
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:30,679
Let's go.

303
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm not one of his acquaintances.

304
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,280
I'll only make myself unwelcome
if I go.

305
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,200
Why don't you go instead?

306
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,960
When you are with him,

307
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,119
take more photos of him for me.

308
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:40,359
OK. I'll help you.

309
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,320
Xiaoci.

310
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,599
Captain Shen.

311
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,679
You are having a long lunch.

312
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,280
I've figured out the answer

313
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,919
to the question you asked me before.

314
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,039
Has it ever occurred to you that

315
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,479
from the very beginning actually,

316
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,479
you've just

317
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:07,479
confused the two problems?

318
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,159
The way to solve a shooting problem
and the way to solve…

319
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,440
To solve a problem about her

320
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
clash with each other,

321
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,599
but technically speaking,

322
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,960
they are two different things.

323
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,200
We focused on the former before,

324
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,039
but you want to work out both,

325
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,919
right?

326
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,280
Instead of being torn over one,

327
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,719
why don't you nail them both?

328
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,280
Why can't I get

329
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,880
what you are talking about?

330
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,119
Dr. Ding told me about it.

331
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,400
Xiaoci,

332
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
weren't you with that…?

333
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,559
This is my partner.

334
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:48,679
I'm talking to my partner for a while

335
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,919
after lunch.

336
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,280
Is there anything wrong?

337
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,320
You

338
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,479
should take the long view.

339
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,520
Maybe

340
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,840
he won't be your partner later on.

341
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,239
I'll talk to you instead, OK?

342
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,119
You've got a great eye.

343
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,679
Shall we switch to an empty table?

344
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,000
OK.

345
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,719
You follow good advice readily.

346
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:10,400
But…

347
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,599
Let's wait until that day comes.

348
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,559
Shen Qingyuan, do me a favor.

349
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,960
Let's swap seats.

350
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,039
How dare you be bossy with me?

351
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:37,679
No, no, no.

352
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,159
Mr. Du,

353
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:38,760
you probably

354
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,719
don't know Captain Shen very well.

355
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,239
He's a bit unfriendly to people,

356
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,280
not to you specifically.

357
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,640
Xiaoci,

358
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,840
I just bought this for you.

359
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,640
Stay away from her later on.

360
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,440
Who? Her?

361
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,239
Tang Xin.

362
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,479
I… Xiaoci…

363
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,479
Xiaoci,

364
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,640
don't fall for his nonsense.

365
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,599
There's no such a thing.

366
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,119
You just lead your own

367
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,239
high-quality life.

368
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:12,640
Why bother to explain to me?

369
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,119
That's good then.

370
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:17,520
Captain, where are you going?

371
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,400
To get something to drink.

372
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,960
I…

373
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,039
Xiaoci.

374
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,559
Here.

375
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,159
Mr. Du,

376
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:32,799
from what I can see,

377
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,719
do you want to court

378
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:34,799
Xiaoci?

379
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,960
What did you say?

380
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,000
I asked if you

381
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
want to court Xiaoci.

382
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,280
I can't hear you. Speak up.

383
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,359
I said, Mr. Du,

384
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,200
do you

385
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,039
want to court Xiaoci?

386
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,239
Xiaoci,

387
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,039
you see,

388
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,359
I'm making such a public confession.

389
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,719
Don't let

390
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:02,799
people's kindness go to waste,

391
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,760
all right?

392
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,760
Well, Mr. Du,

393
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,280
it's OK you usually play jokes

394
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,159
on others for fun.

395
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,080
Do you really want to

396
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,559
make it into headline news?

397
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,520
Just a moment. I…

398
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,919
I've got to take a call.

399
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,200
Where has

400
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,400
Du Lingfeng gone?

401
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,880
He geotagged his WeChat Moments here.

402
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:42,880
He's over there.

403
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,840
Are you not coming?

404
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,240
(No.2 Canteen)

405
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,799
I… Wait…

406
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,919
Well,

407
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,280
why are you playing the trick

408
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,080
of camping out to intercept me?

409
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,599
Please talk to me again.

410
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,119
You are so stubborn.

411
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,719
Why are you latching onto me?

412
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,760
Please, please, please.

413
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,159
Please resume the partnership with us.

414
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,960
I've talked to my company.

415
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,400
You can name whatever terms you want.

416
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,159
Our Rui Live

417
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,239
is open to discuss any terms.

418
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,359
Please. Please. Please.

419
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,119
You can be a bit of help.

420
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,239
It depends on
whether you like to do it or not.

421
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:44,880
I do.

422
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,919
Of course I do.

423
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,039
I've recently

424
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,320
joined the shooting team.

425
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,679
I also want to

426
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,119
contribute to
the university's socializing

427
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:51,960
and cultural exchange events.

428
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,119
I need an errand runner.

429
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,760
If you do a good job,

430
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,479
I can consider resuming the partnership.

431
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,000
No problem. I can do it.

432
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,239
Be on call.

433
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,640
Throw it away.

434
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,840
Little errand runner.

435
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,840
(Haiya University Gymnasium)

436
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,000
Captain, Captain.

437
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,760
Captain,

438
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,839
have you made up your mind so far

439
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,560
to court Miss Tang?

440
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,239
Who gives you the illusion?

441
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,319
When you were in the canteen,

442
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,400
I saw you

443
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,719
staking out your turf against Mr. Du's

444
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,680
over the issue of Miss Tang.

445
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:32,160
I just found

446
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,359
that guy annoying.

447
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,160
Captain Shen,

448
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,160
what about Miss Tang?

449
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,400
What's your attitude to her now?

450
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,040
Pheromone,

451
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,119
in the final analysis,
is a low-level instinct.

452
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:48,839
I want to

453
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,280
advance it onto a higher level.

454
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,119
A higher level?

455
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,959
Isn't that love?

456
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,839
Captain deserves to be a captain.

457
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,920
Such a complicated word

458
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,680
didn't even affect your performance.

459
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,439
It's too complicated.

460
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:04,800
Indeed.

461
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,599
Too complicated indeed.

462
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,520
Take it one step at a time.

463
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,119
Break through the stranger barrier first

464
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,439
before you do reflections

465
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,000
and make corrections

466
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,079
to go into battle again.

467
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,640
Captain, I'm talking too much.

468
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,439
Go on with your training.

469
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,239
I'll leave you alone.

470
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,439
Captain really gives us the creeps
as he always does.

471
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,599
What is he doing?

472
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,880
That's a habit of Captain Shen.

473
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,599
When he has several results below 9.5

474
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,199
for two sets of 30 bullets each,

475
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,920
he goes to run a few laps
on the sports field.

476
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,119
What's the big deal?

477
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
I can do it as well.

478
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,280
Jiang Yitian, come on.

479
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,439
Tally my records for me.

480
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,920
OK. I'll tally them for you.

481
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,040
Go ahead.

482
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,160
Enough.

483
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,359
You… You can stop shooting.

484
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,160
You can stop shooting.

485
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,880
Given your current result,

486
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,040
you'll have to run 30 laps.

487
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,520
What?

488
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,280
Yes.

489
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,920
I'll have to run 30 laps?

490
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,680
Yes.

491
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,040
Mr. Du, go for it.

492
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,040
Your result is so poor,

493
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,920
yet you are so confident.

494
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,479
I've got to hand it to you.

495
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,119
Move aside.

496
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,280
Xiaoci.

497
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,599
I'll try hard.

498
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,959
Even no safety flags.

499
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,760
Hi, livestreamer.

500
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,359
Bring me some water to the sports field.

501
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,520
Shen Qingyuan,

502
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,760
you are not a good runner.

503
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,640
What can you achieve
by running like this?

504
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,719
What can you achieve

505
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,119
if I get serious?

506
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,400
Good, Shen Qingyuan.

507
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,920
Why hasn't the livestreamer come yet?

508
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,359
No, thanks.

509
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:58,920
Wait a minute.

510
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,520
One of the water bottles is mine.

511
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,640
I'm coming. I'm coming.

512
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,439
I'm dead beat.

513
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,199
Are you doing a part-time job

514
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,599
because your company closed down?

515
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,719
I couldn't get a taxi,

516
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:16,599
so I got a scooter.

517
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,920
I was told to ride with a helmet on,

518
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
so I'm having it on.

519
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,680
This is your water.

520
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,439
Is it enough?

521
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,000
Well,

522
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,439
I'm baking in the sun

523
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:27,880
and you are bringing me
bottles of normal temperature water?

524
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,199
I forgot.

525
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,520
There are some ice cubes
in the incubator.

526
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,479
Let me go get some for you.

527
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,439
I'll give you 20 seconds.

528
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Let's go on once you finish drinking.

529
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,439
Can you leave me in peace
to drink some water?

530
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,280
You can't do it?

531
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,040
Who do you say can't do it?

532
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,520
Do… Do I still need
to get the ice cubes?

533
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
15 seconds left.

534
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,400
A towel.

535
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,119
Got it.

536
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,880
I told you to stay away from her.

537
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,119
Me?

538
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,400
You should stay away from her too.

539
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,439
I have 15 laps left.

540
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:37,479
I'll stop talking to you.

541
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,199
Aren't you done running?

542
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,239
Be careful.

543
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,520
What did you say?

544
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:55,920
I said

545
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,319
"Be careful."

546
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,239
When will the rain stop?

547
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,599
I'm coming.

548
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,800
Come on in, come on in.

549
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,479
Be quick.

550
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,040
Livestreamer.

551
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,880
Keep your wits about you
when it is raining.

552
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,280
Do I still need a towel now?

553
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,239
You didn't bring an umbrella instead.

554
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:28,800
I know.

555
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,160
It started raining
when I was riding halfway.

556
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:33,119
You've brought enough towels though.

557
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,439
Shen Qingyuan is lucky indeed.

558
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,160
I was just afraid
one wouldn't be enough for you.

559
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,680
All right. Wipe yourself quickly.

560
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,199
Or you'll catch a cold.

561
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,119
OK. Thanks.

562
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,959
I'll do it myself.

563
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,839
Shen Qingyuan, here you are.

564
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,239
Wipe yourself too.

565
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,680
Let me wipe for you.

566
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,719
Why is there so much water
on your helmet?

567
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,880
I'll do it myself.

568
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,040
Captain Shen.

569
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,560
Umbrella.

570
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,599
I'm here.

571
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,359
What are you doing?

572
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:16,719
Captain Shen,

573
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
I'll share an umbrella with Xiaoci.

574
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,760
This one is for you guys.

575
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,319
Aren't you afraid of being a nuisance
by making advances?

576
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,800
It depends on whom I make advances to.

577
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
You guys go first.

578
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,119
Let's go.

579
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
You always follow me around.

580
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,199
Aren't you afraid of missing the target?

581
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,400
You go first.

582
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,000
The umbrella.

583
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,920
The umbrella is for you.

584
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,000
Xiaoci,

585
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,599
you seem to

586
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,920
care about Shen Qingyuan a lot.

587
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,000
It's such a light rain

588
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,839
and you brought him an umbrella.

589
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,199
He's my partner.

590
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,319
Of course I care about him.

591
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,319
But I found

592
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,160
you seem to care about him
more than I do.

593
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,800
After all, he's the No.1 choice

594
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
of my advertising endorser.

595
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,800
So you said

596
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,880
you wanted me
to be the advertising endorser

597
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,280
and you turn out to be just kidding.

598
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,520
No, absolutely not.

599
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,160
I said it sincerely,

600
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,439
without cheating anybody.

601
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,560
When are you gonna

602
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,079
consider me as a choice?

603
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,560
Now we are teammates after all.

604
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:53,479
I deserve such a privilege.

605
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:56,839
It depends on

606
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,239
when you'll return my favor.

607
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,719
Any time.

608
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,160
But not now.

609
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:04,680
Take the umbrella.

610
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,000
This…

611
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:18,800
Easy access.

612
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,839
Hi,

613
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,160
I'm gonna stay in Haiya's dorm.

614
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:48,239
My dream of youth…

615
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,560
What are you doing?

616
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,760
You are back, Captain Shen.

617
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,599
I'm putting the dorm in order.

618
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,000
Who let you in?

619
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,160
Who else could it be?

620
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,760
My subjective initiative.

621
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,079
I

622
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,599
was actually looking for a single room,

623
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,640
but I can't

624
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,800
force you out of the only single room

625
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,839
you are staying in, right?

626
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,719
So Captain Shen,

627
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,199
let's make do with it.

628
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,199
Get out.

629
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,280
What if I say no?

630
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,920
Mr. Du.

631
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,880
Captain Shen.

632
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,280
What's happening to you guys?

633
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,680
Don't ask me.

634
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,040
He's the one who's booting people out.

635
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:54,199
Mr. Du,

636
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,839
are you gonna share a room
with Captain Shen?

637
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,719
This won't do.

638
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,400
Right.

639
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,040
I feel your vibes

640
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,760
also don't quite match.

641
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,520
Hold your horses.

642
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,359
Let me look
at your constellations first.

643
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,760
The three of you present a united front.

644
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,599
Shen Qingyuan is a treasure,

645
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,839
and everybody protects him.

646
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,839
I can't possibly share a room with you.

647
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,760
That's not what I want, either.

648
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,479
You guys are a good match.

649
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,959
Moon Deer of Extended Net,
Moon Deer of Extended Net.

650
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,359
You guys are related
by the star of life.

651
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,400
A very good match.

652
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,599
If nobody wants to give in,

653
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,040
just have a contest
to show what you've got.

654
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,000
OK.

655
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,199
Let's have a shooting contest then.

656
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,079
But not the one you are practicing.

657
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,479
There's a very popular game these days

658
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,680
called WarGame.

659
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,000
Are you in?

660
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,599
OK.

661
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,119
The loser will have to move out.

662
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,359
No problem.

663
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,040
I'm ready.

664
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,280
Xiaoci,

665
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,199
why are you here today?

666
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,000
Captain Shen

667
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,400
asked the coach for a leave yesterday

668
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,839
to have a live-action shootout contest

669
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,760
with Du Lingfeng.

670
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,959
Coach asked me to tag along

671
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,319
and take it
as an offsite training session.

672
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,000
We don't know

673
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,920
how the teams will be divided yet.

674
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,680
If you are in a team with Captain Shen,

675
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,439
then it'll be game over for us.

676
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,160
Not necessarily.

677
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,640
Du Lingfeng dared to
throw down the gauntlet,

678
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,239
which shows he's sure he's gonna win.

679
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,040
What's more, a war game

680
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,199
is different from training.

681
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,560
It's mainly about tactics.

682
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,199
During the many years
of his stay abroad,

683
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,359
he might have practiced quite often.

684
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,000
In this case,

685
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,479
this must be a lot of fun.

686
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,359
Hi,

687
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,000
can you receive my message?

688
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,640
Livestreamer,

689
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,239
here.

690
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,000
- Hurry up.
- Du Lingfeng.

691
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,640
It's early in the morning

692
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,439
and you asked me to play
in a live-action shootout?

693
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:35,959
Hurry up.

694
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,800
Hello, Miss Tang.

695
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,599
Miss Tang.

696
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:40,800
Go ahead.

697
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,719
How are the teams divided?

698
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:42,599
I want to be in a team
with Captain Shen.

699
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,400
Me too.

700
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Me too.

701
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,199
Let's do it this way.

702
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:46,239
For the sake of fairness,

703
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,640
let's draw lots, OK?

704
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,239
OK.

705
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:48,920
- OK.
- All right.

706
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,560
OK. I'll go and prepare the paper balls.

707
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,000
OK.

708
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,239
Livestreamer, come with me.

709
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,520
Let's go.

710
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,479
Let's pick the gear.

711
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,239
- Go.
- Go.

712
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:00,880
When the time comes,

713
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,079
just choose the biggest paper ball,

714
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:02,560
do you know?

715
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,680
So that I'll be in a team with you?

716
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,959
With Shen Qingyuan.

717
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,199
Why?

718
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,400
I don't want to be in a team with him.

719
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,959
Why do you have so many whys?

720
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:10,119
Do you want the partnership or not?

721
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,520
It's like this.

722
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,280
Later on

723
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,239
when you're in a team
with Shen Qingyuan,

724
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,319
tell me secretly

725
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,160
where he is.

726
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,359
If we win,

727
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:19,160
I'll consider

728
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,239
resuming the partnership with you.

729
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,199
I promise.

730
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:25,839
Let's go.

731
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,199
Let's do it.
I've prepared the paper balls.

732
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,959
Odd numbers will be in a team with me.

733
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,119
Even numbers will be with Shen Qingyuan.

734
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:36,839
Pick one.

735
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,880
I'll have the big one.

736
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,959
I'll have this.

737
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,079
Well done.

738
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:48,560
Mr. Du.

739
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,400
As I wished.

740
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,040
Captain Shen.

741
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
For the sake of fairness,

742
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,839
you guys prepare the paper balls

743
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,359
and we choose which side to attack.

744
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:04,439
Is that OK, Captain Shen?

745
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,520
No problem.

746
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,599
OK. Let's go.

747
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:06,959
Go.

748
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:07,520
Go.

749
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,359
Zhou,

750
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,199
I'm in a team

751
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,079
with Captain Shen and Xiaoci.

752
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,920
You guys are sure to lose.

753
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,280
What shall we do?

754
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:14,560
Give up the fight.

755
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,160
Don't lose heart, Mr. Du.

756
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,439
As Xiaoci said,

757
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,640
this is different from air pistol.

758
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,040
It's mainly about tactics.

759
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,439
Although we are lacking in strength,

760
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,880
we can outwit them.

761
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,359
You're also battle-scarred, aren't you?

762
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,160
Figure out a way.

763
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,280
What do you want?

764
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,719
Wanna win?

765
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:37,319
Captain Shen,

766
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,160
why did you agree to

767
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,239
make a bet with Du Lingfeng?

768
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,760
He wants to take my dorm.

769
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,040
That's not the only reason.

770
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,359
He's indeed a pain in the neck.

771
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,040
Anyway,

772
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,280
I don't like losing.

773
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:20,040
They threw smoke bombs so early.

774
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,680
Captain,

775
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,400
there is smoke.

776
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,040
Copy that.

777
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,640
Be careful.

778
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,760
They are in the smoke.

779
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:25,680
Copy that.

780
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,920
Let's move quickly.

781
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:27,959
Miss Tang,

782
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:28,520
go.

783
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,560
Livestreamer, draw their fire.

784
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,719
They have moved.

785
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,040
Get ready to block Du Lingfeng.

786
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,880
Yang Zhou, get ready to flank them.

787
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:57,359
Captain,

788
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,520
in the 11 o'clock position ahead

789
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,239
is Du Lingfeng.

790
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,120
My vision is blocked.

791
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,120
I can't snipe at him.

792
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,479
I can shoot him.

793
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,239
I'm going.

794
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:16,800
Don't act recklessly.

795
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,760
Captain!

796
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,679
I'm dead.

797
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:39,959
Jiang Yitian,

798
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,399
this is not the way to play a war game.

799
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,320
Yang Zhou,

800
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,560
well done.

801
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,800
Watch out!

802
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,679
Xiaoci is behind you.

803
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:53,679
Captain,

804
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,959
Yang Zhou is in the 2 o'clock position.

805
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:10,159
I'm dead.

806
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:13,639
Yes!

807
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,399
What happened?

808
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,080
I'm dead too.

809
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,199
Livestreamer,

810
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,120
let's start Plan B.

811
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,679
OK.

812
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:28,840
Get a move on!

813
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,760
Captain, don't go.

814
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,320
He's very cunning.

815
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,879
Tang Xin!

816
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,840
Shen Qingyuan,

817
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,239
this is called
throwing caution to the wind.

818
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,080
Followed by danger from behind.

819
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,600
I'm really dead.

820
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:09,840
I'm toast. I'm toast.

821
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,399
Livestreamer,

822
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,439
don't come out of the log cabin.

823
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,840
A big bad wolf is coming.

824
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,000
Did we win?

825
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,800
Miss Tang!

826
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,600
Won?

827
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:50,800
Who won?

828
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,000
Miss Tang!

829
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,320
We won.

830
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:56,919
Good tactics.

831
00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:58,879
I didn't see you are quite good at it.

832
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,919
I was just being lucky.

833
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:01,040
Had I not been misled by what you said

834
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,840
at last,

835
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,479
I would not have lost.

836
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,520
That's why I said
I was just being lucky.

837
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,080
Du Lingfeng, keep your word.

838
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,239
I will.

839
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,120
Livestreamer,

840
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,399
your last shot saved us.

841
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,120
Rui Live

842
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,040
must thank you this time.

843
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,760
Yes!

844
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,439
Shen Qingyuan,

845
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:17,959
you've lost.

846
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,040
Change your dorm.

847
00:37:26,439 --> 00:37:27,439
Why are you so happy

848
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:30,840
when I lose?

849
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,399
A little bit.

850
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:37,520
Tang Xin…

851
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:05,600
Tang Xin!

852
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,120
Tang Xin.

853
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,800
(Inpatient Department)

854
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:28,560
You've come around?

855
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,120
I am…

856
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,000
In a hospital.

857
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,280
You passed out on the field

858
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,439
because I…

859
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:45,919
Stop!

860
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,600
Can you stop talking nonsense?

861
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,840
Who says…

862
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,879
I passed out because of you?

863
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,120
Why did that happen then?

864
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
