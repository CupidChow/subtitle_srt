00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,279
I can't come in the next few days.

00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:01,919
Take care, OK?

44
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,479
Yes, Mr. Zhou.

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,479
I talked to Shen Qingyuan

46
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,000
about Chen Hai's incident.

He'll fix it.

I won't be able to

go to the office or the base
for a while,

50

Shen Qingyuan?

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Didn't you get shot?

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,000
I think he's in hospital.

59
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,839
Oh boy! I'm gonna cry!

Shen Qingyuan,

63
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,199
did you

64
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,119
bully Chen Hai or not?

65
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,520
Shen Qingyuan, say something!

66
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:14,839
You two-faced hypocrite!

(He logged out after a minute.
Did he get cold feet?)

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,119
No!

You're wrong.

So gullible! Shen Qingyuan is faking it.)

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,520
(Reply: It was just a scratch.
He finished the game, didn't he?)

73
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,759
Dr. Ding!

74
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,679
Hi, Dr. Ding.

75
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,039
Are you going to the hospital?

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,759
Yeah.

77
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Shen Qingyuan's leg is wounded,

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,759
but he wants no nursing workers.

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,839
Dr. Ding,

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,080
who is that?

81
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,040
He comes to me

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
for psychological counseling.

83
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,239
He drove by and saw me just now

84
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,880
and came to say hi.

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,399
Tang Xin,

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
you look

87
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,119
pretty well.

88
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,799
All thanks to you.

89
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,799
I'm feeling better and better

90
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,640
and less sensitive.

91
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,640
That's good.

92
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:33,920
Dr. Ding,

93
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,079
I gotta go.

94
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,559
- See you.
- See you.

95
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,119
I'm back.

(Tang Xin: Stop making stuff up.
You don't know what happened!)

100
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,799
Are you defending me online?

101
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,200
It's freezing outside.

102
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,279
You were out for too long.

103
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:50,640
Of course you're cold.

104
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,279
You no longer have intimacy issues?

105
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,399
I don't know.

106
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
I just wanna hug you.

107
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,799
That's all.

108
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:26,279
Tang Xin,

109
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,399
don't waste your time on them.

110
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,559
I don't care

111
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,079
if they call me a bully.

112
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,720
I just hope I can help Chen Hai out.

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,920
I can ignore

114
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
what others say,

115
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,200
but he can't.

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,799
But

117
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,040
Chen Hai will feel guilty.

118
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,279
Fresh dressing, Bed 16.

119
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,799
Thanks, doc.

120
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,760
Did it hurt when she dressed your wound?

121
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,279
I feel much better now.

122
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,799
The doctor says

123
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:24,799
it's just a flesh wound.

124
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,279
I'll be good as new soon.

125
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,920
Are you gonna stay with me these days?

126
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,160
Of course.

127
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,239
Very well.

128
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,480
I could take more shots

129
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,799
to spend more time with you.

130
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:43,799
Shen Qingyuan,

131
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,279
I'd like to try something on you

132
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,000
while you can't walk.

133
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,079
Like what?

134
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,160
Now that you're less aggressive,

135
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,720
I'd like to see

136
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,160
if I can get used to physical contact

137
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,519
so that we can get to the next level.

138
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,160
Next level?

139
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,760
Get your mind

140
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,679
out of the gutter!

141
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,679
Are you inspired

142
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:14,519
by my previous action?

143
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,720
The thing is,

144
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,000
I have no idea what to do.

145
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,239
I'll teach you.

146
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,279
Come closer.

147
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,799
Bring it in.

148
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,039
Give me your hand.

149
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,640
Next,

150
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,799
let's see if you're OK with

151
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,479
direct contact.

152
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,520
- Captain.
- Captain.

153
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,400
Captain,

154
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,960
are you gaining weight

155
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,919
under Miss Tang's watch?

156
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,119
Thank you for taking care of him.

157
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,719
With you here

158
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:16,559
looking after him,

159
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,440
we can stop worrying.

160
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,400
Give me your coat, Captain.

161
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,400
Captain,

162
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,520
would you like to lie down?

163
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,039
Let me sit for a while.

164
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,159
He can't have spicy food.

165
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,599
You mistook it.

166
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,080
It's for us to eat

167
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,280
in case

168
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,559
Captain's condition is worsening

169
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,880
and we have to stay here all day.

170
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,400
Don't jinx it!

171
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,479
Captain,

172
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,520
are you sure you're OK?

173
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,719
I fear the longer you're in bed,

174
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:49,679
the slower your leg...

175
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,919
Come here.

176
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,440
Give me a hand.

177
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,919
Captain,

178
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,919
it's not easy for us

179
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,159
to look after you together.

180
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,239
I can't imagine

181
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,119
how Miss Tang does it alone.

182
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,359
We'll

183
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:02,719
tell the hospital

184
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,119
to prepare special rooms for couples

185
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,119
for more privacy.

186
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:06,919
Then

187
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,520
you won't be disturbed.

188
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,599
I'll go get some hot water.

189
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,320
Did you guys sneak out?

190
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,880
No!

191
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,200
Coach Zhang let us come.

192
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,880
After the accident

193
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,280
during the game in the morning,

194
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,599
he has to stay

195
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,280
to explain to the media

196
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,440
and clean up the mess.

197
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,599
He gave us the rest of the day off

198
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,000
to bring you some supplies

199
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:29,640
that will

200
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,239
help with your recovery.

201
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:31,799
Look,

202
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,080
these are for push-ups.

203
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,359
And the ring.

204
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:34,960
The usual tools

205
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
for training.

206
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,280
Here's a wristband,

207
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,200
a hang grip ring,

208
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,000
sandbags...

209
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,640
This is a...

210
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,520
A complimentary gift

211
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,760
to help reduce your pressure.

212
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,239
Captain.

213
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,919
A yoga mat, too.

214
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,119
The doctor says my bones are fine.

215
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,039
Tell the coach

216
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,039
I'll be back in no time.

217
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,119
That's great news.

218
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,599
Captain,

219
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:55,760
I'll put the yoga mat here.

220
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,520
Jiang Yitian,

221
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
I wanna have

222
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,359
your hot and sour rice noodles.

223
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,479
I'm hungry, too.

224
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:06,880
Come on.

225
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,640
Let's go get hot water.

226
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,960
Hai,

227
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,159
we'll be right back.

228
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,320
You stay with Captain.

229
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,679
Bye.

230
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,280
Captain...

231
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,000
Good job at the range.

232
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:26,599
I...

233
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,599
What did the management say?

234
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,960
I violated the rules of shooting,

235
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,520
so they asked me

236
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,280
to shoot with an empty gun

237
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,679
and clean the field for a month.

238
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,679
Luckily, this isn't an official match.

239
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,039
Not bad.

240
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,760
It is bad.

241
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,159
I...

242
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,200
You'll be Acting Captain

243
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,719
while I'm away.

244
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,960
Watch Jiang Yitian

245
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,159
and other lazy bones closely.

246
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,719
I can finally have these noodles.

247
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,880
Finally!

248
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,719
Should we go somewhere else to eat?

249
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,039
Captain,

250
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,919
I'm sorry.

251
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,159
Hey,

252
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,320
give me your right hand.

253
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:16,919
Come on.

254
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:19,840
What for?

255
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,239
What's going on?

256
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,640
Captain

257
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,880
can read palms, too.

258
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:30,960
Look. He's taking photos of it.

259
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,559
Make the headline

260
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:35,799
bigger.

261
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,000
"One mistake shouldn't kill

262
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,080
over a decade of effort."

263
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,919
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou.

264
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,080
Go back to work.

265
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,520
Sir, sir!

266
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,640
Shen Qingyuan posted a message on Weibo.

267
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,320
The very first one!

268
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,039
"One mistake shouldn't kill

269
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:53,559
over a decade of effort."

270
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,960
It's well-written.

271
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,760
Shen Qingyuan has got

272
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,880
Chen Hai out completely,

273
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,840
but I wonder

274
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,320
if this will

275
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,559
save his own image.

276
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,960
Look,

277
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,400
they're asking in the comment area

278
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,799
if that's really Chen Hai's hand

279
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,919
and keep calling Shen Qingyuan a liar

280
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,000
and two-faced.

281
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,520
If you ask me,

282
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,200
a photo of him and Chen Hai

283
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,599
or a video

284
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,320
would work even better, don't you think?

285
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,239
Shen Qingyuan is smart.

286
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,239
He knows

287
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,080
if he showed a photo of the shooter,

288
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,239
it'd spark a storm of anger online.

289
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,400
So he used a more subtle approach

290
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,320
by posting a hand.

291
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,080
Learn from him.

292
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,000
You wanna practice livestreaming?

293
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,599
I said

294
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,080
I'd help you with your work.

295
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:48,400
And my appearance online

296
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,320
will distract people

297
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,640
from the shooting accident.

298
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,239
Isn't it win-win?

299
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,440
But being a livestreamer

300
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,719
isn't as easy as you think.

301
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,679
Are you sure you wanna do it?

302
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,640

00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,280
I'm Shen Qingyuan.

349
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm here to...

350
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,719
Stop. Just stop.

351
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,000
Let me teach you

352
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,039
about angles

353
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,320
to make you look better on camera.

354
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,919
Must livestreamers know that?

355
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,200
Of course.

356
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,640
Or people flood in

357
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,280
to see a hot guy

358
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
only to find

359
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,479
your face

360
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,239
all distorted.

361
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,159
Here.

362
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,599
Hold it.

363
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,479
Sit straight.

364
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,239
Raise the phone.

365
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,320
Good.

366
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,840
I'll

367
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,080
get you a selfie stick

368
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,599
to relax your arm.

369
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,440
Chin down.

370
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,919
Down.

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,760
♪Simple yet special♪

373
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,160
The normal filter

374
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
makes you look good enough.

375
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,199
It works well on selfies, too.

376
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I don't do selfies alone.

377
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,680

379
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,239
Not good enough.

380
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,280
Yeah, it's not up to the mark

381
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,800
for the real thing.

382
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,560
But we can't let

383
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,880
these clips go to waste.

384
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,920

386

I've got an idea

387
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,920
without you going live.

388
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:47,920
Really?

389
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,839
Our effort

390
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,839
isn't all in vain.

391
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:52,839
You're right.

392
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,199
What's your idea?

393
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:56,599
Can't tell you now.

394
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,319
I'll let you know once I set it up.

395
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,839
It's been a long day.

396
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,520
Get some rest now.

400
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,479
Hello, everyone,

401
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,359
I'm Shen Qingyuan.

402
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,439
Hey...

403
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,199
What are you watching?

404
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,040
What is it, Yitian?

405
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,719
Aren't those the outtakes

406
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,839
of our training video?

407
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,920
Check out

408
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,439
Captain Shen's stern face in coaching.

409
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:06,719
It's weirdly cute.

410
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,239
I agree.

411
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:07,959
- Yeah.
- So cute.

412
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:08,599
You'll see

413
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,439
a completely different side of him

414
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,239
in his single shot.

415
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,319
He...

416
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,280
He does have two faces.

417
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,959
You're good, Shen Qingyuan.

418
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:25,920
You've managed to

419
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,239
turn things around so quickly.

420
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,959
Shen Qingyuan?

421
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,080
(Inpatient)

422
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,400
(Winter Training Base General Hospital
Property Damage Claim List)

423
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:18,880
We gotta pay for breaking the teacup,

424
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:21,119
but it wasn't my fault.

425
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,400
I didn't know

426
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,520
you were under the bed.

427
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,520
I couldn't help it.

428
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,800
I'd go there

429
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,640
every time I was stressed out

430
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:32,079
or lost my temper.

431
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,560
Are you stressed out now?

432
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,680
Because of Chen Hai?

433
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,079
Last night,

434
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,280
it was thundering and raining.

435
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,839
When I went to close the window,

436
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,560
suddenly,

437
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,239
some images came into my mind.

438
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,280
I couldn't breathe.

439
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Images like what?

440
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,839
Nothing.

441
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,079
Did he see me?

442
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,359
Did you see a girl?

443
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,880
Tang Xin,

444
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,000
you're my first love.

445
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,520
You remember it?

446
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,400
So there couldn't be

447
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,839
another girl in my mind.

448
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,239
You don't seem too happy.

449
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,119
Am I not your first love?

450
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,479
Uh...

451
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,079
Should I be happy or not?

452
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,439
You are.

453
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,520
You hesitated.

454
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,439
You paused for a sec.

455
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,760
Knock it off.

456
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,280
I'll go get you some hot water.

457
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,400
Bed 16,

458
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,520
time for your shot and drugs.

459
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,439
It's dressed. Don't touch it.

460
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,959
Babe!

461
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:13,880
Whose fault was it?

462
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,479
Had you focused

463
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,160
when you were on your scooter,

464
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,079
you wouldn't have banged your head.

465
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,319
I'm in pain already!

466
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,079
Can you stop nagging me?

467
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:24,880
OK. I'm sorry.

468
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,560
I'll stop now.

469
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:26,959
I'll go

470
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,280
get you some snacks, OK?

471
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,560
Stop it. Don't be so lovey-dovey.

472
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:30,680
Hey,

473
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,599
man up, will you?

474
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,719
Hang in there.

475
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,040
Miss,

476
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,359
do not

477
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,040
wet his injury.

478
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,079
Have some rest.

479
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,160
- You'll be fine.
- Shanshan!

480
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,959
There, there.

481
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,239
What's with the noise?

482
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,000
A couple is staying in the next room.

483
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,319
Give me your hand.

484
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,359
I'm sorry if my boyfriend was too loud.

485
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,400
Hello.

486
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,280
Hi.

487
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,359
We just moved into the next room

488
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,239
and I came to say hi.

489
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,400
You two are so sweet.

490
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,599
If there's anything happens,

491
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,719
I hope we can help each other.

492
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,359
Sure.

493
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:24,680
This is for you.

494
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,479
My boyfriend loves grapes.

495
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,079
When I went downstairs to get some,

496
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,479
they were on sale,

497
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:30,760
so I picked some for you, too.

498
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:31,839
This is too kind of you.

499
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,040
No big deal.

500
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:33,599
We're gonna be

501
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,839
neighbors for a while.

502
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,239
Are those matching
electric toothbrushes?

503
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,719
I've been into that brand for some time.

504
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,959
Are you their user, too, handsome?

505
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,199
Your boyfriend

506
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:46,959
is so hot.

507
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,359
Sorry.

508
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,400
Don't take me wrong.

509
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:56,800
I just like hot guys.

510
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,000
Clearly, commitment means

511
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,040
nothing to you.

512
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,439
You're still drooling over

513
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,359
someone else's man.

514
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,319
Shanshan!

515
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,280
Have a good day.

516
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,839
I gotta go back.

517
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:14,800
See you.

518
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,719
Bye.

519
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:18,959
Girls these days

520
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:19,920
are open.

521
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,239
You shouldn't have said that.

522
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,199
I was simply stating the fact.

523
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,839
Are you the same?

524
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:30,959
What?

525
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:33,800
I mean, are you

526
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,959
also into hotter guys

527
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,280
like me?

528
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,439
The guy I like

529
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,959
isn't too bad.

530
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,359
Looks don't stand a chance

531
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,839
in front of the sense of humor.

532
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,839
He's got everything.

533
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,199
Give me your phone.

534
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:55,839
What for?

535
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,760
I meant to make our relationship public

536
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,040
but you just gave me a new tag

537
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,839
and called it off.

538
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,160
We need to let everyone know.

539
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,719
Those around us already do.

540
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,680
What's the point?

541
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:07,680
I'm doing it.

542
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
(Moments: I'm glad to share
the rest of my life with you.)

543
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,239
Come on! That's cliché!

544
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,280
I'll change it.

545
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,599

Tacky.

546
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,760

547
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,680

548

551

558
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,160
Can you stop

559
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,680
feeding him such gimmicks?

560
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,160
Your cold is karma.

561
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,079
What did I do wrong?

562
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,959
I only gave him tips

563
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,839
to impress Miss Tang,

564
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,839
not to be so gross.

565
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,479
And my cold is a pure accident.

566
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,000
I didn't wear enough clothes.

567
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,719
Speaking of gross,

568
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,719
one name pops out

569
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:55,599
instantly.

570
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,839
Du Lingfeng?

571
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,119
That's my man!

572
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,040
What's he doing?

573
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,359
It's nothing unusual

574
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,199
that he skips training,

575
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,959
but neglecting Xiaoci is.

576
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:06,880
So,

577
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,319
love will expire, won't it?

578
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:09,839
Shut up!

579
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,239

580

love will stay,

581

00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,199
How have you been?

698
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,160
You must be tired

699
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,959
looking after Shen Qingyuan.

700
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,000
I can manage.

701
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,439
Of course you can.

702
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,520
It's a sweet burden, isn't it?

703
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,199
I got that.

704
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
You got a minute?

705
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,839
I meant to check on Captain first

706
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:58,880
to thank him

707
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,040
for cheering me up,

708
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,160
but here you are...

709
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,079
Did you and Du Lingfeng have a fight?

710
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,920
Did he tell you?

711
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,880
Not the specifics.

712
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,920
You know,

713
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,640
I made a mistake during the assessment

714
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,599
because of him.

715
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,599
When I was a kid,

716
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,560
I was ugly and fat.

717
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,199
All the boys made fun of me.

718
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,439
Sorry, Fattie.

719
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,839
We didn't see you.

720
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,040
You should eat less anyway.

721
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,000
You're too fat to wear a dress.

722
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
- Fattie! Fattie!
- Fattie! Fattie!

723
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,920
- Big and meaty!
- Big and meaty!

724
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,280
- Never stop eating!
- Never stop eating!

725
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,560
Back then,

726
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,560
everyone around me

727
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,719
kept mocking and bullying me

728
00:33:58,479 --> 00:33:59,400
until one day,

729
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,119
a shooting coach came

730
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:04,199
to scout for new talents.

731
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,119
Class,

732
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,719
those who stack more shell casings up

733
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,479
than others

734
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,320
can be my students.

735
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,679
Would you like to have a try?

736
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,600
- Good job!
- Wow!

737
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,639
Amazing!

738
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,439
No. 1 Li Bing.

739
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,439
No. 2 Cao Anzhen.

740
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,959
No. 3 Ying Shan.

741
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,520
No. 4 Lin Huahui.

742
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,399
No. 5 Shi Xiaoci?

743
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,280
You're in, Shi Xiaoci?

744
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,679
You have to pass the test, too.

745
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,919
Look at you.

746
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,439
Even if you made it to the team,

747
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,000
you wouldn't get to shoot.

748
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,040
The more their discouragement,

749
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,080
the stronger my will.

750
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,679
Yet in the end,

751
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,320
I failed.

752
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,199
The coach said

753
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,320
there was only one spot.

754
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,320
After consideration,

755
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,280
they chose

756
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,719
a more athletic girl.

757
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,879
Both of you

758
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,679
did well in the test.

759
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,399
But based on

760
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,479
the physical criteria,

761
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:24,840
we picked her.

762
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,679
When the news got out,

763
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,760
those boys

764
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,239
became even meaner.

765
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:36,879
They thought

766
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,800
I got eliminated

767
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,000
because of my looks.

768
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,399
Since then,

769
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,000
I started to

770
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,320
engage in intensive training,

771
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,959
such as running and aerobic exercise.

772
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,800
Fattie,

773
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,600
why are you still running?

774
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,520
You're getting bigger and bigger!

775
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,560
Just give up.

776
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,040
No way will you be thin!

777
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,280
- Fattie! Fattie!
- Fattie! Fattie!

778
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,159
Eventually, I got into the shooting team

779
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,320
with excellent grades,

780
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,959
which was a slap them in their faces,

781
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,439
Are you surprised?

782
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:15,760
I didn't know

783
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,959
you had such a rough time.

784
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,159
So I'll never forgive

785
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,399
those who have

786
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:22,520
hurt me.

787
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,879
I understand.

788
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,280
They arrogantly

789
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,199
draw a line

790
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,560
between men and women

791
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,439
and label us

792
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,959
as pretty or ugly.

793
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,399
They laugh at the latter

794
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:37,399
no matter how hard

795
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:39,639
they try to become better.

796
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,280
They took joy in

797
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:43,639
insulting and putting me down

798
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,479
that I hated going near any boys

799
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:47,479
for a long time.

800
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:56,600
Well,

801
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,840
not all boys are like that.

802
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,199
I didn't know that

803
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,199
until I grew older.

804
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:06,120
At that time,

805
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,840
I was eager

806
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,399
to prove them wrong,

807
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,399
so I wanted a new look,

808
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,199
a better and prettier one,

809
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:15,639
so much so

810
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,919
that those sexists

811
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,800
would be ashamed in front of me.

812
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,959
I see.

813
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,040
So you were mad at Du Lingfeng

814
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,399
back in the canteen

815
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:29,600
because he touched your sore spot.

816
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,000
Those words he let out

817
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,159
without thinking

818
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,080
reminded you

819
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,439
of those mean boys.

820
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,840
You weren't

821
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,800
your normal self in front of him.

822
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,199
When I calmed down later,

823
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,040
I know

824
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,159
I shouldn't have blamed him for that

825
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,199
or what Xu Dian has done,

826
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,520
but I can't find a way

827
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,560
to apologize to him.

828
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,040
Xiaoci,

829
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,560
can you tell me

830
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,719
why you poured out your heart

831
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,919
to me so easily?

832
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,479
Because you're my friend.

833
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,040
Is Du Lingfeng not?

834
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,879
I don't know

835
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:09,399
what's going on between you guys,

836
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,959
so I can only tell you this

837
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:11,919
from my own experience.

838
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,840
Since Shen Qingyuan and I

839
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,879
started to see each other,

840
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,600
I'd rather share certain things

841
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,800
with strangers than him.

842
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:20,840
But

843
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,360
that doesn't mean I don't like him.

844
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,520
It's the opposite.

845
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,840
I like him so much

846
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,919
that I don't wanna

847
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:28,840
expose him

848
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,840
to any of my negative feelings.

849
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,399
Xiaoci,

850
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,159
you like Du Lingfeng, too,

851
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,040
don't you?

852
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:41,800
Or you wouldn't be distracted

853
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,600
by him during the assessment

854
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:45,040
and made a beginner's mistake.

855
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,679
I'm not sure how I feel about him.

856
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,080
It's just that

857
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,080
when he seemed so cold and distant

858
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:55,879
as if

859
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:57,000
he was giving me up,

860
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,239
it broke my heart.

861
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,600
Exactly.

862
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,000
I felt the same when Shen Qingyuan

863
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,639
gave me the cold shoulder.

864
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,879
Don't think

865
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,560
too much.

866
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,800
Just follow your heart

867
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,479
and let nature take its course.

868
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,320
It seems to me

869
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,439
that Du Lingfeng is also insecure.

870
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,959
Otherwise,

871
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,000
he wouldn't get so agitated

872
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,280
on the day of the assessment.

873
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:26,199
He was totally not himself.

874
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:37,199
Does someone miss me?

875
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,560
Stop! Not again!

876
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,479
I'm out!

877
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,879
What's wrong with me?

878
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,080
Go to bed

879
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,560
and my mind will rest.

880
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,800
Hello?

881
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,479
Mr. Du, bad news!

882
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:50,719
Your father had a car accident!

883
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:52,000
What?

884
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,719
Car accident?
