=Episode 32=

35
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,680
But I wouldn't mind

36
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,160
you taking up my time.

37
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,599
Let's eat.

38
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,879
Why am I being like this?

39
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,400
It's normal.

40
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:51,360
There's nothing wrong

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,839
for a couple

42
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,400
to get closer to each other.

43
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,720
I just think

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,919
that we are both quite silly.

45
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,519
Though we look

46
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,919
like sensible people,

47
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,480
it took us a long time to finally

48
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,559
decide to be together.

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,000
We even had

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,120
a "wrestling" period,

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,879
which only showed that we didn't

52
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,599
have the courage to be together.

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,759
Detours can happen

54
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,000
in relationships.

55
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:13,880
Do you think

56
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,360
I'm a selfish person?

57
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,559
I'm really enjoying
my current state of life.

58
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,399
Doing the things I like

59
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,199
with the person I love

60
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,839
makes me feel happy

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,479
and fulfilled every day.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,440
So I'm a little sad

63
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,679
about his leaving.

64
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,160
Shen Qingyuan.

65
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,800
I have a question for you.

66
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,160
Do you think I have a gift for shooting?

67
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,119
Your biggest problem is

68
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,320
that you aren't persistent enough.

69
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,600
How could you say that

70
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,880
to an energetic young man?

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,399
Socrates said,

72
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:55,679
"Man know thyself."

73
00:02:59,279 --> 00:02:59,839
Alright.

74
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,039
I'll think about it.

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,119
You are like a wobbly bear

76
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:10,039
when you are in love.

77
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,479
You are staggering and reaching

78
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:15,360
your paws out to show your toughness,

79
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,119
but actually, you are very soft

80
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,000
and super cute.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,320
Will you stop making fun of me?

82
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,399
You are supposed to help me

83
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,800
and comfort me.

84
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,279
You should think positively.

85
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,199
Maybe Du Lingfeng is making

86
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,360
a plan for the future.

87
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,600
It's his way

88
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,759
to be responsible for not only himself,

89
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,800
but also you.

90
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,119
It's too hard.

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,080
What do I do?

92
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,080
Shi Xiaoci,

93
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,759
you should look at the bigger picture

94
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,919
instead of living in the moment.

95
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you think

96
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,399
I should

97
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:48,119
put myself in his shoes?

98
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:49,919
As his girlfriend,

99
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,440
I should put his needs first.

100
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,000
That's what he does for me, right?

101
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,800
So you shouldn't feel depressed.

102
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,479
I'm impressed.

103
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:00,399
Turns out

104
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,600
you are quite a love expert.

105
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,240
One accumulates experience
through practice indeed.

106
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,800
What are you talking about?

107
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,479
I'm about your age.

108
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
I know some stuff, okay?

109
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,720
Xiaoci said

110
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,880
Jujube sometimes coughs.

111
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,920
The temperature is fine.

112
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,279
Jujube.

113
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,160
Perhaps

114
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,480
the cat food you bought for it is
too salty,

115
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,079
and it makes its throat dry.

116
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,279
But I couldn't

117
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,440
find any food especially for hedgehogs.

118
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,359
You also said

119
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,000
that cat food is most suitable

120
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,679
for hedgehogs.

121
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,880
Wanna try?

122
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,959
Shen Qingyuan.

123
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,079
How can you

124
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,399
mess around like I do?

125
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,679
You are an athlete.

126
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,440
You can't eat

127
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,600
strange stuff like this.

128
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,760
Jujube.

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,799
You, too.

130
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:14,679
Don't be like him.

131
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,480
No self-control.

132
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,799
Jujube.

133
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,119
It ignores me.

134
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,760
Don't you think

135
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,640
it has the same personality as mine?

136
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,880
It's jealous of me.

137
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,480
I think

138
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,880
you know yourself better now.

139
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,440
I think everybody

140
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,760
starts to realize what they want.

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,160
What do you mean?

142
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,799
Xiaoci told me

143
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,000
that Du Lingfeng had started

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,119
to make plans for the future.

145
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,959
Future.

146
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:54,959
This word is so

147
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,880
elusive to me.

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,920
When I was in elementary school,

149
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,880
I thought going to middle school
and high school was my future.

150
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,519
When I was a college student,

151
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,839
I thought finding a job was my future.

152
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,079
In fact, oftentimes,

153
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,959
we are pushed forward by time.

154
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,200
And after you met me?

155
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:10,079
After I met you,

156
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,959
I became more positive

157
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,359
and active.

158
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,399
I'll always be there for you no matter

159
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,679
it's positive or negative.

160
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,200
So you also care about the future,

161
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,760
right?

162
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,359
The future is more important
than the past,

163
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:27,880
right?

164
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,160
Why are you suddenly
obsessed with this?

165
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,279
I don't want to be obsessed with this,

166
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,040
so I asked you.

167
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,959
I don't care what the past was like.

168
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,559
What matters more is

169
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,200
that I have you from now on.

170
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,559
Alright.

171
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
Then in the future,

172
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,079
let's buy a big lakeside house.

173
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,320
Okay.

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,559
That way, Jujube can take a walk

175
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,679
by the lake every now and then,

176
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,200
thinking about its hometown.

177
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,839
But most of the time,

178
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,559
it should stay in the warm house.

179
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,920
The bottom line is I won't let it

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,519
suffer in the winter again.

181
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,959
What else?

182
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,600
Oh, yeah.

183
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,920
It's not just about Jujube.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,839
By then,

185
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,920
you must have become

186
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,119
one of the most famous athletes.

187
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,600
But I heard

188
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,920
that athletes tend to gain weight

189
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,760
after their retirement.

190
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,040
So we should have

191
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,359
a gym room for you in the house.

192
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Don't just think of me.

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,600
What about you?

194
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,279
Me?

195
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,320
Now that I think about it,

196
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,200
I do need quite a few things.

197
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,760
There should be a study.

198
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:38,440
For us.

199
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
It's for both of us.

200
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,559
There should also be a wardrobe.

201
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,600
For both of us as well.

202
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,359
Game room.

203
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,720
But I need you
to play the games with me.

204
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,600
Shen Qingyuan.

205
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,279
Looks like you are involved

206
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,200
in all the plans

207
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,160
I made for the future.

208
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:00,600
So, let's look to the future together,

209
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,679
okay?

210
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,320
Okay.

211
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:17,839
Hello? Dad.

212
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,000
I have something to tell you.

213
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,679
You saw the hot search list?

214
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,200
Not Du the Beauty.

215
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,359
That's not what I'm talking about.

216
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,880
I want to tell you

217
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
that I have a girlfriend now.

218
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
You got back together

219
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,320
with the girl you lost?

220
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,559
Yes.

221
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,719
I'm glad you won her back.

222
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
This time

223
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,320
you won't break up, will you?

224
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,640
We'll never break up again.

225
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,359
Dad,

226
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,359
I've thought about what you

227
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,320
said to me.

228
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,400
Since I'm in

229
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,640
a serious relationship now,

230
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,840
I think I should also take my life

231
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,000
and my career more seriously.

232
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:06,599
I have one more question for you.

233
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,039
What thoughts do you have

234
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,320
about Lingda?

235
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,880
Dad,

236
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,239
I know you want me
to go back to Lingda.

237
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,080
I'm not going to force you.

238
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,440
Son,

239
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:21,640
I know

240
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,280
that you want your own career,

241
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,719
but Lingda is also your career.

242
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,719
I just want to give you

243
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,159
one more choice.

244
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,559
Don't give up this opportunity

245
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,479
intentionally because of me.

246
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,919
It's been 20 years
since Lingda's inception.

247
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,719
It's still young,

248
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,760
and still has a long way to go.

249
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,719
And that's why

250
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,039
it should keep learning

251
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,119
and evolving.

252
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,239
Son,

253
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,880
I sincerely hope

254
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,679
that you can grow together with Lingda.

255
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,799
Dad,

256
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,080
I heard you.

257
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,359
Working on the material?

258
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,359
Why is it all about Du Lingfeng?

259
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,799
He wants to retire, right?

260
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,039
I was thinking

261
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:53,719
maybe we can

262
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,640
prepare a gift for him.

263
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,760
And I came up with this idea.

264
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,359
I'm going to make a short video

265
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,520
featuring his life in the shooting team.

266
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,479
What do you think?

267
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,679
Kind of valuable.

268
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,520
Anything wrong with that?

269
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,880
Too valuable.

270
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,039
You made it for him in person.

271
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:12,479
Mr. Jealousy,

272
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,320
could you be generous here?

273
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,880
Fine.

274
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,880
He'd better not try to give you
something in return.

275
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,880
You approved?

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,359
Do I have a choice?

277
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,880
You are my future wife after all.

278
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,119
Are you cold?

279
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,039
No.

280
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,359
Xiaoci,

281
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,280
I've made up my mind.

282
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,280
After this winter,

283
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,799
I'll go back to Lingda.

284
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,359
I figured as much.

285
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
So what do you think?

286
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,080
This question

287
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,119
is a little tricky.

288
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,840
If I say I'm happy,

289
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:12,679
you'll be unhappy.

290
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,039
If I say I'm not happy,

291
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,440
you'll be torn again.

292
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you think

293
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:22,960
I should check online to find out

294
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,000
what to do
when my girlfriend is too smart?

295
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,520
Thank you for asking.

296
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,359
I'm the girlfriend
of the question poster.

297
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:32,760
Xiaoci.

298
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:34,599
Will you support my decision?

299
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,280
Of course, I will.

300
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,239
You must have

301
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,000
your reasons to do this.

302
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,359
I trust you.

303
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,559
Thank you.

304
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,679
Looks like Shen Qingyuan

305
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,479
has regained his strength.

306
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:19,719
Coach Zhang.

307
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,599
What is it, Coach Liu?

308
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,280
Take a look

309
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,599
at this,

310
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:24,880
and this.

311
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,960
I hereby announce

312
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,359
that Haiya Shooting Team won

313
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,000
in the joint training today.

314
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:34,880
Great!

315
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,719
We finally defeated them

316
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,520
before the final assessment.

317
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
And Captain Shen is with us this time.

318
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,200
Let's see how they can compete with us.

319
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,679
- That's right.
- Exactly.

320
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,359
Don't drop the ball at the last minute.

321
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,359
- Rest assured, Captain.
- We won't, Captain.

322
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,479
Boys,

323
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:46,599
keep up the good work.

324
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,840
Don't slack off.

325
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,640
Go back to training.

326
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,280
Okay.

327
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,039
Keep it up.

328
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,320
Captain,

329
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,719
don't you think it's strange?

330
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,039
Since you came back,

331
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,039
Zhou Yue hasn't been

332
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,200
as competitive as before.

333
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,159
Be focused

334
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,559
and mind your own business.

335
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,039
But aren't you curious at all?

336
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,880
A clown who's been

337
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,840
trying so hard to play tricks

338
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,000
suddenly got quiet.

339
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,159
Perhaps he's waiting for his chance

340
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,000
to make some big trouble.

341
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,599
Don't worry about a rival

342
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,080
whom you already defeated.

343
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,080
Alright.

344
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,359
After all, we are terrible shooters.

345
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,119
But no matter how good you are,

346
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,799
you are still afraid of being set up.

347
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,080
What did you say?

348
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,640
Too bad you already gave up on yourself.

349
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,840
I'll listen to our captain.

350
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,359
I won't argue with you.

351
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,000
Looks like he's really subdued.

352
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,039
Our Haiya Team is the best.

353
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,799
Not only do we get along well,

354
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,760
but we also get couples

355
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,679
who display affection every day.

356
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,119
Miss Live Streamer.

357
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,479
Let's have lunch together.

358
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,479
I'm going to tell you guys

359
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:03,359
about an important decision I made.

360
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,080
I've received the materials.

361
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,880
But…

362
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,520
are you sure it'll work?

363
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,280
I can't say for the other things,

364
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,359
but Tang Xin is involved in this thing.

365
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,359
He almost lost

366
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,719
his shooting career

367
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,479
because of her.

368
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,039
Alright.

369
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,760
Then wait for the good show.

370
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,479
Retire?

371
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:49,919
But, Boss Du,

372
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,679
you've just joined our team.

373
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,640
Our friendship

374
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,520
has just begun.

375
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,840
I finally had a teammate

376
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,000
who can play games with me,

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,840
I'll miss you a lot

378
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,840
if you leave us.

379
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,719
I thought I was the one

380
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:01,559
who played games with you.

381
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:02,640
Bro,

382
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,679
don't take it personally.

383
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,039
With our tight bond,

384
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,119
I need not remind you of that.

385
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,039
You

386
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:08,919
are kept in here.

387
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
I'm the man of the hour.

388
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,239
Stop talking about your brotherhood.

389
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,080
The winter training will be over soon.

390
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,760
Are you sure

391
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,640
you want to retire right now?

392
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:19,880
No.

393
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,000
I want to attend the final assessment

394
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:23,880
and try my best

395
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,640
to get a good result before I leave.

396
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,679
Hope I can be a dark horse.

397
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,039
More of a dark cat I think.

398
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:29,880
It's fine, too.

399
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:33,880
Do you have a plan after you retire?

400
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,559
Shooting is a less popular sport.

401
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,119
It's hard for a former shooter

402
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,760
to find a job that relates to shooting.

403
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,880
I may go back to my father's company.

404
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,599
He asks me to go back all the time.

405
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,119
I forgot.

406
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,000
You are different.

407
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,320
What different?

408
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,320
I tell you what,

409
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,719
during the time
I'm on the shooting team,

410
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,239
I think of all of you as my brothers.

411
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:05,359
Don't say that.

412
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,479
Don't you think of me as a brother?

413
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,719
You are right.

414
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:08,800
- We are all good brothers.
- Exactly.

415
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,160
We are all close friends

416
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,040
who fight side by side

417
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,079
under Captain Shen's leadership, right?

418
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,199
When we were exhausted

419
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,280
from training,

420
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,359
we lay on the playground

421
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,760
and applied merbromin
so many times, right?

422
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,319
That's right.

423
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,040
I've never used merbromin.

424
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,680
Brothers.

425
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,479
We are good brothers.

426
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,359
- Come on, brother.
- Hai.

427
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,479
Hai, come on.

428
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:30,920
Brothers.

429
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:35,280
Actually, I've thought about it.

430
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,760
Aside from familiarizing myself

431
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,880
with Lingda's main business,

432
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,160
I also want to open a club.

433
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,719
A shooting club.

434
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,800
During the time I was
on the shooting team,

435
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,199
I learned a lot

436
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,359
from you guys.

437
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,680
So I want to do my part

438
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,359
and make a backup plan for all of you.

439
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:54,359
Boss Du.

440
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,880
Thumbs-up for you.

441
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:05,880
Xiaoci,

442
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,359
now you don't have to worry anymore.

443
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,760
By the way,

444
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,000
listen, guys,

445
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,040
all the positions in the club

446
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,359
are available to you.

447
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,520
Except

448
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:16,359
for the position of the boss's wife.

449
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:18,880
You'd better be careful.

450
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,560
Don't let me

451
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
catch you flirting

452
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,199
with another girl.

453
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,280
Come on.

454
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,719
How would I dare?

455
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I can't wait to take you

456
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,680
to meet my parents,

457
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,079
and get a marriage license

458
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,079
as soon as possible.

459
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,280
Otherwise,

460
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,599
if you are in a bad mood one day

461
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,640
and dump me

462
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,719
for some Shen Qingyuan junior…

463
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,479
Hey, guys,

464
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,239
I'd like to propose

465
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,520
a toast to Boss Du.

466
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,479
Let's use water instead of wine.

467
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,719
Come on.

468
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,359
I used to think you were a bad guy.

469
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,599
Nonsense.

470
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,719
We really don't want you to go.

471
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,359
It's true.

472
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,880
Hey, bro.

473
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,880
I'll still stay for a while.

474
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,479
Don't make it sound

475
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,839
like we'll never see each other again.

476
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,199
Let's have a toast first. Come on.

477
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,880
- Here. Cheers!
- Cheers!

478
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,359
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

479
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,160
Now that I think of it,

480
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,560
we haven't met
each other's parents yet.

481
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,880
I want to get a marriage license
with you.

482
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,760
You are sure a fast learner.

483
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,839
Because I'm willing to learn.

484
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,719
Alright.

485
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,199
My parents live in my hometown.

486
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,239
I'll take you to see them

487
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,239
when you are ready for a vacation.

488
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,560
Okay.

489
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,560
But the thing is
after the winter training,

490
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,079
you'll be busy
with preparing for the match.

491
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,319
With your busy training schedule,

492
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,119
you won't have time
to meet my parents.

493
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,479
It won't take a minute
to get the license.

494
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,719
If you count in the travel time,

495
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,760
one day is plenty enough.

496
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,239
Shen Qingyuan,

497
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,400
you have no idea how big a deal

498
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,560
it is to meet your girlfriend's parents,

499
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,319
do you?

500
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:03,800
It's okay.

501
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,119
Your parents take after you. They must

502
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:06,800
be very easygoing.

503
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,520
What did you say? They take after me?

504
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,160
You take after them.

505
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,800
And your chubby face

506
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,920
is also genetic, right?

507
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,800
Shen Qingyuan!

508
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,119
Shen Qingyuan, don't run!

509
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,079
Shen Qingyuan.

510
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,520
You are having a good time, huh?

511
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:21,800
Anyway,

512
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,719
I'm here to tell you something.

513
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,800
What is it?

514
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,160
Do you know you once
lost your memory?

515
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,800
We are leaving if there's nothing else.

516
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,239
You really don't know,

517
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
or you are just playing dumb

518
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,160
and pretending that you don't?

519
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,160
I see that your girlfriend

520
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,680
submits to you a lot.

521
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:45,760
It must be tough.

522
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,199
But, do you know

523
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,000
that you hurt her once?

524
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,319
What do you mean?

525
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
It was a few years ago,

526
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,119
you two…

527
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:56,880
Zhou Yue,

528
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,000
stop making up absurd stories.

529
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,640
It hasn't been a year
since he and I first met.

530
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,800
Let's go.

531
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,119
A person like him is such a killjoy.

532
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:06,800
Come on.

533
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,760
You still have training this afternoon.

534
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,239
Right?

535
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:08,760
Let's go.

536
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,439
Really?

537
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,680
Are you sure you've only

538
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,880
known each other for less than a year?

539
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,119
Coach Liu.

540
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:33,599
Look.

541
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
Here's the result of today's training.

542
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:39,040
The two teams are nearly neck and neck.

543
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,920
Haiya Team led by eight
and scraped a narrow victory.

544
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,359
Now, please go back to training.

545
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,800
Okay.

546
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,599
Qingyuan,

547
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,439
now that you are back from recuperation,

548
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:56,920
you need to work

549
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,760
on your stability.

550
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,119
It'll soon

551
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
be the National Team selection.

552
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,479
And more tough games

553
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,560
are coming next year.

554
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,280
You need to do your best.

555
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Focus on your training.

556
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,040
I'll collect more material for you.

557
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,520
I thought you were going

558
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,560
to film Du Lingfeng.

559
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,000
Filming you…

560
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,280
Filming you is my ongoing job.

561
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,800
Captain Zhou,

562
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,319
Shen Qingyuan's team defeated us

563
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,319
as soon as he came back.

564
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,640
I really can't take this humiliation.

565
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
They won the cycle assessment

566
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,000
of the joint training last time,

567
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,400
and those who've been
holding their team back

568
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,760
all walk with their heads held high now.

569
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,280
When we won for days in a row,

570
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,959
the leaders didn't say anything.

571
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,719
But when Shen Qingyuan came back,

572
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,520
they even went
to welcome him in person.

573
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,079
That's so unfair.

574
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,439
Don't get anxious.

575
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,160
It'll soon be the final assessment

576
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,400
of the winter training.

577
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:17,959
We'll get our chance

578
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,280
to come back then.

579
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,400
But Shen Qingyuan recovers so quickly.

580
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,000
Will we be able to win them?

581
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:27,040
Captain.

582
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,239
Shen Qingyuan.

583
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,479
I saw a cute video

584
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,839
of hedgehogs today.

585
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,280
Would you like to see it?

586
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,839
I also heard

587
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,959
a few funny jokes.

588
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,400
Let me tell them to you.

589
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,280
Is what Zhou Yue said true?

590
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,040
Why are you still thinking about him?

591
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,959
Don't you remember

592
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,719
that we first met

593
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,040
at the National Shooting

594
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,719
Championship?

595
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,239
Why would I lie to you?

596
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,119
Silly.

597
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,839
But you are looking very nervous.

598
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,199
You are interrogating me like a cop.

599
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,479
Of course, I feel uncomfortable.

600
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Don't you remember me?

601
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,079
You've never

602
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:33,640
thought of me

603
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
in the past years?

604
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,239
I heard that you've won

605
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,760
a lot of awards in shooting.

606
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,560
So,

607
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,119
how were you doing

608
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,400
before you joined Haiya Team?

609
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,239
By the way,

610
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,280
where were you back then?

611
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,119
Yongcheng.

612
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,400
I was in high school.

613
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,199
Which high school?

614
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:00,920
High school…

615
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,359
No. One High School.

616
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Yongcheng No. One High School.

617
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:04,880
What about you?

618
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,199
Yuying.

619
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,520
It's a key high school, isn't it?

620
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,760
But one of us was
in the south of the town,

621
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,959
while the other was in the north.

622
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:16,959
Then why did you

623
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,479
ask me if I remembered you?

624
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,640
Because I liked you,

625
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,760
I always wanted to know you.

626
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,479
But later I found

627
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,319
that you didn't like to be disturbed.

628
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,839
Really?

629
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,640
Of course.

630
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,000
You don't believe that I liked you?

631
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,479
I didn't mean that…

632
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,199
Hurry and eat your dinner.

633
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:39,199
You still have night training later.

634
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:40,439
Here.

635
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,280
(A surprise for you.)

636
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,680
(Zhou Yue)

637
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
(This is the group picture
of your twelfth-grade class.)

638
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,600
(Which one is Tang Xin?
I've thoughtfully marked her for you!)

639
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,400
Do you know you
once lost your memory?

640
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,319
You really don't know,

641
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
or you are just playing dumb

642
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,560
and pretending that you don't?

643
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,839
Do you remember when was

644
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,040
the first time you met me?

645
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,760
It was the time

646
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,119
when you first said hi to me.

647
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,880
And you even

648
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,040
pretended that you knew me.

649
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,800
Keep eating.
The dishes are getting cold.

650
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,240
(Counseling Room)
(Consulting)

651
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,280
You want to know
why I went to find Tang Xin

652
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,880
when you were in hospital?

653
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,640
You don't have to repeat my question.

654
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,239
So that's why you are here.

655
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,880
Shen Qingyuan,

656
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,359
you know

657
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,719
Tang Xin's problem, right?

658
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,520
That's all you talked about?

659
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,160
What else could we talk about then?

660
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,359
Don't tell me

661
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,640
you are really jealous of me.

662
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,160
Stop worrying.

663
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,800
She came here

664
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,680
only for

665
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,760
her own therapy

666
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,560
so that she can have a future with you.

667
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,440
(Restroom)

668
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,640
What were you

669
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,079
talking about yesterday?

670
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,119
Captain Shen,

671
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,079
is it the right attitude

672
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,079
to ask someone for a favor?

673
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,400
Plus,

674
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,000
there are so many people

675
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,800
in the hallway.

676
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,680
Do you really want the others

677
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,439
to find the skeleton in your closet?

678
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,040
If you want to know,

679
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:49,920
meet me on the terrace at noon.

680
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,359
Qingyuan.

681
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,160
I need to go to the restroom.

682
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,040
Can't hold it anymore.

683
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,119
Here.

684
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,119
Tang Xin.

685
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,640
What's wrong?

686
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,079
Had a fight with Shen Qingyuan?

687
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:18,760
No.

688
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,479
He has something to take care of.

689
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,119
What kind of thing is more important

690
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,439
than spending time with you?

691
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,719
He'd even tie you on his belt

692
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:27,160
when he goes

693
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,400
to the bathroom if he could.

694
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,680
It's okay, Xiaoci.

695
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,199
(Tang Xin,)

696
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,280
(are you with Shen Qingyuan)

697
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,040
(right now?)

698
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,479
(No.)

699
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,199
(He said he had something
to do this noon.)

700
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,400
(He came to my office today)

701
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,359
(and asked me what we talked
about in your sessions.)

702
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:04,800
(Shen Qingyuan,)

703
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,479
(would you like me to bring you lunch?)

704
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,400
(Where are you?)

705
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:16,479
(I've had lunch.)

706
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,599
(I'll take a nap.)

707
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,640
(Okay. Then see you in the afternoon.)

708
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:45,880
You have no proof.

709
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,199
I'm not a three-year-old

710
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,560
whom you can fool

711
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,479
with a made-up story.

712
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,719
Shen Qingyuan,

713
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:01,160
do you believe
there are ghosts in this world?

714
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,319
Of course not.

715
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,119
Sorry,

716
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,400
but I do.

717
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,680
Ghosts are in people's hearts.

718
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,479
Touch your chest

719
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,359
and see if there's a ghost.

720
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,560
If you want proof,

721
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:29,000
see it for yourself.

722
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,199
Same day,

723
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
same time,

724
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,440
(Local Policemen Arrested a Gang)
(Guilty of Robbery and Sexual Assault)

725
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,680
and same place.

726
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
One is surnamed Shen,

727
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,239

Do you know what it means?

729
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,160
Alright, stop guessing.

730
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,079
I'll be kind enough

731
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,199
to help you all the way.

732
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,839
Let me help you

733

piece together the truth.

734
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
At that time,

735
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,319
you and Tang Xin were already in love.

736
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,439
One day

737
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,560
when you were on a date,

738
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,239
you encountered a gang.

739
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,280
They kidnapped Tang Xin

740
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,719
and asked you to get money.

741
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,479
Guess what happened next?

742
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,359
You abandoned her and ran away.

743
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,280
You were

744
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,599
so scared

745
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,640
and in a hurry

746
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:34,439
that you were hit by a car.

747
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,479
As for Tang Xin,

748
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,920
she was almost…

749
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,319
Shen Qingyuan,

750
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
I really don't know

751
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,079
whether you really lost your memory

752
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,000
or you are just faking it.

753
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,760
Are you just playing dumb

754
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,119
and fooling everybody?

755
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,599
But you are lucky

756
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,479
to have such a nice girlfriend.

757
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,520
Though she's the victim,

758
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,119
she still keeps it a secret

759
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,160
to be with you.

760
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,399
You guys are a perfect match

761
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,760
indeed.

762
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,320
This was the accident scene.

763
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,879
No cash was found at all.

764
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:38,879
Do you have more to say?

765
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,879
24.

766
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,280
Seven.

767
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,360
This is the time I need to protect you.

768
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:24,560
But you are lucky

769
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,439
to have such a nice girlfriend.

770
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,679
Though she's the victim,

771
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,399
she still keeps it a secret

772
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,360
to be with you.

773
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,439
You've never

774
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,040
thought of me

775
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,959
in the past years?

776
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,159
He can't do an eyedrops commercial.

777
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,320
His visual acuity

778
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:38,280
is only 0.1.

779
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,320
Shen Qingyuan,

780
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,320
you never take me into consideration.

781
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,800
If you did even just for a short time,

782
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,439
you'd know

783
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:48,000
that all you're saying right now
is an excuse,

784

Did we know each other at that time?

835
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:03,479
I told you

836
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:04,399
that I liked you,

837
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,479
so I searched for your information.

838
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,800
What about my eyesight?

839
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:13,399
Most athletes

840

have bad eyesight.

841
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,560
It's an occupational problem.

842
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,000
Yeah.

843
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,360
Then why did you keep asking me

844
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,000
if I've ever thought about you?

845
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,560
I don't think that's what I asked.

846
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,199
Maybe you remembered wrong.

847
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,919
I might have asked about the years

848
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,639

in those years.

853
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,919
It doesn't matter.

854
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,159

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,159

Don't listen to him.

858
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Is he a liar

859
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,679
or you've been keeping
the truth from me?

860
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,120
I was hit by a car in 2015.

863
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,679
Are you going to deny it all?

864
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,639
I only found out about it later.

865
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:41,679
But,

866
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,959
Dr. Ding said

867
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,919
what you have is selective amnesia.

868
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,679
Though you forgot me,

869
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,600
it's okay,

870
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,919
we ended up

871
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:53,159
together again.

872
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,159
So everything he said is true.

873
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:08,760
So,

874
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,560
I'm the one who betrayed you,

875
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:17,560
abandoned you,

876
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,000
and hurt you.

877
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:28,919
Shen Qingyuan…

878
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:33,080
I need to go back to my training.
