(Idle)

36
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,480
Tang Xin.

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,919
What brings you here?

38
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,360
Dr. Ding.

39
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,600
I don't know

40
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,559
what to do now.

41
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,119
Shen Qingyuan has known it all.

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,320
What's going on?

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,360
Take it easy. Tell me slowly.

44
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,479
He's got to know he lost his memory.

45
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:18,160
Now he thinks he's the one
who put me through the sufferings.

46
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,479
You can add some weight training

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,240
to your regular training nowadays.

48
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:28,759
Captain.

49
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:33,919
Captain.

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,240
Captain Shen.

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,520
You guys

52
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,080
should spend more time resting

53
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,360
outside of your regular training.

54
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,600
Otherwise, just look at Shen Qingyuan

55
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,080
who got injured

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,199
and rushed back for training,

57
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,199
torturing himself into a walking zombie.

58
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,320
For an athlete,

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,720
if his hidden psychological illness

60
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,279
attacks him now,

61
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,520
there could be terrible consequences.

62
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,479
Is there a solution?

63
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,160
Even if it works in the short term,

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,520
it can't address the root cause

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,240
and will end up
affecting him all his life.

66
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,119
The Olympic qualifier

67
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,080
is getting closer and closer.

68
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,639
For Shen Qingyuan,

69
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,639
not a second is to be wasted next year.

70
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,320
Dr. Ding,

71
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,039
is there a way
that can have it both ways?

72
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,360
First, Shen Qingyuan needs
to be aware of

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,119
and accept

74
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,479
his psychological problems

75
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,039
and volunteer to

76
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,000
seek medical attention.

77
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,399
Although it is

78
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,080
a very long and grinding process,

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,440
it is better than

80
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,039
a sudden explosion with a bang.

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,720
Tang Xin,

82
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,399
before Shen Qingyuan

83
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,880
volunteers to seek medical attention,

84
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,160
I hope

85
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,440
you can find a way

86
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,639
to have

87
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,119
a frank and straight talk with him.

88
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,880
At such a time, we can only

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,240
try to ease the signs of a flare-up

90
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,279
as much as we can.

91
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,639
I see.

92
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,119
Thank you, Dr. Ding.

93
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm going for now.

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,000
Take it easy.

95
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,960
Let me know if anything comes up.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,520
OK.

97
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,239
Hello, Coach Zhang.

98
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,519
Something may be wrong
with Shen Qingyuan.

99
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,840
It's this one. This is the word.

100
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,200
He's over there.

101
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,559
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,720
Go.

103
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,040
Captain.

104
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,040
Captain.

105
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,160
Captain looks so handsome

106
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,920
even when he's changing the air bottle.

107
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,720
Did you see it?

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,359
Learn from Captain

109
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:49,839
so that we can do it like him later.

110
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,880
Captain,

111
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,119
can you

112
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,160
correct the rear sight for us later?

113
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,839
Yes, yes, yes.

114
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,440
Captain,

115
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,200
it's not because we are lazy.

116
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,119
Everybody knows

117
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,799
you are the best at it.

118
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,079
Change it for us tomorrow,

119
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,600
Captain.

120
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:01,600
Yes.

121
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,640
Captain,

122
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,799
why are you pumping air for so long?

123
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,399
Yes.

124
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:13,000
Is the air bottle leaking?

125
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,119
Maybe.

126
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,959
It's leaking.

127
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,440
Captain,

128
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
correct the rear sight…

129
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,640
Look.

130
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,000
You are just being garrulous.

131
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,959
Captain was actually checking

132
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,239
whether the air bottle
was leaking or not just now.

133
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,480
That's right.

134
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,279
I even began to question

135
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,600
his common sense just now.

136
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:36,640
Don't worry.

137
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,000
For the assessment tomorrow,

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
with Captain being our ace in the hole,

139
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,359
we two minions

140
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,720
will just have to
show our regular performance, right?

141
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,000
All right.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,359
Let's not bring more trouble

143
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,040
to Captain.

144
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,559
Let's go.

145
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,799
Where are we going to hang out

146
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,799
if we win the assessment match tomorrow?

147
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,600
Yes.

148
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,559
This is the right question

149
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,559
for us to consider.

150
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,399
Is anything the matter?

151
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,519
No.

152
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,920
The seal ring is broken.

153
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,079
Shouldn't be a big problem.

154
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,279
Come to see me anytime
if there's a problem.

155
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,239
Qingyuan.

156
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,880
Xin,

157
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,480
do you need my help today?

158
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,480
It's OK.

159
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,079
Let me be the cameraman today.

160
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,880
Have a rest yourself.

161
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,559
Let me take you to have some good food.

162
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,440
Tell Captain

163
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,480
not to practice so hard.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,959
I've practiced like this before.

165
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,440
It would only add to the mental burden.

166
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,799
Besides, he has such skilled

167
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:31,559
muscle memory that

168
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:32,559
he doesn't need to practice.

169
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,320
Miss Live Streamer, we are going first.

170
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,919
OK, thanks.

171
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,080
Xin,

172
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,479
I'm going back for now.

173
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,679
I'll take the material back first

174
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,440
and give it to you later.

175
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:52,719
Bye, Qingyuan.

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,280
Whether it's pheromone

177
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,719
or muscle memory,

178
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,599
it all comes out of

179
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,719
the guilt I felt for her.

180
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,080
Shen Qingyuan, I…

181
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,640
I haven't finished

182
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
what I said last time.

183
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,599
I wanted to say,

184
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,080
fortunately,

185
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,919
the police arrived in time later

186
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,760
and saved me.

187
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,760
I was unscathed.

188
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,320
But you had a car accident

189
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,200
while you were trying to save me.

190
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,520
I should be the one to say sorry.

191
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,479
Please leave

192
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:40,440
when the match starts a while later.

193
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,679
Why?

194
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,799
I don't want to see you.

195
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
Shen Qingyuan,

196
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,080
don't be angry anymore, OK?

197
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,799
I'm hungry.

198
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,960
Let's go for dinner.

199
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,080
I suppose no contract
has been signed so far, right?

200
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,840
Since no contract has been signed,

201
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,359
then I'm not

202
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,479
obligated to play along with you now.

Even if you don't take me as a friend,

204
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,440
you shouldn't go

205
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,239
without saying goodbye.

206
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,359
Shen Qingyuan,

207
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,039
what happened is all in the past.

208
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:29,679
What's the point

209
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,640
of pursuing it further now?

210
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,799
Don't take it to heart,

211
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,640
OK?

212
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,039

What do you suggest

356
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,239
we do after the training?

357
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,719
Let's see when it's over.

358
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,920
It depends on your performance.

359
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,119
Are you hungry?

360
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,000
Do you want something to eat?

Today is the day
for the final assessment match

at the end of the joint training
of our two teams.

On your marks!

369
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,240
Go.

370
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,640
I've got it for you.

371
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:12,520
We are a team

372
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,560
headed by Shen Qingyuan.

373
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,400
Let them bring it on.

374
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,680
Look at Captain.

375
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,839
He's as cool as a cucumber.

376
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:19,640
Awesome.

377
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:20,920
He was born for shooting.

378
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,280
Born for shooting.

Miss Tang, Miss Tang,

380
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:26,000
can you hear me?

381
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,680
Yes, I can.

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,839
OK. Listen to my cues.

383
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,599
Get ready for the lead-in.

384
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,359
Three, two, one.

385
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:34,680
Good morning.

386
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,280
This is the live scene of the Olympics.

387
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,319
Stop, stop, stop.

388
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,400
Young lady,

389
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,000
are you still asleep?

390
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:41,800
Sorry, sorry.

391
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,319
I… I'll say it again.

392
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,760
The young girl Tang Xin

393
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,800
is not doing well today.

394
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,479
She's not at her best.

395
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,239
Why do I feel

396
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,199
she's not the only one

397
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,280
who's not at their best?

398
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,880
Camera No.2,

399
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,839
zoom in.

400
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:55,719
Give a close-up of Shen's hand.

401
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:56,599
The director asks you

402
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,640
to give a close-up of Shen's hand.

403
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,280
Zoom in.

404
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,160
Captain Shen.

405
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:16,680
Why are you trial shooting
without loading your pistol?

406
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,319
OK, director.

407
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,000
Be quick. Switch the camera over there.

408
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,880
Turn it around.

409
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:26,880
Captain Shen,

410
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,479
although you are
playing against minnows,

411
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,959
just don't be so casual.

412
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,479
We haven't partnered up for a long time.

413
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:37,359
We must

414
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,719
beat them a while later.

415
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
Isn't it going well?

416
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,959
Who was sending a false alarm just now?

417
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,280
Mr. Xu.

418
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,000
- Mr. Xu.
- Mr. Xu.

419
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,719
What brings you here?

420
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm here to watch the match.

421
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,719
Mainly because it's not exciting enough

422
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,719
to watch it on TV at home.

423
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,439
Get on with your work.

424
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,000
Don't let me hold you up.

425
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,239
I'm gonna join the live audience.

426
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
The match begins.

427
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,880
Ready.

428
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:36,280
Shoot!

429
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,000
All right, Tang Xin.

430
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,119
You can film freely.

431
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,000
Listen to my cues at any time.

432
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:41,760
OK.

433
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,640
Why does the pistol sound a bit strange?

434
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,959
Could it be yesterday Shen Qingyuan…

435
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,239
It really doesn't sound right.

436
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,839
Your boyfriend has scored 3 tens.

437
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,800
That's divine marksmanship.

438
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,479
Tang Liqi,

439
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,599
can you tell

440
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,479
anything wrong with the sound

441
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:45,479
of Shen Qingyuan's pistol?

442
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,640
I keep finding the sound strange.

443
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:48,880
Is it?

444
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,000
I can't tell.

445
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,880
Xin, don't worry too much.

446
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,199
Maybe

447
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,479
I was wearing the headphone
for too long.

448
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,479
With so many years
of competition experience,

449
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,959
Qingyuan has a pro mentality.

450
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,119
No problem.

451
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,239
Is the camera shooting going well?

452
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:26,680
Do a good job of it.

453
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,280
Rest easy.

454
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,560
It seems he's not been hit hard enough.

455
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,239
He can still keep competing.

456
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,040
A good hit has a strong aftereffect.

457
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,079
Don't you think so?

458
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,280
But there is one thing

459
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,359
I can't wrap my head around.

460
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,079
Why could Shen Qingyuan still maintain

461
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,680
his original results in the first half?

462
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,199
Although his brain has braked to a halt,

463
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,839
the inertia

464
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,520
can't stop for a while.

465
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,680
What happens next?

466
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,359
How can we just make him stop?

467
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,520
We must take advantage of this inertia

468
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,760
and set up a stumbling stock

469
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,400
to make him fail completely.

470
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,560
Or what am I here for?

471
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,520
Group 1 of the qualifiers is over.

472
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,000
Group 2 Southeast Team get ready.

473
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:38,760
OK.

474
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,319
Captain Zhou,

475
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,079
it's a piece of cake
for us to overtake them.

476
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,640
Just keep boasting.

477
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,440
Keep boasting.

478
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,439
Why?

479
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,000
Are you not convinced?

480
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:45,719
So what?

481
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,800
Go back quickly to prepare.

482
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,439
What a disgrace!

483
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,040
Go back quickly.

484
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
It's good that Qingyuan and Xiaoci

485
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,239
have entered the final.

486
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,439
You guys

487
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,599
don't often take Captain Shen's results

488
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,599
as your own.

489
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,400
Why are you so thick-skinned

490
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,239
all day long?

491
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:02,839
What matters is

492
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,079
you should do well yourself.

493
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,199
Do you get it?

494
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:05,719
Yes.

495
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,160
Do you get it?

496
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,680
Yes.

497
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,400
Yes, Coach.

498
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,920
Yes.

499
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,319
Qingyuan, Xiaoci,

500
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,000
take a 15-minute break.

501
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,160
Go on after that.

502
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,880
OK.

503
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,800
You are a real sharpshooter, Xiaoci.

504
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,400
Well done.

505
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,520
Did you find

506
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,640
Captain Shen a bit weird?

507
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,520
What's weird about him?

508
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,439
He's always like this.

509
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,479
Xiaoci,

510
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,359
I've found a restaurant.

511
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,359
We can go there later.

512
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,439
OK.

513
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,640
Take a break.

514
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:36,719
Tang Liqi,

515
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:37,719
keep an eye on it for me.

516
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,199
OK.

517
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,000
Shen Qingyuan,

518
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,319
you did well in the semi-final.

519
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,079
It's good to go out for a breath of air,

520
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,439
which helps to keep you in top shape.

521
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,920
But Shen Qingyuan,

522
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,280
why don't you

523
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,760
check your pistol later?

524
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,199
Shen Qingyuan.

525
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,920
Shen Qingyuan.

526
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,599
Miss Tang.

527
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,920
Jiang Yitian.

528
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,400
Could you tell

529
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,280
there was something wrong

530
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,439
with your captain's pistol?

531
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,239
No.

532
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,199
Captain did pretty well.

533
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:33,359
What could go wrong?

534
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,119
Miss Tang,

535
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,640
are you and Captain…

536
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:39,280
What happened?

537
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,640
Something was really wrong.

538
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,239
You could tell by listening carefully.

539
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,880
Speaking of which,

540
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,599
yesterday morning

541
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,040
Captain seemed to
have repaired his pistol.

542
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,560
Yes, yes.

543
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,920
Yesterday the seal ring of his pistol's

544
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,560
air bottle was broken,

545
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,079
but he found out at once.

546
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:53,760
Yes, yes, yes.

547
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,680
Besides, if Captain

548
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,439
doesn't see a need

549
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,400
to check it now,

550
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,119
there must be
nothing wrong with the pistol.

551
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:58,640
Yes.

552
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,400
Miss Tang,

553
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,439
I think you're just being over-concerned

554
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:02,239
and overthinking.

555
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,160
Don't worry.

556
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,000
Captain will

557
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,520
win a gold medal for you later.

558
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:08,959
Captain,

559
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:09,880
let's go together. Let's go together.

560
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,520
Let's go together.

561
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,239
10m Air Pistol

562
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,640
men and women mixed team final,

563
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,800
finalists on your marks.

564
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,079
Five-minute trial shooting.

565
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,479
Keep it up, Captain.

566
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:25,560
- Come on, Captain.
- Keep it up, Captain.

567
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,199
Keep it up, Captain Shen.

568
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:27,079
Come on, Xiaoci.

569
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,560
Stop shooting.

570
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,400
Open your cartridge clips.

571
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:25,000
Finalists load your pistols.

572
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,439
Shoot.

573
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,719
A few years ago,

574
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:36,839
I was kidnapped by a gang.

575
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:39,599
Later,

576
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,719
fortunately, the police arrived in time,

577
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,400
otherwise, I…

578
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:54,079
Captain Shen.

579
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:55,800
Captain Shen.

580
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:13,599
Although I didn't sustain

581
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,160
any physical harm,

582
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,479
from then on,

583
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,040
I've been very afraid of having…

584
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,439
intimate contact with the opposite sex.

585
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,079
He missed the target.

586
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,359
He missed the target?

587
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,640
Is there anything wrong
with the score indicator?

588
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,599
Could it be there's
something wrong with the pistol?

589
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,880
Wait a minute, Tang Xin.

590
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:49,599
Tang Xin.

591
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:49,839
Mr. Xu!

592
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:50,680
Wait a minute, Tang Xin.

593
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,280
- Tang Xin, I'll see you home later.
- Mr. Xu! Let go of me, Mr. Xu!

594
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,680
- Tang Xin. Tang Xin, I like you.
- Mr. Xu!

595
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:54,680
Tang Xin…

596
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,359
- Let go of me, Mr. Xu!
- Tang Xin. Tang Xin, I like you.

597
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,359
- Captain Shen! Captain Shen!
- Captain Shen!

598
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:21,000
- Captain Shen!
- Captain!

599
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,640
- Captain!
- Qingyuan!

600
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,800
- Captain!
- Captain!

601
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,520
Captain!

602
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,319
Shen Qingyuan!

603
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,640
Shen Qingyuan!

604
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,599
Shen Qingyuan!

605
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,479
Now they are happy.

606
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:51,760
Southeast Team won.

607
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,719
What was wrong with Captain?

608
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,920
He just missed the target.

609
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,959
He didn't have to
waive the right to compete.

610
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,680
Yes.

611
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,520
Besides, I don't seem to have seen

612
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,640
Captain Shen miss the target before.

613
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,880
There must be something wrong with him.

614
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,920
He was off his game indeed.

615
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,719
He didn't even load his pistol
for the trial shooting.

616
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:07,839
Had he done that before?

617
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:09,239
Never.

618
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,400
He had always been

619
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,760
in a very stable condition
during training.

620
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,280
That's weird then.

621
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,479
Why did he suddenly do that?

622
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:17,760
Is he out of his mind?

623
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,599
What are you talking about?

624
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,959
I may know the reason.

625
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,520
Shen Qingyuan,

626
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,439
don't be like this anymore.

627
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,719
What can't you get over?

628
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,680
I'm all right now.

629
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,479
Why are you

630
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,719
still obsessed with this?

631
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,959
I went to the restroom the other day

632
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:56,959
and saw

633
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,359
Zhou Yue being with Qingyuan.

634
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,760
At that time, Zhou Yue

635
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,079
mentioned something like

636
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,839
the skeleton in the closet,

637
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:03,719
and then I found Qingyuan

638
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:04,959
started to be off his game.

639
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:05,959
In retrospect,

640
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,839
what happened to Qingyuan

641
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:07,599
must have

642
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,719
something to do with Zhou Yue.

643
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,800
The skeleton in the closet?

644
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,319
What shameful secret does he have?

645
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,319
Captain returned from abroad

646
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:14,920
as a transfer student.

647
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,199
We don't know either.

648
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,760
He has such a mysterious past.

649
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,079
Don't be garrulous.

650
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,319
Think about what we can do.

651
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:24,319
I'm a real idiot.

652
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,280
I knew that guy

653
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
has an evil intention.

654
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,560
I just didn't keep a close eye on him.

655
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,079
What's to be done about Captain now?

656
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,479
We must do something.

657
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,400
As to Shen Qingyuan,

658
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,920
we can't help him much

659
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,079
except to count on Tang Xin.

660
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,400
Let's look into Zhou Yue.

661
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,280
Since Zhou Yue left the base

662
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,319
mysteriously that day,

663
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,640
I've been keeping an eye

664
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,359
on his whereabouts.

665
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,040
But he didn't go out again.

666
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:49,800
That's to say,

667
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:51,319
the only possibility is that

668
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,959
when he was out that day,

669
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,160
he brought something back

670
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,920
to show Shen Qingyuan.

671
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,680
Shall we

672
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,640
sneak into his dorm?

673
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,199
No, no.

674
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,920
We're not staying in the same dorm area.

675
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:04,160
We'll be easily spotted.

676
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Even so, we have to go.

677
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,680
Actually, compared with the dorm,

678
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,479
the locker room is a more likely place.

679
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,959
Why?

680
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,679
When Zhou Yue came back that day,

681
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,560
it was very late.

682
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,520
I was following him all the way.

683
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,800
You guys were training.

684
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,959
I saw him go straight
to the locker room,

685
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,959
change into his team uniform

686
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,479
and go back to his room.

687
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,639
I thought you usually change into

688
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,159
your team uniform for training, right?

689
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,719
Why did he go straight back to his room?

690
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,840
So I thought it was weird.

691
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,719
That was weird indeed.

692
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,479
The locker room is worth a visit.

693
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,199
Let's do it this way.

694
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Let's go to the locker room.

695
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,199
Xiaoci,

696
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,280
you go to see Tang Xin.

697
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,679
All right. Let's go.

698
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,360
Let's go.

699
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
It's not that simple, is it?

700
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,679
Let's play it by ear.

701
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:42,959
- Yes. Let's go.
- Go.

702
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,639
- Get changed quickly, bros.
- Get changed quickly.

703
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,919
We must not lose this time,

704
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:50,439
I tell you what.

705
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,879
What do you want, Haiya members?

706
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,040
Your locker room is next door.

707
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,120
Give back the stuff.

708
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,879
What are you talking about?

709
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:02,879
What do you think I'm talking about?

710
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:04,040
You Southeast Team members

711
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:05,520
stole our wallets

712
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,479
while our team was being disorganized.

713
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:08,280
- Don't talk nonsense.
- Are you insane?

714
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,919
I ask you to

715
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:11,520
give back the stuff.

716
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,280
Do you get it?

717
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
- You want a fight?
- What are you doing?

718
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,280
Come on, you come out.

719
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,360
I'm gonna hit you, so what?

720
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:15,919
Go!

721
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:16,959
- Go out!
- Go out!

722
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,800
Come out, come on.

723
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,760
Out…

724
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,280
Go out to talk.

725
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,120
I'm not afraid of you.

726
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,040
Cut the crap. Come out!

727
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,600
- Go!
- Go!

728
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
(Name: Zhou Yue)

729
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:38,560
Where's the stuff?

730
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:39,760
Have you disposed of it?

731
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,959
Burned up.

732
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,239
And the stuff in your cellphone?

733
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:44,919
All deleted.

734
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,919
That kind of stuff

735
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,280
must not be kept.

736
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:48,639
OK.

737
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,000
Shen Qingyuan!

738
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,959
Can you act normal?

739
00:35:57,919 --> 00:35:58,600
Is it because

740
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,639
I didn't go back to save you

741
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,360
that you became afraid of

742
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,719
having intimate contact
with the opposite sex?

743
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:10,840
I…

744
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,399
I am the knot in your heart.

745
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,560
Yes.

746
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:27,919
Now

747
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,320
it's time to make everything clear.

748
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:37,959
Back then,

749
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,000
because you didn't come back,

750
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,360
I was almost…

751
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,199
sexually assaulted.

752
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,560
But Shen Qingyuan,

753
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,040
think carefully about it.

754
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:02,520
First,

755
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,959
I got saved by the police.

756
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,399
Second,

757
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:08,879
it was because you had a car accident

758
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,360
that you didn't come back.

759
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,639
It was a pardonable circumstance.

760
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,320
Why do you

761
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,639
keep having such obsessive ideas

762
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,239
to give yourself a hard time?

763
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,520
Because it was my fault indeed.

764
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,120
No.

765
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,560
It was really not.

766
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,800
You can't even remember the past.

767
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,760
Why are you so sure?

768
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,719
I fled.

769
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,120
You… You didn't.

770
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,439
Sorry.

771
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,919
I can't forgive myself.

772
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,679
I never intended to

773
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,560
go back to save you.

774
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,280
Neither did I go back to get the money.

775
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:07,439
No way.

776
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,439
I don't believe that.

777
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,360
Shen Qingyuan,

778
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:18,159
you can't even remember all this,

779
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,439
but why do you still believe others

780
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:21,439
instead of me

781
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,919
and yourself?

782
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:30,320
There was no cash

783
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,879
on the scene of the car accident.

784
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:47,840
There was no cash at all

785
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,360
on the scene of the car accident.

786

what exactly has happened?

809
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,199
Who did he have dinner with

810
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,199
to run up a bill of over 2,600 yuan?

811
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,879
Go, go, go.

812
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,520
I'd be a goner
