=Hello, The Sharpshooter=

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
=Episode 34=

35
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,440
No.

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,919
That person

37
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,279
was probably Xu Dian.

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,639
Xu Dian?

39
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,199
That's what happened.

40
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,080
He now thinks

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,400
he abandoned me.

42
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,279
So...

43
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,319
You knew each other years ago.

44
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,319
No wonder

45
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,720
Captain Shen

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,360
overreacted when the first time

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,320
he saw you.

48
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,600
But I can't believe

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,919
he forgot all about you.

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,919
Dr. Ding said

51
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,320
it's a normal symptom

52
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,399
once one's traumatized.

53
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,080
His extreme avoidance

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
of certain things

55
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,839
caused his

56
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,080
selective amnesia.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,759
Do you believe
that he abandoned you?

58
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,679
I didn't believe it,

59
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,279
but then he personally told me.

60
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,360
I don't know.

61
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't think

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,240
Captain Shen would do it.

63
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,160
He loved you so much.

64
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,320
He couldn't have abandoned you.

65
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,240
There must

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,399
be a misunderstanding.

67
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,119
Now, now.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,479
But I'm still a bit scared.

69
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,880
What if he's spoken the truth?

70
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,039
What do I do, then?

71
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:05,679
Tang Xin,

72
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
you still like him,

73
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,360
don't you?

74
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,839
If...

75
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,320
I mean if

76
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,639
Shen Qingyuan spoke the truth,

77
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,600
would you continue to love him?

78
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,080
I…

79
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,839
I wish I could stop.

80
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,839
You're so cute.

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,919
You wish?

82
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,520
It means you'll still love him.

83
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,080
Am I right?

84
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,240
Since you'll continue loving him,

85
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,679
what are you worried about?

86
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,759
And what Shen Qingyuan said

87
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,839
isn't necessarily the truth.

88
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,039
He heard it from Zhou Yue,

89
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,639
right?

90
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,679
What if that's not true?

91
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,759
Not true?

92
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,800
Right.

93
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,759
Relax.

94
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,679
I'm sure he won't leave you.

95
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080
So right now,

96
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,320
the top priority

97
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,080
is to figure out the truth

98
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,679
to get Shen Qingyuan
back on his feet.

99
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,399
As well as you.

100
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:08,880
Shen Qingyuan now

101
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,399
needs you very much.

102
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,639
He's expecting you

103
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,160
to pull him out of the mire.

104
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,160
I still don't think

105
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,519
it's right to jump to the conclusion

106
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,359
that Zhou Yue and Xu Dian

107
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,000
are working together

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,959
merely based on the fact

109
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,880
that they nodded and smiled
at each other.

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's not just that.

111
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,920
Xu Dian

112
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,160
isn't as decent as

113
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,640
he appears to be.

114
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,880
How come?

115
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,519
He's been in the biz for long.

116
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,480
I never heard of any rumor

117
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,519
about him.

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,720
Xu Dian

119
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,279
harassed my sister before.

120
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,760
Did he?

121
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,160
At the time,

122
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,519
it was Qingyuan, Mr. Zhou

123
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,559
and Xiaoci

124
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,440
who helped my sister
get out of the problem.

125
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Please keep it to yourselves.

126
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,720
You have to.

127
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,119
I wondered

128
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,880
why they withdrew from

129
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
our winter training livestream
halfway through.

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,839
You never judge a man by his appearance.

131
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,519
I notice

132
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,519
Xu Dian and Zhou Yue

133
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,920
always have a problem
against Qingyuan,

134
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:06,119
so that's why I suspect

135
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,720
that they joined hands

136
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,359
to plot this.

137
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,279
Let's go.

138
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,119
That's…

139
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,279
Hey, look.

140
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,239
That was fun, wasn't it?

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,399
Thanks to you.

142
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,040
Getting angry with a young man.

143
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,799
- It was my bad.
- Right?

144
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,640
But the thought

145
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,119
of ruining a genius with my own hand

146
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,640
excites me.

147
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,399
We'll grab a meal together later.

148
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,559
Go back now.

149
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,920
Go.

150
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:50,799
So Captain and Miss Tang

151
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,040
had a history.

152
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,040
It's so touching.

153
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,880
Maybe they're predestined.

154
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:56,920
What about Tang Xin?

155
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,839
How is she doing?

156
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,600
I walked her back to the dorm.

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,359
She looked alright.

158
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:03,320
But certain damage was done, though.

159
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,920
What's the matter, Liqi?

160
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,679
I'm fine.

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I just didn't expect

162
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,399
that boy

163
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,160
to be Captain Shen.

164
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,679
You know about this.

165
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,040
Of course.

166
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,519
When it happened,

167
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,239
my sister

168
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,359
had been down for quite a long period.

169
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,160
She couldn't

170
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,920
find the boy anymore.

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
So it was a car accident.

172
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,000
And you?

173
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,399
I'm fine.

174
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,600
I know

175
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,640
how much Qingyuan loves my sister.

176
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,920
I don't believe

177
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,480
he would

178
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,600
escape on his own.

179
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:38,920
Yes.

180
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,040
We all know

181
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,079
Captain Shen is a decent man.

182
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,920
Now that we've sorted it out,

183
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,279
let's take action.

184
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
What do we do?

185
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,920
First, we find Shen Qingyuan.

186
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,160
He can't run around anymore.

187
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,760
Then we

188
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,880
figure out what exactly happened

189
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,480
before we deal with Zhou Yue
and Xu Dian.

190
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:56,519
Okay. Let's move.

191
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,040
Go.

192
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,200
♪Unwittingly or intentionally♪

193
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,400
♪Feels like I know you
when I meet you♪

194
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,600
♪Close or distant♪

195
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,040
♪My feelings for you

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
♪I'm a paradox♪

197
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,560
♪I want to get close
but I keep a distance♪

198
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,040
♪Keep a safe distance♪

00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,040
4.5-mm bee pellet.

200
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,959
Two big ends, and a narrow waist.

201
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,440
So it's also known as diabolo pellet.

202
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,839
Noted.

203
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,559
Oh, right.

204
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,040
The head is flat.

205
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,559
I can't be more detailed.

206
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,040
You can make a handicraft.

207
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,720
Who says I'll make any handicraft?

208
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,920
I didn't.

209
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,520
♪Can't cure the heart♪

210
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,760
Very important.

211
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,440
The gift that you made?

212
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,000
Go.

213
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,760
You hand-made it.

214
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,000
We can't lose it.

215
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,640
♪You're my source of happiness♪

216
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
♪You're my source of sorrow♪

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,559
Wait.

218
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,239
You said

219
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,359
you made a lot of them,

220
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,000
but why is there only one?

221
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,080
Because only the most exquisite one

222
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,000
could be picked out for you

223
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,200
from a pile

224
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,119
of electable models.

225
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,440
I chose this one.

226
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,880
The others must be exquisite too.

227
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,960
You didn't even see them.

228
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,799
I didn't need to.

229
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,000
You still owe me a bracelet.

230
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,880
Bracelets are not allowed
during competition.

231
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,280
An anklet also would do.

232
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:52,039
We shouldn't waste

233
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,080
such exquisite craftsmanship.

234
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,840
(Jiang Yitian)

235
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,960
Miss Tang,

236
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,280
Captain Shen has gone missing.

237
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Do you see Captain Shen?

238
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,359
No.

239
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,119
Where is he?

240
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,599
Hello.

241
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,760
Sorry.

242
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,320
Hi, man.

243
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,080
How is it going?

244
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,080
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

245
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,599
What about you?

246
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,440
No.

247
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,760
You found him?

248
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,440
Hai, what about you?

249
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,000
No.

250
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,840
And you?

251
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,400
No.

252
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,119
Me, either.

253
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,760
Miss Tang,

254
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,799
any luck?

255
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,599
No.

256
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,239
How about we call the police
and watch the surveillance videos?

257
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,200
Okay.

258
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,719
No, no.

259
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,840
Why?

260
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,679
Once we go to the police,

261
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,200
the entire team,

262
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,559
the shooting sports center,
and the Sports Bureau

263
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,599
will know this.

264
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,119
If he's penalized

265
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,000
of going AWOL,

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
he'll surely be suspended.

267
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,359
Then how does he

268
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,239
get selected into the national team?

269
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,320
What if the Coach decides

270
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
that he lacks team spirit,

271
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,760
how does he get into the Olympics?

272
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,119
What to do, then?

273
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,760
We find some other ways.

274
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,280
Xiaoci and Du Lingfeng

275
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,200
have driven a car to look for him.

276
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,400
We try to find him inside.

277
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,280
Okay.

278
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,679
How about

279
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,200
I check the dorm?

280
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,000
Xin, I'll go with you.

281
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,599
Maybe without you,

282
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:48,520
Captain is easier

283
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,400
to be found.

284
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,359
Good point.

285
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,559
I'll go to the company

286
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,599
to explain what happened.

287
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,799
Okay. Off you go.

288
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,840
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Let's split up.

289
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,840
I'll go that way.

290
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,640
Let's go inside.

291
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,080
Go.

292
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:06,960
Shen Qingyuan,

293
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,640
are you home?

294
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,719
Shen Qingyuan,

295
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
stop playing with me.

296
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,799
I know you hide from me on purpose.

297
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,400
Shen Qingyuan,

298
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,119
are you taking a shower?

299
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,359
I'll break into the bathroom.

300
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,119
Tang Xin.

301
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,880
Teddy misses you.

302
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,239
You said

303
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,880
you were a very responsible man,

304
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,359
didn't you?

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,640
Xiaoci,

306
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,119
it's a big area.

307
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,400
Where do we find Shen Qingyuan?

308
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,280
He isn't a local.

309
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,000
When he left,

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,919
he didn't take his ID card,

311
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,400
so he has no choice
but to wander on the street.

312
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,559
Xiaoci,

313
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,200
we turn left or right
at the next corner?

314
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,159
Look over there.

315
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,000
Shen Qingyuan.

316
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,679
Shen Qingyuan.

317
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,000
Shen Qingyuan,

318
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,119
what do you think you are doing?

319
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,159
The entire team is worried about you.

320
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:42,760
Do you know that?

321
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,520
Yeah.

322
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,640
Tang Xin is so worried.

323
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,679
Go back with us.

324
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,320
Hey, listen.

325
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,359
We've known

326
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:56,559
all about you.

327
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,440
Though I think

328
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,400
you're kind of a weirdo,

329
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,799
I know you are not a coward.

330
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:01,799
Right?

331
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,960
Come on.

332
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,280
They are waiting.

333
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,119
What now, Xiaoci?

334
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:23,960
He didn't listen to me.

335
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,719
I'd better give Tang Xin a call.

336
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,440
No, no, no.

337
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,840
Why?

338
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,000
I think Tang Xin

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,840
is the only person
who can make him talk.

340
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,559
I fear that Tang Xin's emergence

341
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,679
would provoke him.

342
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,159
If he runs away again,

343
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,200
we won't be able to find him anymore.

344
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,400
I shouldn't have gotten off the car.

345
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,039
You stay here.

346
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,080
I'll go give it a shot.

347
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:51,840
Captain Shen,

348
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,280
would you like to go to a place

349
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,760
where Tang Xin can't find you?

Hello.

357
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:29,039
Hello, I found Shen Qingyuan.

358
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,039
Sorry, Coach.

359
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,599
It's my bad again.

360
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,320
But please don't worry,

361
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,000
I've found him.

362
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,239
I learned

363
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,359
about this thing

364
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,239
from Dr. Ding.

365
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,359
It isn't your fault.

366
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,799
Thank you, Coach.

367
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,919
Coach,

368
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,239
seeing it's a special circumstance,

369
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:49,760
I would like

370
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,840
to ask for leave on his behalf.

371
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,520
Okay.

372
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:54,760
Miss Tang,

373
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,599
I've repeated what I'm going to say

374
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,679
to you more than once,

375
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,400
and I guess you're probably sick of it.

376
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,760
But you can just

377
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,479
see me as a nagging old man.

378
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,520
Please say what you need to say.

379
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,599
I'm just a shooting coach.

380
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't really understand

381
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:12,959
your young people's stuff,

382
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:13,719
nor do I know

383
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:14,680
how to communicate
with your generation.

384
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,680
So I'll

385
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,599
entrust you with Shen.

386
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,640
Dr. Ding told me

387
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,800
that his trauma is serious

388
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,239
and that it may affect

389
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,319
his career as a shooter.

390
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,199
So it's a heavy responsibility

391
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,239
for you.

392
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,599
Please don't mess it up.

393
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,520
I got it.

394
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,239
Thank you, Coach.

395
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,040
I'm off.

396
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,960

398
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,119
Miss Tang.

399
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:46,040
We have something urgent to tell you.

400
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,760
What?

401
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
It was Xu Dian.

402
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,199
Miss Tang,

403
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:53,239
it's highly related to our captain.

404
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:53,920
We have found out

405
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,479
that Zhou Yue and Xu Dian
keep a secret relationship.

406
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,040
So most likely,

407
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,880
they worked together

408
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,920
to plot this.

409
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,719
Those two nasty fellows.

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,880
I swear I'll…

411
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,560
Okay.

412
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,040
I got it.

413
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,000
Thank you for your information.

414
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,520
Miss Tang,

415
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,800
what do you plan to do?

416
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,439
At the moment, I don't have

417
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,560
time for those two.

418
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160

my top priority right now.

Do you have a minute?

426
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,719
I'd like to talk to you

427
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:50,640
about Shen Qingyuan.

429
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,199
let's go to see Shen Qingyuan.

430
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
The three of us

431
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,479
will have a not-so-cold winter.

432

What's the matter with you?

436

What are you doing?

438
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,079
Someone set my sister up.

439
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,800
Like I didn't know.

440
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,880
Is that your sister?

441
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,280
I'll take care of it.

442
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,119
Please give me a few more days.

443
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,119
Sure.

444
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:11,959
No problem. No problem.

445
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:12,719
Yes, yes.

446
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,640
I'll take good care of it.

447
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,280
Okay.

Mr. Zhou,

449
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,599
I need to ask for leave.

450
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,119
Do you know
that you're a hot topic again?

451
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,080
(Complete Exposure of Shen Qingyuan's Girlfriend
She's the Root of All the Problems!)

452
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,239
There's nothing I can do

453
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,079
about the articles.

454
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,839
Even if you're going to fire me

455
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:30,959
or tell everybody else in this business

456
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,119
not to hire me,

457
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:33,439
I'll ask for leave today

458
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,400
to find Shen Qingyuan.

459
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,599
I thought it was about something else.

460
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,280
Approved. You can go look for him.

461
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,719
Oh, right.

462
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,000
Don't worry about

463
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
the articles online.

464
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,040
They posted an irrelevant image

465
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,119
and made the entire article up.

466
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:48,599
Tomorrow, I'll send them
a warning letter

467
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,319
to silence all those

468
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,119
commercial accounts.

469
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

470
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,119
No problem.

471
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,119
Although I don't know

472
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,479
what happened,

473
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,119
you, Tang Xin,

474
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,560
have to get back

475
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,959
the hope

476
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:02,599
of our company.

477
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:04,839
Mr. Zhou,

478
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,319
one more thing.

479
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,239
I don't have any

480
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,400
firm evidence,

481
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,479
but

482
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,119
I think Xu Dian is behind this.

483
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,000
I see.

484
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,400
Just go.

485
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,839
Go and find Shen Qingyuan.

486
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,479
I'll take care of the rest.

487
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,280
Hello, Miss Zhang?

488
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,959
Tang Xin won't need

489
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:37,760
to clock in and out
in the next few days.

490
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,640
Paid leave.

491
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,119
You ask how many days?

492
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,119
Chinese New Year

493
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,119
is around the corner, right?

494
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,520
Wait until the holidays are over.

495
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,760
Yeah.

496
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,880
Tell your manager

497
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,119
that I have approved it.

498
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,439
Okay.

499
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,800
After the Chinese New Year holidays?

500
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,640
Fine.

501
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,640
I'm off during the holidays anyway.

502
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
I'll go to visit Mom and Dad.

503
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,439
If possible,

504
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,520
you can take Qingyuan home

505
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,640
to visit our parents.

506
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,319
Yeah.

507
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,400
Shen Qingyuan said

508
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,119
he'd like to visit Mom and Dad.

509
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,400
Tang Xin,

510
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,000
say no more.

511
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,239
I wish you the best.

512
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:19,400
Xin,

513
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,560
why are you carrying
this little hedgehog?

514
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:22,880
Shen Qingyuan and I

515
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,800
kept him together.

516
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:24,880
His name is Jujube.

517
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,959
Jujube.

518
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
What a cute name.

519
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,319
With him,

520
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,319
I may be able

521
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,479
to see Shen Qingyuan sooner.

522
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:32,920
Xin, you know?

523
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:33,640
Now the hedgehog

524
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,040
is curled up

525
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,959
inside the box,

526
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,439
protecting himself with his spikes.

527
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,479
But

528
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:38,640
if you throw him up in the air,

529
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,319
it will fall to the ground

530
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,400
showing his belly,

531
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,119
and the predator

532
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,599
will gobble him up.

533
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:43,880
But forcing a hedgehog

534
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,959
to show his weak spot

535
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,800
is what foxes do

536
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,880
when they prey.

537
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,040
Xin, sorry.

538
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:53,800
It's okay.

539
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,520
I need to go.

540
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,119
If I need anything,

541
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,319
I'll contact you.

542
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,000
Tang Xin,

543
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,239
be safe on the road.

544
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,000
Call us if you need anything.

545
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,520
Okay.

546
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,479
Safe travels.

Xu Dian

552
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,959
isn't someone you can trust.

553
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,079
Dr. Ding.

554
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,800
(How to Stop Worrying and Start Living)
I'm on my way

555
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,560
(How to Stop Worrying and Start Living)
to see Shen Qingyuan.

556
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:00,760
Great.

557
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,839
So,

558
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,040
once I'm there…

559
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,359
If Shen Qingyuan wishes

560
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,640
to continue his career,

561
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,640
he'll have to accept
clinical psychotherapies.

562
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:13,079
I know

563
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,880
it won't be easy for you

564
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,560
or him.

565
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,359
But you're Tang Xin.

566
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,439
You soften the hardest,

567
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:22,439
and sweeten the bitterest.

568
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,520
Thank you, Dr. Ding.

569
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
But I'm a bit concerned.

570
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,119
That I'll do a bad job.

571
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,000
That I'll do it wrongly.

572
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,439
I don't know what I can

573
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,959
or cannot do.

574
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,880
Shen Qingyuan will let you know.

575
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,239
Yes, he refuses to talk,

576
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,280
but communication

577
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,760
is not just about words.

578
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,640
In another words.

579
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,119
Long as you love him

580
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,560
and really feel it with your heart,

581
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,479
you'll figure out what to do.

582
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,119
Dr. Ding, trust me.

583
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,640
I promise I'll get him back.

584
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,720

586
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:49,959
Mr. Shen.

587
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:52,800
I was thinking about calling you.

588
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,439
Sir,

589
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,359
may I ask,

590
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,400
how much longer do we need
to get there?

591
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,400
That's the suburbs.

592
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:03,959
I'd say

593
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,359
another half an hour.

594
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:10,760
Miss,

595
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:11,800
are you in a rush?

596
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,439
If you are,

597
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:13,599
I'll try to drive faster.

598
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,239
But I'm not very familiar

599
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,239
with the road here.

600
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,520
Kind of.

601
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:19,920
But it's okay.

602
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,119
Just drive at a normal speed.

603
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm good.

604
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:23,479
All right.

605
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,640
It looks to me that it's the first time

606
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,439
you came here.

607
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,400
You can enjoy the views

608
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,640
on the way

609
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:33,959
and rest your mind.

610
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,319
Just see it as a trip.

611
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,599
To be honest,

612
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,280
though I'm a driver

613
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,439
who travels

614
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:40,520
more than 300 miles every day,

615
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,239
I'm always stuck in the city.

616
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,239
I feel good

617
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,560
to drive around the suburbs.

618
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,880
After staying in the city for too long,

619
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,239
we do need a trip to the suburbs
from time to time.

620
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,599
Just take a walk.

621
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,920
The further you go, the freer you feel.

622
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,680
Sorry.

623
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,319
- Tang Xin.
- Xiaoci.

624
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,479
Du Lingfeng.

625
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,920
Where is Shen Qingyuan?

626
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,680
On the second floor.

627
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:53,640
Tang Xin,

628
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,599
since Captain Shen came here,

629
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,280
he hasn't said a single word
or had any food.

630
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,160
We just went out

631
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,000
to buy something for him,

632
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,239
and have put the stuff in the fridge.

633
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:00,400
If you have time,

634
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,439
please cook something for him.

635
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:02,719
Thank you.

636
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,040
I'm going upstairs.

637
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,680
Go.

638
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,079
Go.

639
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,199
Shen Qingyuan.

640
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,000
Shen Qingyuan.

641
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,119
Shen Qingyuan.

642
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,760
Shen Qingyuan.

643
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:33,880
Shen Qingyuan.

644
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,400
Shen Qingyuan.

645
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,160
I know you're inside.

646
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,479
Please don't hide from me, okay?

647
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,880
If you feel aggrieved

648
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,199
or unhappy or confused,

649
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,920
you can tell me face to face.

650
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,479
Shen Qingyuan, you know?

651
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:14,000
I'd really like to talk to you.

652
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,959
I've been looking for you the whole day,

653
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,520
and I'm filled with bad feelings.

654
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,199
If you don't come out,

655
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:20,599
I'm going to bloat

656
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,400
and explode.

657
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,599
You don't want me and Jujube anymore?

658
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,239
Shen Qingyuan,

659
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:50,920
are you going to turn

660
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,479
the back of your head on to me forever?

661
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,160
As far as I know, the range of view

662
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,319
of human eyes is 120 degrees.

663
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:59,839
Can you see me

664
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,359
like this?

665
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,160
But yes,

666
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,800
you're a shooter.

667
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,800
Your profession

668
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,359
requires you to be concentrated.

669
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,599
But I also heard

670
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,280
that when one's concentrated,

671
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,119
his range of view is only 25 degrees.

672
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:15,920
Will you see me

673
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,800
once I'm

674
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,359
in front of you?

675
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,119
Shen Qingyuan,

676
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,680
you know,

677
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,119
I'm not sure

678
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:33,880
if I'm a good girlfriend

679
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
or not.

680
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,199
Should I stand in front of you

681
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,599
to fill your field of view

682
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,160
or should I keep

683
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,280
some space between us?

684
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,319
It is up to you,

685
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,199
okay?

686
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,880
Shen Qingyuan,

687
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,160
could you not

688
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,119
make me a monologist here, okay?

689
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,400
Come, Jujube.

690
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,520
Come on.

691
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,160
Jujube.

692
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,280
You are now

693
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,160
our special agent.

694
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,400
Quickly.

695
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,400
Go to him and kick him out.

696
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,439
Jujube.

697
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,359
Jujube.

698
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,119
Jujube, don't be like him.

699
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,680
Shen Qingyuan.

700
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,800
You don't want Jujube

701
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,439
or me, huh?

702
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,280
Shen Qingyuan,

703
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,079
I haven't seen

704
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,000
your face for so long.

705
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:11,640
Shen Qingyuan,

706
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,400
let me show you something.

707
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:17,439
Look.

708
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,000
This is our picture

709
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,119
when we were in high school.

710
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:24,680
Look at your beaming face.

711
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:26,640
You were so nice at the time.

712
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,439
Seriously.

713
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,839
You're nice now, too.

714
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,839
When you were in hospital,

715
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,119
you insisted on taking a selfie with me.

716
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:34,520
So

717
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,920
there's no difference

718
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:38,439
between the old and the current you.

719
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:40,520
You won't leave me behind,

720
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:43,160
and the old you wouldn't, either.

721
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,599
I have another thing.

722
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:54,719
Look.

723
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,359
This is

724
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,359
what you gave me before.

725
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,880
I've kept it till this day.

726
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,880
You have no idea

727
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,199
how nicely you treated me.

728
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,280
You need to believe in yourself

729
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,679
that you aren't that kind of a person

730
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,840
who would leave me behind.

731
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,399
Shen Qingyuan.

732
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,760
Why would you rather trust others

733
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,840
than me?

734
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,479
You said

735
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,520
you'd be there for me,
negative or positive.

736
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,080
I'd be there, too.

737
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,000
So could you

738
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,399
believe me?

Thank you. Thank you.

00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,920
Sure. Sure.

771
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,760
We'll deepen our collaboration.

772
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,959
Alright, that's all.

773

See you next time. See you.

774
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,040

- Bye.

00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,639
Ai still hasn't accepted my request.

782
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:14,879
Have I got a cold?

783
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:21,879
Shen Qingyuan.

784
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:23,719
Shen Qingyuan.

785
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:26,719
Shen Qingyuan.

786
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,399
Shen Qingyuan.

787
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,679
Are you preparing

788
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,959
the towel on my forehead?

789
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,280
Shen Qingyuan.

790
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,120
Dr. Ding.

791
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,800
I notice

792
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,000
that Shen Qingyuan has a new symptom.

793
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,399
I don't know how long it has lasted.

794
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,840
What is it?

795
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:08,959
He would stare blankly in the mirror

796
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,159
as if he doesn't know himself.

797
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,360
Doesn't know himself?

798
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,239
It should be depersonalization.

799
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,639
It's one of the manifestations

800
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,560
of dissociation symptom.

801
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,320
By putting themselves

802
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,919
outside the world,

803
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:23,879
the patient runs away

804
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,120
from what torments them.

805
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,120
Like soul detachment.

806
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,919
Close enough.

807
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,919
Once the patient

808
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,120
has this disturbance of perception,

809
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,840
their trauma

810
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,040
will become harder to cure.

811
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,439
Did I provoke him?

812
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:39,679
