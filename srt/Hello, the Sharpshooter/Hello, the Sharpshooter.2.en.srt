=Hello, The Sharpshooter=

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
=Episode 2=

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,800
Not a single livestreaming

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,919
can be interrupted!

37
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,919
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,199
I...

39
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,519
You promised me

40
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,239
that you would complete the mission.

41
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:49,959
It's our first time

42
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,760
to try a traditional
sports livestreaming

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,800
with Haiya University.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
If you fail it,

45
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,120
our whole team

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,800
may be dissolved!

47
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,480
I shouldn't have left

48
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,760
such an important mission

49
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,480
to you.

50
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,480
But if

51
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,599
I continued the livestreaming,

52
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,639
Haiya Shooting Team

53
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,800
won't be able to win.

54
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,800
Will this kind of livestreaming

55
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,759
still be a success?

56
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,039
What nonsense are you talking about?

57
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:12,199
Don't make excuses
for your incompetence.

58
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,960
Don't come back
if you can't get it done!

59
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,600
After the emergency repair
to the trigger,

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,399
Shen Qingyuan of Haiya University

61
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:26,199
is back to continue the game.

62
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,119
Looks like
the malfunction of the trigger

63
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,440
didn't affect

64
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,320
Shen Qingyuan.

65
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,279
He's getting better

66
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,720
and closing the gap

67
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,919
with Zhou Yue.

68
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,479
Shooter No. 4

69
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,119
and Shooter No. 24 are eliminated.

70
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,119
Live streamer.

71
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Sounds like

72
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,800
Shen Qingyuan is going to turn the tide.

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,839
Why don't you livestream it now?

74
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,320
He'll lose if I do.

75
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,720
Are you a prophet?

76
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,559
Just do what you're supposed to do.

77
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,720
If that doesn't work,

78
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,960
you can relay it.

79
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,520
Relay it?

80
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,600
You're right.

81
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,399
Can you let me use your phone?

82
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,639
I may need two phones.

83
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,240
Well,

84
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,880
can't you just call a spade a spade?

85
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,559
Now you know

86
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,119
how hard it is to be an intern.

87
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,720
Is it that important
whether he wins or loses?

88
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
I think your relationship
with Shen Qingyuan

89
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,160
is unusual.

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,479
There are only

91
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,160
two shooters left now.

92
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,240
Each has one last shot.

93
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,039
After that, the champion today
will be decided.

94
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,360
Mr. Zhou.

95
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,119
The livestream resumes.

96
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,080
- Great.
- It starts again.

97
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,520
Sorry.

98
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,240
Something went wrong
in the live room just now.

99
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,440
But we happen

100
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,039
to catch the best moment.

101
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,240
The two shooters on the field

102
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,160
are about

103
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,520
to fire their last shot.

104
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,440
The gap between them is small.

105
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,199
(National Shooting Championship)
Shen Qingyuan in second place

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,960
is only 0.2

107
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,800
behind Zhou Yue.

108
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,959
10.6!

109
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,200
Zhou Yue
from the Southeast Shooting Team

110
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,160
is a veteran indeed.

111
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,399
Now the pressure

112
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,839
is on Shen Qingyuan.

113
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,200
He needs to hit 10.9

114
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,119
to win the championship.

115
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,279
However,

116
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,040
Zhou Yue got

117
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,359
a nearly perfect score.

118
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,959
Actually,

119
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,359
shooting is not only
about skills and mentality,

120
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,320
but also about luck.

121
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,640
10.9!

122
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,559
Perfect!

123
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,600
- Captain! Captain Shen!
- Captain! Captain Shen!

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,679
Excellent!

125
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:58,160

You're welcome.

00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,239
The livestream is popular.

138
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,519
It's not easy for you

139
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,519
as an intern.

140
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:28,839
You have a message.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,760
(Interview Shen Qingyuan.
Our live room is on the homepage.)

142

Captain Shen.

143
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,559
Congratulations.

144
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,119
Oh, right,

145
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,559
are you okay?

146
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,799
Do you need me to get Dr. Ding for you?

147
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,279
I'm fine.

148
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,480
Shen Qingyuan.

149
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
I remember you now.

150
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm leaving.

151
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,440
You are not seeing him

152
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,160
as your competitor, right?

153
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,160
I am. What's the matter?

154
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,799
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

155
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,920
Shen Qingyuan is just like me,

156
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,160
and he always gets first place.

157
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,519
There is no such thing

158
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,359
as a competitor for him,

159
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,399
because he only competes with himself.

160
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:22,600
Shen Qingyuan, wait!

161
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,679
Hello.

I'm Tang Xin from Rui Live.

163

Look, he's so handsome.

164
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,559
Yeah.

165
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,079
We've met a few times before.

166
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,880
Congratulations on your championship.

167
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,359
Are you

168
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,720
available for an interview now?

169
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,359
No.

170
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,320
But you've won the championship.

171
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,679

Do you remember

174
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,200
what two hours mean?

175
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,399
Two hours

176
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,959
is the time used for a shooter
to win championship.

177
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,040
Have you not

178
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,679
remembered me at all

179
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:19,640
over these years?

180
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,760
The camera is blocked!

181
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,200
Over these years?

182
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,119
What does it mean?

183
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
Do they know each other?

184
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,680
(Livestreaming comments)

185
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,159
The interview!

186
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,440
Do you know that you wasted

187
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,479
the most expensive position
on the homepage?

188
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,080
Mr. Zhou.

189
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,520
Sorry.

190
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,359
There was an accident.

191
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,679
I'm not professional.

192
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,760
Why didn't I see

193
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,000
it was an accident?

194
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,640
Either you don't

195
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,960
want this job,

196
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,719
or,

197
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,479
Shen Qingyuan

198
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,000
is your ex-boyfriend, isn't he?

199
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,760
I have a piece of advice for you.

200
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:26,840
During a livestream,

201
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,039
what happens on the scene

202
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,239
must be handled objectively.

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
This is called professionalism!

204
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,200
And also,

205
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,200
the keyword "ex-boyfriend"

206
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
could be attractive.

207
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,919
We need such a topic.

208
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,840
Maybe you should think about

209
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,799
putting it to good use.

210
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,840
Do you have

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,479
Shen Qingyuan's private information?

212
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,559
Take it out

213
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,599
and use it for publicity.

214
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,200
Mr. Zhou.

215
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,039
Isn't that

216
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,280
too utilitarian?

217
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,320
I don't need a lecture from you!

218
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,880
Just tell me soon
if you will do it or not!

219
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,440
Miss Tang!

220
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,440
Well done today.

221
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,320
Maybe we could become popular

222
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,799
thanks to your livestream.

223
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,640
Congratulations on winning
the championship.

224
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,640
We are only responsible
for watching over the water fountain

225
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,440
and comforting people.

226
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,000
But then again,

227
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,960
did you and our captain

228
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,039
know each other before?

229
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,400
You can say that.

230
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:29,919
But

231
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,520
I don't think he likes me very much.

232
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,080
No way.

233
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,440
Our captain is very nice.

234
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,320
Yeah.

235
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,280
And I think

236
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,440
he treats you differently.

237
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,400
The sight of you

238
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,520
made him not be able

239
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,119
to keep his mind on shooting.

240
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,039
He just wanted me to leave.

241
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,000
This is our captain's uniform, right?

242
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,679
Definitely.

243
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,359
Our captain has a special liking

244
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,320
for number seven.

245
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,039
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,640
Miss Tang.

247
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,640
My sixth sense tells me

248
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
that you should talk to him.

249
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,760
Maybe

250
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,880
he will tell you everything.

251
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,280
Right.

252
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,400
It's time to have a good chat with him.

253
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,679
I'm Du Lingfeng

254
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,679
from Lingda Group.

255
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,520
You can say that we are partners.

256
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,440
Now I officially invite you

257
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,119
to join us

258
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,119
and become our advertising endorser.

259
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,400
Look.

260
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,799
Eye drops and shooters.

261
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,280
Well, aren't they well matched?

262
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,679
Sorry.

263
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,039
Not interested.

264
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,239
Just consider it.

265
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,159
I rarely flatter people.

266
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,559
How possible is it

267
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,080
that I use your eye drops

268
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
with my eyesight?

269
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,320
What's your eyesight?

270
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,080
It's just a commercial for eye drops.

271
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,400
He can't do a commercial for eye drops.

272
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,799
His eyesight is only 0.1.

273
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,679
What did you say?

274
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,679
0.1?

275
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,400
He's a shooter.

276
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,159
It is

277
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:57,919
a big misunderstanding

278
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,520
that shooters

279
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,440
need good eyesight.

280
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,919
0.1?

281
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,880
At least make up something reasonable.

282
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,880
Just say it if you don't
want to endorse it.

283
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,119
Don't tell me you don't need eye drops

284
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,280
with your eyesight.

285
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,320
Hello, it didn't work out.

286
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,280
I'll come back to you.

287
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,760
- Sorry.
- What are you doing?

288
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,239
I just want to take a look
at the schedule.

289
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,960
It's you.

290
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,679
You helped Shen Qingyuan
drive people away.

291
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Aren't you the one who hid

292
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
the live streamer?

293
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,560
(Shen Qingyuan's preliminaries
Shen Qingyuan's finals)

294
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,559
Did you record

295
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,119
the performance

296
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,239
of Shen Qingyuan's every bullet?

297
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,919
Yes.

298
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,919
Not everyone in the auditorium

299
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:54,960
just wants to be

300
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,039
an ordinary audience.

301
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,479
You took a photo with him.

302
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,320
You two look good together.

303
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,679
You can make a handsome couple.

304
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,119
These shooters in the shooting team

305
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,280
are so overweening.

306
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:21,799
They do need eye drops.

307
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,919
Well,

308
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,760
I didn't know

309
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,960
you don't want him to know

310
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,080
your eyesight.

311
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,559
Sorry.

312
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,559
You're interested in me.

313
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,239
You even found out

314
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,080
that my eyesight is 0.1.

315
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,559
It's not like that.

316
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,880
I just wanted to explain for you.

317
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,119
And your eyes...

318
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:49,479
Do you want me

319
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,400
to give you the contact information

320
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,640
of my eye doctor?

321
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,599
So,

322
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,599
have you had
a sight restoration operation?

323
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,479
Is this how you guys

324
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,679
do interviews in Rui Live?

325
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,640
Do I need

326
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,719
to report my eyesight to you?

327
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,799
No, no.

328
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:03,119
I want to keep interviewing you.

329
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,239
The eyesight matter

330
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,760
is just a little episode.

331
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:11,760
Two minutes.

332
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,640
Why don't you start?

333
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,039
Right away.

334
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:30,119
Welcome back

335
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,479
to our live room.

336
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,440
Hello, Shen Qingyuan.

337
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,320
First of all, congratulations
on winning the championship.

338
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:41,960
Thanks.

339
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,919
I heard you've won many awards

340
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,479
in shooting contests.

341
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,520
What was your life like

342
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,599
before you joined the Haiya Team?

343
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,599
I took classes, had training,

344
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,679
played games and got awards.

345
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,760
I was busy every day.

346
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,599
There was

347
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:02,000
nothing else.

348
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,400
Can you be specific about it?

349
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,960
Like

350
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,119
some important people or things.

351
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,799
There was nothing important.

352
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,440
Are you sure?

353
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,960
Just think about it.

354
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,679
I'm sure.

355
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,440
Don't waste your time.

356
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,719
Shen Qingyuan.

357
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,559
If you had to summarize

358
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,960
your old self with one sentence,

359
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:33,200
what would you say?

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,840
Let me ask you.

361
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,359
Where is the target

362
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,919
in the air pistol competition?

363
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,840
Ten meters ahead.

364
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,239
Then why should I look back?

365
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,320
I understand.

366
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,479
Time is up.

367
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,000
You've asked enough.

368
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,840

Be careful!

371
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:22,719
Don't be afraid.

372
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,039

probably never meet again.

I want to borrow some pistol oil.

It's in the cupboard.

397
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,719
Okay.

398
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,400
Is that

399
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,920
the live streamer from Rui Live?

400
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,719
Do you know each other?

401
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,920
I met her for the first time.

402
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,280
I found her a little weird.

403
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,239
Could it be
that she got crazy about you?

404
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,439
It's normal.

405
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:43,680
Girls who just met you

406
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,560
are all like her.

407
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,160
If I remember it correctly,

408
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,599
you only look at this stopwatch

409
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,280
when you are really upset.

410
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,640
You think too much.

411
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,119
Shooting is

412
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,280
a static sport.

413
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,640
Looking at the stopwatch

414
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,560
is for doing better in the game.

415
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,160
Please hold this for me.

416
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,040
I'll take things out.

417
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,640
Welcome aboard.

418
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,960
Can you put this for me?

419
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,119
Live streamer.

420
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,199
We meet again.

421
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,079
Let me help you.

422
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:29,680
Thanks.

423
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,560
Aren't you afraid
to worsen your eyesight?

424
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,000
Be careful and don't make it 0.1.

425
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,359
I think

426
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,160
I met this guy at the game.

427
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,599
He seems to be the one

428
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,880
who watched the game with Miss Tang.

429
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,199
Is he

430
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:00,479
the son of Du Weiming of Lingda Group,

431
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,400
Du Lingfeng?

432
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,000
Even Du Lingfeng

433
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,359
came to our captain.

434
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,160
He's good.

435
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,479
But

436
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,560
why did he come to Captain Shen?

437
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,400
He wants our captain

438
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,439
to endorse his eye drops.

439
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,920
But something went wrong.

440
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,119
We dare not say anything

441
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,000
or ask anything.

442
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,000
What are you looking at?

443
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,239
Miss Tang.

444
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,319
How did it go with our captain?

445
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:34,800
We didn't talk about it.

446
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,479
I'll just talk to him

447
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,359
about work from now on.

448
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,680
Well, it's okay.

449
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,880
We can be friends.

450
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,479
Why didn't I see you

451
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,920
so active during training?

452
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,599
Captain, sorry.

453
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,160
I told you earlier

454
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,880
you shouldn't talk too much today.

455
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,079
Ladies and gentlemen.

456
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,599
The plane is about to take off.

457
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,400
Please fasten your seat belts,

458
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,640
close your tray table,

459
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,880
and pull up the window shade.

460
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,319
Excuse me.

461
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,479
I need to get by.

462
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:45,760
Thanks.

463
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:19,479
What's wrong?

464
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:39,400
Jiang Yitian.

465
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,319
I want to borrow it.

466
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,479
Here.

467
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,319
What are you doing?

468
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:52,479
The smell is too strong.

469
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:57,319
It affected me.

470
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,560
Ladies and gentlemen.

471
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,640
Our aircraft

472
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,920
is experiencing some slight turbulence

473
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,560
with slight bumps through the clouds

474
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,800
due to the airflow.

475
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,640
Please don't worry.

476
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,000
Be seated

477
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,479
and fasten your seat belts.

478
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:27,880
Do you get airsick?

479
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,160
You forgot something.

480
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,520
Thanks.

481
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,640
Thanks.

482
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,439
I almost forgot it.

483
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:37,400
Maybe you should keep it.

484
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,479
Although you don't get airsick,

485
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,959
what if you get carsick or seasick?

486
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:40,880
It can clear your head.

487
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,040
It's quite useful.

488
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,680
Athletes are not allowed
to accept gifts.

489
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,280
- It's not that serious.
- What are they doing there?

490
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,479
It didn't cost much.

491
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,760
Just a little gift between friends.

492
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,400
It's okay.

493
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
We're not friends.

494
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,839
Miss Tang.

495
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,839
Stay optimistic.

496
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,880
After all, our captain

497
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
must have a higher standard
than ordinary people.

498
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,920
Right?

499
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:00,000
Stay optimistic.

500
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,119
Jiang Yitian!

501
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:08,920
The bus is here!

502
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:09,920
Our school bus is here.

503
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm leaving. See you later.

504
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,599
Bye-bye.

505
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:12,920
Hurry!

506
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,800
Hurry!

507
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,079
Hello, Mom.

508
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,079
I've come back to Haiya.

509
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,880
You have watched the live video

510
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,760
and think it's great?

511
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,479
That's good.

512
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,800
I haven't watched it yet.

513
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,560
Become a regular worker?

514
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,479
I hope so.

515
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,920
Boyfriend?

516
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,839
Let's talk about it later.

517
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,520
I've told you countless times

518
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,599
not to rush me.

519
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,959
Okay, I'll hang up.

520
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:39,959
Bye-bye.

521
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:46,599
When I tell her only the good news,

522
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,920
I have to swallow the tears by myself.

523
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,360
(Qianyang 26)

524
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,079
Welcome the big live streamer!

525
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,199
- Welcome the big live streamer!
- Welcome the big live streamer!

526
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,439
Welcome back, the big live streamer!

527
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,359
You are...

528
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,719
You're not bad as an intern.

529
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,160
Mr. Zhou.

530
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,959
You are lucky.

531
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:20,959
Thanks to

532
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:22,400
the shooter captain,

533
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,439
you got off this time.

534
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,000
Congratulations to Tang Xin!

535
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,479
I heard

536
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:30,599
there is

537
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,439
the latest news and gossip

538
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,760
about the handsome sharpshooter!

539
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,319
It's said that the live streamer

540
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,560
is Shen Qingyuan's ex-girlfriend.

541
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,800
(Livestreaming Comments)
She asked an affectionate question.

542
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,520
"Two hours", and "over these years"?

543
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,599
Let's wait for more news.

544
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,520
Maybe

545
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,160
they have fallen in love

546
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,959
again.

547
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,920
Mr. Zhou.

548
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,479
Can I talk to you?

549
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,199
Come in.

550
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,760
I've submitted your application

551
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,800
for becoming a regular worker.

552
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,400
Welcome to join Rui Live.

553
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,119
Did our company

554
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,400
buy the trolls to create hype?

555
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,239
I just want to say

556
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:05,599
if we can

557
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,920
keep the personal relationship

558
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,359
out of work.

559
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,560
Looks like I overestimated you.

560
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,800
We are a live streaming platform

561
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,439
of the TV station.

562
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,760
If we want

563
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,359
to have a place in this field,

564
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,800
we have to do it by surprise.

565
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,359
Yes.

566
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,800
The company

567
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,560
played a part

568
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,839
in this matter,

569
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,199
but it also started

570
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,359
with your interaction
with Shen Qingyuan.

571
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,479
We didn't make it up.

572
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,800
The Olympics are approaching.

573
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,800
We are certainly not qualified

574
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,439
to shoot the current national team.

575
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:38,280
That's why we have to

576
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,560
keep up with Haiya Shooting Team.

577
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,479
An elite shooter

578
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,560
like Shen Qingyuan

579
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,760
is likely to reach the finals

580
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,719
and win a medal at the Olympics.

581
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,599
If we miss it,

582
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,359
will you regret it?

583
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,839
Of course, I will.

584
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,359
But is there a better way

585
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,719
to take the whole situation
into account?

586
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,400
Well,

587
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:57,680
do you have a better way?

588
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:58,959
No.

589
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:00,079
There you go.

590
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,040
Before we find

591
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,160
a better solution,

592
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,760
we can't

593
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
just wait around for that to happen.

594
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,599
But...

595
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,040
Fine, I promise you.

596
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:08,640
If you think of

597
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,479
any better solution later,

598
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,839
our company will
fully cooperate with you.

599
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:12,800
Tomorrow,

600
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,560
we'll have a celebratory dinner

601
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,880
and invite all the members
of the Haiya Shooting Team

602
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,880
to come and talk about

603
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,920
their intention
of long-term cooperation.

604
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,479
This is the most important thing
right now.

605
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:22,959
I need you

606
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,920
to go to the hotel, and check the venue

607
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,839
and the list of guests.

608
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,359
I see, Mr. Zhou.

609
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:30,040
Go ahead.

610
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,040
Mr. Zhou.

611
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,760
Now that you've submitted

612
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,839
my application
for becoming a regular worker,

613
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,000
can I

614
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,520
have my own name now?

615
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,280
My name is not "Intern".

616
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,239
My name is Tang Xin.

617
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,839
Xiaoci.

618
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,160
Where are the photos?

619
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:05,199
I almost forget about it.

620
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,400
Wait a minute.

621
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,359
I've sent them to you.

622
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,119
I'm not professional

623
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,119
and I don't accept criticism.

624
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,239
He looks so handsome

625
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,000
in spite of your unprofessional skills.

626
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,479
If there were
a professional photographer,

627
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,880
how handsome would he be?

628
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,119
No wonder

629
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,760
those girls got crazy
when they watched the livestream.

630
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,000
There is one thing for sure,

631
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,479
Captain Shen is handsome indeed.

632
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:27,479
Good appearances are basically the same.

633
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,479
Interesting souls are rare to be found.

634
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,760
You also have a good appearance.

635
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,479
Why do you have so much hair?

636
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:35,359
Why is your hair so smooth?

637
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,560
You can even endorse

638
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,760
the shampoo we use.

639
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,640
I think your tongue is smooth, too.

640
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,719
Just wait.

641
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:41,760
After I endorse it,

642
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,160
I'll cover

643
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,400
all your shampoo.

644
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,079
Really?

645
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,719
Deal!

646
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,640
Speaking of that, have you heard

647
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,800
that the men's team seems
to have been sponsored recently?

648
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,640
It's Lingda Group.

649
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,800
No wonder

650
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,079
I saw someone from their company

651
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,520
on the field earlier.

652
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,520
They have a sponsor now.

653
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,280
When can that

654
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,160
happen to our women's team?

655
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,160
There are even fan clubs

656
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,640
and support groups

657
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,760
of Captain Shen in our school.

658
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,199
Even if we don't have a sponsor,

659
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,319
we should take Captain Shen at least.

660
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,280
Do you really think Shen Qingyuan

661
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,040
will be taken

662
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,959
by one of his fans?

663
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,040
That's right.

664
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,239
Even if he wants to find a girlfriend,

665
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,800
he will find you,
his partner in mixed doubles.

666
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,400
Our Xiaoci is the best.

667
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,599
Captain!

668
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,119
Captain...

669
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:30,599
Coach.

670
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,839
You are also here.

671
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,839
Can I not be there?

672
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:35,920
No way.

673
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,800
It's not negotiable.

674
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
This celebratory dinner

675
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,959
will bear upon the funding

676
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,000
of our shooting team.

677
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,000
We will need to

678
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,239
collaborate with Rui Live
in a long term.

679
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,680
That live streamer

680
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,079
will come again to shoot our team?

681
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,199
Yeah, what's wrong?

682
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,079
Nothing.

683
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,719
Think less of having fun.

684
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,199
Focus on training, understand?

685
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,479
I'm here to get a tip

686
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:02,479
from Captain Shen

687
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:04,319
and borrow his shampoo.

688
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,880
Captain Shen's hair is smooth and shiny.

689
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,239
I want my hair to be like his.

690
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,280
You have a glib tongue.

691
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,359
Goodbye, Coach.

692
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:14,439
Captain.

693
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,079
Check this out!

694
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,160
You're popular now.

695
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,079
Look.

696
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,880
There are all your fans

697
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,319
who support you
and that live streamer girl.

698
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,439
You're not watching it?

699
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
Are you feeling guilty?

700
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:26,880
Is there really something

701
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,079
between you and her?

702
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,119
Did I pick

703
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,359
the right couple in the first place?

704
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:30,920
Captain!

705
00:32:58,479 --> 00:32:59,880
I wonder whether what Mr. Zhou did

706
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:01,800
will affect him

707
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:05,160
and how he is

708
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,959
doing now.

709
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:08,959
I have to find a chance

710
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,119
to explain it to him.

711
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
(Name: Tang Xin Company: Rui Live
Post: Sports live streamer)

712
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,439
Shen Qingyuan.

713
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:24,920
Have you not

714
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,560
remembered me at all

715
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
over these years?

716
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,920
Tang Xin.

717
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:41,839
My partner.

718
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,239
Please maintain

719
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:45,280
your professionalism and mentality.

720
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,239
Don't let me down.

721
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,959
Ex-boyfriend?

722
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,159
Looks like someone else

723
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,919
is interested in Shen Qingyuan.

724
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Son, you're back.

725
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,479
Dad?

726
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,080
How come you are at home?

727
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,080
The dinner was postponed today.

728
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
So I came back to see you.

729
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,280
Come here, sit down.

730
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,879
Have some tea with me.

731
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,159
I don't think you're back to see me.

732
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,040
You're here to pry into my work, right?

733
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,040
Dad.

734
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,199
No hurry.

735
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,399
Our bet

736
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,439
is not due yet.

737
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,439
This time,

738
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,719
I must crack

739
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,520
the hard nut

740
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
and impress you.

741
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,879
I'm your father.

742
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,120
Do you think I don't know
what you're thinking?

743
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,120
You made it sound like
you're trying to find an endorser

744
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,040
in the shooting team for the group.

745
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:01,520
In fact,

746
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,800
you are just doing

747
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,560
what you're passionate about.

748
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,280
But as far as I know,

749
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,280
your plan

750
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,080
doesn't seem to be going well.

751
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,919
It's true.

752
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,399
The person

753
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:16,919
I selected...

754
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:17,919
He has great potential,

755
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,520
but it's hard to get him on board.

756
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,520
Sure enough,

757
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,320
aged ginger is more pungent.

758
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:25,840
This guy is competent.

759
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,159
He is popular

760
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:27,959
and has a good image.

761
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,719
But the problem is

762
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,080
he is too stubborn

763
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,239
and takes no advice.

764
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,239
I don't know what to do with him.

765
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:37,239
It will save me a lot of trouble

766
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,399
if you lose because of him.

767
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,520
No way.

768
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,719
This time, I'll figure out a solution.

769
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,360
If that doesn't work,

770
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,959
I'll find a suitable person
to replace him.

771
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:48,560
Anyway, I can't get tripped

772
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,320
after I took just two steps.

773
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,320
Since I made a bet with you,

774
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:54,000
I'll accept

775
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,000
whatever result it is.

776
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,479
If you crack this hard nut,

777
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:58,239
I will let you play

778
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,360
for another two years as you want.

779
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,000
But if you can't,

780
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:02,320
sorry.

781
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,919
You're gonna have to

782
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:05,879
come to the company
and learn how to run it.

783
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,479
I will make it.

784
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,080
Shen Qingyuan.

785
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,719
I'm here

786
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,199
because of the comments online.

787
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:35,879
Didn't you say

788
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:37,320
we probably wouldn't meet again?

789
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,560
I did.

790
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,679
But I didn't expect

791
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,239
our company would collaborate

792
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,199
with your shooting team.

793
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,199
Now it seems

794
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,879
that we will see each other

795
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,560
a lot of times

796
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,320
due to work.

797
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,159
So I want to give you

798
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:53,560
a heads-up...

799
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,239
I see.

800
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,840
There are other important things.

801
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:02,080
They haven't signed
the contract yet, right?

802
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,719
Since there is no contract,

803
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,560
I'm not obliged

804
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
to cooperate with you.

805
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,239
Captain!

806
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,199
Hold on!

807
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,280
Captain.

808
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,239
Aren't you usually the first

809
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,360
to go to the training hall?

810
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,239
Are you waiting for me today?

811
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,080
Hello, Miss Tang.

812
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,399
You guys go to practice first.

813
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:22,000
We'll talk about it later.

814
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:28,479
Bye-bye.

815
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,239
Captain!

816
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,800
(Haiya University Gymnasium)

817
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,439
I'm leaving.

818
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,080
Bye-bye.

819
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,840
Other candidates...

820
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,360
Hello.

821
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
Do you need any help?

822
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,719
I am looking for someone.

823
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,520
Outsiders are not allowed
to touch pistols.

824
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,320
Please go out.

825
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
You can't cross the line.

826
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,840
Aren't you that guy from Lingda?

827
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,760
There are so many people
at Lingda Group,

828
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,719
yet you know me.

829
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,679
It's my honor.

830
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,040
Let me formally
introduce myself this time.

831
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm the Honorary General Manager
of Lingda Group,

832
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,760
Du Lingfeng.

833
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:40,520
However,

834
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,760
I prefer being known

835
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,919
as the heir to Lingda Group.

836
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,520
Usually, more girls like it.

837
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
What brings

838
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,280
Mr. Du here today?

839
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,000
Want to play with pistols?

840
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:51,679
I heard

841
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,760
that the rich boys now

842
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,080
like to try something new.

843
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,800
But...

844
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,000
They give up easily.

845
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:07,360
Impressive!

846
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:08,840
But

847
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
not every rich boy

848
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,080
gives up easily.

849
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,399
At least I'm not.

850
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,800
If you don't believe me,
I can prove it to you.

851
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,679
Not everyone can touch a pistol.

852
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:16,919
Please go out.

853
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,560
Relax, all right?

854
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,800
Let me try it.

855
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:22,879
Maybe you will look at me

856
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:23,760
differently.

857
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,280
Are you enough?

858
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:26,560
There are security guards outside.

859
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,919
Do you need me
to get them here now?

860
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,719
Okay, okay.

861
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,719
Actually, I'm here this time

862
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,439
to look for someone

863
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,000
to endorse the eye drops
of Lingda Group.

864
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,760
I think you shoot accurately,

865
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,040
and your eyes are beautiful.

866
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,679
You're perfect

867
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,800
for our eye drops commercial.

868
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,040
Well, are you interested?

869
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,760
I'll say it one last time.

870
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,520
Don't enter the shooting range again.

871
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,560
Bullets don't have eyes.

872
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,959
Okay.

873
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,360
Have you found it out?

874
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,000
It's the people of Rui Live
who want to sponsor the shooting team.

875
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,959
Their company is not big,

876
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,520
but they have a big appetite.

877
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:11,080
So, the ex-boyfriend
and ex-girlfriend stuff

878
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,879
was made up

879
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,080
by them.

880
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,399
They're not afraid of
upsetting the shooting team

881
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:17,719
by making such a big scene.

882
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,080
However,

883
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,560
I can play down on them

884
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,679
and win him over this time.

885
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
(Honorary Certificate
National Team Shooting Championship)

886
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,399
Shi Xiaoci.

887
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:34,080
It's a good name.

888
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:41,560
Come in.

889
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,800
Mr. Zhou.

890
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,080
I made a copy of the list

891
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,959
for the celebratory dinner tonight.

892
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:47,959
I'll put it here.

893
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,959
The venue has been confirmed.

894
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:51,080
There is basically no problem.

895
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,879
As for the details,

896
00:40:52,879 --> 00:40:54,479
I'll check them again when I get there.

897
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:58,959
You're quite reliable.

898
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,000
I'll go out then.

899
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,560
Okay.

900
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,679
Mr. Zhou.

901
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,280
You should

902
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,840
have less fast food.

903
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:27,199
Am I seeing it right

904
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,439
that Captain Shen is lost in thought?

905
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:33,879
Captain,

906
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,919
what's on your mind?

907
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:36,919
Is it Miss Tang?
