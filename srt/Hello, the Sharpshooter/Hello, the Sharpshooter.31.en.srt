Xiaoci... How come

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
she misunderstood me like that?

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,279
Any message

38
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,199
I can take to her for you?

39
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,160
Thanks

40
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,600
for today.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
But no need to help me more with this.

42
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,919
I'll talk to her in person.

43
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,919
No more meeting Tang Xin in private
in the future.

44
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,520
Now I get it, Shen Qingyuan.

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,679
You offered to meet me

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,600
just to warn me

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,720
not to meet her in private anymore?

48
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,080
How can you

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,440
be so narrow-minded?

50
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,399
You should learn from me

51
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:56,000
to become more open-minded, magnanimous,

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,880
and generous.

53
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,399
Have you forgotten

54
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:58,440
you've got business to do?

55
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,919
All right. Bye.

56
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,160
Shen Qingyuan.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,839
Recover soon.

58
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,000
And then I'll let you know

59
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,440
that my love

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,279
isn't an unrequited one.

61
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,119
Shen Qingyuan.

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,039
How was the talk?

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,679
So-so.

64
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,039
Good or bad exactly?

65
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,960
Tell me more details.

66
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,119
More details

67
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,279
are conditional.

68
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,160
I can't reach you.

69
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,679
I can move.

70
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,720
Now your request

71
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,000
has been met.

72
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,399
You should tell me more details.

73
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:56,440
Fine.

74
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,080
In fact, on this matter,

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,160
they can only depend on themselves.

76
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,039
If two people

77
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,440
like each other,

78
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,240
do they need a matchmaker?

79
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,200
Shen Qingyuan,

80
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,760
my response is...

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,320
I like you very, very much.

82
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,119
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

83
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,160
Good for you.

84
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,239
- Boss Du?
- Boss Du?

85
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,000
- Boss Du...
- Why are you dressing like this?

86
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,880
You've done your training?

87
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,000
It's really a skirt?

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,519
Where's Xiaoci now?

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,000
She went back to her dorm.

90
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,799
Hey, wait.

91
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,320
Why are you dressing like this, Boss Du?

92
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,079
Yeah.

93
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:11,640
Since when

94
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,079
have you formed such a special liking?

95
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,279
Enough, enough.

96
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,760
You guys are so ignorant.

97
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,279
What's wrong with me wearing a skirt?

98
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,119
You know what?

99
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:20,000
Men in Middle Ages not only wore skirts,

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,880
but also wore high heels.

101
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,880
Not to mention that

102
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
wearing a skirt is good in many ways.

103
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,279
It's comfortable,
and my body can get more air

104
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,440
which can drive heat and wet away.

105
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,000
You sure get more air.

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,239
Indeed.

107
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,960
(Du Lingfeng)

108
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:15,839
You...

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,440
How do you like it?

110
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,959
I'm dressing like this

111
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,000
to apologize to you.

112
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,559
I'm sorry, Xiaoci.

113
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,239
I was being inconsiderate.

114
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,480
I said something wrong.

115
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,079
In fact, I'm always thoughtless,

116
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,679
and assume things as a matter of course.

117
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,239
I didn't put myself into your shoes.

118
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,440
It's my fault.

119
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,279
But what I really mean to say was

120
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,079
that a skirt cannot be

121
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,440
chains that bind a girl,

122
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,239
nor can it be

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,799
a must for a girl

124
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,679
to be charming.

125
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,839
When I said you looked good

126
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,519
in trousers,

127
00:06:59,119 --> 00:06:59,679
I didn't mean

128
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:00,839
that a skirt didn't suit you.

129
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,839
Instead, in my eyes,

130
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,760
whatever beautiful clothes you wear

131
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,679
would only make your charm
more noticeable by contrast,

132
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,440
because naturally, you are exceptional,

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,760
dazzling,

134
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,239
and unique.

135
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,679
As for the past
that you don't want to recall,

136
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,559
to me,

137
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,079
it can only prove your handsomeness

138
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:22,839
along your way through.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,839
Just as you said,

140
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,440
fairness, justice

141
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,040
and mutual respect

142
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,839
are the most important factors
in a relationship,

143
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,119
so I hope

144
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,320
our relationship

145
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,839
can be ideal like that.

146
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,040
You told me that you could be stubborn

147
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
or overbearing sometimes,

148
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,600
and you could even go to extremes

149
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,040
when in a relationship.

150
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,480
Now when I look back,

151
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,440
it's just those
unique characters of yours

152
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,079
that made you so special

153
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,799
and thus attracted me

154
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,640
so much.

155
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,079
So, Xiaoci,

156
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,679
I like you.

157
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:13,839
I like you

158
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,440
not because you're smart,

159
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,320
brave and bright as they see on you,

160
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,559
but because of your real

161
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
and unique self I find in you.

162
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,880
So romantic!

163
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,519
You said you didn't want

164
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,679
to be taken as an eye candy.

165
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,039
Then can I

166
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,640
your eye candy?

167
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,280
Will you accept me,

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,080
a man who's been narcissistic,

169
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,799
arrogant,

170
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,520
who likes to show off

171
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,719
and sometimes

172
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,760
can be a little bossy,

173
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,640
and be my girlfriend?

174
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,200
Du Lingfeng,

175
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,840
that was too touchy-feely.

176
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,040
- So enviable!
- Good for them!

177
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,919
Seriously, Du Lingfeng?

178
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,320
Don't you think this is too gaudy?

179
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,239
Come on, Xiaoci,

180
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,599
I've been waiting for this for long.

181
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,159
Just let me enjoy this moment.

182
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,520
No.

183
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,359
Your way of proposing

184
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,559
is too old-fashioned.

185
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,679
Well, I...

186
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,080
Let me do it.

187
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,200
Du Lingfeng,

188
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,280
I...

189
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,080
Hang on.

190
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,080
I'm not finished yet.

191
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,039
Du Lingfeng,

192
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,719
I'm sorry

193
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,080
that I dared not

194
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,479
admit my true feelings for you

195
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,200
and made you suffer so much.

196
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,200
From now on,

197
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,520
let's take better care of each other.

198
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,559
That's not true.

199
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,799
I was being too stupid.

200
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,440
I only wanted to avoid the difficulties.

201
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,559
I almost forgot how special you are.

202
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,799
Du Lingfeng,

203
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,520
thank you.

204
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,679
I like you.

Oh, I almost forgot,

the netizens who saw your dressing today

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,919
have given you a new nickname:

257
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,719
Du the Beauty!

258
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,280
That's no big deal.

259
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,440
You know what?

260
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,799
That's far better

261
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,159
than my previous nicknames

262
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,440
such as Master Lingfeng

263
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:03,599
or Mr. Du.

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,119
But livestreamer,

265
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
you must help me make my new image

266
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,599
more positive in the future.

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,760
"Du the Beauty" is indeed a good name.

268
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,880
You should work with me more

269
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,320
so that your new nickname

270
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,119
can be more convincing

271
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,080

Hello?

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,919
Hi, Li.

277
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,280
This is Zhou Zuguang,

278
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,080
your old colleague
back at the TV station.

279
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:38,599
Oh, Zhou.

280
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,159
It's been a long time.

281
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,359
That's right.

282
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,640
Good that you remember.

283
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,640
I hear you've been promoted

284
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,760
to chief director at Star Show, right?

285
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,479
Congratulations!

286
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:50,919
Here's the thing.

287
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:52,760
I called to ask about someone

288
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,080
who once worked at your company.

289
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,479
It's Ai.

290
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,599
Ai?

291
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,239
You mean Yang Ai, right?

292
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:00,919
That's right.

293
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,479
But I heard

294
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,719
that she went to work at your company
after quitting.

295
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,520
She quit again?

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,400
Yeah,

297
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,760
not long after she got here.

298
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,840
Is she very close

299
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,919
to Xu Dian?

300
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,559
Zhou,

301
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,400
you still have a keen sense of news

302
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,239
as a former journalist.

303
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:18,679
You're right.

304
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,760
She and Xu Dian are close,

305
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,200
for years.

306
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,479
As for Xu Dian, you know him.

307
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,880
He's not quite a decent man.

308
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,119
I remember the two of them
were already close

309
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,280
back when you were working

310
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,599
at the station, right?

311
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,080
And the anchorwoman

312
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
was Lin, right?

313
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,200
Right.

314
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,719
I still pity her.

315
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,359
She was doing a great job

316
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,719
and was undoubtedly promising,

317
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,960
but she suddenly...

318
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,760
(HY TV HD OB Van)
Lin Li quit so suddenly

319
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,119
without warning anyone including you?

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,239
I kept calling her,

321
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:52,440
but she just didn't answer.

322
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,039
Why didn't you
make preparations earlier?

323
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,599
What a shame
for a municipal TV station like ours

324
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,119
to have such a kind of accident!

325
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,559
The original live program

326
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,719
was suddenly replaced by a recorded one?

327
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,359
You think the viewers are easy to fool?

328
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,320
I apologize,

329
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:05,440
but it was too sudden

330
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,960
for me as well to react properly.

331
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,119
Look what you have taught her

332
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,520
for almost a year!

333
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,799
She doesn't have a basic sense

334
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,520
of responsibility!

335
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,599
Zhou Zuguang,

336
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,919
look

337
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,119
what you have done!

338
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,200
Fine!

339
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Say no more.

340
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:19,919
Just wait for your punishment.

341
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,679
Okay, I get it.

342
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,440

Yes.

350
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,040
Over an hour, to be exact.

351
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,400
And,

352
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,959
I have good news for you.

353
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,599
The doctor just told me

354
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,079
that after an examination,

355
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
you would be discharged from hospital.

356
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,599

We've established

357
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,520
a deep friendship

358
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,599
over these days.

359
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,040
Hope we can meet again.

360
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,000
But not at a place

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,959
like this next time.

362
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,560
Handsome boy,

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,199
we may never see each other again.

364
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,400
Let's have a hug.

365
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,839
What are you doing?

366
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,920

391
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,199

392
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,959
No one can be more careful than us.

393
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:35,319
All right, I have a word to say.

394
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,319
Thank you all for your concern.

395
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,079
My leg has fully recovered.

396

Show us your steady steps then.

397
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,079

398
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:43,680
you came back

399
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,959
not at a good time.

400
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,040
It's Valentine's Day tomorrow.

401
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,839
You're supposed to come back

402
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,680
for the training

403
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,719
after celebrating the festival
with Miss Tang,

404
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,160
right?

405
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,239
Sounds reasonable.

406
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,400
It's for you.

407
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,079
This is the thing

408
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,400
that I had to go back to the hotel

409
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,760
to pick it up

410
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,880
that night.

411
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,400
It's very nice.

412
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,400
It's exquisite.

413
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,199
Wait.

414
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,000
You said you made a lot of them,

415
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,640
but why is there only one?

416
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,359
Because only the most exquisite one

417
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,640
could be picked out for you

418
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,959
from a pile of

419
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,760
electable models.

420
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,040
I chose this one.

421
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,439
The others must be exquisite too.

422
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,599
You didn't even see them.

423
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,400
I didn't need to.

424

such exquisite craftsmanship,

582
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,359
Can't reach it?

583
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,920

584
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,000
don't do stupid things.

585
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,680
I didn't know

586
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,239
he was so sly.

587
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,680
He took advantage of me,

588
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,199
but pretended to help me.

589
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I can get it for you.

590
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,119
You take it with you

591
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,359
all the time.

592
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,160
Is it special for you?

593
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,479
I was told

594
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,760
when I was being sent to the hospital,

595
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,319
I kept holding this watch.

596
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,119
But in fact, I don't know

597
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,239
where I got it.

598
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,000
That day...

599
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,160
He actually took this watch with him.

600
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,800
If you like it,

601
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,880
you can just have it.

602
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,560
Don't bother.

603
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,839
It's of no use for me.

604
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,319
Then I'll give it to you
after having it repaired.

605
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,439
You once said

606
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:21,680
it could help you focus
before you shoot.

607
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,439
It must be your mascot then.

608
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,959
Now my mascot

609
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:26,839
is you.

610
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:30,800
What's more, I have this.

611
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:39,160
Soon after, Shen Qingyuan
was back to the winter training

612
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:39,839
as well as

613
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,599
intense extra training.

614
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,920
He became even more hard-working,

615
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,760
and stricter on himself.

616
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:57,959
Endurance matters more

617
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,160
than speed.

618
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,520
Don't misbelieve that such running

619
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,599
would affect your training later.

620
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,359
Build a stronger heart and lungs,

621
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,920
and you'll know what's good about that

622
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,800
only after you get on the field.

623
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,560
Shen Qingyuan, come on!

624
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,520
Guys, come on!

625
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:28,920
Later

626
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,400
when I'm back,
I must grab some tasty meat.

627
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,760
- Captain.
- Captain.

628
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,199
- We'll leave first.
- See you.

629
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:34,520
Bye.

630
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,119
Xin.

631
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:36,839
See you, Xin.

632
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,359
Bye.

633
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:39,880
It's been a long time since last time.

634
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,439
Aren't you going to eat yet?

635
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,680
I'll just practice a little longer.

636
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,160
I knew it.

637
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,280
You must've saved a lot of bullets

638
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,400
for the team, right?

639
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,319
Why don't you go get a new box of them?

640
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,359
Dry practice also helps.

641
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,119
Besides,

642
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,040
I have the bullet from you.

643
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:17,920
Come.

644
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,040
Have some crispy winter jujube.

645
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,640
You're here.

646
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,239
- Miss Tang.
- Xin.

647
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:45,760
What happened?

648
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,800
You called me a lot.

649
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,319
I've taken a spot for you.

650
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:51,719
Isn't that

651
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,319
taking up your training resources?

652
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,400
- Of course not.
- Definitely not.

653
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,040
Every day you stand a long time,

654
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,800
which is exhausting,

655
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,959
while someone else

656
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:02,400
is always absent
from the training field.

657
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,880
Whether it's in the morning

658
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,280
or in the afternoon,
he only wants to relax here.

659
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,640
That someone is the one
who's been taking up the resources,

660
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,520
right?

661
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:09,760
- Right!
- Yeah, that's right!

662
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,000
I was only undergoing physiotherapy.

663
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,239
Miss Tang, Captain,

664
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:14,199
take your time and enjoy it here.

665
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:15,199
We'll leave you alone.

666
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,800
- That's right.
- Take your time and enjoy.

667
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,640
Enjoy.

668
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:18,520
Let's go.

669
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:19,400
This place is yours now.

670
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,719
Have a good massage.

671
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:21,760
See you.

672
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,319
Get down.

673
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,640
Does it ache here?

674
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,160
Miss,

675
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,000
you have a light lumbar muscle strain.

676
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:39,079
Pay more attention.

677
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,760
Let your little brother help you more.

678
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,560
Don't do everything alone.

679
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:47,439
Coach Zhang.

680
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,320
You've seen

681
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,719
my performance, right?

682
00:34:58,439 --> 00:34:59,159
I have.

683
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,280
You...

684
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,439
Weren't really practicing.

685
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,280
As expected,

686
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,719
no secret can escape from

687
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,560
your eyes, Coach.

688
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,239
Tell me, what's on your mind?

689
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,199
Let's sit, Coach.

690
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,919
Coach,

691
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:27,719
through your observation

692
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,800
over these days,

693
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,199
have you ever seen

694
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,520
a little bit of a professional athlete
in me?

695
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,320
I have.

696
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,560
Okay.

697
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:43,439
Then it's worth it.

698
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,159
You always talk about

699
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,439
"worth it" or "not worth it".

700
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,800
Have you thought about your future?

701
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,320
I thought

702
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,399
I had made some good plans.

703
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,159
But now when I think it over,

704
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,120
I don't think I ever thought about
my future seriously.

705
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,040
I can see that.

706
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,399
As expected,

707
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,439
you think little of me.

708
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,159
Do you think I should

709
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,520
think highly of you?

710
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,959
When you told me that

711
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,479
you wouldn't come to the base every day

712
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:23,919
during the winter training,

713
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,719
I realized that

714
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:27,080
you

715
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,840
might never be a professional athlete.

716
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,959
So, I never really pushed you.

717
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:39,959
Tell me your decision
after thinking it through.

718
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:44,520
But I guess those kids

719
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,040
wouldn't want you to leave.

720
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,520
You scared me.

721
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,280
How come you reacted so fast?

722
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,879
I was walking softly.

723
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,399
You're boring.

724
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,600
I smelled you coming.

725
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,239
Impossible.

726
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,040
I take a bath every day.

727
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,040
Can it be that
I sleepwalked to your room

728
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
and got polluted by the smell there?

729
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:34,840
I see.

730
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,000
Xiaoci,

731
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,399
you just want my compliment
on your fragrant smell,

732
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,040
don't you?

733
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,919
My Xiaoci has the most fragrant smell,

734
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,399
however,

735
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,399
you might have been polluted
by my smell.

736
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,320
What were you and Coach talking about?

737
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,159
Xiaoci,

738
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,520
you might know as well

739
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,439
that I came here to practice shooting
only for fun.

740
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,639
No.

741
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,360
Not for fun.

742
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,199
I came here to practice shooting

743
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,439
only for you,

744
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,679
right?

745
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:17,679
Is that what you two were talking about?

746
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,560
Not really.

747
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:25,840
I'm confused

748
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,639
about my future.

749
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,439
So, it has nothing to do with me.

750
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,679
You would talk about it with Coach
but not with me.

751
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,280
So?

752
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,840
You're jealous?

753
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,479
I think you'll be jealous

754
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,479
if I ignore you.

755
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,280
No, no, no.

756
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm talking about it with you.

757
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,199
And whatever my future will be like,

758
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,360
you will be in it.

759
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:56,120
That's why I didn't need to explain.

760
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,800
Xiaoci, don't be upset.

761
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:03,320
I was joking.

762
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,959
Go back to your training.

763
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,840
For real?

764
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:09,879
For real.

765
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:10,520
Hurry up.

766
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,399
Hurry.

767
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,080
You mean
Du Lingfeng is considering quitting

768
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,520
because he's planning for the future?

769
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:47,199
He didn't tell me that though.

770
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:49,520
What's on your mind now?

771
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,239
Actually, everyone in the team knows

772
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,439
he came here for fun,

773
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,280
and he's leaving sooner or later.

774
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,439
Don't be too upset.

775
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:05,439
They are just talking about
girls' business.

776
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:07,560
Don't think too much.

777
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,919
Rest assured.

778
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:09,959
Xiaoci

779
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:10,639
won't take up too much time

780
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,679
of your girlfriend.

781
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:15,959
But I wouldn't mind

782
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,439
