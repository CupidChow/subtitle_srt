35
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:36,839
Xiaoci.

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,879
- I've got one question...
- Tang Xin.

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,279
Does this present

38
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:40,879
mean that you take me

39
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,919
as your friend now?

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,319
Of course.

41
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,760
Of course I want you to be my friend.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,040
But you're too good for me.

43
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:47,839
I'm afraid you don't want

44
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,720
to be my friend.

45
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
Don't feel inferior.

46
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:51,360
Everyone

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,800
has their strengths and weaknesses.

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,720
So do I.

49
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,440
Actually I know

50
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,319
what you wanted to ask.

51
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,559
As your new friend,

52
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,480
I should make a date with you.

53
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,279
How about we

54
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,199
have lunch together?

55
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,480
OK.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,720
Relax.

57
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,440
I'll give you an answer

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,240
by then.

59
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,479
You can go

60
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,880
find Shen Qingyuan now.

61
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,360
He's on the sports ground.

62
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,119
OK, see you.

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,000
Say hi, say hi.

64
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,600
Mr. Du.

65
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,839
Do you have time for an interview?

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,160
Come on.

67
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,720
The fans are waiting in the live room.

68
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,639
Come on, say hi to them.

69
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,160
Hi.

70
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,559
Here.

71
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:00,880
Chen Hai.

72
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,679
It's not a livestream.

73
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,279
Lead us.

74
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,440
Are you trying to trick me?

75
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,360
Follow up, guys.

76
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,399
I'm getting materials

77
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,440
for the partner thing.

78
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,080
How many times have I told you?

79
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,839
Make me look handsome.

80
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:10,679
Am I handsome to you now?

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,119
OK, I'm done.

82
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:12,960
Keep running.

83
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,600
What are you doing?

84
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,160
Don't slack off.

85
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,919
Did I slack off?

86
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,559
I'm running with you.

87
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,039
Listen.

88
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,160
It's kidnapping.

89
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,479
Miss Tang.

90
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,160
How's it?

91
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,279
Is our captain handsome?

92
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm working very hard here.

93
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,479
OK, OK.

94
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:37,759
Yeah, yeah.

95
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,360
Keep on working.

96
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,520
I brought mercurochrome.

97
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,880
I'm gonna wear some

98
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
on my knees

99
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
and pretend to fall.

100
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,479
And you... You...

101
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,759
I carry you to see the doctor?

102
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,039
Do you think I can carry you?

103
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,360
It's better than running.

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,639
Here it is.

105
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,480
Oh, no! I'm hurt!

106
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,720
I need to go to the infirmary!

107
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,799
I'm bleeding!

108
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,279
I need to go to the infirmary!

109
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:31,959
I'm hurt!

110
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,640
That's the best he can do?

111
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,359
Come on.

112
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,679
My mercurochrome went to waste.

113
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,120
No.

114
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,959
Why is he here?

115
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,279
What happened? You fell?

116
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,480
Let... Let me see.

117
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,279
No.

118
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,399
I fear blood.

119
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:44,760
Jiang Yitian.

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,959
Take me to the infirmary.

121
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,040
I can carry you there.

122
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,799
No, no, no.

123
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:48,279
Come on.

124
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,720
No.

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,519
It's fine.

126
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,359
Captain.

127
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,160
It's mercurochrome.

128
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,119
Our mercurochrome.

129
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,160
Wasn't it your plan?

130
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,760
You weren't involved in our plan.

131
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,640
Captain.

132
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,160
We... We were wrong.

133
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,359
You should know

134
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,399
who to learn from.

135
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,239
It's obvious.

136
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,720
Stop running, all three of you.

137
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,359
Thanks, Captain.

138
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,040
Later in the afternoon,

139
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,160
come here for training.

140
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,600
Captain Shen.

141
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,920
You wanna get more training tomorrow?

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,640
Captain Shen.

143
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,720
I worked hard.

144
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,040
Can't you go easy on me?

145
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,160
I haven't exercised before.

146
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,839
It was hard for me

147
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,959
to run a 5K.

148
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:47,920
In the Shooting Team,

149
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,239
it's either to pass or fail.

150
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,480
We never take someone as excellent

151
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
if he didn't pass.

152
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,279
You better stop the nonsense.

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,279
Tang Xin.

154
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,720
Xiaoci.

155
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,679
Are you coming to run a 10K, too?

156
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,519
No.

157
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,559
It's the women's team's turn
in the afternoon.

158
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,720
I brought water.

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,760
What are they doing?

160
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,519
Keep on.

161
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,760
Practice hard.

162
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,320
You're hurt?

163
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,600
No.

164
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,440
I'm having a rest.

165
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:32,359
Captain Shen.

166
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm here to give you water.

167
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,799
Thanks.

168
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,399
You guys keep practicing.

169
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,079
I'm off.

170
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,640
Where are you going?

171
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm tired. I don't feel like practicing.

172
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,320
Punish me as you want.

173
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,440
Thanks.

174
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,559
You're welcome.

175
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:01,720
I didn't expect

176
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,920
Captain Shen could be this frustrated.

177
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,679
Do you wanna know my answer?

178
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,720
About who do I like.

179
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,160
I don't know.

180
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,000
I was pretty sure before.

181
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:21,880
The only guy

182
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,279
I can accept in my life

183
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,000
is Shen Qingyuan.

184
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,119
But

185
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,040
recently I have

186
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,440
had a crush.

187
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,279
I don't mean Shen Qingyuan.

188
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,679
And I've thought about it.

189
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,880
I've been taking Shen Qingyuan

190
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,200
as a worthy opponent of mine,

191
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,720
and I appreciate him.

192
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,959
I just don't want to see

193
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,480
such a talented player like him
to be ruined.

194
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:48,600
And I think

195
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
he only deserves

196
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,839
to be with me.

197
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,279
Have you got jealous for him?

198
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,959
I haven't, actually.

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,399
But I want to own him.

200
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,600
This word isn't very accurate.

201
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,359
I don't want to own him as a person.

202
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,320
It's just...

203
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,079
I just want him

204
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,160
to make sure I can always win.

205
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,160
Xiaoci,

206
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,279
who do you like then?

207
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,119
It doesn't matter.

208
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,519
What matters is

209
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,839
I've reached the goal line,

210
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,799
but I dare not
to carry the ball across it.

211
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,840
Why is he acting weird?

212
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,039
He seems to be avoiding us.

213
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,000
Captain Shen.

214
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,520
What's the look on your face?

215
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,280
Captain.

216
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,520
Miss Tang

217
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,359
is just having lunch

218
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,440
with Xiaoci.

219
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,840
You're not used to

220
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,159
being away from her for this while?

221
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,000
I just want to know

222
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,320
what Xiaoci said to her.

223
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
You're afraid

224
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,960
Miss Tang would know

225
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,080
how well you cooperated with Xiaoci

226
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,119
and she'd get upset?

227
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,280
When the heart starts functioning
for someone,

228
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,159
the brain just starts malfunctioning.

229
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,719
Right?

230
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,320
Captain Shen.

231
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,520
Why didn't I realize

232
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,280
you have two sets of rules?

233
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
You've always

234
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,119
- been so...
- Cold and detached to us.

235
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,320
Yes.

236
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,520
What does that mean?

237
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,840
It means...

238
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,479
You have one set for other people.

239
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:02,840
And

240
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,159
a different set of rules

241
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,400
for the girl you love.

242
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,919
Is it a good thing?

243
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,039
Well...

244
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,640
It isn't about good or bad.

245
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,719
Only two people

246
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,000
are involved in a relationship.

247
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,960
If she isn't

248
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,119
that special to you,

249
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,640
you won't become a couple,

250
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,239
will you?

251
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,400
And of course, you hope

252
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,520
she can have a special set of rules

253
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,840
for only you.

254
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,000
This way, you can prove

255
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,640
that she likes you, right?

256
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,960
This two-sided relationship

257
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,039
is said

258
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,840
to be the sweetest.

259
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
The sweetest.

260
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,159
But looking at your attitude,

261
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,000
I have to say

262
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,239
this is a little bit too much.

263
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,159
Look.

264
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,559
You've been hostile

265
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,000
to almost everyone.

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,559
Right?

267
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,599
What does this mean

268
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
if I'm overcautious?

269
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,359
It means

270
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,080
you're afraid she'll get hurt.

271
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,440
And you love her so much.

272
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:56,719
Finish your lunch.

273
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,239
Horrible.

274
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,640
It's just horrible.

275
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,400
Come on.

276
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,080
The female team's on their way.

277
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:12,919
We can only

278
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,359
keep running

279
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,840
under the hot sun.

280
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,760
Thankfully it's autumn.

281
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,200
Or how will we live?

282
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,119
Don't get sunburnt.

283
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,400
We're shedding sweat here

284
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,719
and they're being lovey-dovey.

285
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,640
Enough of it!

286
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,400
Thank you!

287
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,200
Mr. Du.

288
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,080
It's like the pot

289
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,000
calling the kettle black.

290
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,119
We're the most miserable.

291
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,359
The countdown is starting.

292
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Be prepared for running.

293
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:56,679
Miss Tang.

294
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,159
Could you help

295
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,479
persuade our captain?

296
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,159
You have to practice

297
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,320
to get the best result.

298
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,880
Come on.

299
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,080
You've started

300
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,119
to taking his side now.

301
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,119
Three.

302
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,280
Two.

303
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:09,559
One.

304
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,200
Mr. Du.

305
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,840
Are you stimulated?

306
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,719
You're running so fast.

307
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,840
Could you believe it?

308
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,520
This morning, he was
grabbing our mercurochrome.

309
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,799
It's the power of love.

310
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,320
Good point.

311
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,520
Love is encouraging.

312
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,239
Coach.

313
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,799
Are you here to check on them?

314
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,559
Shen Qingyuan's good.

315
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,080
He's organized the training

316
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,880
in such a short time.

317
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,280
How was your run?

318
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,640
Not bad.

319
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,840
I used 39 minutes.

320
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,440
The 8K running test

321
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,239
won't be a problem.

322
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:58,799
It surely won't be a problem for you.

323
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,880
But those kids

324
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,119
have been fooling around.

325
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,119
Right.

326
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,119
Don't come for the training tonight.

327
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,559
You have to take more rest.

328
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,400
Alternate between stress and rest.

329
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,640
That won't do.

330
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,320
I'm not even close

331
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,239
to the goal Captain Shen set for me.

332
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,400
I have to come.

333
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,599
You're obedient to him now.

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,559
This isn't like your style before.

335
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,039
He gives helpful advice.

336
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,039
I approve of him.

337
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,159
Come on, come on.

338
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,599
It's the last lap.

339
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,919
Is that Tang Xin?

340
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,239
Dr. Ding was right.

341
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,400
She's a good influence.

342
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,119
I think I'm having a heart attack.

343
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,200
That's impossible.

344
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,960
Evil people live long lives.

345
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,840
You won't die this early.

346
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,840
95 minutes.

347
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,840
What's the passing time?

348
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,119
45.

349
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,719
You've worked hard, everyone.

350
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:12,559
Here. Have some water.

351
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,400
Shen Qingyuan, I warn you.

352
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,599
Don't be so greedy.

353
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,039
I can deliver them to them.

354
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,520
It's too heavy.

355
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,760
Congrats, you've finished

356
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,239
the first 10K run this year.

357
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,119
Keep up the good work.

358
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,200
It's...

359
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,520
My first time.

360
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,119
It's good that you made it.

361
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If you leave now,

362
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,599
we won't have to talk anymore.

363
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,359
I'm not leaving.

364
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,119
I just finished running

365
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,960
and am stretching out.

366
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:16,479
Du Lingfeng.

367
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,799
Do you feel awkward?

368
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,119
Have you had

369
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,159
lots of girlfriends?

370
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,479
That's just a rumor.

371
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,400
It's not true.

372
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,880
So you do feel awkward.

373
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,640
Xiaoci.

374
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,239
I've been trying to find a chance

375
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,039
to talk to you.

376
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,280
But I don't know how to say this.

377
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,880
How many types of relationship

378
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,799
do you think are there
between men and women?

379
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,000
Pursuing, being pursued,

380
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,880
and already got it?

381
00:15:59,119 --> 00:15:59,960
These three?

382
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,359
Before

383
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,760
I really thought so.

384
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,119
But after I met you,

385
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:10,840
I found

386
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,200
you're not like any of them.

387
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,799
I think we're having

388
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,960
a wrestling relationship.

389
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,640
Wrestling?

390
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,359
I talked to you after the 2V2 match,

391
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,400
and suddenly realized

392
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,559
the wrestling relationship
between men and women

393
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,080
is like a competition.

394
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,200
Both competitive

395
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,280
and passive-aggressive.

396
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,119
Anyway, it's like

397
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,960
no one wants to bow down first

398
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,640
and they both find joy

399
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
in it.

400
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,760
So you mean

401
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:48,760
let's not spoil

402
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,880
this interesting relationship for now,

403
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,520
and not resist it.

404
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,559
Just go with the flow.

405
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,039
So can I take it as

406
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:01,760
you want to give it a try

407
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,719
and get to know me?

408
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,119
Wipe your sweat off.

409
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,640
As you command.

410
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,160
My opponent.

411
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,280
You feel envious?

412
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,800
Du Lingfeng and Shi Xiaoci.

413
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,839
If you feel envious,

414
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,199
I can do that.

415
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,560
No.

416
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,079
How

417
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,640
about this?

418
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,599
I... I've got things to do.

419
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,040
I... I'm going back to work.

420
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:06,359
Xiaoci.

421
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,599
Why do I like

422
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,640
a girl like you so much?

423
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,160
What do you mean?

424
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,839
Sometimes I wish

425
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,000
I could be you.

426
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,560
Are you silly?

427
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,239
Every girl is unique.

428
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,719
Can you

429
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,359
think about your love life and career?

430
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,680
I'm serious.

431
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,119
Look at you.

432
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,000
Having such a tender skin

433
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,560
and a good shape.

434
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
If I were a guy,

435
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,959
I would marry you.

436
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,479
But most of the times

437
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,359
I want to be you.

438
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,520
What are you thinking?

439
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,880
No.

440
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,760
We've been roommates for three years.

441
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,359
But there's

442
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,079
still a such gap between us.

443
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,239
Look at you.

444
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,319
So delicate.

445
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,400
You used mouthwash
after brushing your teeth.

446
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,640
And now you're using mouth spray.

447
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,479
You're making it so professional.

448
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,520
Of course.

449
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,359
Dental care is as important
as skin care.

450
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,560
Don't you know?

451
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,400
I don't.

452
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,000
You're such a pretty girl.

453
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,640
Even your breath is fresh.

454
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,280
Xiang.

455
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,920
I really don't

456
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,400
want to outshine you.

457
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,479
Who will let you outshine me?

458
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:06,760
Xiaoci.

459
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,079
Do you have any secrets

460
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,079
to become pretty and awesome?

461
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:10,760
Teach me.

462
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't have any secrets.

463
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:13,920
But

464
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,359
you have to push yourself hard

465
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,040
and keep moving on.

466
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,359
Never take regressive steps.

467
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,839
Now you mention it,

468
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,359
I notice you've been
doing these all along.

469
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,359
Look at your routine.

470
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,680
You're like an Iron Woman.

471
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,199
Getting up at 5 AM,

472
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,079
going to bed at 10 PM,

473
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,599
and swimming a kilometer every day.

474
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,479
You even count calories when you eat,

475
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,199
use sugar-free toothpaste,

476
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,839
and always do dental care.

477
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,479
Forget it.

478
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,199
I can never do these.

479
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,199
I'd better be an ordinary girl.

480
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,560
Right, cutie?

481
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,640
How about this?

482
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,439
I don't want that.

483
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,479
I want a blind box underneath.

484
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,359
This one.

485
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,400
Is there any more boxes

486
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,040
that you like?

487
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,719
No. Only this one.

488
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,680
OK.

489
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,560
(Please wait)
(Payment successful, delivering...)

490
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,120
(Successfully delivered)
(Please get it from the pick-up box)

491
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,120
(Pick-up box)

492
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,280
Take it.

493
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,000
Thanks.

494
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,199
Is blind box

495
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:27,479
all about uncertainty?

496
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,640
What's uncertain

497
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
about liking something?

498
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,040
I was certain

499
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,199
the first time I saw you.

500
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,239
Take a guess then.

501
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,359
I won't.

502
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,880
Let me tell you.

503
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,560
I will buy

504
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,560
all the blind boxes today.

505
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,239
Really?

506
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:43,959
Really.

507
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,560
But have you forgotten

508
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,599
what we agreed upon?

509
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,479
Is it...? Wrestling?

510
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,239
One of the key features about wrestling

511
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,079
is keeping a balance.

512
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,160
The more money you spend,

513
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,000
the more I will lose.

514
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,280
Is there such a hidden rule?

515
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,880
Yes.

516
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,119
So after you bought so many takeouts,

517
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,920
I've been saving up.

518
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,479
Xiaoci.

519
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,479
I never expected

520
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,800
I'd worry about money someday.

521
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:14,599
Xiaoci.

522
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,760
Come on, hero.

523
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,319
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

524
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,760
Come on, come on.

525
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,000
Yes!

526
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,839
I thought we had a deal.

527
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:35,920
We can't end the game

528
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,719
in less than ten minutes.

529
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,439
You know what?

530
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,199
I'm in a bit of a bad mood.

531
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:42,839
I need a little drink

532
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,599
to cheer myself up.

533
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,560
What can I do about it?

534
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,239
I'm anxious

535
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,800
for being so awesome.

536
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:54,560
OK.

537
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,880
Men should always let women win.

538
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,079
I admit defeat.

539
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,000
But you can't

540
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,359
let anyone win.

541
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,160
Don't worry.

542
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,839
You're the one and only.

543
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,359
When we were training,

544
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:13,839
I didn't know

545
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,160
you have such a honey mouth.

546
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,000
You didn't pay any attention to me.

547
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,079
You will know if you
pay more attention to me.

548
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:27,520
Xiaoci.

549
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,760
Why are you like a child?

550
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,359
You got food on your face.

551
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:41,800
Xiaoci.

552
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,040
I feel so happy now.

553
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:46,520
If only we could be like this

554
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,359
forever.

555
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,280
Actually

556
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,839
Mom's in a stable condition now.

557
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,040
You don't have to worry too much.

558
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,560
It's all because of you.

559
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,719
There is some color back in her cheeks.

560
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,760
You seldom praise me.

561
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,920
Before we got married,

562
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,359
I'd said all the nice things about you.

563
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,239
Now when I say it,

564
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,160
it feels as alien

565
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,439
as this wedding house.

566
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,760
Why don't you get some rest?

567
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,439
You will get many things on.

568
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,000
Zuguang.

569
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:21,160
I lost my father.

570
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,239
What if...?

571
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,839
What if my mom...?

572
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,800
It won't happen.

573
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,239
I'm with you.

574
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,280
It will never happen.

575
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,079
Sorry, sorry.

576
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:43,119
Sorry, Ding Fang.

577
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:43,560
I...

578
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,199
I'm not ready yet.

579
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:50,800
Sorry.

580
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,640
A loving couple.

581
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,680
How ironic.

582
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,119
Here.

583
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,839
I'm exhausted.

584
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,319
I can't play anymore.

585
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,160
What's wrong?

586
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,920
Your saliva.

587
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:15,719
Don't.

588
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,319
So-Sorry.

589
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:25,839
Captain.

590
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,280
The lunch break is over?

591
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,440
(Go for it)

592
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:04,719
Tang Xin.

593
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,319
What are you doing?

594
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,880
Are you

595
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:31,319
satisfied now?

596
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,960
(Invite her)

597
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,800
There's still time before training.

598
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,920
How about going on a date with me?

599
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:54,920
Date?

600
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,959
Aren't couples

601
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,319
supposed to go on dates?

602
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:00,599
OK.

603
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,319
What do couples do on a date?

604
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,479
We used to have lunch

605
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:12,680
or go see a movie.

606
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:13,760
But the lunch break

607
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,719
is so short.

608
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,400
We've had lunch.

609
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,959
And a movie is too long.

610
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,400
Well...

611
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,239
I don't know.

612
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,119
Why hasn't Captain said anything?

613
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,000
Did he get turned down?

614
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,920
Luckily, we have secret plans.

615
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,599
Come on.

616
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:34,800
The last one.

617
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,720
(Hair band)

618
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,520
Look at you.

619
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,359
Your hair band is old.

620
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,079
Come on.

621
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,079
I will buy you a new one.

622
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,199
I think it's pretty new.

623
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,000
It's old.

624
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:52,880
Come on.

625
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,800
Let's go.

626
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,479
No need. My hair band is fine.

627
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,359
I have to buy you a new one.

628
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:02,880
Let's go.

629
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,560
Stay where no one's around.

630
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:15,520
Is this lovely?

631
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:17,000
It's pretty lovely.

632
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,640
Let's check over there.

633
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,560
Go.

634
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:34,479
This place seems great.

635
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,160
Shen Qingyuan.

636
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:42,079
Isn't it a little inappropriate?

637
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,119
It's appropriate.

638
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,680
Thanks.

639
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,920
Big brother.

640
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:05,000
Are you buying underwear

641
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,040
for this big sister?

642
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:08,959
Cutie pie.

643
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,839
Keep your voice down.

644
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:11,719
Buying underwear

645
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:13,239
is not a strange thing.

646
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,680
Shall we leave?

647
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,199
Wait.

648
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,479
Have you got registered?

649
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:27,040
Kids nowadays know everything.

650
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,119
Who told you?

651
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,359
Listen, you can't talk at will.

652
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,920
Why do you glare at me?

653
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,880
Mom.

654
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,160
Let's go.

655
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,359
Mom.

656
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,280
Mom.

657
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,920
What if her mom sees the footage

658
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,119
and comes to give you trouble?

659
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,119
I just answered

660
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:00,920
her question.

661
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,520
Why would she give me trouble?

662
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
You're tall

663
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:05,760
and like

664
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,239
to pull a poker face.

665
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,560
When you don't speak,

666
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,199
people will think you're dangerous

667
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,280
when they see
your expression and gesture.

668
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,199
No wonder the little girl got scared.

669
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,640
She said we don't look like a couple.

670
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,160
I have to explain to her.

671
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,160
She said we don't look like
husband and wife.

672
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,760
How can we look like one?

673
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:29,959
I don't know.

674
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,839
It's said on TV that
we should rely on each other

675
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:34,599
and have intimate contact.

676
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:38,560
Shen Qingyuan.

677
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,800
Do you feel upset?

678
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,359
Why would I?

679
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:45,719
Because I can't

680
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,160
be a normal girlfriend

681
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:48,319
who's willing to

682
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,920
get intimate with you.

683
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,199
It's fine.

684
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,400
I have time

685
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,640
and patience.

686
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,319
I promise you

687
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,719
to solve my psychological problem

688
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:01,479
as soon as possible.

689
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,920
And your psychological problem.

690
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,800
I've been

691
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,040
telling myself

692
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,879
not to dwell on the past.

693
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,320
But Shen Qingyuan,

694
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,840
sometimes I just couldn't help

695
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,679
thinking about

696
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,520
what happened that year

697
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:20,879
and why

698
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,199
you chose to forget

699
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,360
me.

700
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:25,639
Dr. Ding.

701
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,719
Are you busy?

702
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,320
I want to talk to you

703
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,040
about the updates between
me and Shen Qingyuan.

704
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,959
(Transfusion room)
Is it that you made

705
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,239
a huge process?

706
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,919
We're seeing each other officially.

707
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,199
Really?

708
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,399
Is it because you're seeing each other

709
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,479
and got closer,

710
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,520
but you're facing

711
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,600
more problems?

712
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:46,199
Especially the physical contact problem.

713
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,120
Yes.

714
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,479
I really like him.

715
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:51,800
But probably

716
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,399
because I like him so much,

717
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,000
I just don't know

718
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,080
how to mention the past to him.

719
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,239
But if I keep being silent

720
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,840
and hiding the truth,

721
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:03,159
I'm afraid he'd misunderstand me.

722
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,199
I don't want that

723
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,959
and I don't want him to be upset

724
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,879
every time he gets close to me.

725
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,000
So Dr. Ding,

726
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,600
I wanna ask

727
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:13,919
if you have any

728
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,439
special treatment

729
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,479
to help me walk out of the
psychological shadow

730
00:35:17,879 --> 00:35:19,360
and be intimate with him.

731
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,320
Tang Xin.

732
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,800
It'll be counterproductive

733
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
if you rush it.

734
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,320
Because you can

735
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,879
only be cured

736
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:27,280
without you noticing.

737
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,479
It's just like

738
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,840
you had the stammer problem,

739
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,760
and later on

740
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
it was solved naturally.

741
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,479
Maybe one day

742
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:35,919
in a certain situation

743
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,120
you'll suddenly forget your fear

744
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,000
and only have him in your mind.

745
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,840
Will this day come?

746
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,239
That I can overcome my fear completely?

747
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,239
Everything is possible,

748
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:47,959
isn't it?

749
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,800
You didn't think about

750
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:51,840
continue being

751
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,199
with Shen Qingyuan before, right?

752
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,919
Thank you, Dr. Ding.

753
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,239
Well... Dr. Ding.

754
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,520
I hope when you're

755
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,239
handling your relationship
with Mr. Zhou,

756
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,000
you can stay this sober.

757
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,560
Don't give up easily.

758
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,360
Actually Mr. Zhou

759
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,719
is firm in speech but soft in heart.

760
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,840
You can't just listen to what he says,

761
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,000
but look at what he does.

762
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,399
Little girl.

763
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,520
Have some food.

764
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:57,959
I'm so tired.

765
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:05,919
How sweet!

766
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,919
Take a rest.

767
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,000
Get up. Get up.

768
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,520
Stretch out before you get rest.

769
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,439
Captain.

770
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:02,439
Let us rest for ten seconds.

771
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:03,399
OK? Just ten seconds.

772
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:03,919
No, no.

773
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:04,639
Only ten seconds.

774
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,959
Get up and stretch out first.

775
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,800
I'll go get you water.

776
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,399
- Thanks, Miss Tang.
- Thanks, Miss Tang.

777
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,760
Are you alright?

778
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,320
I'm fine.

779
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,479
Let me check.

780
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,199
Does it hurt?

781
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:28,479
No.

782
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:31,520
How about here?

783
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,560
No.

784
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,840
Can you move your arm?

785
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:36,840
Yes.

786
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,760
Did I see wrong?

787
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,560
Captain is

788
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,840
giving Miss Tang a massage.

789
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,120
That's true.

790
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,479
My shoulder hurts, too.

791
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,760
Jiang Yitian, rub it for me.

792
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,479
Come on.

793
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,000
Thanks, Jiang Yitian.

794
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,879
You're so kind.

795
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,239
Your shoulder hurts?

796
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,679
Have some water and you'll be fine?

797
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,439
Captain, are you shutting me up?

798
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,239
Right?

799
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,199
I'm very glad.

800
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,639
He's finally got the point.

801
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,360
But it'll be hard

802
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,879
for our single guys.

803
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,879
We have to watch this

804
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:15,040
after running a 10K.

805
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:16,959
It's not fair.

806
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:17,719
Jiang Yitian.

807
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:19,000
I have to seek some benefits

808
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,879
from Captain.

809
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:20,840
Don't go.

810
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:22,919
You're going to confront him.

811
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:23,959
Are you seeking death?

812
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,040
