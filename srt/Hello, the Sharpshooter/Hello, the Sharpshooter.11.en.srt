=Hello, The Sharpshooter=

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
=Episode 11=

35
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,639
Well done.

36
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,040
The center density is quite right.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,559
Xiaoci.

38
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,319
Look at my sweat.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,120
It's all because of the training.

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,040
You haven't eaten, right?

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,239
I brought you some food
from the canteen.

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,000
Have some..

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,320
Xiaoci.

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,080
You prepared

45
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,119
the food specially for me?

46
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,720
Hard work

47
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,559
indeed pays off.

48
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,440
You have to keep up the hard work.

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,199
Or there will be no payback.

50
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,919
The food from the canteen
is so good today.

51
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,960
Even the rice is so delicious.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If I practice like this every day,

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,039
can you bring me food tomorrow?

54
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,960
Let's go over there first.

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,200
(Locker Room)

56
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,320
Hold them.

57
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Do you know what they are?

58
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,119
Leather coats for air rifle shooting.

59
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,039
Don't you only practice air pistol?

60
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,320
Let's go.

61
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,080
Captain,

62
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:42,199
you look so cool in that outfit.

63
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,240
But our captain

64
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,399
looks perfect in everything.

65
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:44,919
Captain!

66
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,279
Captain,

67
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,559
I've finally managed
to borrow a rifle for you.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,399
Tell me,

69
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,240
how are you gonna thank me?

70
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:55,399
It's quite heavy.

71
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,440
Just do two shots.

72
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,279
After all, air pistol

73
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,440
is different from air rifle.

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,440
Easy does it.

75
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,279
Our captain is an all-rounder.

76
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:03,800
Yes.

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,559
Special target sheets.

78
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,759
Thanks.

79
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,279
Captain Shen,

80
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,279
let me change the target sheets for you.

81
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,240
Thank you.

82
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:17,279
Miss Tang,

83
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,720
how did Captain come to think of

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,920
giving you a demo of air rifle shooting?

85
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,440
It was a spur-of-the-moment idea.

86
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,480
It's ready, Captain Shen.

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
He's loading the rifle.

88
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,279
10.9.

89
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,079
Awesome!

90
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,239
Awesome, Captain!

91
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,839
That's great!

92
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,079
Fantastic!

93
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:25,920
Yes, he's awesome.

94
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,320
10.9.

95
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,200
Your target is

96
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,799
several times larger

97
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:30,399
than ours.

98
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,920
Ours is a coin target
and you could even…

99
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,920
Captain Shen,

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,079
your shooting posture
is also up to standard.

101
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,279
Your shooting talent

102
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,799
is beyond question.

103
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,040
Our captain is an all-rounder.

104
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,440
- Yes, an all-rounder!
- An all-rounder!

105
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,279
Our captain is capable enough to do it.

106
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,320
Don't be so shocked.

107
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,920
Thanks.

108
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,320
Captain, you rock!

109
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,239
Awesome, Captain!

110
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,720
Captain is my idol.

111
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,600
I was wrong.

112
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,880
I know you are not only good at

113
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,040
air pistol,

114
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,679
but we'd better

115
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,040
keep practicing air pistol.

116
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,279
Wait a minute.

117
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,799
Air rifle shooters

118
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:31,519
call this outfit skin.

119
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,440
Externally,

120
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,679
it can insulate against
the recoil force of the rifle.

121
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,480
Internally,

122
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:38,679
it can insulate against

123
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,799
subtle changes

124
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,720
including heartbeat.

125
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,959
I suppose you know this.

126
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:49,359
Give it to me.

127
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,839
Leave it here for now.

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,359
Stretch out your hands.

129
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,640
Your shooting posture is unstable.

130
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,679
It can help you improve

131
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,760
the stability of your shooting.

132
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,799
And give you a feel of practice.

133
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,119
Shen Qingyuan.

134
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,399
Did you call me?

135
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,320
You don't remember me?

136
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,040
Hi, Captain Shen.

137
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,760
I am Tang Xin from Rui Live.

138
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Starting from today,

139
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,079
I'll be in complete charge of

140
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,600
recording the shooting team's
daily routine

141
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,160
and I'll also try hard to be

142
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,799
a good roommate who brings no trouble.

143
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,480
Hope I can get your approval.

144
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
What are you doing?

145
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,600
Back then,

146
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,200
we didn't have a good start

147
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,480
and brought many confusions and hassles
to each other.

148
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,959
Now, Shen Qingyuan,

149
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,040
let's start all over again.

150
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,519
The best scenario is…I can accept you

151
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,040
and you can accept me.

152
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,040
Shen Qingyuan,

153
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,440
go sleep in your bedroom.

154
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,239
Or you'll easily catch a cold here...

155
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,440
Shen Qingyuan,

156
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,520
why are you being so nice to me?

157
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,960
Didn't you say
you couldn't remember me?

158
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,719
Or is it that

159
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:04,880
whether you remember me or not,

160
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,919
you will always find me again?

161
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,359
It's quite heavy,

162
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,799
but it can relieve pressure.

163
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,559
Can you feel your heartbeat?

164
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,239
What about cellphone vibrations?

165
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,600
(Shen Qingyuan)

166
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,040
(Accept)

167
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,200
(Shen Qingyuan)

168
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,679
It seems

169
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,559
this is a substandard leather coat.

170
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,239
No.

171
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,520
It's quite good.

172
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,280
If only I could wear this leather coat

173
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,520
for the 2v2 game

174
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:11,640
and the following commentary

175
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,479

You guys go with me to drink a toast.

OK. Go back to drink first.

OK. Go.

You've become a rare visitor.

How have you been?

270
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,280
Haven't you devoted yourself to sports?

271
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,200
Why do you have time

272
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,080
to patronize this place today?

273
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,960
I'm just here to look around

274
00:14:58,119 --> 00:14:59,840
and incidentally test myself.

275
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,919
Test?

276
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,799
Do you know how I feel

277
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,719
when I see these things now?

278
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:06,919
Just one word.

279
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,280
Boring.

280
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,000
Bro, have you become dumb

281
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,599
since you started practicing shooting?

282
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,479
Have I?

283
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,280
Do you have to be so deep into the game?

284
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,280
It's all because of
the one who guides me.

285
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,679
Shen Qingyuan?

286
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,039
Well, bro,

287
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,200
now you are also

288
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,559
thinking about a partner on your mind.

289
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,919
That's not what I'm talking about.

290
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,159
I'm talking about a chick.

291
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:36,679
No.

292
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,559
I shouldn't call her

293
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,280
with such a tacky word.

294
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,520
Is there a story?

295
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,039
Come on.

296
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,679
Come on, tell me more.

297
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:44,840
What's going on?

298
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,640
I'm off.

299
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,760
You've just come and you are leaving?

300
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,080
Curfew time.

301
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,719
She's only given me

302
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,719
an hour for some fresh air.

303
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,039
I'm off.

304
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,520
(Du Lingfeng)

305
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,000
Xiaoci.

306
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,479
How can you have

307
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,599
Du Lingfeng as your WeChat contact?

308
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,440
Didn't you agree not to befriend him?

309
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,159
As you know,

310
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,840
we've been playing 2v2 these days.

311
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,719
I have to keep an eye on him.

312
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,280
Be mindful.

313
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,479
Don't lose control of yourself.

314
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,400
I'm going for a shower.

315
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,840
Dr. Ding,

316
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,919
here's my update for you.

317
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,640
I've been practicing rap these days

318
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
and getting on pretty well.

319
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,479
Besides, I found

320
00:16:58,479 --> 00:16:59,640
Shen Qingyuan has become

321
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,599
increasingly softer to me,

322
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,599
and occasionally even very gentle.

323
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,359
Could it be he's remembered something?

324
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,319
Whether or not
he's remembered something,

325
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,199
it's a good sign, isn't it?

326
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,439
Tang Xin, keep it up.

327
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,359
Thank you, Dr. Ding.

328
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,439
I wanted to thank you in person,

329
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,760
but you've been on leave these days.

330
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,680
Also,

331
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,640
is there any disagreement

332
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,239
between you and Mr. Zhou these days?

333
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,160
(Dr. Ding typing…)

334
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:54,479
I'm sorry, Dr. Ding.

335
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,359
Am I talking too much?

336
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,719
I shouldn't have
asked about your privacy.

337
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,719
It's OK.

338
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,359
Nine times out of ten,
disappointing things

339
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,319
happen to us in our lives.

340
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,199
There may be few people
we can confide in.

341
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,239
You'll probably understand this

342
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,959
when you grow up more.

343
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:14,719
Is maturity

344
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,000
such a cruel thing?

345
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,079
But Dr. Ding,

346
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,520
I believe

347
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,160
everything will be fine.

348
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,680
You are right.

349
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,959
But I hope you'll never

350
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,119
get to experience these things.

351
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:38,760
And your Shen Qingyuan.

352
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,000
(Mental Health Assessment Report)

353
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,079
You've recovered pretty well

354
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,040
after this period of therapy.

355
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:50,920
I don't think

356
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
anything will go wrong with you again.

357
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:53,599
Dr. Ding,

358
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,400
thank you for what you did
during this period of time.

359
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:56,959
I might not

360
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,800
be able to hold on till now without you.

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,040
I don't know

362
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,000
if I'll have the chance

363
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,199
to see you again in the coming days.

364
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,719
Of course you will.

365
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,439
No.

366
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,760
I mean

367
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,439
not in a doctor-patient relationship.

368
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,319
Could we

369
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,160
develop it further?

370
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,319
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,359
I have a husband already.

372
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,959
Sorry.

373
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,040
It's OK.

374
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,839
I'm off for now.

375
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,719
OK.

376
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,119
Here you are.

377
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:37,000
Excuse me
for not seeing you to the door.

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,560
(Hubby)

379
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,040
I'd rather not have one.

380
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,599
Don't think nonsense.

381
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,680
Concentrate on your work, Tang Xin.

382
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,199
Are you all right?

383
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,040
Why are you not having that thing on?

384
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,760
What?

385
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:37,400
The head?

386
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,760
Because I'm going to drink some water.

387
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,359
Are you gonna do livestreaming?

388
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,560
Would you like me
to tap the beat for you?

389
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,800
Won't that take up your time for rest?

390
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,920
Come to work in the living room.

391
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,920
I'll tap the beat for you.

392
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,400
I'll begin.

393
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,839
Hey, boy,

394
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,640
never mind
how small the target paper looks,

395
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,000
how far it is from you,

396
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,439
blocking out everything

397
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,640
and leveling the sight bead

398
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,640
is the choice for calming your mind.

399
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,680
I heard that shooters

400
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,199
find faith in guns

401
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:42,119
and their bullets

402
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,079
are always straight linear.

403
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,160
Looking for the destined magnetic field

404
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,680
is something to long for.

405
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,280
(Your Bear: Good rhythm.)

406
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,319
Hello, Tang Xin.

407
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:20,680
Nothing particular.

408
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,439
I'm just a bit uptight.

409
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,959
I'm going to do livestreaming tomorrow.

410
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,719
OK, OK.

411
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:27,520
I see.

412
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,040
Go on with your work.

413
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,719
I'll be waiting for your plan.

414
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:32,239
OK.

Why is she filming the wall?

446
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,119

Can I ask you a question?

452
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,640
Why are you wearing
so many layers these days?

453
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,280
You begin to stammer
as soon as you see me.

454
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:17,119
I wonder if

455
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,599
it is because I'm inadequately clothed,

456
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,439
so I just put on extra layers of clothes

457
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,560
in case your thoughts begin to wander.

458
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,280
I don't daydream.

459
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:30,800
I mean wild imaginations.

460
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,680
Wild.

461
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,640
So you are

462
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,680
wearing extra layers for me?

463
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,599
Thank you.

464
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,560
But

465
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,040
you don't have to wear so many layers.

466
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:48,719
I think

467
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:50,199
it's necessary for us to have a test.

468
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,640
Hasn't she signed off yet?

469
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,239
What are they doing?

470
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,199
I'll begin.

471
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,000
Are you OK?

472
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,880

you brought this on yourself.

480
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,880
Don't blame me.

481
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,719
Hello, sir.

482
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,839
Do you know

483
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,439
someone who can do simple processing

484
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,040
on videos and photos?

485
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,439
I need them tonight.

486
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,560
OK. Thank you, sir.

487
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,680
I'll send them to you now.

488
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,280

489

What…what brings you here?

491
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,439
I'm here…

492
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,800
to bring you the quilt Mom made for you.

493
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:57,760
Didn't you say you'd send a package?

494
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,479
What's the point of sending a package?

495
00:30:58,479 --> 00:30:59,400
If I didn't say that,

496
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,680
how could you

497
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
tell me your address honestly?

498
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,319
Tang Liqi, you've picked up vices.

499
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,760
You've become cunning.

500

I can't help it.

Mom taught me well.

502
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,839
No, no, no.

503
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,520
It's not what you think.

504
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:28,880
Well,

505
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,839
were you guys undressing
while livestreaming?

506
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,119
You've got something.

507
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,239
There are just the three of us.

508
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,319
Is it going to be OK?

509
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,079
It'll be OK.

510
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:57,680
It'll be OK.

511
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,359
Look at you,

512
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,560
I know you usually

513
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,880
react more slowly than others,

514
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,319
but you were

515
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,000
just too daring.

516
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,760
Xin, where is your room?

517
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,880
I'll put the stuff in there for you.

518
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,000
Let me do it.

519
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,160
Thanks.

520
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,599
Xin,

521
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,680
the high-octane scenes have been sent.

522
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,959
There's no use in worrying.

523
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:33,000
Well, why are your…

524
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,560
your glasses

525
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
hanging so low?

526
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,800
I forgot to introduce myself.

527
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,640
Hello, brother-in-law.

528
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,400
I'm Tang Liqi.

529
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:41,640
Tang Xin's younger brother.

530
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:44,520
Hello.

531
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,680
Well…

532
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:48,439
Actually, I am your idol.

533
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,280
No, no.

534
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,680
You are my idol.

535
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,839
A slip of the tongue.

536
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,160
It's OK.

537
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,560
It's a bit embarrassing.

538
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,319
Can't help it.

539
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:10,000
Brother-in-law,

540
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,560
this is a mobile game I'm playing.

541
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:12,760
Let me give you a demo.

542
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,199
Brother-in-law,
you are so good at shooting.

543
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:16,479
You must be an expert

544
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,239
in such shooting games.

545
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,319
Tang Liqi!

546
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,680
He's not your brother-in-law.

547
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,239
Shooting game?

548
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,479
Nowadays we are in the e-game area.

549
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:26,040
It's called first-person shooting game.

550
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,199
It's super-duper.

551
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,520
Tang Liqi.

552
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,199
Stop your demo.

553
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,280
He…he doesn't know how to play.

554
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,239
Brother-in-law, are you not interested?

555
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:36,479
I don't usually play these games.

556
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,400
Prince Charming of Marksmanship.

557
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,119
Got it.

558
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,359
It shouldn't be the case though.

559
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,079
Do you play no games at all?

560
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,880
It's OK.

561
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,079
Let me tell you,

562
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,319
- this AK is super powerful.
- Tang Liqi.

563
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,000
It's more powerful than M4.

564
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,160
- I picked up an AK…
- Tang Liqi!

565
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,199
How long are you staying?

566
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,040
I…

567
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:00,040
Right.

568
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,839
I've got to go.

569
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,000
The anime I'm following

570
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,800
is about to be updated

571
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,640
in 30 or 40 minutes.

572
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,000
I really can't spend time with you guys.

573
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,280
I'll take a tangerine.

574
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,959
Bye, brother-in-law.

575
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:12,719
Xin.

576
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,879
I can solve

577
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,000
livestreaming problems for you,

578
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,959
but only limited to the computer

579
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,159
and internet area.

580
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,320
I really have no idea of other areas.

581
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,520
I see. Get out of here quickly.

582
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,560
OK, OK, OK.

583
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,239
Be safe on the way.

584
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,320
I will, I will, I will.

585
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,399
Brother-in-law.

586
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,760
Bye.

587
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,520
Bye.

588
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,919
Good…

589
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,479
Good night.

590
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,360
Morning.

591
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,320
Morning.

592
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,120
Morning.

593
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,320
Morning.

594
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,360
Xin.

595
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,159
Morning.

596
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,600
Morning.

597
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,080
Morning.

598
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:16,679
Lizi,

599
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,199
why does everybody look weird

600
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,000
as if they don't want to talk to me?

601
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,199
Tang Xin,

602
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,840
why are you so careless?

603
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,840
Don't you know our company outright bans

604
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,159
livestreaming on an alternative account?

605
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:29,520
Now you are in trouble.

606
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,120
Ai has reported you.

607
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,840
I didn't use public resources.

608
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,320
And I was only entertaining myself.

609
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,320
Why did Ai report me?

610
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:44,879
How did she know

611
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,280
I was doing livestreaming
on an alternative account?

612
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:48,719
Don't worry so much.

613
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,600
Your top priority of the moment is

614
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,080
is to explain to Mr. Zhou.

615
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,879
To beg for mercy.

616
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,680
Well, it needs to be revised here.

617
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,679
Mr. Zhou.

618
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,280
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

619
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,520
I was indeed doing livestreaming

620
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,439
on my alternative account,

621
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,479
but I didn't do any publicity

622
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,520
in the company's name,

623
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,120
still less seek personal gain.

624
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Tell me your story.

625
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,120
Why did you open an alternative account?

626
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:35,360
I was doing it…

627
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,639
under the force of circumstances.

628
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:41,600
What was the force of circumstances?

629
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:45,600
Tang Xin,

630
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,399
I actually found out about it

631
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:48,639
in the shooting hall the other day,

632
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,800
but I was afraid that…

633
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,360
so I dared not speak out.

634
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,600
Do you find yourself
unable to speak properly

635
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,199
facing Shen Qingyuan?

636
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:01,080
Mr. Zhou,

637
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,399
I do find myself stammer

638
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,280
when talking to Shen Qingyuan,

639
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:06,439
but I've found a way of

640
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:07,439
doing livestream and giving commentaries

641
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:08,560
through rapping.

642
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,399
I don't stammer at all.

643
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,280
And it goes well with
the rhythm of the game.

644
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,879
Yesterday, I was using
an alternative account

645
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:15,560
to do an experiment,

646
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,320
and found it worked well.

647
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,439
I was thinking of

648
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,679
talking to you about it today.

649
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,760
It's all my fault.

650
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:27,959
I was too hasty

651
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,520
and too eager to defend Mr. Zhou

652
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,360
and Rui Live.

653
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,399
I didn't expect Tang Xin

654
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:32,280
was working out a way

655
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,479
to solve her stammer problem.

656
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,280
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

657
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,919
I was too impulsive.

658
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,159
I caused a misunderstanding.

659
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,479
You did the right thing.

660
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,199
It's you to blame.

661
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,040
Why didn't you

662
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,280
tell me earlier that you stammer?

663
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:46,679
How can stammer be overcome so quickly

664
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,520
by practicing?

665
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:51,040
Even rap livestreaming.

666
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,159
No.

667
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,199
It's neither serious nor fitting.

668
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:57,959
No, no.

669
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,360
Tang Xin,

670
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,800
this issue can be either big

671
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,600
or small.

672
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,439
Either

673
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:06,679
you cure your stammer quickly

674
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,120
or give me a new plan,

675
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
otherwise there's nothing I can do.

676
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,000
Mr. Zhou,

677
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,120
please don't be angry.

678
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,439
I think Tang Xin

679
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,040
must have her own inconveniences.

680
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,760
But in order to avoid suspicion,

681
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,439
I think

682
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:32,959
it's better
to have the alternative account deleted.

683
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,719
Let's go on.

684
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,239
Xin,

685
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,679
were you doing the livestream
on an alternative account?

686
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:49,080
When

687
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,040
did you start stammering?

00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,719
A few days ago.

689
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,000
You really make me worry.

690
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,320
Don't be disrespectful to your senior.

691
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,040
I'm not stammering on purpose.

692
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:06,760
What's going on, Tang Xin?

693
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,919
Ai didn't get to see you
when she came just now.

694
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:08,879
She asked me to pass the word to you

695
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,239
that Mr. Zhou reminds you

696
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,800
to delete the live room
on your alternative account.

697
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:14,679
Mr. Zhou said no to rap livestreaming.
