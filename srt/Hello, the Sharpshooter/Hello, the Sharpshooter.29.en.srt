=Hello, The Sharpshooter=

=Episode 29=

35
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,120
Hello.

36
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,870
Mr. Du, bad news.

37
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,870
Your father had a car accident!

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,310
What?

39
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,040
Car accident?

40
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,400
(Complex building)

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,510
Thank you, Tang Xin.

42
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,630
I'm not going to the ward.

43
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,480
With you around,

44
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,680
he will sleep soundly.

45
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,160
If there's any problem,

46
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
don't hesitate to tell me.

47
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,400
I can give you some advice.

48
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,400
Xiaoci,

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,120
I have something to ask you.

50
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,950
Do you know

51
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,000
Shen Qingyuan sometimes
sleeps under the bed?

52
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,310
Under the bed?

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,030
Why? What's wrong with him?

54
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,000
When he's stressed out,

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,360
he gets unsettled.

56
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,670
Sleeping under the bed
makes him comfortable.

57
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
I'm not aware.

58
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,440
You can ask Dr. Ding.

59
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,000
I hear

60
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,550
she has a part-time job there

61
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,440
only because Shen Qingyuan is

62
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,800
on the shooting team.

63
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,390
What happened to you two?

64
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,880
I've got a bad feeling.

65
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,470
I can't tell it.

66
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,630
Maybe I'm just too sensitive.

67
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,910
Don't worry.

68
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,080
He'll be all right.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If anything happens,

70
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,390
let us know in time.

71
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,110
Last night,

72
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,240
it was thundering and raining.

73
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,960
When I went to close the window,

74
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,240
suddenly,

75
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,000
some images came into my mind.

76
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,550
I couldn't breathe.

77
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,800
Are Shen Qingyuan's memories...?

78
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,670
Why don't you eat?

79
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:17,880
Nothing.

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,160
When I was walking,

81
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,110
something occurred to me.

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Did you

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
take part in a competition

84
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,000
named Lucky Seven?

85
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,550
What's wrong with Player No. 7?

86
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,830
Is he

87
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,510
going to give up?

88
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:43,830
No.

89
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,230
He's avoiding the surroundings, I guess.

90
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,670
You mean the championship?

91
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,200
It indeed existed.

92
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,000
Do you remember

93
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,510
why it was named Lucky Seven?

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,390
I was standing on Platform No. 7.

95
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,200
Do you remember

96
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,720
who cheered for you

97
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,640
in the auditorium?

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,640
A lot of people were there.

99
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,830
I didn't know them.

100
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,510
Did you hear someone yell

101
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,720
"I support Player No. 7"?

102
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,670
I support Player No. 7!

103
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,480
Double lucky number seven.

104
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,640
We can see

105
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,480
this player is

106
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
on Platform No.7.

107
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,920
And the girl cheering for him

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,720
in the auditorium

109
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,200
has a seven on her hoodie, too.

110
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:52,920
Well,

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,550
let's wait and see.

112
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,550
At such a decisive moment,

113
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,640
will this girl

114
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,270
be his Luck Fairy?

115
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,440
I didn't notice that.

116
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,000
Have some broccoli.

117
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Then do you remember

118
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,550
that you had a car accident?

119
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,600
How do you know I had a car accident?

120
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,920
I heard about it.

121
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,830
It was a small accident.

122
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,720
Nothing was serious.

123
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,920
What do you want to know?

124
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,320
The vision...

125
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,550
The vision surgery you talked about...

126
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,200
I had the successful vision surgery

127
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,640
after the car accident.

128
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,110
Do you remember

129
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,320
when you first met me?

130
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,040
When I first met you,

131
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,390
you accosted me.

132
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,160
At that time,

133
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,320
you pretended that you knew me.

134
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,070
Eat. The dishes are getting cold.

135
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,920
It seems to me

136
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,950
that Du Lingfeng is also insecure.

137
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,510
Otherwise,

138
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,510
he wouldn't get so agitated

139
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,880
on the day of the assessment.

140
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,720
He was totally not himself.

141
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,760
Fortunately, I didn't hurt too much.

142
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,790
Dad,

143
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,520
what happened?

144
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,030
Mr. Du.

145
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,230
Mr. Du,

146
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,710
- take a good rest.
- All right.

147
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,670
Thank you, Liu.

148
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,280
You're welcome.

149
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,150
Why did you come back?

150
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,320
Your assistant told me

151
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,230
that you had a car accident.

152
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,030
How are you now?

153
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,910
Are you seriously injured?

154
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,400
Not really.

155
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,400
When you

156
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,670
suddenly care for me,

157
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,350
I'm not

158
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,710
very used to it.

159
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,150
I'm not seriously injured.

160
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,840
But to me,

161
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,590
I've had a rebirth.

162
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,110
Did you have a car accident

163
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,030
or a renascence?

164
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,350
What a son!

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Be serious.

166
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,110
Come on.

167
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,230
Sit down and talk with me.

168
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,320
Fine.

169
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,840
Let's talk, then.

170
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,320
I know you want to discuss with me

171
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,640
about shortening the gamble.

172
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,760
You know what?

173
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,790
I don't agree.

174
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,400
Am I that kind of guy?

175
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,280
I'm just considering

176
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,280
if I should cancel

177
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,520
our agreement.

178
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,080
What?

179
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,640
Do you think we're playing house?

180
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,550
We're not?

181
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,670
You promised

182
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,670
to find an advertising endorser
for our group.

183
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,550
What happened then?

184
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,760
You became the advertising endorser.

185
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,880
Don't tell me

186
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,030
it's a gamble

187
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,110
you risked your life and honor for.

188
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,150
Such are hot-blooded dialogues
in comics.

189
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,590
You'd better not say any of them.

190
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,110
I'm just trying a new way.

191
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,710
Besides,

192
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,840
the result hasn't come out yet.

193
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,550
We don't know

194
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,400
how it'll end up.

195
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,400
What do you want, Dad?

196
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,230
You want me to go back to work?

197
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,320
Son,

198
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,640
I've decided to give up

199
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,030
the gamble between us.

200
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,880
I won't force you

201
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,910
to take over the company, either.

202
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,550
You decide

203
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
what kind of life you live.

204
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,880
No one knows

205
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,910
which will come first,

206
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
tomorrow or accident.

207
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:19,960
Dr. Ding,

208
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,520
are you in the base?

209
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I want to talk with you.

210
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,760
All right.

211
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,280
Come to me this afternoon.

212
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,590
Shen Qingyuan,

213
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,520
I bought some fruit for you.

214
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,760
Later,

215
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,230
I'm going back to the base.

216
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,200
But I'll be back soon.

217
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay.

218
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,790
Time for me to go out
for some fresh air.

219
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,790
You're going with me?

220
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,790
No way.

221
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,110
Stay in the ward.

222
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,280
I'll be back after the business.

223
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,590
How long will you be away?

224
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,670
You have one hour.

225
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,400
It even takes more than one hour

226
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,710
to go and come back.

227
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,710
Fine, then.

228
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,910
You have one and a half hours,

229
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,880
starting from now.

230
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,880
Don't start at the timer.

231
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,150
Or you'll suffer.

232
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,880
If you come back early,

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I won't suffer.

234
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,550
Shen Qingyuan,

235
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,910
you're a shooter.

236
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,880
It's important for you

237
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,150
to be modest and patient.

238
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,520
How about this?

239
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,000
When I'm away,

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,280
stay here

241
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,760
and remove the seeds

242
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,590
from the pitaya.

243
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,910
You like to eat pitaya?

244
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,230
Without seeds.

245
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,470
It tastes clean.

246
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,760
Give me a toothpick.

247
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
You're so nice to me now.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But why did you

249
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,230
forget me so easily?

250
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,470
You're saying

251
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,670
Shen Qingyuan's memories are recovering?

252
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,110
Not completely,

253
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,150
but he's recalling things.

254
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,670
The other day in the hospital,

255
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,230
he recalled some scenes

256
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,880
about the car accident.

257
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,590
- Here. Have some water.
- Thank you.

258
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,960
Tang Xin,

259
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,840
Shen Qingyuan and you

260
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,670
may have the same problem.

261
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,790
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

262
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,110
But we have

263
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,470
totally different symptoms.

264
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,880
Nearly all disorders

265
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,550
related to traumatic stress

266
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,790
generally have

267
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,840
a psychobiological symptom.

268
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,840
Positive symptom
of psychological separation

269
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,960
makes the patient

270
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,960
experience the traumatic case.

271
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,880
It's intrusive reproduction.

272
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,670
Negative symptom

273
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,910
of psychological separation

274
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,110
makes the patient

275
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,640
avoid any stimulation

276
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,670
that can trigger traumatic memories.

277
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,200
It's psychogenic amnesia.

278
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,150
I mentioned it to you before.

279
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,150
Tang Xin,

280
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,880
you should be mentally prepared.

281
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,110
Why did he

282
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,520
totally forget you?

283
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,670
I guess the reason

284
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,960
can possibly be

285
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,400
his cure.

286
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,030
Are you saying

287
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,550
the lost memories mean something

288
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,640
to him?

289
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,910
Let me put it this away.

290
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,320
If a man loses all the memories

291
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,200
about the old days,

292
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,590
he has generalized amnesia

293
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,670
in psychologic terms.

294
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,440
The most common case is

295
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,080
the selective amnesia

296
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,350
that Shen Qingyuan has.

297
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:48,790
Actually,

298
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,910
he only removed a spot

299
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,320
from his memories.

300
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,000
So, I'm the spot?

301
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,520
You may well say so.

302
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,670
But you mentioned

303
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,640
that he was behaving strangely.

304
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,400
I agree with you

305
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,760
that he's likely

306
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,230
to have started to restore his memories.

307
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,640
So now, you have two options.

308
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,110
What are they?

309
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,200
Face it

310
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,590
by stimulating his recovery

311
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,910
or benumb him

312
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,400
by making him forget the past forever.

313
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,710
Either option

314
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,350
can be risky.

315
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,520
Have you thought

316
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,710
that maybe the car accident

317
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,030
had something to do with you?

318
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,710
Dr. Ding,

319
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,590
could you confirm

320
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,150
when the car accident happened?

321
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,590
Fine.

322
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,280
I'll try to confirm it.

323
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,080
Thank you, Dr. Ding.

324
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,840
I'll take my leave.

325
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,150
Either option

326
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,910
can be risky.

327
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,400
I don't care.

328
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Today, I just want them

329
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,280
to judge the case.

330
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,350
It's no big deal.

331
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,670
Why do you bother to come?

332
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,910
If they don't judge the case,

333
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,150
you shall take care

334
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,110
of your fruit for the future.

335
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,840
I won't take care of it anymore.

336
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Fine. Let's do it.

337
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,150
Let's do it.

338
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,670
Cool man,

339
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,320
where's your girlfriend?

340
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,000
She's away.

341
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,710
Look, his girlfriend is away.

342
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,430
Let's get back.

343
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,710
No way!

344
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,640
You want to cut it widthways, huh?

345
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,430
Let me ask you.

346
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,400
Will you cut it widthways or vertically?

347
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,190
It's not that I don't allow you
to cut it vertically,

348
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,000
but it's just not sensible.

349
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,640
Cool man,

350
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,680
judge it for us.

351
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,040
According to netizens,

352
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,590
it's easier to control seeds
of watermelons pieces

353
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,190
that are cut widthways.

354
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,000
Why?

355
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,950
Because seeds

356
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,230
usually grow in a straight column

357
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,590
along the lines.

358
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,350
If we cut it widthways,

359
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,070
the seeds

360
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,310
will be on the cross-section.

361
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,400
Then,

362
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,950
we can remove the seeds easily

363
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,190
with something like chopsticks

364
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,680
and make it a watermelon

365
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,950
without seeds.

366
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,110
It's quite easy to eat like that.

367
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,880
Don't you think so?

368
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,110
You always believe

369
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,800
the netizens.

370
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,760
They always make sense.

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,310
But will they
cut the watermelon for you?

372
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,880
Will they remove the seeds for you?

373
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,920
I just feel sorry

374
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,350
for your exhaustion
with removing the seeds.

375
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,040
You feel sorry for me?

376
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,000
But I care for you, too.

377
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,710
Do you know

378
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,000
the ends of the watermelon

379
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,430
taste different?

380
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,160
Some pieces are sweet.

381
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,710
Some pieces are mild.

382
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,520
You may get mild pieces
if I cut the melon widthways.

383
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,590
But if I cut it vertically,

384
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,950
you won't have

385
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,110
the tasteless pieces.

386
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,280
I know you're picky.

387
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,640
I don't want you to throw it away
if it doesn't taste good.

388
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,560
It'll be a big waste.

389
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,000
Thank you, honey.

390
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,830
Cool man,

391
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,110
I'm more reasonable,

392
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,160
right?

393
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,520
I... I don't know.

394
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,430
I'm removing the seeds of pitaya

395
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,520
for my girl Tang Xin.

396
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,710
Removed the seeds of pitaya?

397
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,040
You removed these seeds?

398
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,880
Cut it vertically!

399
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,800
Fine, then.

400
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,710
We must cut it vertically!

401
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,590
That's more like it.

402
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,710
We'll only buy watermelons,

403
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,520
instead of pitayas.

404
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,310
We should have been doing this.

405
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,920
It's been quite a long time.

406
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,760
Wait.

407
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,920
Why did you come out alone?

408
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,230
I want to go to the toilet.

409
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,590
All facilities are available

410
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,560
in your private ward.

411
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,230
Stop running about.

412
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,190
Or it'll influence your recovery.

413
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,560
Get back.

414
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,400
Let me hold you.

415
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,710
Come on.

416
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,040
Be careful.

417
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,160
Patient in Bed No. 16,

418
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,110
why are you out?

419
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,680
You mustn't walk around.

420
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:15,800
Go.

421
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,430
Go back to your ward with me.

422
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,480
(Beds 15-17)

423
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,760
Patient in Bed No. 16?

424
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,760
Where are you going?

425
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,190
Your leg is hurt

426
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,350
and you mustn't walk around.

427
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,110
Don't you know?

428
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,230
Go. Get back with me.

429
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,520
Go.

430
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,800
Something's wrong
with the handsome man in Bed No. 16.

431
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,430
Is he getting too bored?

432
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,190
You're right.

433
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,800
An athlete is always full of vitality.

434
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,800
Perhaps,

435
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,110
he isn't used to staying in bed.

436
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,110
Let's keep a closer eye on him.

437
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,040
Okay.

438
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,190
Patient in Bed No. 16,

439
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,040
where are you going?

440
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,950
Next door.

441
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,310
Fine.

442
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,000
Come on in.

443
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,680
Get the drug list

444
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,560
and check it with me.

445
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,000
Okay.

446
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,470
Look.

447
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,310
Min,

448
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,430
give me the medical record
of the patient in Bed No. 16.

449
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,110
All right, Director.

450
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,110
Okay. Goodbye.

451
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,710
It's his medical record.

452
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,230
Yes.

453
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,470
I'll go check on him.

454
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,230
Nurse,

455
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,760
I want to ask

456
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,190
about my boyfriend's condition.

457
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,400
Why are you in the wheelchair?

458
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,110
Doctor.

459
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,950
Come on.

460
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,430
Hurry. Hurry.

461
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,280
What's going on?

462
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,680
My head hurts. It hurts.

463
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:16,920
Your head hurts?

464
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,920
Let me check.

465
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,590
Is it...? Is it bleeding?

466
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,110
It hurts. It hurts a lot.

467
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,110
- Is it...? Is it bleeding?
- No, no, no.

468
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,760
You're all right.

469
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,350
- You must trust the doctor.
- He...

470
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,000
He keeps having a headache.

471
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,310
Is he brain-damaged?

472
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,470
He keeps saying his head hurts.

473
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,830
Is he having an aftereffect?

474
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,920
Nurse, save him.

475
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,280
Don't touch it. Don't touch it!

476
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,310
If he's brain-damaged,

477
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,110
I...

478
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,950
Miss, Miss.

479
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,230
Don't worry. He won't be brain-damaged.

480
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,680
Rest assured, Miss.

481
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,830
Finished your work?

482
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,640
I'm sorry.

483
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,400
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

484
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,430
Not really.

485
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,110
Let's go have lunch.

486
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,560
Fine. What would you like to eat?

487
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,280
Don't worry about that.

488
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,470
I'll try my best to help him.

489
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,190
By the way,

490
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,430
I usually work

491
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,830
at Haiya Hospital.

492
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,350
If you need anything,

493
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,710
come to me at any time.

494
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,760
Let's go. Get in the car.

495
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,280
Okay.

496
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,430
Ding Fang!

497
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,710
What?

498
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,190
Sir?

499
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,350
- Let go of her!
- What are you doing, Zhou Zuguang?

500
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,070
Zhou Zuguang!

501
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,590
What are you doing?

502
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,520
Is this the new start

503
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,640
you talked about?

504
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,110
Come on.

505
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,190
What's wrong with you?

506
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,830
You!

507
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,040
Ding Fang,

508
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,830
we haven't divorced yet.

509
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,230
But you're already

510
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,070
talking and laughing with another man.

511
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,590
Have you considered my feelings?

512
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,800
Then let's get divorced quickly.

513
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,400
Zhou Zuguang,

514
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,430
our marriage

515
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,800
existed in name only long ago.

516
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,350
I don't know what you're waiting for.

517
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,590
Even if it exists in name only,

518
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,070
you're still my wife!

519
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,470
I won't be it soon.

520
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,760
Zhou Zuguang,

521
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,760
how do you have the nerve
to question me?

522
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,000
Don't you remember

523
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,760
who ruined

524
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,430
our relationship?

525
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,680
We're in such a condition

526
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,190
all because of you.

527
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,470
We've split up for over two years.

528
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,950
So, no matter what I'm doing

529
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,830
at the moment,

530
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,070
you're not qualified to interfere.

531
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,560
Let's go.

532
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,880
Do you think

533
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,400
it is good

534
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,560
when he doesn't remember it?

535
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,710
Or

536
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,710
should I make him
get back his memories?

537
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,880
But...

538
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,430
I really don't know what to do.

539
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,040
If he recalls something

540
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,110
that I can't accept,

541
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,000
I don't know what to do, either.

542
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,760
And if he isn't

543
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,880
as nice to me as he is now,

544
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,160
shall I keep him the way he is?

545
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,280
Theoretically,

546
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
I should go back now

547
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,230
and take good care of him

548
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,520
instead of stimulating him
to restore his memories.

549
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,310
But...

550
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,230
But I can't help

551
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,280
trying to figure out the truth.

552
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,590
So, you prefer talking to a hedgehog

553
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,470
to talking to me?

554
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,830
Why are you here?

555
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,470
How...?

556
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,920
How's your leg?

557
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,710
You're late.

558
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,430
You should have been back
in one and a half hours.

559
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,160
But you didn't come back.

560
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,760
Zhou,

561
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,880
have you noticed something?

562
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,310
Since Captain Shen left,

563
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,590
the smell of the air

564
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,280
has even changed.

565
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,310
No.

566
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,520
I don't feel any change.

567
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
Silly boy.

568
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,000
There's no longer

569
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,920
the smell of love.

570
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,950
The air is fresh now.

571
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,430
It's the smell of straightforward men

572
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,160
without being polluted.

573
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,760
- Xiaoci.
- Xiaoci.

574
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,590
Why are you here alone?

575
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,430
What about the others?

576
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,350
They're getting changed.

577
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,280
Captain Shen is in hospital.

578
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,520
So is Du Lingfeng's father.

579
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,430
Besides, it's natural
that Du Lingfeng doesn't come.

580
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,040
Oh, Xiaoci.

581
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,160
Why do you look haggard?

582
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,230
Me?

583
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,950
I don't.

584
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,920
I'll take my leave.

585
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,230
Xiaoci,

586
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,230
on my way here,

587
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,430
I saw Du Lingfeng's car

588
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,680
in the parking lot.

589
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,430
I guess

590
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,710
he's back from the hospital.

591
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:02,950
Thanks.

592
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,110
Zhou,

593
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,430
I guess the smell of love

594
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
will come back.

595
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,230
Shen Qingyuan, do you have any idea?

596
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,160
You're having a recuperation.

597
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
You mustn't walk around.

598
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,560
What if your wound cracks?

599
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,590
What if it influences

600
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,640
your shooting career?

601
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,190
Do you want me to feel guilty?

602
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,000
Don't get angry.

603
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
I wanted to see you,

604
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,590
regardless of anything.

605
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,430
You keep asking me to promise you

606
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,350
a lot of things.

607
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,310
What about your promise?

608
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,000
You promised that you wouldn't

609
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,040
try to hurt yourself again.

610
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm sorry.

611
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,430
I was wrong.

612
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,070
You should apologize to yourself.

613
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,230
Shen Qingyuan, sorry.

614
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,800
All right.

615
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,640
Even if you're angry,

616
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,830
don't catch a cold.

617
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,310
Here.

618
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,560
Shen Qingyuan,

619
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,560
could you stop

620
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,710
being so nice to me?

621
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,830
Why?

622
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,950
Looks like he didn't hear me.

623
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,470
Nothing.

624
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,400
I visited Dr. Ding just now.

625
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,350
Then I came to see the little hedgehog.

626
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,800
Why did it vomit?

627
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,230
Vomit?

628
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,680
(Locker Room)

629
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,070
Xiaoci.

630
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,680
- Xiaoci.
- Sorry.

631
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,470
Sorry to disturb you.

632
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

633
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,920
Sorry, I got the wrong guy.

634
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,520
What do you want?

635
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,310
Sorry.

636
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,430
What a coincidence!

637
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,640
So it is.

638
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,400
Why are you so serious today?

639
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,520
Nothing.

640
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,920
I just want to keep fit.

641
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,310
Keep fit?

642
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,520
Why do you suddenly do that?

643
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,640
Are you planning something?

644
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,640
I hear your father...

645
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,350
My father is all right.

646
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,710
I just start the regimen.

647
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,310
Regimen?

648
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,430
Isn't it inappropriate

649
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
to start it so early?

650
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,880
We don't know

651
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,520
if something is appropriate

652
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,470
after we experience it.

653
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,560
Du Lingfeng,

654
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,310
I came for you today.

655
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,560
Are you so narrow-minded

656
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,430
that you get angry?

657
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,560
- In the assessment...
- Xiaoci,

658
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,070
you don't need to explain.

659
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,830
I understand.

660
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,760
We won't be together.

661
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,400
You can go on adoring Shen Qingyuan.

662
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,280
He's more excellent, after all.

663
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,590
Be careful. Come on.

664
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,800
Did you call the taxi?

665
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,560
Yes, sir.

666
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,350
Get in.

667
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,070
Sir,

668
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,520
to the nearest animal hospital, please.

669
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,070
Okay.

670
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,430
No.

671
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,800
You should get back to the hospital.

672
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,640
Sir,

673
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,040
to the...

674
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,520
I want to go with you.

675
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,070
But your leg...

676
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,230
It's all right.

677
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,710
I promise I won't move.

678
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,000
Here we go, sir.

679
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,680
Okay.

680
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,200
(Puppy Town Love Animal Hospital)

681
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,190
What's its name?

682
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,920
Name?

683
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,470
Actually, it's...

684
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,520
Its name is Jujube.

685
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,110
Right.

686
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,230
Its name is Jujube.

687
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,800
So far, it looks like

688
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,830
Jujube is all right.

689
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,070
It's also lucky.

690
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,000
After roaming for such a long time,

691
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,470
it hasn't had any parasites.

692
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,400
Roaming?

693
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,000
Was it abandoned?

694
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,710
It's a kind of mini hedgehog

695
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,520
from Africa.

696
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,040
It isn't a native species.

697
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,350
Many people buy it

698
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,280
as a pet.

699
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,310
It was abandoned, I guess.

700
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,350
It has suffered.

701
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,230
It's hard for it
to get through the winter.

702
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,190
Doctor,

703
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,520
it just vomited.

704
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,880
Looks like it's seriously sick.

705
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,640
Did it vomit white foam?

706
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,400
It's not sick.

707
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,520
Vomiting is a special behavior

708
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,400
of hedgehogs,

709
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,430
collecting smells.

710
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,310
Collecting smells?

711
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:56,830
Right.

712
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,640
When a hedgehog wants to build

713
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,950
a long and stable relationship with you,

714
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,710
it collects smells.

715
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,830
To put it simply,

716
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,280
it applied its saliva

717
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
on you.

718
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,070
After mixing it with your smell,

719
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,280
it gets it back again.

720
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:09,880
How about this?

721
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,590
I'll give it a routine blood test

722
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,590
and infectious disease test.

723
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,230
Be careful.

724
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,400
Collecting smells?

725
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,230
Jujube?

726
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,040
Why did you give it

727
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,430
such a lovely name?

728
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,310
You love crisp jujubes, don't you?

729
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,310
Unexpectedly,

730
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,710
a little hedgehog

731
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,640
collected smells of me.

732
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,950
It has a name now.

733
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,350
Jujube.

734
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,000
Jujube, good boy.

735
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,590
Is it something

736
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,110
like the pheromone?

737
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,110
Yes, I guess.

738
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,070
But its pheromone isn't

739
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,160
one-on-one.

740
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
After settling Jujube,

741
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,350
let's get back to the hospital.

742
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,950
When you're in hospital,

743
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,360
I want someone else to take care of it.

744
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,760
Or I can't help worrying.

745
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:21,520
Xiaoci,

746
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,950
I'm in a bad mood now.

747
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,600
Leave me alone, will you?

748
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,360
Du Lingfeng.

749
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,870
Du Lingfeng, come back!

750
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,120
Xiaoci,

751
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,360
what happened?

752
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,800
He's out of his mind.

753
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,630
Did he quarrel with you?

754
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,430
I would rather he quarreled with me.

755
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,760
He didn't quarrel with you?

756
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,840
Then why are you so angry?

757
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,870
He suddenly doesn't speak to me.

758
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,910
Wait a minute for me.

759
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,600
Come. Come over.

760
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:52,600
What happened?

761
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,390
Tell me about it.

762
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,080
I had planned
to confess my feelings to him today.

763
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,760
I don't know why,

764
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,470
but he's been very depressed lately.

765
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,040
He doesn't come for training at all.

766
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,000
Today,

767
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,080
he finally came.

768
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,910
But he didn't speak to me

769
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,000
and left me all alone.

770
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,800
He even asked me to adore Shen Qingyuan.

771
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,670
- No way!
- No way!

772
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,040
I have a girlfriend now.

773
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,560
Is there a misunderstanding?

774
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,120
What misunderstanding can there be?

775
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,190
I...

776
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,080
I don't even have a chance to tell him

777
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,390
that I like him.

778
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,560
All right. Don't be angry.

779
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,280
Don't worry.

780
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,670
I'll make him speak to you.

781
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,870
You will?

782
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,390
I count on you, then.

783
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,080
Rest assured. Leave it to me.

784
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,430
So that you won't get my boyfriend.

785
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,670
Fine.

786
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,080
I trust you.

787
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,360
You're my girlfriend.

788
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,390
You are having

789
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,800
quite a happy life.

790
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,910
So, is it better

791
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,670
to keep it this way?

792
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,120
Xiaoci.

793
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,000
Do me a favor.

794
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,190
What?

795
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,910
Before you help me out,

796
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,520
you want me to repay you already?

797
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,600
The hedgehog?

798
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,760
Fine. No problem.

799
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,800
I'll give it enough to eat.

800
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,360
Thank you, then.

801
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,320
Will you really help her?

802
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,280
Sure.

803
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,080
But you haven't helped me yet.

804
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,520
Your Majesty,

805
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,150
I'm going to serve you immediately.

806
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,080
Why did you go out again?

807
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,120
I took a walk with him.

808
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,670
Get back to the ward.

809
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,000
Don't run out anymore.

810
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,040
Slow down.

811
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,120
Be careful.

812
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,910
Be... Be careful.

813
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,910
Be careful. Be careful.

814
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,230
Let me check on your leg.

815
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,320
According to the doctor,

816
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,000
it may be more swollen.

817
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,390
Does it hurt?

818
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,910
It's indeed more swollen.

819
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,560
It's... It's your illusion.

820
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,230
How about this?

821
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,470
I'll go get some hot water

822
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,360
for your foot bath.

823
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,120
If you feel sleepy before I'm back,

824
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,950
get to sleep.

825
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,360
I'm not sleepy.

826
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,520
You have to sleep, too.

827
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,760
Otherwise, you have nothing to do

828
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,600
when staying in the ward.

829
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,390
That's not right.

830
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,120
We have a lot of things

831
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,000
to do.

832
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,870
Don't blow your mind.

833
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,760
What...? What?

834
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,800
My leg hurts.

835
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,120
Give me a hug.

836
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,670
Fine, fine.

837
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,670
If you're sleepy, get to sleep.

838
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,800
Come back quickly.

839
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,880
(Nurse Station)

840
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,390
Nurse,

841
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,190
is there a power failure?

842
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,430
Not in the main building.

843
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,630
There's one
in the inpatient department.

844
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,390
It's being fixed.

845
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,040
Just a minute.

846
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,710
Who?

847
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,870
At last, we're out.

848
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,800
I was freaked out.

849
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,120
What a bad idea you had!

850
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,390
Walking in the quit
in case of dispersing?

851
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,430
What did you come for?

852
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,600
We're scared!

853
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,910
So, we came here

854
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,080
to seek reliance.

855
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,760
What are you yelling at?

856
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,950
You're the loudest.

857
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,670
Is it a power failure or a ghost movie?

858
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,520
We're afraid of the dark!

859
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,390
Don't you live next door?

860
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,320
This is Room 215.

861
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,670
Come on.

862
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,840
Why did you come to another ward
during the power failure?

863
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,630
Don't make trouble.

864
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,360
Get back to your own ward.

865
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,430
Don't. Don't.

866
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,230
Before the power restoration,

867
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,430
we prefer to stay here.

868
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,470
No way!

869
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,670
I'll give you a torch.

870
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,430
Get back to your ward.

871
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,280
Or you will

872
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,710
disturb other patients.

873
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,430
Fine. We'll get back.

874
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,390
Go back to your ward

875
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,230
and stay there obediently.

876
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,080
Don't run about.

877
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,080
Just go.

878
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,000
Don't run about anymore.

879
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,470
Fine.

880
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,230
Be quick.

881
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,950
Babe, let's get back.

882
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,520
Get going.

883
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,520
I'll shine the torch for you.

884
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,840
- Bye-bye.
- We're leaving, then.

885
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,760
Go, go, go.

886
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,600
Hurry, hurry.

887
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,600
Don't run about anymore.

888
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,910
Shen Qingyuan.

889
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,710
Shen Qingyuan.

890
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,190
Tang Xin?

891
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,600
Here I am.

892
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,360
Luckily, you're all right.

893
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,040
Shen Qingyuan,

894
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,600
are you all right?

895
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,630
