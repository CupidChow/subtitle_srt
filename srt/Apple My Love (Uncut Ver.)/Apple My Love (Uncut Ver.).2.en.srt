00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
The series is not based on a true story, individuals, places,
or organizations.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,420
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:25,970
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish you all the best.. all those great things you wish for

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:34,400
I wanna be that person of your dream, get close to you,

5
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,710
and stay with you all the way.

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,240
If our feelings are mutual, could I be your boo?”

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,440
Could I be your boo?

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,320
Could I be your boo?

9
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,700
Will she survive from the situation?

10
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,970
I think she won’t.

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,440
Hello, everyone.

12
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,020
Hello.

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,360
I’d better get prepared upstairs.

14
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,300
Gosh, I think we all

15
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,390
Kris is getting downhearted.

16
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,400
I told you when Karn gets angry, no one can handle her.

17
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,810
Shall we find a new host now?

18
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,120
We can’t afford to hire a new one. Who will you hire?

19
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,650
How about influencers?

20
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,050
With such a shoestring budget, you’re still so picky.

21
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,960
Or should we become the hosts ourselves?

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,960
Nah.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
Nope. You’re being silly.

24
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,000
Huh, what should we do then?

25
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,140
I have an idea.

26
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,280
Yay!

27
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:58,960
Karn.

28
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,360
Hi.

29
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,410
Please have a seat,

30
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,150
Wahoo!

31
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,150
Let’s get wild today.

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,560
Yahoo! Come on, everyone.

33
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,560
Cheers.

34
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,090
That’s Kris. Kris’s here.

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,610
Come and join us, my sister.

36
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,150
Is this your good idea?

37
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,510
Can I have this?

38
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,950
I don’t drink, Karn.

39
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,340
You chicken.

40
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,340
Well,

41
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
I’d like to apologize to you

42
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,920
for making you misunderstand.

43
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,790
I never dislike you,

44
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:26,680
yet I even admire you.

45
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,560
For what?

46
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,120
For the fact that I have no one beside me?

47
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,120
No, it’s nothing like that, Karn.

48
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,700
Drink it. If you drink it, we can start over.

49
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,670
But I didn’t mean you had to chug the whole bottle.

50
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,271
Kris.

51
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:16,462
Kris, Kris.

52
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,910
Kris, are you ok?

53
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,900
Kris,

54
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,810
Karn, are you applying the Shadow Clone Technique?

55
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,250
That’s awesome!

56
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Please teach me. So, we have to do this right? Oh.

57
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
It was fun last night.

58
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,360
My Aonthakarn?

59
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,530
Uh-oh.

60
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,560
God please, this is not real.

61
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,850
It’s just a dream, a dream.

62
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,730
What’s up, my dear sister?/ What?!?

63
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,970
Oh, you even have to prayer to God?

64
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,920
Look, I’ve got a video clip to show you.

65
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,710
It’s a wicked one.

66
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,390
What clip?

67
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,400
Have a look. Ohhhh

68
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,990
You! Delete it.

69
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,930
Ouch! What are you doing?

70
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,340
Oh, the joss sticks.

71
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,620
Well, what’s done is done. Look at the clip.

72
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,340
Delete it.

73
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,510
Hey, don’t take it from me.

74
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,640
Delete it right now.

75
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,080
Ouch, I’ll delete it later. Well, another one is even more brilliant.

76
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,900
Awww, kiss-kiss.

77
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:19,240
No, I don’t want to see it. Take this!

78
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,910
Ouch, you need a shaman.

79
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:26,030
Why did you record me?

80
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,340
I want to show you how much I love you.

81
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,540
This is not love. You’ve teased me.

82
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,910
My Aonthakarn is calling.

83
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,970
Whoa, here it comes!

84
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,880
Hello.

85
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,830
Where are you off to? Tell me, I want to know it, too. / Hello.

86
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,930
I want to know what’s going on.

87
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,580
Karn, please hold on for a second.

88
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,440
Hello.

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,700
How are you doing, Kris?

90
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,320
Uh.

91
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,860
Now, you’ve got back to your old self,

92
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,310
more’s the pity.

93
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,340
I wish you were still drunk

94
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,120
so that we could get to know each other more deeply,

95
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,470
but not this version of you.

96
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,860
Well,

97
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,350
I’d like to apologize to you for last night.

98
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,470
What do you apologize for?

99
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,890
What?

100
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,120
Well, I can’t remember.

101
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,680
If you want to apologize, tell me in person.

102
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,040
How?

103
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,750
Are you free for lunch to day? Let’s have lunch together.

104
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,990
Please don’t turn down my invitation.

105
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,400
I normally don’t ask anyone for a meal.

106
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,880
You’re staying silent,

107
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,030
so I take it as a yes.

108
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,550
See you soon. I’ll tell you the location of the place later.

109
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,980
Karn, wait!

110
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,030
Hello, is anybody here?

111
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,690
Hit me.

112
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,460
Certainly!

113
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,090
Pud,

114
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,090
why did you hit me so hard?

115
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,280
I’m not dreaming.

116
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,510
I guess you want another one.

117
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,210
Stop it. You’re becoming too helpful.

118
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,210
As a brother, this is responsibility for my sister.

119
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,420
Duh!

120
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,190
I’m late.

121
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,040
Hi, Kris. / Yikes.

122
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,380
Sorry. I don’t know that you’re shocked so easily.

123
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,070
Would you like some more water?

124
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,740
I’m ok.

125
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,600
Ok. Why did you call me? May I help you?

126
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,370
Uh. You asked me to see you.

127
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,510
Did I? I can’t remember at all.

128
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,240
It’s great that you asked to meet up.

129
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,950
Well, I’d like to apologize to you.

130
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,440
I’d like to apologize to you for last night.

131
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,170
For what?

132
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,950
I didn’t see why you have to be sorry.

133
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I’m sorry for…

134
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,160
Oh, I see.

135
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,380
That’s all right. I don’t mind.

136
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,160
Don’t you get angry with me after all?

137
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,320
Yes, I do.

138
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,460
Eh?

139
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,680
I get angry with you as long as you talk to me formally.

140
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,810
But I’m always polite to you.

141
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,170
Last night, you talked to me casually. Don’t you remember?

142
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,790
Don’t you remember at all?

143
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:07,220
My dear Karn is the cutest, my cutie-pie, and mwah, mwah.

144
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:10,340
Owww, Karn. Please stop.

145
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, Karn.

146
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,030
Commonly, we don’t kiss acquaintances on the forehead,

147
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,660
Karn, are you applying the Shadow Clone Technique?

148
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,910
Come on, Karn.

149
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,920
Let’s dance. Come on.

150
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,450
You’re so cute.

151
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,170
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

152
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,580
We’ve made it!

153
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,920
Cheers!

154
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,110
Please let go of me.

155
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,400
Call me again.

156
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,590
Please let go of me.

157
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,980
Call me Karn.

158
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,340
Please let go of me, Karn.

159
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,960
Ok,

160
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,290
we’re now close.

161
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,520
I told you to get some more water.

162
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,990
What is the real you like?

163
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,760
This is the real me.

164
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,700
Really?

165
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,190
But I like you last night more.

166
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,210
Me last night?

167
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,150
Yes, you spoke frankly when you were drunk

168
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,740
unlike the sober you who appear so reticent that we quarreled.

169
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,490
I’m really sorry.

170
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,560
But I like this version of you more.

171
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,020
By the way, don’t you remember anything from last night at all?

172
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,190
I’m sorry, but I got blackout drunk.

173
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,810
What a pity, so you can’t remember that part.

174
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,510
What part?

175
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,650
What did I do when drunk?

176
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,720
Of course.

177
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,290
It’s even more awesome than the kisses on my forehead.

178
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,260
What is it?

179
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
More awesome than the kisses?

180
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
This is what you look like when you’re drunk

181
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,540
What is it?

182
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,540
You’re completely different from how I thought you’d be.

183
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,780
You’re so cute.

184
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,750
Don’t play with my cheeks.

185
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,290
They’re cute.

186
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,690
You’re wild when drunk.

187
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,670
Are you tired, my cutie-pie.

188
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,730
It’s all right.

189
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,380
What happened, Karn? There’re more than the kisses.

190
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,570
I’m really sorry. What have I done to you?

191
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,600
I won’t tell you

192
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,020
because it’s a secret between the other Kris and me.

193
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,640
If you want to know it,

194
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,840
come to have lunch at my place tomorrow.

195
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,050
Do you like her?

196
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,940
I don’t her that way.

197
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,640
I didn’t mean you have ‘romantic feelings’ towards her.

198
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,250
Hey, in fact, you may like her.

199
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,860
I’m not sure and confused.

200
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,380
What should such feelings be?

201
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,950
Plus, she’s a woman.

202
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,290
Hmm, I guess I know your feeling. You used to have a boyfriend.

203
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,460
Well, that doesn’t count.

204
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,570
Ok. Let’s say love is love.

205
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:26,810
If you have a crush on someone, it will tell you.

206
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,740
Eh? Are you in love with someone?

207
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,490
Of course.

208
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,840
Who is he?

209
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,930
Once I’m ready, I’ll will tell you first.

210
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,250
Do I know him?

211
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,420
I said you’ll know it first when I’m ready.

212
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,060
You’re ready now.

213
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,280
Not yet.

214
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,020
Be ready now.

215
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,280
Open the door.

216
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,760
I’ve invited her here. I’m hungry.

217
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,050
Oh.

218
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,460
Natty, you’re so noisy. The condominium juristic person will scold you.

219
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,170
You all just come to my room like your own place.

220
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,220
Oh, I usually came here without your permission in the old days.

221
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,480
In the old days.

222
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,800
If you want to come in, come in.

223
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,530
You’re like a bear with a sore head but eventually let us in.

224
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,680
Why did you complain?

225
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,080
Let me see.

226
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,240
I miss those days.

227
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,820
Cute!

228
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:14,900
You look exactly the same, nothing’s changed.

229
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,720
Something’s changed.

230
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,480
Could you please open the gate for me?

231
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,660
Toy!

232
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,440
Kris?

233
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,290
Do you know each other?

234
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,790
People say your karmic person can be an ex-boyfriend.

235
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,640
Hey,

236
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,790
will you be my girlfriend?

237
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:17,960
Eh?

238
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,900
Everyone, Kris is my girlfriend.

239
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,250
Everyone, Kris is my girlfriend.

240
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,980
Kris is my girlfriend, yahoo! Kris is my girlfriend.

241
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,770
Eh?

242
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,610
Who are you?

243
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,360
Toy is Kris’s boyfriend.

244
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,390
There began the dark era of my high school life.

245
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,130
Babe, shall we make love?

246
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,770
Eh?

247
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,190
What did you say?

248
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,740
Oh, no?

249
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,520
Ok. Can you give me a BJ?

250
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,670
How dare you said that? Pervert,

251
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,480
what kind of a person you are?/ Oh, that’s fine.

252
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
You don’t want to give me a BJ.

253
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,860
Well, then… ok? Just do this.

254
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,330
You’re a real pervert from hell.

255
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
What the heck is wrong with him?

256
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,360
I hope I won’t see him ever again.

257
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,730
Long time no see, Kris.

258
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,730
Like I want to see you again.

259
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,580
You’ve grown up so well.

260
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,690
Piece of crap.

261
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,720
Hey, calm down.

262
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,422
You’re still violent as usual.

263
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:55,288
Why are you messing with Karn?

264
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,693
We’ve dated, why can’t I visit her? There’s nothing wrong with it.

265
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:01,884
Nope. What are you talking about? We broke up, Toy.

266
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,604
You’re the only one who broke up with me, but I don’t.

267
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,186
Don’t get closer, unless you’ll be neutered.

268
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:18,180
Hey.

269
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,191
All right.

270
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,608
If you don’t want to see me today, it’s fine. I‘ll see you later.

271
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,413
See you soon, babe.

272
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,782
Bye-bye.

273
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:50,355
Kris, what’s the matter?

274
00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:51,742
Nope.

275
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:53,740
Do you know Toy?

276
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,573
You read my mind.

277
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:03,170
I was once his girlfriend,

278
00:25:04,097 --> 00:25:06,090
but we broke up.

279
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,040
Did you break up for real?

280
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:12,675
Of course, I told him to break up.

281
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,426
But he won’t break up with you, right?

282
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,302
Yes.

283
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,666
This guy would feel so humiliated once a woman dumped him.

284
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,253
What about you, how do you know him?

285
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:31,057
Well,

286
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,511
I was once his girlfriend.

287
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,977
Really?

288
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,337
He forced me to, but it lasted just one week.

289
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,488
Did he keep coming around?

290
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:46,168
He didn’t dare.

291
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,160
Are you serious?

292
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:04,631
That’s why he seemed terrified of you.

293
00:26:04,684 --> 00:26:07,644
If he wants more, I’ll be willing to do it again.

294
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,191
This side of you is so cool.

295
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,240
My brother taught me.

296
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,733
Why did you break up with him?

297
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,364
Oh, he had a really dirty mind.

298
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:43,066
I was so pissed off. Talking about him makes me furious.

299
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:45,060
Ok, I see.

300
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,982
Oh, what about…

301
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,644
I won’t tell you.

302
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,560
Karn, don’t be such a tease.

303
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,057
You’re so cute that I want to tease you.

304
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:13,370
Relax! Are you hungry?

305
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:17,270
I’ll cook something for you.

306
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:19,875
Can you cook?

307
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,471
Yes, I can.

308
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,604
Today, I’m going to make many dishes.

309
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:27,306
Could you be my assistant?

310
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:39,875
I hardly ever cook, but… If I screw up the cooking, don’t scold me.

311
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,026
Oh, you won’t.

312
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:45,306
I’m here with you, and you can help me.

313
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:46,542
Let’s go.

314
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,248
Oh, you look a mess.

315
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,497
You stare at me so intensely that I’m shy.

316
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,490
Let’s eat.

317
00:29:59,324 --> 00:30:00,186
Ok.

318
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,448
You look nervous every time you see me.

319
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,333
No, I’m not nervous.

320
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:19,626
I thought we were more familiar with each other.

321
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,768
Don’t you want to be my friend?

322
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:25,520
No, it’s not what you think.

323
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,737
I want to get to know you.

324
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,315
So do I.

325
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,457
I want to know more about you, too.

326
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,666
So,

327
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,004
why don’t you stay over tonight?

328
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,088
Stay over?

329
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,480
Why are you startled?

330
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,191
I have something to talk to you all night long

331
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,248
so that we get to know one another.

332
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,986
Kris, are you ok in there?

333
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,435
What takes you so long?

334
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:21,502
I’m all right.

335
00:31:21,537 --> 00:31:22,862
Can I help you?

336
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:24,860
No, you don’t have to.

337
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,577
Oh, the door is not locked.

338
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,986
Oh, no. Karn.

339
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:34,195
Kris, what’s going on?

340
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,817
Ow, I’m all right.

341
00:32:03,102 --> 00:32:04,702
There. Finished.

342
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:12,168
Thank you.

343
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:21,822
Actually,

344
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:26,410
you have a fair complexion.

345
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:28,222
Karn!

346
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:33,022
That’s true. I can still see you…

347
00:32:34,026 --> 00:32:36,020
I don’t want to talk about it.

348
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,151
Are you getting sulky?

349
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,026
Nope.

350
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,502
If you’re not sulky, turn around and talk to me.

351
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,368
Ok, ok. I’ll stop teasing you.

352
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:51,048
Come on, I’ll dry your hair.

353
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:55,600
I’ll dry your hair. Sorry.

354
00:33:20,924 --> 00:33:22,920
Your hair has a lovely smell.

355
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,044
It’s the same shampoo.

356
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,666
But...

357
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,693
it smells more pleasantly on your hair.

358
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:54,497
There. Finished.

359
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,377
Thank you.

360
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:03,751
Can you wait for a minute?

361
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,137
I’ll come back.

362
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,970
I’d better not drink.

363
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,635
Why?

364
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,595
Are you afraid of turning into the other Kris?

365
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,377
Do you want to see her?

366
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,448
No need for that.

367
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,391
This version of you is a lot better.

368
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,337
Do you still want to know the secret between that Kris and me?

369
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,191
Yed, I do.

370
00:35:12,453 --> 00:35:14,450
Kris

371
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,168
and Karn have the same blood group.

372
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,697
Is that really all you’ve got? I thought there’s something serious.

373
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,431
Do you have other secrets?

374
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,653
Uh, no.

375
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,862
Ok.

376
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,111
You drink quite a lot.

377
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,511
This won’t make me drunk.

378
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,475
I always drink.

379
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,808
How often?

380
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,484
Well,

381
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:18,680
every time I miss my mother.

382
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:33,493
I can’t even look at her pictures these days.

383
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,862
But she always sticks in my mind.

384
00:36:50,204 --> 00:36:52,200
You remind me of her.

385
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,768
Kris,

386
00:36:57,368 --> 00:36:59,786
I’m not that old.

387
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,457
I didn’t mean you’re old.

388
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,462
Karn

389
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,782
can I borrow your shoulder for a moment?

390
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,977
I’ve brought you to your bed.

391
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:07,617
This arm first.

392
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:15,235
Uh, help me a bit.

393
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,471
Wait, calm down, calm down.

394
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,840
We’ll call it even.

395
00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:00,684
You’re too cute when drunk.

396
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,210
Do you like it?

397
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,742
When do you stop being shy around me?

398
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:24,675
Kris,

399
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,297
do you think

400
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:38,035
people can fall in love through letters?

401
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,702
There they come.

402
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,817
Where did you choose this dress for me?

403
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,306
Who is this?

404
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:44,320
I’ve never known that you could be that cool when drunk.

405
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,573
Oh, have you come here together?

406
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,271
Well, yeah.

407
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,506
You picked her up early in the morning.

408
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:58,880
She didn’t pick her up. Kris was not home last night.

409
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:00,088
How so?

410
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,360
I’ve told you I wouldn’t go home.

411
00:41:01,404 --> 00:41:03,973
Oh, I didn’t say anything.

412
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,595
The dress looks familiar anyway.

413
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:10,280
Karn, don’t you quit the job here?

414
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,871
Not anymore.

415
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:18,951
Hey, this means App Talk survives the crisis.

416
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:26,160
To be honest, the host couldn’t be anyone else but you.

417
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:29,751
It’s always been only you, the host of App Talk.

418
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,453
Thank you.

419
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:34,880
Let’s go to the studio.

420
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,297
We’re having another review to shoot.

421
00:41:37,324 --> 00:41:41,680
We’re shooting upstairs,

422
00:41:43,182 --> 00:41:45,180
Ok. Wait.

423
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,626
My scent on you smells lovely.

424
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,613
Aww, that’s awesome.

425
00:41:56,657 --> 00:42:00,080
Excuse me, kris.

426
00:42:00,115 --> 00:42:02,897
Can you tell us how you feel?

427
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,631
Stop it, guys.

428
00:42:04,657 --> 00:42:06,462
You’re now beaming with pleasure.

429
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:07,813
You really are something.

430
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,186
Oh, where are you going?

431
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:20,071
Guys, I’m sorry for troubling the team.

432
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:21,102
Pardon?

433
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,204
What did you say? I can’t hear you. Say it again.

434
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:26,968
Are you deaf? I won’t say it again.

435
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:28,450
What?

436
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:34,364
Hey, take care of the studio for me. I’m seeing customers to sell our services.

437
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,262
Ok.

438
00:42:35,537 --> 00:42:37,048
Behave yourself. I’ll come back soon.

439
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:38,115
Hey, just leave.

440
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:39,840
Ok.

441
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,951
You’re working hard, Karn.

442
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,608
Definitely, I can’t let my fan down.

443
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,973
Does your fan refer to

444
00:43:23,857 --> 00:43:25,950
Ms. Apple?

445
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:27,950
Do you know about her?

446
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,911
Toh’s often talks about her.

447
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:46,675
This is Ms. Apple.

448
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:52,862
Do you always bring it along?

449
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,511
Yeah.

450
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,493
You have a lot of fans, why Ms. Apple?

451
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:19,217
Because I feel loved.

452
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,471
Kris, do you know that I’ve dreamed of being an actress?

453
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,991
Do you know why?

454
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,746
I want to be loved by everyone,

455
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,377
be a beloved person.

456
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:50,862
I appreciate myself when people see me,

457
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:55,330
and Ms. Apple’s letters are love letters

458
00:44:57,688 --> 00:45:01,208
that I’d never received from anyone before.

459
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,333
I specially work hard

460
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,102
so that she’s not disappointed in me.

461
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,351
OK.

462
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,044
I’ve made it! I’ve made it!

463
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,266
What have you got?

464
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,182
We’ve finally got a sponsor.

465
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,751
What is it, Pud?

466
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:38,746
Listen. Now,

467
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,782
Royal Chart Group Co. Ltd. now sponsors our company.

468
00:45:46,817 --> 00:45:49,244
Gosh, really.

469
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,986
It’s Royal Chart Group, pals.

470
00:45:55,031 --> 00:46:01,200
Guys, what is Royal Chart Group?

471
00:46:01,244 --> 00:46:03,200
Why are you so happy?

472
00:46:03,404 --> 00:46:10,444
Royal Chart Group overtakes almost the entire consumer goods industry in our country.

473
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,844
I once met him in person, he exuded an aura of wealth.

474
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:20,186
Once the company sponsors us, we’ll be greatly supported.

475
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,768
Excuse me, what do they want us to make a review?

476
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:33,422
Right, what is it?

477
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,906
what is it?

478
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,773
Cushion foundation.

479
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,364
Cushion foundation!

480
00:46:38,391 --> 00:46:39,804
Cushion foundation?

481
00:46:43,395 --> 00:46:44,000
What’s wrong?

482
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:45,760
We’re doomed.

483
00:46:45,795 --> 00:46:47,964
Your company works on reviewing gadgets,

484
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:51,653
and you’ve got cushion foundation to review, Pud.

485
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,391
Even a merchant can become a singer,

486
00:46:56,426 --> 00:46:59,484
why can’t an IT company make a review of cushion foundation?

487
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,355
If you think it’s ok, I’m ok.

488
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,817
Karn, what is it?

489
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:12,968
Kris, I think there is something wrong.

490
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,728
Hey, he might be arriving.

491
00:47:16,773 --> 00:47:17,724
Who is it?

492
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:22,071
Royal Chart Group! Their vice-chairman is here today himself.

493
00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:23,822
Let’s go.

494
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,502
Hello, Pud.

495
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:48,260
It’s hard to find your office.

496
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:52,168
Small.

497
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,151
Uh. I mean the alley is narrow.

498
00:47:58,204 --> 00:48:02,346
Oh, it’s unique, right? I chose it myself.

499
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,773
Let’s go inside and talk.

500
00:48:04,808 --> 00:48:06,586
Right. Please come in.

501
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,200
Is this what you mean by saying ‘see you later’?

502
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,102
What’s up, babe?

503
00:48:17,137 --> 00:48:18,968
What exactly do you think you’re going to do, Toy?

504
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:55,262
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

505
00:48:55,290 --> 00:49:04,142
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish you all the best.. all those great things you wish for

506
00:49:04,168 --> 00:49:12,257
I wanna be that person of your dream, get close to you,

507
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:14,506
and stay with you all the way.

508
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:21,902
If our feelings are mutual, could I be your boo?”

509
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:29,288
Could I be your boo?

510
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:39,200
Could I be your boo?
