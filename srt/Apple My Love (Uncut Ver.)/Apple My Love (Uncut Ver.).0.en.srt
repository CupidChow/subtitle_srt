00:00:06,728 --> 00:00:14,097
Hello, we're presenting Apple My
Love Documentary to you!! Yay!!!

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,200
"Apple My Love"
(Episode 0)

3
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:28,080
I surrender, and I'll follow
only you ‘coz I love you.

4
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:36,684
Even though my heart is broken, I wish you all
the best... all those great things you wish for.

5
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:47,306
I wanna be that person of your dreams, get
close to you, and stay with you all the way.

6
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:53,690
If our feelings are mutual,
could I be your boo?”

7
00:00:56,426 --> 00:01:00,808
Hi! I'm Folk, Sutima Korkiatvanich,
playing the role of Karn.

8
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,257
Hello! I'm Orm, taking the role of Kris.

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,768
Kris is a person who isn't so confident.

10
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,244
When someone comes along in her life,
she's become more confident.

11
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:19,253
One special thing about her is
that she is an eye transplant recipient.

12
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,066
You'll learn more about
this throughout the series.

13
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:27,342
Actually, Karn actually has
a great passion for a career,

14
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:32,380
but her mother passed away and
she's just broken up with her girlfriend.

15
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:35,668
So, she felt that her
life was way too harsh.

16
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:42,524
Once she received a letter, she regained her
emotional strength thanks to Kris' letter.

17
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:43,820
Yeah, from Ms. Apple.

18
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:46,308
Silly, not from Kris. It's from Ms. Apple.

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,142
Ok.

20
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,124
When you're getting closer, you could
feel a shock, and you could take your time.

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,235
So, there's no rush, and
you should get closer slowly.

22
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,880
Hello, My name's Gun or Ms. Kornrawee
Wongtrakul. I take the role of Natty.

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,373
In my opinion, Natty is a
tomboy among her friends.

24
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:17,111
Well, she shows masculine traits most,

25
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,840
and she's sensitive to
her friends' problems.

26
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:28,000
She always asks them to see if
they are ok or have any problems.

27
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:32,080
Natty is an ideal naughty
girl for many people.

28
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:39,040
After being provided with Natty's
background, characters, and career,

29
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:44,568
I tried to observe maturity and expressions
of people who are in the same profession

30
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:48,017
or have similar characters.

31
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,942
Once I got the scripts, I've tried to
interpret and understand the lines.

32
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,810
Ms. Phitsamai.

33
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,777
It's Ms. Phitsamai.

34
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,708
That means the girl was.

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,331
Aonthakarn.

36
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:06,560
Gosh!!!

37
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:09,230
Gosh! I've got goosebumps.

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,520
I think all stages of the character,

39
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,315
but the most impressive one is the fact
that Mean feels concern about Sol.

40
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:20,515
That's right. I feel the same.

41
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:23,360
Both of them care for each other,
but they don't show it.

42
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,008
That's true.

43
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:33,288
So, we are impressed by their concern about
one another, albeit a few expressions.

44
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:34,773
Absolutely.

45
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:36,266
They show some concern
over one another, though.

46
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,831
True. The subtext is that
care for each other.

47
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,915
Even though they don't say it,
they show their concern through actions.

48
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:44,594
- That's right.
- Through their eyes.

49
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:49,268
Mean, what should I do to
go back to the way we were?

50
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,668
What if we couldn't?

51
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:14,328
Natty in all moments impress
me because I can feel her honesty,

52
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:24,586
Particularly in the scene where Natty positively
encourages Mean and Sol to clear the air without quarrels,

53
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,700
and that's cute for me.

54
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:29,382
Mean, go clearing up your
problems and everything today.

55
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:31,942
If you can't clear the air between you,
I won't let you leave the room.

56
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:33,908
- Absolutely. I'm rooting for you.
- Let's leave, Nat.

57
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,514
Hello!

58
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:01,828
Hello. I'm Pak Varayu,
performing the role of Jessada.

59
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,680
You can call me Big Bro Jess.

60
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:04,560
Oh.

61
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:06,765
Hello, I'm Mon Taechin.

62
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:09,954
I take the role of Toh, and
you can call me Big Bro Toh.

63
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,431
For me, Jess is a cool, eloquent guy.

64
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,848
He is an awesome Casanova?

65
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:21,070
Kinda.

66
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,902
This is my distinctive trait.

67
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,000
What about Toh?

68
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:29,154
I think Toh is a man
of a favorable attitude

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,057
who has brotherly love for friends and
company loyalty,

70
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,857
namely he wants the company to develop

71
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,982
and doesn't want to disappoint it

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,497
because he wants everyone
to move forward together.

73
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,234
That's right. More importantly,

74
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,074
Toh is hotheaded
while Jessada is nerveless.

75
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:46,540
What's wrong with her?

76
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,371
Yeah.

77
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:50,297
Pud, your sister needs medicine.

78
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,725
You mean I should take
her to see a medical doctor?

79
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:53,720
No, Pud, a medicine doctor.

80
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,560
You should rush...

81
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:57,620
following my sister?

82
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:58,868
Bringing some holy water!

83
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,217
Her condition seems serious.

84
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,428
Hello! I'm Gun Thanawat.

85
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:07,782
I take the role of Pud in
Apple My Love Documentary.

86
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,965
Hi! I'm Pik Supawit,

87
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:11,497
playing the role of Pen-eak.

88
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,108
Mmm.

89
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,000
My character is a mischievous

90
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,525
but mature guy

91
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,800
because he is the CEO of App Talk.

92
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,331
I think his traits are similar to mine,
so I can relate the character to myself,

93
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:28,342
and I don't need to research
and prepare much for the role.

94
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:30,925
I feel quite relaxed
about performing the role.

95
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,893
For me, Pen-eak is mature and
cunning which is different from me

96
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:48,168
in terms of age, life
experience, and speech tempo,

97
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:55,048
so I have to learn more about the rich who
own businesses, that is, how they behave,

98
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:59,180
keep a cool head, speak,
and convince people.

99
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,445
I'm Guy, Puntakarn Weeravatesakul

100
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,022
I play the role of Toy.

101
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:19,691
He's a bad guy, a really
bad one. (Laughing)

102
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,851
Just think about the evilest person you've
ever met in real life, and that's him.

103
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:28,951
“What impresses you about the character?”

104
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,902
Talking about Jess,

105
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:33,565
when I read the script,

106
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,220
I think he's the one who
always makes everyone smile.

107
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:42,171
Provided that these we three
are together, namely Toh, Jess

108
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:42,662
and Pud.

109
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,862
Yes, the trio always make
people laugh and smile,

110
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:51,191
and that really impresses me.
Jess is the first one and rich.

111
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:52,817
In the series, I'm a rich guy.

112
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,440
I'm gonna die. I can't breathe.

113
00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:59,840
Should we find a new host now?

114
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,257
Or should we become the hosts?

115
00:08:01,268 --> 00:08:03,140
Ouch!

116
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,508
Oh.

117
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:11,142
Oh, Toh. Hurry up!

118
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:12,354
Hurry!

119
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,451
Luckily, I didn't fall down.

120
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm not quite good at acting.

121
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,908
It hurts.

122
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,000
What's wrong with the car?

123
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:34,377
Haven't you gassed the car up?

124
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,502
Sorry, but it's an EV.
I forgot to charge it.

125
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,857
Jess, you're dumbass.

126
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,728
How can we make it in time?

127
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:43,730
We need to call a cab.

128
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,268
Now, get moving quickly.

129
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,851
Hey, close the car door for me, I forget.

130
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,650
Why haven't you gas the car up?

131
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,068
It's an EV car.

132
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,074
As for Toh, the character impresses me

133
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:05,177
in that the series is about the three men
who have brotherly love for one another

134
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:10,240
and stay together in a house like a family
and many people at the company

135
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,548
who get along so well in a
close-knit working society.

136
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,845
Toh always supports to grow the company.

137
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:20,948
When the business isn't
good, Toh becomes really sad.

138
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,765
He's a workaholic.

139
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:24,228
Serious about his work.
Serious about his friends.

140
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:25,531
Yes. Serious about his friends.

141
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,188
I was from the series, 2 Worlds.
We were both from the series, 2 Worlds.

142
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,613
Well, you can say that this is quite a
change from my role of Phupha in 2 World.

143
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,930
However, it has a sense
of comfort in my own way.

144
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:42,377
I didn't feel tense or
stressed or anything.

145
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,608
But there might be something more.
That is, the love for my younger sister.

146
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:47,930
Because I have a younger
sister and I have to care for her.

147
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:52,994
Even though we kick, punch, bite, tease
each other, there will always be love.

148
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:56,457
But actually, Orm and I
are already quite close.

149
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,080
So, it's not a big deal at all.

150
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,634
Mum, Pud hurts me.

151
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:03,074
Mum! Ouch! It really hurts.

152
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:06,274
Mum, it's not true. She lies. Mum!

153
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:09,097
Ouch! My head is broken. Mum!

154
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,885
She slanders me,

155
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,091
Mum. Don't listen to her.

156
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:15,620
Mum!

157
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,770
Why can't I open it?

158
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,720
What? Mum locks the door?

159
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:20,250
Hahaha. She locks the door.

160
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,525
Ah! It's opened now. Are you dumb?

161
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:28,520
Hahaha. Then, I'll go telling Mum on you.

162
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,262
Please take care of my sister.

163
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,457
Don't worry. Your sister is my sister too.

164
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,902
Gun, cheer up a bit. What's troubling you?

165
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,188
That's awesome.

166
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,137
This is a new actor. He
arrived on set for the first day.

167
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:58,045
Hi. Please take care of me.

168
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,451
I'm rooting for you!

169
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,937
I was also from the series, 2 World.

170
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,497
From the role of a bodyguard, now I am...

171
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:09,840
What bodyguard? Your
role was a killer back then.

172
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,891
Yeah, a killer.

173
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:11,980
And a bodyguard, too?

174
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,868
Yeah, a bodyguard, too.

175
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,240
So scary!!!

176
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,422
And in another series, Monster Next Door,

177
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:21,885
I had a role of a student.

178
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:27,040
But this is a grown-up
type, which has a bigger role.

179
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:28,571
So, Karn, are you in a relationship?

180
00:11:28,594 --> 00:11:30,570
Sorry for asking such a personal question.

181
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,480
But it will affect our decision on
how suitable you are for this role.

182
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,440
Toy is a person who
just says what he thinks.

183
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,822
So scary.

184
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:45,111
It's like I'm trying it for the
first time and I'm very excited.

185
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,845
And today I just started,
so there are many things,

186
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:51,074
but I'll try my best.

187
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,000
Hello, Toy.

188
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,445
Hello, Pud.

189
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:01,268
Yeah.

190
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,331
This office is very hard to fine.

191
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,845
Very small. Er, I mean the
entrance alley. It's small.

192
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,011
Ah…it's quite unique, isn't it?

193
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:18,330
“Your Impressive Scenes”.

194
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,537
Actually, there were many
scenes that impressed me.

195
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,902
Many people might think that the scenes
with Kris and Karn were very cute.

196
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,186
I think so, too.

197
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,493
And I want to present another
perspective, that is, Kris's friendship.

198
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:39,380
Kris's time with friends was a very
cute moment and perspective for me.

199
00:12:39,394 --> 00:12:43,725
Another thing is Kris's time
with her brother and her family.

200
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:49,177
It makes me feel that apart from
the relationship between lovers.

201
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,748
There are also friends and family that
support each other, which are really cute.

202
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,662
My impressive scenes are the same as Orm's.

203
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,911
Actually, there were many
scenes that impressed me.

204
00:12:57,955 --> 00:13:02,364
But my most impressive scenes were
every scene that Kris was drunk. Hahaha.

205
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:02,764
Eh?

206
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,390
Because I feel that when Kris was drunk,
she turned to another person, like…

207
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,377
She was cute when she was drunk?

208
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,022
She was cute but she was
much cuter when she was drunk.

209
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,371
But I like this Kris better.

210
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:25,155
“I surrender, and I'll follow
only you ‘coz I love you.

211
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:34,080
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish you
all the best... all those great things you wish for

212
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:42,160
I wanna be that person of
your dream, get close to you,

213
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:50,720
and stay with you all the way. If our
feelings are mutual, could I be your boo?

214
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:11,093
“Your Feelings about the APPLE Girl Gang”.

215
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:16,594
Starting from the casting day,
the first person I met was Gun.

216
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:20,514
That time I felt that she
was a very cool woman.

217
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:24,640
Then, on the workshop days, I met Bebell

218
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:26,160
and then Plaifah.

219
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,222
Oh, I forgot to mention Orm.

220
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:30,280
Very strange. You forgot me.

221
00:14:30,308 --> 00:14:33,154
Actually, I have already
known Orm for a long time.

222
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,524
What impressed me about the girls is
that they are very dedicated to their work.

223
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,630
Whether it is workshop or event or anything,
they are very dedicated. Very lovely.

224
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,908
From the first day I met everyone,

225
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:49,154
the first picture I have of them was like…

226
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:52,822
Like Gun. Gun was the first person I met.
At first, I felt that Gun was very cool.

227
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Then I saw that she had many perspectives
that make her cute, like a little girl.

228
00:14:57,857 --> 00:14:58,471
Yes.

229
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:03,080
As for Plaifah, she is a fun
person who talks in a cheerful way.

230
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:07,828
While Bebell likes to watch YouTube
so much. In 24 hours of a day…

231
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,908
- She watches it for 25 hours!
- She watches it for 25 hours!

232
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,591
As for Folk, like she said that
we have long been familiar with each other.

233
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:16,568
We have known each other for a long time.

234
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:19,715
But when we actually got to
work together, I felt very happy.

235
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,205
Someone is hungry.

236
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,845
It's 6 PM now.

237
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,234
Very yummy!

238
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:49,475
Firstly, I felt very happy to get a chance
to work with the 4 girls of Apple Gang.

239
00:15:49,502 --> 00:15:50,850
5 girls including me.

240
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,417
I felt like everything
was perfectly balanced.

241
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,626
Everyone seemed to get
along well. It flowed very well.

242
00:15:57,662 --> 00:15:59,440
And everyone was very nice.

243
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,062
Not just the 5 of us in Apple Gang.

244
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:10,022
But also the crew members
that I felt that they were very nice.

245
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:15,337
- When we actually came to work, it was like we were brothers and sisters.
- Yes.

246
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:18,434
It's more than just discussing work.

247
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:21,611
At first, when we weren't that
close, we talked about work.

248
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:25,200
- Then we started to consult each other about personal matters.
- Yes.

249
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,634
- It's like we're opening up and talk to each other more.
- Yes.

250
00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:31,485
It's not just Orm and Folk.
I also talk with Bebell almost every night.

251
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:34,205
Yes. We consult each
other about everything.

252
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:39,040
Yes. But Bebell has a bad habit of not
talking much when she has a problem.

253
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:42,822
She often waits for me to say it first
and then she would agree with me.

254
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:45,851
Saying, “Yeah…I think so,
too.” Something like that.

255
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:50,820
If starting from the first
person I met until the last,

256
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,906
Folk was the first person I met.

257
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:58,190
My first impression was that she was
very cute and I felt warm being with her.

258
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:02,457
The next person I met
was either Bebell or Orm,

259
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,382
and then Plaifah.

260
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:09,497
I feel that they all are
very friendly and caring.

261
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:12,285
I am not a good talker but they
always try to make conversation with me.

262
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:15,768
The one I feel good
with the most is Bebell.

263
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,448
Because we came in at about the same time.

264
00:17:17,484 --> 00:17:21,475
And I feel that we are close in
age so it's easy to talk to each other.

265
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,222
After getting close for a while,
we become like sisters and friends.

266
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,328
And we had a heart-to-heart talk about
our experiences in the past.

267
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:32,060
I feel comfortable when I'm with them.

268
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,514
I feel that we can consult each other
anytime when we have a problem.

269
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:42,182
“I surrender, and I'll follow
only you ‘coz I love you.

270
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:51,291
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish you
all the best.. All those great things you wish for.

271
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:55,520
I wanna be that person of your dream,

272
00:17:55,573 --> 00:18:01,848
get close to you, and
stay with you all the way.

273
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:07,810
If our feelings are mutual,
could I be your boo?”

274
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:18,915
“First impressions at the first meeting”.

275
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,760
- Oh, we've answer this question often.
- Definitely.

276
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:23,440
Right? But we never get
bored with the question.

277
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:26,182
- We can finely keep answering it.
- Like millions times.

278
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,085
Because I know that you like it, don't you?

279
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,211
Hello. Hello, who's that?

280
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:32,777
I can go first about first impressions.

281
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,011
As I said earlier, when I first met Orm,

282
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:37,554
I was not alone but
sitting with a friend of mine.

283
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:38,948
Can I tell the story because
I can now recall it all?

284
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,491
Ok, she can recall it now.

285
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,120
Let me tell you what happened. Like
she said, she was sitting with a friend.

286
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:46,617
I'll tell the story as
though I were Folk herself.

287
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:49,290
First, I was sitting with a friend.

288
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:53,324
Orm was the one approached
and talked to me first.

289
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:01,626
I'm so impressed with the fact that she came
to render me more relaxed and talk to me.

290
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:06,728
You've just talked on my behalf
using your words and expressions.

291
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:08,115
- Really? I've tried my very best.-
- ‘Render me more relaxed',

292
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,028
I won't say that.

293
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,714
Next, can you try talking like me?
Do you remember what I said back then?

294
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:14,617
No, I don't.

295
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:15,771
Bruh.

296
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,925
What did you say?

297
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:21,142
As you said earlier, I
approached you first.

298
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,965
- Oh, I see. But Orm will say that…
- You can try replying like me.

299
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:29,893
Can I? Actually, everyone, I'd like to tell
you that I couldn't recall that I greeted her.

300
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,770
When she's talked about it frequently,

301
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:36,337
I then tried to recall it and
recollected that I really greeted her.

302
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:37,280
- She looked cute back
then, so I approached her.

303
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,106
Have you just made
some part of the story up?

304
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,828
Yes, I have.

305
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,314
Our first impression… In fact,

306
00:19:43,337 --> 00:19:47,382
we've seen each other
through a mutual friend.

307
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,171
That's right.

308
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:53,288
That mutual friend knows Fah and Bell,

309
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:57,730
so we've seen each other but never talked.

310
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,674
We met in person on the audition day.

311
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:05,680
On that day, I felt that she looked cute,
and I wanted to talk to her. And that's it.

312
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:09,371
When we work together as actress,

313
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,005
I've learned that Bell's
got beautiful eyes.

314
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:12,080
Really?

315
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:13,644
You've never told me so.

316
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:22,760
Yeah, her eyes are beautiful, and I was
spellbound looking at them while acting.

317
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,275
During the audition, we were tasked
with acting in a fight scene in which we

318
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:27,020
were angry with one another and quarreled.

319
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:29,485
I couldn't get angry with her anyway.

320
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:33,142
My first impression is excitement,

321
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,400
and I feel that… As I'd seen Fah before

322
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:43,394
and Fah is one of the senior actresses of
Kongthup Production, I felt slightly nervous.

323
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:48,548
As I said earlier, Fah was the icebreaker

324
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,595
who made us relaxed and chilled.

325
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:55,448
Moreover, my first audition went well

326
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:56,940
because I felt at ease.

327
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:04,942
“I surrender, and I'll follow
only you ‘coz I love you.

328
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:13,920
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish the
the best... all those great things you wish for.

329
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,186
I wanna be that person of your dream,

330
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:24,302
get close to you, and
stay with you all the way.

331
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,315
If our feelings are mutual,
could I be your boo?”

332
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:31,460
I love more every day, Orm.

333
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:33,040
Awww.

334
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,434
I feel…

335
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:34,914
Awww.

336
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:36,068
- Not yet.-
Not yet.

337
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,662
Awww, oh, not my line.

338
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:40,251
Hey, that's my line!

339
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:44,365
I feel great. As I say every time,

340
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:48,777
I'm happy that Orm is my co-actress, and I
want to work with her continuously because

341
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,354
as I always say, If it wasn't Orm,
no one else couldn't replace her.

342
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:55,177
What is the question again? I forget.

343
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,040
I feel great to co-star with Folk.

344
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:01,108
Everyone, she's a copycat.

345
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:03,691
No, I'm not. I really feel
great. What else can I say?

346
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:06,845
Like I feel bad, I don't like
her, most of the time she smiles.

347
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,537
Can we make a cut now?

348
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,222
It's wonderful to co-star
with Folk because we talked,

349
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:20,248
after finding out that we might not work
together, that we wished one another well.

350
00:22:20,275 --> 00:22:24,410
This was our mutual opinion.

351
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,777
If one of us has a better choice,

352
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,120
we'll always support each other.

353
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:35,537
Eventually, we co-star in the project,

354
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:38,340
and it was beyond our expectations.

355
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:39,222
That's right.

356
00:22:39,253 --> 00:22:40,657
And we're elated.

357
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:43,000
“When did you fall for each other?”

358
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,940
Indeed, I just turn my head to the right
now, and I can have a romantic moment.

359
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,051
Are you shy with me?

360
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,413
There are many romantic moments for her

361
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:59,102
because she's good at taking
care of other people as I said earlier.

362
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:04,080
She might take care of
many people, but, for me,

363
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:06,480
She takes care of me

364
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,782
because she likes to do so.

365
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,680
She enjoys taking care of everyone, indeed.

366
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,891
I think I like Folk when
she focuses while working.

367
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:17,805
When she has a passion
for something, like …

368
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,697
At first, she seemed frivolous,

369
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,194
but she is deeply engaged in work.

370
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:32,542
“I surrender, and I'll follow
only you ‘coz I love you.

371
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:41,360
Even though my heart is broken, I wish you
the best... all those great things you wish for.

372
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:47,484
I wanna be that person of your dream,

373
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:51,751
get close to you, and
stay with you all the way.

374
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,120
If our feelings are mutual,
could I be your boo?”

375
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:57,342
“How do you feel performing in the series?”

376
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,782
Firstly, I'm excited.

377
00:23:59,794 --> 00:24:03,097
I'm half excited, half pressured because

378
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:08,845
I don't want to disappoint anyone, and I
know that everyone is waiting for our work.

379
00:24:08,857 --> 00:24:13,691
We're fully engaged in it, and
we promise we'll do our very best.

380
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:17,862
Before this project, I've had
small parts in some drama series.

381
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:20,411
It feels totally different.

382
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:25,234
In those drama series, I felt
pressured to do my best for my own part,

383
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:30,280
but I can say that we're engaged in
the entire work of this drama series.

384
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:34,142
As a result, we feel even more
pressured because it's like..

385
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,253
Apart from our own part,
we need to help lead the cast.

386
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,831
That's right.

387
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:42,542
Something like that.
Besides, we're excited.

388
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:50,377
As Folk said earlier, we'll try our
very best and work to the fullest.

389
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,594
First of all, I didn't expect to
be one of the main characters

390
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,626
because this is my first drama series.

391
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,870
So, I feel startled and thrilled, as
well as honored to be in the cast.

392
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:12,125
Also, I feel really happy because
I did the first audition with Fah.

393
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,577
- Absolutely.
- So,

394
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:17,497
I feel at ease because Fah is my co-star.

395
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:23,622
Plus, I feel even more relaxed
because our first audition was quite good.

396
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:27,668
We've talked since the first day we met.

397
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,462
When I learned that Fah
was going to be my co-star,

398
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,760
I feel at ease and slightly excited

399
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:39,470
because Fah is a co-star who
I feel at ease to work together.

400
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:44,915
The feelings have gradually developed.

401
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:47,102
I don't feel excited like Bell.

402
00:25:47,137 --> 00:25:50,257
Bell performs as a main character in
her first drama series, so she becomes

403
00:25:50,302 --> 00:25:52,426
excited about what she is going to do.

404
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:52,871
Each and every job.

405
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:53,800
Yes, each and every job.

406
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:55,874
Even today, she is very excited.

407
00:25:55,885 --> 00:26:00,548
But for me, it's like I have
started from baby step.

408
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,968
Being raised and
growing up little by little.

409
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:06,506
I feel that it was a good experience.

410
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,724
And I feel grateful to all experiences
that have shaped me to be who I am today.

411
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,937
I will definitely do my very best!

412
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,645
There is Marriage Equality Act now, right?

413
00:26:17,668 --> 00:26:18,045
Yes.

414
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,651
I feel like we are another voice. Or like…

415
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,485
We create entertainment
in a more diverse format.

416
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,768
Moreover, even though
our series is about love,

417
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,168
But there are many things that
are quite interesting to find out.

418
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,364
About the characters or the story.

419
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,900
So, we feel very lucky to have
been able to portray this story.

420
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,268
I feel honored and very happy,
just like what my friends answered.

421
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:54,742
Because our bosses, Nat and Khet,
and all of the crew member do their best.

422
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:03,885
Everyone is dedicated. And I feel
that all five of us need to work harder.

423
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,994
And we need to do a lot more of homework.
Anyway, thank you in advance.

424
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:10,050
Thank you.

425
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:17,222
I feel very excited because
its such a rare opportunity.

426
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:20,365
And it is a big chance.

427
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,386
It turns out that when we get a big opportunity,
we have to give up something that is really big.

428
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:28,026
Both our time and our
body, we have invested a lot.

429
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:33,777
I feel that it's such a good
opportunity. I feel good to get to do it.

430
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,084
And I feel that I need to
thank our bosses, Khet and Nat.

431
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,946
Thank you for selecting
me to be a part of this project.

432
00:27:41,982 --> 00:27:44,364
And I will try my very best.

433
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,471
Honesty, I feel very glad.

434
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:54,382
I didn't think that we would
get to have a role in this series.

435
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,485
And I didn't think that we
would get to play the role of…

436
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,115
- Of Toh.
- Of our gang, or of Pud.

437
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,660
Of the Three Musketeers.

438
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,320
Yeah.

439
00:28:02,342 --> 00:28:04,674
To bring smiles to everyone.

440
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:07,257
Yes. It's actually a
change of character for me.

441
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:07,805
Yeah.

442
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:11,977
Mon now gets the role of Toh while
he used to play the role of Wayu.

443
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,074
It's changed.

444
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,408
With a group of friends who have sincere
love, who love each other very much.

445
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:21,450
And I feel very much happy,
especially working with Folk, Orm, and...

446
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:25,451
Bebell, Plaifah and Gun.

447
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:28,995
Yes. I feel that it is very interesting.

448
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:31,644
Especially the script
reading. Let's talk about it a bit.

449
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:32,217
Very funny.

450
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:34,468
We must talk about this. We
cannot miss it. It's about Orm.

451
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:39,511
The thing is, from the script reading,
we feel that Orm does a lot of homework.

452
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:42,595
She has so much energy

453
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,022
that we want everyone to
look forward to watching it.

454
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:51,022
I know that it is going
to be a great series.

455
00:28:51,048 --> 00:28:57,820
Just by reading the script, I feel
that this is a really well-made series.

456
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,991
I think that I will watch it
for the 2nd time for sure.

457
00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:04,151
I feel certain about
that even before filming.

458
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah, just by reading the script.

459
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:06,662
I feel good just by reading the script.

460
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,960
Yeah, it's so much fun. I feel very
impressed to be a part of this series.

461
00:29:09,977 --> 00:29:10,914
Yeah.

462
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:16,137
I'm very happy because I get to work
with all familiar people in this series.

463
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:21,257
Very happy. And with the role I
get, everything is perfectly balanced.

464
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:25,268
It's going to make me
very happy when filming.

465
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,546
Or when on air, I think everyone might
feel the closeness between the actors.

466
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,857
And all the fun that
will happen in the series.

467
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,365
I feel that it is another important step

468
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:40,248
Because I get
to play a character that was important to the story.

469
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,622
And there were challenges in
terms of character dimensions.

470
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:50,788
But most importantly, I get to work
with talented seniors who I'm close to.

471
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,188
Gun is also talented. Hahaha.

472
00:29:53,210 --> 00:30:01,413
“I surrender, and I'll follow
only you ‘coz I love you.

473
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:10,400
Even though my heart is broken, I wish you
the best... all those great things you wish for

474
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:16,373
I wanna be that person of your dream,

475
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:20,764
get close to you, and
stay with you all the way.

476
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:26,968
If our feelings are mutual,
could I be your boo?

477
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:46,462
“What do you give each
other the most advice on?”

478
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,571
I think it's the same for both of us.

479
00:30:48,594 --> 00:30:49,142
Yes.

480
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:49,862
About work.

481
00:30:49,902 --> 00:30:54,657
But, actually, Orm knows
about almost everything in my life.

482
00:30:54,693 --> 00:30:57,644
I ask advice from Orm
about almost everything.

483
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,272
No, Folk, not almost.

484
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:01,577
When I have something, I would just…

485
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:04,311
Like, sometimes I just have trouble
defecating or being stuck in a traffic jam

486
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:07,279
I would send a Line message
to complain about that to Orm.

487
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:10,400
At first, I was
shocked. Very shocked.

488
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,925
We will discuss about
everything. Really everything.

489
00:31:14,948 --> 00:31:17,405
I am everything. I am everything for her.

490
00:31:17,428 --> 00:31:22,640
I discuss with her about work the most.
Because we share the responsibilities,

491
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,960
and we want to try our very best.

492
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:32,457
We talk about the script and everything,
even about how will work hard together.

493
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,675
We mostly discuss about personal matters

494
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,355
Because actually we talk with each
other during bedtime every night.

495
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:38,994
Talk about this and that.

496
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:40,148
Yes, about this and that.

497
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:50,764
“What do you beg from each other the most?”

498
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,297
I rarely do.

499
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,994
Umm…Orm rarely does. But I beg
from her about almost everything.

500
00:31:57,017 --> 00:32:02,594
Sometimes she just drives me home
and I would feel especially happy.

501
00:32:02,617 --> 00:32:04,411
So I normally beg from
her about almost everything.

502
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:06,643
But if I tease her, like, “Oh,
I guess you're happy now.”

503
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,788
She would say "It's
nothing. Not at all.”

504
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:14,502
So, everyone, I might kill the mood in front
of the scene, ButFolk's got my habit now

505
00:32:14,514 --> 00:32:17,040
and likes to kill the
mood behind the scene.

506
00:32:17,662 --> 00:32:18,490
You're telling on me!

507
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,725
I am the kind of person who, like
when she says something to me,

508
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,718
I would be like, “Umm, umm,
okay, I'm going to bed now.”

509
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,324
Like, when we talk on the phone,
before we hang up, I would say,

510
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:36,788
“Love you.” Something like that
to give each other spiritual support.

511
00:32:36,811 --> 00:32:38,205
Yes, we both knew it.

512
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:42,160
To simply say. Everything.

513
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:45,257
Yeah. Bebell would beg
from me about everything.

514
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:46,285
Pretty-please.

515
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:50,346
Whether she wants to get
something, to go somewhere, to sleep,

516
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:54,342
to eat, to get grumpy, to be
angry, she would be like that.

517
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:58,346
“3 Must-Have Items”.

518
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,631
Let me answer about yours first, okay?

519
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:04,320
Okay. You tell mine and I tell yours.
Or maybe not? We might get confused.

520
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:05,348
One thing she can't miss: the lipstick.

521
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:06,594
Definitely.

522
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:07,828
Antihistamine.

523
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,508
That's right!

524
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,491
Facial tissue paper.

525
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:12,388
- Definitely. Running nose all the time.
- Sneezing all the time.

526
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:15,780
She says sneezing. I say running nose.

527
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:18,754
As for Folk, the first
thing is the inhalant.

528
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:21,668
Most beloved item.
Inhaling and feel refreshed.

529
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:24,490
And lipstick. This is
a must-have item, too.

530
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:30,148
And one last thing, what
would it be… Ah! A doll.

531
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:31,771
- Definitely.
- A must-have item.

532
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:33,691
All of my bags must have a doll in it.

533
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,542
Must-have items in my bag.

534
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:40,262
1) Lipstick. This is normal.

535
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,022
2) Inhalant.

536
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,234
3) Money or cash. Just
like an average person.

537
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:48,708
In our bags…

538
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,828
Let me say first.

539
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,160
For Plaifah, the first thing is perfume.

540
00:33:55,782 --> 00:33:57,520
Pressed powder for a touch-up.

541
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:05,542
And the last thing is
inhalant, a life-saver of the day.

542
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:08,548
Of curse. These are must-have items.

543
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:10,514
For Bebell. 1) Lipstick.

544
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:20,297
2) Bebell needs to have snacks. Because
when I crave for snacks, I would ask her.

545
00:34:20,328 --> 00:34:23,324
And she would always have some in her bags.

546
00:34:23,386 --> 00:34:24,008
Yes.

547
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:28,731
And I would eat just a little. And she would
be like, “It cannot fit in my bag now.”

548
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:29,645
“Eat them up now.”

549
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:31,485
She said, ‘eat it up', and I was like…

550
00:34:31,497 --> 00:34:35,291
I just wanted to have some of it,
but I already opened the packet.

551
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,988
That was planted in my memory.

552
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,930
Ok.

553
00:34:38,948 --> 00:34:42,068
Bell doesn't carry a
pressed powder or cushion

554
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,346
because she always goes to
university before going to work.

555
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,045
She might get up
late.. Usually gets up late.

556
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:54,480
When she goes to work, make-up
and touch-ups are required.

557
00:34:54,514 --> 00:34:56,811
I need touch-ups.

558
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,354
We need all those makeup
tools. I bring other things for Bell,

559
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:03,885
while Belle has lipsticks
and something else.

560
00:35:03,908 --> 00:35:05,828
It feels like we fulfill one another.

561
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:09,280
“Where do you want to
take your character to?”

562
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:14,617
For me, I'd like to take
Karn to a flower field and

563
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,794
everywhere that is full of flowers so that
she can see the vividness of the world

564
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:23,851
and learn that there are a lot of beautiful

565
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:27,520
and cheerful things in the
world that help heal her heart.

566
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,788
For me, I'd like to take Kris to Karn.

567
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:32,880
Oh, she's won.

568
00:35:32,914 --> 00:35:36,045
Kris cherishes Karn most.

569
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,268
Bell wants to take Sol to the sea.

570
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,531
You can then come to my home.

571
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:46,285
And one more thing, Fah's
home is next to the sea,

572
00:35:46,297 --> 00:35:50,834
I personally love sea,

573
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:57,817
and I feel that Sol isn't different
from me in that she's fun and

574
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:02,365
may enjoy swimming in the sea.

575
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:10,020
Also, the sea is relaxing, and
when you sit down on the beach…

576
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:14,900
Indulging in the beach and
sea, you may use this expression.

577
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:19,371
I'd like to take Meen and Sol to a room

578
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,211
where we can watch a movie, cook some food,

579
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:30,377
lead a happy life simply but specially.

580
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:38,674
As for Natty, I think she is kinda an
artist, so I want her to enjoy artistic vibes

581
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:45,142
in Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand
because the city boasts some indie corners.

582
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:51,954
I also want to take her to some cafés
in the forest and stay in a homestay.

583
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:58,605
In fact, I don't want to take only
Natty but all friends: Meen, Sol, …

584
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:03,040
It could be anywhere
but with the 5 friends.

585
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,502
I might take him to undergo
a psychotherapy to talk

586
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:11,040
and see if there are any problems.

587
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:16,057
If I can decide, I'll like to go as a trio,

588
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,235
that is, Jess, Toh, and Pud

589
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:23,253
because we've read the scripts, and
the scenes take place mostly in the office.

590
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:27,111
I feel that we've
encountered so many issues

591
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:29,630
that I want to set them free.

592
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,942
If I can choose a place, I'll
take them to an amusement park

593
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:36,171
because I want them to try screaming.

594
00:37:36,194 --> 00:37:39,680
I want them to scream like ahhhhh together.
That might set them free.

595
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:45,531
We've been faced with many problems that
gradually arise while founding App Talk,

596
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,445
so I want to take them to an
amusement park to set them free.

597
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:50,902
Oh,

598
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,971
for me, I'll choose a unique place.

599
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,508
Unique?

600
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,434
I like to visit a temple.

601
00:37:54,457 --> 00:37:55,291
Ah.

602
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,492
I'll take the trio to a temple
to meditate, make merit,

603
00:37:58,516 --> 00:38:01,165
perform religious observances,
and clean the temple.

604
00:38:01,177 --> 00:38:02,830
- Amen.
- Do you know why?

605
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,777
To calm yourselves

606
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:06,270
- and make yourselves relaxed.
- Because there are various issues.

607
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:08,365
Of course, when we're faced
with some serious issues,

608
00:38:08,391 --> 00:38:12,256
love, and sorrow. We've
accumulated all those things and feelings.

609
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:12,970
Yeah.

610
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:15,725
I want to take everyone to a temple.

611
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,497
Personally, I'd like to take Pud to the US

612
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:27,074
to go sightseeing and have a
talk with companies and CEOs.

613
00:38:27,128 --> 00:38:30,960
This could be an interesting choice
because App Talk has just been founded,

614
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:33,297
and we need management
and meetings with them.

615
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,480
At least we can find connections
through seminars and other activities

616
00:38:36,502 --> 00:38:40,822
and learn more to push the
company toward the future.

617
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:41,851
A true CEO.

618
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:44,480
Of course, I'm still a CEO now.

619
00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:49,450
I want to take Eak to remote areas.

620
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:50,000
Hey!!

621
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:52,217
Remote areas refer to serenity.

622
00:38:52,228 --> 00:38:53,908
- Oh, serenity.
- Serenity with rustic vibes

623
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:59,805
will show Pen-Eak that he can't see things
on the ground from a high place,

624
00:38:59,828 --> 00:39:02,313
and I'll take him to explore
those things on the ground

625
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:04,822
so that he can learn from
them and become a better man.

626
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:08,222
“Ask the Viewers to Support the Series”.

627
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,988
Okay, now, for both of us,
we'd like to say thank you.

628
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,120
- Thank you. Please support
the character of Jessada,

629
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:16,160
and…

630
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,649
of Toh, too. Most importantly,

631
00:39:18,674 --> 00:39:20,728
thank you to all the seniors,
both in front of and

632
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:23,211
behind the scenes. Thanks
to our bosses, Nat and Khet.

633
00:39:23,234 --> 00:39:26,708
Thanks to our seniors, Phet
and Waan. Thank you…

634
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,542
- Everyone in Kongthup Production.
- Yes.

635
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:31,074
And many other people.

636
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,068
Thank you for giving us a
chance to be a part of this series.

637
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,377
Yes. And we're very glad and very happy.

638
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:36,880
Goodbye.

639
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:39,188
Goodbye. Please support us.

640
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,142
Please support us. My character, Push...

641
00:39:41,154 --> 00:39:45,222
No, I mean, Pud from the series, Apple.

642
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,348
Please support this series.

643
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:50,880
And I'd like to tell you that this is
such a very interesting GL series.

644
00:39:50,914 --> 00:39:54,080
From the dedication and
effort of Kongthup Production.

645
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:57,600
All the actors, actresses and crew members
are dedicated in their work.

646
00:39:57,634 --> 00:40:00,434
I can say that the lead actresses Orm-Folk
have such a good chemistry.

647
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,857
- Yes, very good chemistry.
- Yeah, they chemistry is quite natural.

648
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,245
Personally, I feel that
this series worth watching.

649
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:08,210
It could bring you happiness.

650
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,577
It could get you to
understand each character.

651
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,320
And probably make you have
more passion in GL series.

652
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:15,720
I see that this is a perfect series.

653
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:21,657
Please support the character of Pen-Eak.
Please support me and every actor and actress.

654
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,691
We are all very dedicated in this work. Lastly,
please keep the series Apple in your heart.

655
00:40:25,742 --> 00:40:27,528
Thank you, all fan clubs.

656
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:34,200
For giving me the same love and
support since my first day until today.

657
00:40:34,228 --> 00:40:41,451
Thank you for continuing to
giving me love and support.

658
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:46,480
I would be happy to have all of you with me for
a very long time. Please follow me on my IG, too.

659
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:51,622
Don't forget to follow the main channel
of Kongthub Production and Apple series.

660
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,622
Goodbye.

661
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,920
First, I'd like to thank
our bosses, Nat & Khet,

662
00:40:57,954 --> 00:40:59,211
and the crew members.

663
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,574
Thank you, Kongthub
Production, for seeing my

664
00:41:02,598 --> 00:41:06,628
ability and choosing me
to take the role of Sol now.

665
00:41:06,651 --> 00:41:12,788
If I hadn't taken the role of Sol, I
wouldn't have had a chance to meet everyone.

666
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:20,891
Thank you, all fan clubs,
for always supporting us.

667
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:24,822
For being the source of our strength.

668
00:41:24,845 --> 00:41:30,708
Every time we just open social media
and see them, we feel so energized.

669
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:34,262
So, we'd like to thank all fan
clubs for always being there for us.

670
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:40,194
Our series hasn't aired yet, but I'd like
everyone to stay with us until it ends.

671
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:45,942
Until all the characters
grown in different aspects.

672
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,194
Bebell has said everything. I
just want to add some more.

673
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:54,251
Every time we go to an event,
we will meet the fan clubs.

674
00:41:54,274 --> 00:41:58,320
Whether the regular fan clubs of
Orm and Folk or the new fan clubs

675
00:41:58,354 --> 00:42:00,813
who just find and start to
follow the series Apple.

676
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:05,360
We would very much like to
say “thank you” to all of them.

677
00:42:05,394 --> 00:42:09,737
Thank you everyone who
may join with our journey since…

678
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:12,788
- Since the beginning.
- Yeah. Since we were still inside the small egg.

679
00:42:12,811 --> 00:42:16,331
- Until now that we're hatched,
- Now we're hatched

680
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:23,051
and we're glad that everyone is still with
us. And thanks a lot for being our support.

681
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,720
Orm said that we're hatched now, right?

682
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,039
I'd like everyone to be
with us until we learn to walk.

683
00:42:28,063 --> 00:42:31,360
Until we can walk
fluently. Until we grow up.

684
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,131
To simply say, I'd like everyone to
stay with us for every moment of our lives.

685
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,531
Please follow…
Ah, I'll let Orm say it now.
