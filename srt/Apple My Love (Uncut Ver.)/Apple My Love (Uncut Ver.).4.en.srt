1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,951
The series is not based on a true story, individuals, places,
or organizations.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,413
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

3
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:26,195
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish you all the best and all those great things you wish for.

4
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:34,373
I wanna be that person of your dream, get close to you,

5
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:42,924
and stay with you all the way. If our feelings are mutual, could I be your boo?”

6
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,231
Good morning.

7
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:12,017
Good Morning.

8
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,106
Where’s my morning kiss?

9
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,662
Karn,

10
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,675
there should be a period of adjustment for me.

11
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,253
I thought you spent last night on adapting to live with me.

12
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:38,595
Don’t tempt me.

13
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,782
Where is that shy girl?

14
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:54,933
I’m still feeling shy,

15
00:03:55,404 --> 00:04:00,568
but I adore you more.

16
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,560
Whose sweetheart is this?

17
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
That’s enough for now.

18
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,337
Let’s keep the best for last.

19
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,485
Shall we go on a date today?

20
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,045
A date?

21
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,828
A date?

22
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,000
Nope.

23
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,200
You want to be intimate with me just now.

24
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:51,240
It’s my natural instinct.

25
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,965
We’ve got 3 days off.

26
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,794
Where should we go on vacation?

27
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,274
Anywhere as you like it.

28
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,657
. I love to please you, boo.

29
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,211
Or...

30
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,400
Let’s go, my boo.

31
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:15,222
Let’s go.

32
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:27,628
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

33
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:36,885
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish you all the best, all those great things you wish for.

34
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:44,611
I want to be that person of your dream, get close to you,

35
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:53,325
and stay with you all the way. If our feelings are mutual, could I be your boo?”

36
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:08,000
I’m exhausted.

37
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,600
I agree.

38
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,080
I’ve never done anything like this for ages.

39
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:18,700
Is tomorrow really the last day of our vacation?

40
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:21,205
I don’t want to go to work.

41
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:24,350
Are you being childish?

42
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:35,920
The sea is so beautiful,

43
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,091
and it’s even more beautiful when you’re here.

44
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,805
Aww, that’s way too sweet.

45
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,217
You look gorgeous.

46
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,565
Kris,

47
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:08,280
tell me why you lost the sight for 3 years.

48
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:11,800
It’s a long story.

49
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:14,280
I have time for it.

50
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,925
Okie,

51
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,137
I once wanted to be a director.

52
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,354
Really?

53
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:24,742
Yeah,

54
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,108
so I refused to continue studying Pharmacy in accordance with my parents’ wish

55
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,211
and studied Film instead.

56
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:34,857
Once, I graduated, it was really hard to find a job.

57
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,222
Eventually, I found a job in a production.

58
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,466
At that time, I thought my dream nearly came true,

59
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,973
so I worked with a great deal of effort.

60
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,193
I went to the set early in the morning,

61
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,100
and I was the last person who went back home.

62
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,553
I was elated, Karn.

63
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,380
It’s not easy to work at a set all the time.

64
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,380
Just like what you said, one day,

65
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,253
my body couldn’t take it anymore.

66
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:18,773
That night, the filming was finished late,

67
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,060
and I drove home by myself.

68
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,913
I dozed off while driving, and the car crashed into a tree.

69
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,940
Karn, someone might see us.

70
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:36,940
There’s no one around.

71
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,940
You don’t have to console me, Karn.

72
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,653
I’m not consoling you.

73
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:49,160
It happened several years ago.

74
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,953
It feels great that I regained my sight once again,

75
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,073
so, I always dream of you.

76
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,306
You’ve dreamed of me?

77
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:06,806
I’m just saying it.

78
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,273
Oh, how much do you adore me?

79
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:16,126
You know how much I adore you.

80
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,333
Someone might see us.

81
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:27,466
No, they won’t.

82
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,980
Hello.

83
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Kris, are you going back to Bangkok?

84
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,446
I’m still in Chonburi, Mom.

85
00:09:43,486 --> 00:09:44,640
Pud’s been arrested.

86
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:45,546
My goodness,

87
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,546
Pud’s been arrested.

88
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,653
Luckily, I’ll let it pass this time.

89
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:01,380
Next time, you’ll be in jail.

90
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:03,646
I’ve just seen a moron call his mother to bail him out.

91
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:04,833
You’re low class.

92
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,153
We can fight again.

93
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:10,680
You siblings use violence alike.

94
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,546
If I were rich and grew up like you, I would rather stay poor.

95
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:15,013
Stop it.

96
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,793
Stop quarreling. You’re right at the police station.

97
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,766
Take care of your relative.

98
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,280
I’m sorry, officer.

99
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,060
Hey,

100
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,500
do you think it’s worth it quarreling with him? Stop it.

101
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:35,760
Tell me what’s going on.

102
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:42,720
Mr. Toy, someone from Apps Talk wold like to see you.

103
00:10:42,873 --> 00:10:43,966
Let them in.

104
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,526
Oh, Pud.

105
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:48,713
Hello.

106
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,353
I’d like to inform you that,

107
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,706
from now on, I’ll attend a meeting here with you.

108
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:56,540
The first job was finished,

109
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:02,026
and, as for the last job, I think our team is on the right Track.

110
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,973
Hey, Pud, are you not comfortable with me?

111
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:07,060
Of course not.

112
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,060
I just want to work more conveniently.

113
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,693
But you look different from what you’ve said.

114
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,140
Oh, is it because of Kris?

115
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,480
Don’t pull that sort of expression.

116
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,846
Just a friendly reminder.

117
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:26,986
As a man, I’d say Kris is a fast girl.

118
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,913
She gave me a BJ on our first day.

119
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:31,593
You son of a b*tch!! She’s my sister.

120
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,406
What’s wrong with you? Hey, what are you doing?

121
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
Help me!

122
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,860
Help!

123
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,466
You deserve a punch.

124
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:40,673
Leave my sister alone.

125
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:41,493
What’s wrong with you?

126
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,286
Help! Please help!

127
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,326
Stop it.

128
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,653
Help!

129
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,413
Help!

130
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:03,626
How could I let it pass?

131
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,240
He said you’ve got big boobs, but you’re actually booblets.

132
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:09,600
What are you talking about? I never say such things.

133
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,780
I just said that she was a
fast girl,

134
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:14,606
and that she gave me a BJ on our first day

135
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,726
You son of a b*tch!

136
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,253
Enough!

137
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,840
Huh, get back to the car.

138
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:21,693
No.

139
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,953
Pud.

140
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:24,950
I won’t leave you here with this scumbag.

141
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,506
Bro,

142
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,193
we’re right in front of a police station. He can’t do anything to me

143
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,180
or is he does, I’ll handle it.

144
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,866
Just tell me if something happens.

145
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:41,160
Ok.

146
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:43,340
I’ll stay here with her. Don’t you worry, Pud.

147
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,013
Go!

148
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,266
Well, Kris?

149
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,126
After all this time, you’ve been bad-mouthed me?

150
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,553
No, I haven’t. We did date.

151
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,566
Even though I’ve never had sex with you, I think I get
the facts straight.

152
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,193
Karn.

153
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,026
I’ve been tolerated listening to you crap.

154
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,473
Will you stop picking on us?

155
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,226
Toy,

156
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,880
I’m surprised, too.

157
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,860
Although you’ve been bad-mouthing me all the time,

158
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,693
I never get angry with you.

159
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,426
Instead I think you’re so pathetic.

160
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,680
You’re being ridiculous.

161
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,093
Do you seriously want to gain acceptance?

162
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
Sometimes,

163
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,146
I think why you’ve been bugging us, though you can easily find someone new.

164
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,986
You probably feel embarrassed

165
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,466
about Karn and I dating. Oh, Toy.

166
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,006
Poor Toy,

167
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:14,010
you must not have a friend,

168
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,106
a real friend who sincerely stands by your side, right?

169
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,746
Do you really think people will accept your LGBT relationship?

170
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,046
It can end Karn’s future.

171
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,926
H*ll no. I’ve finally found my dream and future,

172
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,533
Get out of our lives.

173
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,653
Kris.

174
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,546
Yeah?

175
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,666
What does this mean?

176
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,133
Oh, we have to shoot another review.

177
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,193
The shooting is already scheduled.

178
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:25,060
Oh, I see. Okie.

179
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:31,060
Phew! That’s a relief. They’ve made up.

180
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:33,813
Right, I can breathe now.

181
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:37,900
Pud,

182
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,626
hey, Pud!

183
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,893
Don’t you care about anything?

184
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,093
None of your business.

185
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,040
He’s become strange after quarreling with Toy.

186
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,546
Pud, aren’t you interested in your sister?

187
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:55,460
They go much further than reconciliation.

188
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,506
Oh, Karn, where are you going?

189
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,500
Hmm. I’m going to the restroom.

190
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,506
What’s the matter?

191
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,726
It seems too obvious.

192
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,133
My babe texted me that she wanted to have a kiss.

193
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,130
Who can resist such temptation?

194
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:02,633
Kris!

195
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,160
You’re cute.

196
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:16,386
Easy, sweetheart.

197
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:20,160
It gives me a real thrill

198
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,413
to keep it secret from everyone.

199
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,220
But Pud might have known it.

200
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,880
He’s probably known it right from the start.

201
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,200
He always has eyes and ears on everything.

202
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,886
Will you tell them about us?

203
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,346
I’m ok with it,

204
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,506
but...

205
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:52,373
What is it?

206
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,800
I’m shy.

207
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,873
How could the wolf that’s going to eat me just now be embarrassed about revelation?

208
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:06,560
You have to understand me.

209
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:11,606
I’ve grown up with them, since secondary school.

210
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,793
I feel like they’re, sort of, my dad.

211
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,046
Give me some time.

212
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:20,260
Okie,

213
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,053
will you stay over at my place tonight?

214
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:32,160
Are you sending me the signal?

215
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,553
Will you accept the invitation?

216
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:39,420
Let’s get our things and go home.

217
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,440
What a fit. I’ve already finished my job.

218
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:43,600
Let’s go.

219
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:44,140
Let’s go.

220
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:49,400
Let’s go.

221
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:03,533
Let’s go.

222
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,726
Let’s go.

223
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:05,353
Off you go,

224
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:06,153
now.

225
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,506
You don’t let me go.

226
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,693
Apps Talk’s 3 golden boys
Guys, I’ve got something to tell you.

227
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,593
Karn

228
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:57,360
Yes?

229
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:02,010
Do you want to go for an audition?

230
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,533
What audition?

231
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,253
A senior told me that a studio is looking for a leading actress,

232
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,040
and the role really suits you.

233
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,453
Nope.

234
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,090
I’m 25 years old now, Kris.

235
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,620
What’s wrong with being 25?

236
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,106
You’re not that old, Karn, and I believe that you can do it.

237
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:39,980
Give me some time to think.

238
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,420
There, take it.

239
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,140
What? I haven’t done anything.

240
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:55,453
Why did you tell me to get it?

241
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,593
There, this is what we call take it.

242
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,400
Stop it.

243
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:04,440
Ticklish?

244
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:05,460
Stop it.

245
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,686
Naughty you.

246
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,173
I’m ticklish.

247
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:12,220
There you go.

248
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:14,886
Are you being h*orny to me?

249
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
I feel h*rny just to you.

250
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,233
Naughty girl,

251
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:24,300
you act like a shy girl in front of the others.

252
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,586
I really feel shy.

253
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,566
Hey,

254
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,760
won’t you tell them about us?

255
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,400
It’s ok to tell them about us.

256
00:21:56,753 --> 00:21:58,750
I mean telling everyone.

257
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,313
Are you embarrased about it?

258
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,980
No, I don’t feel embarrassed about you.

259
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,300
I know that,

260
00:22:16,946 --> 00:22:18,940
but it’s really ok with me to tell everryone.

261
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:23,900
What about your dream, Karn?

262
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,986
A relationship like ours can be judged,

263
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,633
even though there’s nothing wrong with it.

264
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,926
We won’t be able to tell anyone about our relationship

265
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,653
If I become an actress one day?

266
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,106
There could be the right time for us.

267
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:57,300
I think it’s ok.

268
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,706
We can see many boy-to-boy relationships.

269
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,420
Girls can also date one another, and people like it.

270
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:07,380
There’s nothing to worry, Kris.

271
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,586
To each their own, in deed.

272
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,960
Yet, not telling anyone about it is good for you.

273
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,846
But I want to let them know

274
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,480
how much we love each other.

275
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,720
Ok, if anyone asks me about us,

276
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:48,653
I’ll tlell them that you’re mine, sulky girl.

277
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,653
I’m sulky only around you.

278
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,320
No one can’t make up better than me.

279
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,780
Now, I’m becoming sulky.

280
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,060
Are you sulky again?

281
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,840
Stop it.

282
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,780
You’re always sulky, naughty girl.

283
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,700
You're playing rough.

284
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,480
You, too.

285
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,360
Today, you’re kind to me,

286
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:34,010
so I’ll reward you.

287
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,533
And.. cut.

288
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:39,740
Let me have a look at it.

289
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,586
I think the more we shoot a review, the prettier you look.

290
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,340
Of course, we’ve just got exercise together.

291
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,320
Exercise?

292
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,913
It turned out so great that I’m obsessed with it.

293
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,493
Aren’t you obsessed with it?

294
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,760
Naughty!

295
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,873
Dear My beloved one.

296
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,073
I’ve heard that every new beginning is always scary.

297
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,593
But my thought has changed when I met you.

298
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:33,066
Every new beginning is still scary.

299
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:37,640
But it might not be that scary if we travel together.

300
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,653
Such a poem lover as the same.

301
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,866
Today I’m sending you the song I wrote for you.

302
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,273
Let’s start a new beginning together. From Apple.

303
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,066
Just being someone close to you is good enough.

304
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,240
Just being someone beside you is probably enough.

305
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:45,193
Still watching you, you are so lovely. Such a good story.

306
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,986
I secretly looking at your IG story,

307
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:56,273
just wanting to know if you are okay now.

308
00:33:56,293 --> 00:34:00,253
But you probably don't know that I like you.

309
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:03,646
I have been waiting for a long time, loving you.

310
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:09,760
I surrender, and I’ll follow only you

311
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,033
‘coz I love you. Even though my heart is broken,

312
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:21,513
I just wish you all the best and all those great things you wish for.”

313
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,840
Kris

314
00:34:43,153 --> 00:34:45,006
You scares me.

315
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,940
What are you doing?

316
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,940
Apple is like a hero.

317
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:59,920
She will always be in front of me every time I need.

318
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,873
What about me?

319
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,166
Don't be mad, my love.

320
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:12,213
You are my heart.

321
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,210
If you say it like that, I'll feel really embarrassed.

322
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,980
One, two, three.

323
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,233
Hello. My name is Aonthakarn Rakthai.

Age 25 years. Height 155 centimetres. Weight 40 kilograms.

325
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:40,913
I’m currently working as a sports reporter and host on App Talk channel.

326
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:45,286
My hobbies are watching movies and listening to music.

327
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,366
My special talent is singing.

328
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,780
Hello. My name is Aonthakarn Rakthai.

329
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,113
Age 25 years. Height 155 centimetres. Weight 40 kilograms.

330
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,333
Movies and music are my pasttime.

331
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,353
Good job. Cut.

332
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,913
I think it is good.

333
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:16,973
Is that okay?

334
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:18,433
Okay. Really okay.

335
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,430
Okay, I think that will do.

336
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,833
Meen,

337
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:30,546
I want it to be more fulfilling, more seducing. Can you do that?

338
00:36:30,573 --> 00:36:34,413
The two of them are highly popular right now.

339
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,513
Fanclub might want to see more seducing pictures.

340
00:36:37,546 --> 00:36:39,510
Please. Do it a little more for me, please.

341
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:40,213
Okay.

342
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,793
Girls, this is not okay. Do like this.

343
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,546
You extend your foot.

344
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,200
And you hug her. Great.

345
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:47,760
Bring your face together. Bring your face together. Yes.

346
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:48,773
You hold your face still.

347
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,526
Shoot it like that.

348
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,260
Oh my gosh, it's so great.

349
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,840
I like it so much.

350
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,766
Make it like that. That’s right.

351
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,260
Okay, okay. Pose.

352
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,440
Satisfying, right?

353
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:03,326
Yes. That’s what I want.

354
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,846
Ok.

355
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,820
I guarantee the photobooks will be sold out.

356
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,586
- Thank you.
- 	Oh my gosh. It’s such a long day.

357
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,053
Thank you, Kong. You’re very talented.

358
00:37:12,073 --> 00:37:12,826
Let me see you off.

359
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:16,033
Girls, girls. Okay.

360
00:37:17,393 --> 00:37:21,766
You know, insiders say that these two are really dating.

361
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,340
Really? Are you crazy?

362
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,980
Positive. My friend works on set.

363
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:28,386
She said that they used to be friends.

364
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:30,506
And it's like a friend who breaks through the friend zone.

365
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:31,933
Oh my gosh. Really?

366
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:36,633
Well, let’s pack our things now so we can hurry home.

367
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,453
Okay, okay.

368
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,700
Natty, wanna go drinking?

369
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,826
I'm sorry, girl. I ovulated today. I have to be with my husband.

370
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,326
You're really something, Natty.

371
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:08,453
Hello. Chris, what are you doing?

372
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,806
Wanna go drinking?

373
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,593
I'm really sorry. I'm with Karn.

374
00:38:16,486 --> 00:38:17,630
She’s asleep.

375
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,526
Wait! Are you two dating?

376
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,100
Yes. We’re dating.

377
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,593
Since when? Why didn’t you tell us?

378
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:34,546
I’m very sorry. It’s been really hectic around here for me.

379
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,486
I’ll tell you when we meet.

380
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:41,386
Have you had sex with her?

381
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:44,373
Damn, Meen! You pervert!

382
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,360
I’m just kidding.

383
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,153
Friends are useless now that you’re dating.

384
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,900
Okay. I won’t bother you anymore.

385
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,360
Call me if you have anything.

386
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,860
Sure. I know. Okay. Bye.

387
00:39:12,273 --> 00:39:13,706
Then I’ll just go alone.

388
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,046
We’re closing now.

389
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,540
Do you want me to call a cab for you?

390
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:36,633
No, thank you. My friend is coming.

391
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Nat!

392
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Nat! Nat!

393
00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:50,946
Hello.

394
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,760
Come and take me home.

395
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:54,086
Wait! Are you drunk?

396
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:56,126
I told you but you didn't come.

397
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,220
That’s a pity.

398
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,093
Now come and take me home.

399
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,213
What did you eat? You’re so heavy.

400
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:35,210
What are you looking at?

401
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:37,706
Nothing.

402
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,566
What else are you going to scold me about?

403
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,513
Do you have a guilt?

404
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,946
Thank you.

405
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,193
You can sleep here.

406
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,113
No.

407
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,060
Just sleep.

408
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,633
No. I wanna sleep with you.

409
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:17,620
Damn, Meen!

410
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,800
You smell very good.

411
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,200
What the hell are you talking about?

412
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:23,953
I miss you.

413
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,946
You miss me?

414
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,220
Then why didn’t you come to see me?

415
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,513
Why didn’t you talk to me?

416
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,020
You have been ignoring me

417
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,980
since we entered university.

418
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:03,633
You only talk to Nat and Kris when you have anything.

419
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,173
What about me?

420
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,266
Am I not your best friend?

421
00:42:25,426 --> 00:42:27,420
What if everything is not the same anymore?

422
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,793
What do you mean?

423
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,080
I don't know since when.

424
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,433
Maybe it was because the weather was nice that day.

425
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,666
Or maybe it was because you were cuter that day than ever.

426
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,166
Hello. Aonthakarn speaking.

427
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,753
Yes. Yes.

428
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,420
. I passed it?

429
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,900
Next Wednesday. Sure. Of course, I can.

430
00:44:58,933 --> 00:44:59,560
What did she pass?

431
00:44:59,693 --> 00:45:01,273
Thank you very much.

432
00:45:02,706 --> 00:45:05,700
Kris, I can enter the audition round.

433
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,906
I made it. I got the main role.

434
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,000
I believe that you could do that.

435
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,106
Stop! What are you doing?

436
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:22,566
We’re happy.

437
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,700
We’re happy for Karn.

438
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,986
Excuse me? Flowers for Aonthakarn.

439
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,613
That's a really big bouquet of flowers.

440
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,610
Who gave it to you?

441
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,520
I saw it was from A.

442
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,120
What is that?

443
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:49,726
Someone close to me whose name starts with A can only be…

444
00:45:58,126 --> 00:45:59,333
Who’s that, Karn?

445
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,306
It’s probably be Apple.

446
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:08,473
I don’t think so, Karn.

447
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,546
Get in the frame now.

448
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:20,840
I can enter the audition round now.

449
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,273
Thank you everyone for supporting me.

450
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,353
I’ll do my best.

451
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,350
Who the hell was that?

452
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,200
Oh. Hi, Kris.

453
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,353
Hello, Kris.

454
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:54,880
Oh, there are the trainees. They’re doing an internship at our company.

455
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,433
This is Earn.

456
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,406
This is Case.

457
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,326
Does our company accept trainees?

458
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:08,573
Why are you saying that?

459
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,986
You didn’t read the messages in the group line, do you?

460
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:14,353
Do I look like I have a free time?

461
00:47:14,406 --> 00:47:16,153
You gave me a lot of work to do.

462
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,953
How am I supposed to find time to do anything?

463
00:47:18,973 --> 00:47:19,786
You always find an excuse.

464
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,313
I’m sorry, then.

465
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,946
Hello.

466
00:47:26,986 --> 00:47:27,866
Hello.

467
00:47:28,593 --> 00:47:30,060
Trainees, right?

468
00:47:32,453 --> 00:47:34,450
How come do you know?

469
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,086
They talked about it in the group line, Kris.

470
00:47:38,113 --> 00:47:38,966
See?

471
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,940
There, there. It’s alright.

472
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,346
Karn, don’t pamper her too much. She will be spoiled.

473
00:47:51,373 --> 00:47:52,140
It’s none of your business.

474
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,586
Kris, you look cool but also have a cute side.

475
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,540
Thank you, ma’am.

476
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:02,420
You don’t have to be too polite with me.

477
00:48:02,453 --> 00:48:03,760
We’re going to be colleagues soon.

478
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,760
You can call me Earn.

479
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,660
Okay, earn. You can call me Sis.

480
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:14,413
Since we’re going to be close.

481
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,473
Are you two dating?

482
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,366
We’re best friends.

483
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,333
Really?

484
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:47,973
Karn

485
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:51,893
What?

486
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,566
Are you sulky?

487
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:57,333
No.

488
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,006
This is called very sulky.

489
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:11,000
Are you jealous of me?

490
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,386
Umm.

491
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,786
I just met Earn today.

492
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,506
How could there be something?

493
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:23,146
It’s not about that.

494
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,753
When she asked if we were dating,

495
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:29,690
why did you say we were just friends.

496
00:49:31,413 --> 00:49:33,033
Oh, Karn.

497
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:38,150
You looks very scared.

498
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,473
Don’t you feel scared?

499
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,373
With someone close to us, I understand.

500
00:49:45,746 --> 00:49:47,370
But she’s a stranger.

501
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,746
And you’re going to act in a series.

502
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,300
If she talks about you in a bad way, what will you do?

503
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
Why do you always think for me?

504
00:49:59,973 --> 00:50:01,800
Because I’m worried about you.

505
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,000
Do you feel offended?

506
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,706
I just don’t get it.

507
00:50:14,926 --> 00:50:17,213
You make it seem like our thing is embarrassing.

508
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:20,850
I never thought like that.

509
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,333
I didn’t tell her because… You know it well. Because it’s…

510
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,153
Ouch! Darling, please be gentle.

511
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:31,300
Oh, I miss you so much, baby.

512
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:50,110
Where have all the others gone?

513
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,006
Did you hear that?

514
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,646
Daling... Baby…

515
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:29,046
We should tell everyone that we’re dating.

516
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,713
Baby?

517
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:36,493
Kris is so fussy. I’ll tell her later.

518
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:39,973
When are you going to tell everyone about us?

519
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:44,320
Damn, Pud. Why does it have to be here?

520
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:49,893
Soon, soon. Soon, my good girl.

521
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:09,880
What does Aonthakarn mean?

522
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,593
It means darkness.

523
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,453
Wrong answer.

524
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,653
Aonthakarn means lovely.

525
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,020
Yuck!

526
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,580
Same old trick.

527
00:53:33,766 --> 00:53:34,986
Still sulky?

528
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,246
I saw you secretly smiling.

529
00:53:39,086 --> 00:53:40,600
The corner of your mouth is twitching now.

530
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:46,020
Don’t be sulky. Please, Aonthakarn.

531
00:53:56,293 --> 00:53:57,173
You want more?

532
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,246
Are you still sulky?

533
00:54:02,486 --> 00:54:05,426
Oh, why is it so hard for you to stop being sulky?

534
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,886
You’re not sulky now,

535
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,313
are you?

536
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:10,373
Hmm?

537
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,006
Okay, I’m not sulky now.

538
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:17,986
You know well that I still stop being sulky if you do this.

539
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,680
Because I am your girlfriend. How could I not know that?

540
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,880
Sorry for being silly.

541
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,033
I’m sorry, too.

542
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,580
Sorry for being a bad girlfriend.

543
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,813
I understand that you’re worried about me.

544
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:44,840
I understand your reason, too.

545
00:54:47,353 --> 00:54:49,560
I just feel bad.

546
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,680
I get it now, Karn.

547
00:54:53,653 --> 00:55:00,186
Then, if you ‘re okay with it, I won’t keep it a secret anymore.

548
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,053
But I won’t announce it.

549
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,326
If anyone knows, it’s fine.

550
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:15,340
If anyone asks me, I’ll say that we’re dating.

551
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:18,486
Umm.

552
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,960
Sorry for being a bad girlfriend.

553
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,900
You’re always the best for me.

554
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,440
My cheeks are all puffy now.

555
00:55:39,826 --> 00:55:41,060
But, Kris,

556
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:46,293
your brother is very naughty.

557
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,506
What are you talking about?

558
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:52,400
I almost forgot it. The image is stuck in my mind.
I always thought that Pud is strong.

559
00:55:52,446 --> 00:55:54,126
But being able to easily carry Earn like that…

560
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,153
Enough! Now, naughty girl.

561
00:55:56,173 --> 00:55:57,360
He carried Earn.

562
00:55:58,353 --> 00:55:59,166
Enough!

563
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,086
Now! I am strong, too.

564
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:08,266
Do you want to prove that I am just as hot?

565
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,120
I want to prove it now.

566
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,580
But we’re at work.

567
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:12,120
I don’t see anyone else. It’s just the two of us.

568
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:13,953
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

569
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:22,993
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish you all the best and all those great things you wish for.

570
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:31,026
I wanna be that person of your dream, get close to you, and stay with you all the way.

571
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:39,533
If our feelings are mutual, could I be your boo? Could I be your boo? Could I be your boo?””
