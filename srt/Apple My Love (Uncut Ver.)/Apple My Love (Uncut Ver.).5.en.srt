1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
The series is not based on a true story, individuals, places,
or organizations.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:17,440
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,920
Even though my heart is broken,

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,240
I just wish you all the best and all those great things you wish for.

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,840
I wanna be that person of your dream,

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,720
get close to you, and stay with you all the way.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,080
If our feelings are mutual, could I be your boo?”

8
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,600
Pud.

9
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,400
When did you install a CCTV at the company?

10
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Where is the clip?

11
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,240
Give it to me.

12
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,360
What clip?

13
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,440
Hey, what are you doing?

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,280
Did you see it?

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,480
What did I see?

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,480
I haven’t seen anything.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,280
Pud, are you playing games with me?

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,080
What’s wrong? Why are you staring at me like that?

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,080
Do you think you’re the only person who sees something secretive?

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,960
What did you mean?

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,600
Easy, babe.

22
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,200
-I miss you, boo.
- Hey!!

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
Since when?

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,200
Since the beginning.

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:25,480
I never think that an uncle like you will have an affair with a girl. Oh, my god.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,920
What’s going on? Are you shy?

27
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,800
I’ve never seen you acting this way.

28
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,120
It’s just worth it to see.

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,800
Oh, look at your face.

30
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,320
Here it is.

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,760
Give it to me.

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,040
No.

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:06,560
Do you really think that I’ll die alone? Never!

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,560
Pud!

35
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,760
You want it? Fetch it.

36
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,400
You can’t reach it.

37
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,480
There, can you reach it?

38
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,960
Give it to me, please.

39
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,920
Please.

40
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,200
But you must give me a promise that you won’t tell this to anyone.

41
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,960
Promise?

42
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,240
I promise,

43
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
give it to me.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Delete it.

45
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,600
Ok.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,680
I’ll delete it for you. Wait a second.

47
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,840
Let me see.

48
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,120
If I do, you’ll see something else.

49
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,280
How could I know that you really delete it then?

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,160
There you go.

51
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,120
Ok.

52
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,840
Pud! Kris! Why are you so noisy, quarreling again?

53
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,880
I’ll tell on you.

54
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,080
Mom, Pus is teasing me again. Ouch. It hurts.

55
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,720
Mom, that’s a lie. Don’t listen to her.

56
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,600
Ouch, Pud is hitting my head. My head is broken. Ouch, mom.

57
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,480
Mom, Kris is hurting me. Ouch.

58
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,200
Kris is hurting me.

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,400
Mom, don’t listen to her. Mom.

60
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,840
Mom. Mommy.

61
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,600
Mommy.

62
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,840
Why is a brother always teasing a sister? Ouch.

63
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,720
Mom, I didn’t do anything.

64
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,720
Pud is picking on me.

65
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,560
I didn’t do anything, mom.

66
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,480
That’s enough, you two. You both are grown-ups.

67
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,240
That’s not true, mom.

68
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,960
-And you’re still fighting.
- But she’s still shorter than a dog.

69
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,960
Mom, see?

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,920
That’s enough.

71
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,760
So, why are you quarreling?

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,520
Pud has a girlfriend, dad.

73
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,600
Hey, Kris!

74
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,560
Really?

75
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
Explain it. What girl?

76
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
What’s going on?

77
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,080
I don’t have anyone, mom. Kris’s just talking silly.

78
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,240
Silly talking? I’ve seen it with my own eyes that he…

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,520
What did he do?

80
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Dad and mom are not strangers.

81
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,320
That's right.

82
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,360
I’m only seeing her.

83
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,960
I’ve just known her for a while.

84
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,200
She helped me when I quarreled with Toy.

85
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,760
Really? So, your dad and I have to say thank you to her.

86
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,600
I agree.

87
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,840
I’ve just known it.

88
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,120
Earn witnessed to the quarrel,

89
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,160
and she separated me from toy. Also, she was a witness for me.

90
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,240
Oh, so, does she know Toy?

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,920
Their parents know each other, but they’re not close.

92
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,280
So, how is your relationship going with her? Are you happy?

93
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,120
Extremely happy.

94
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,560
Great. You should invite her to see your dad and me when can.

95
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,400
But Kris is also dating.

96
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,360
Hey.

97
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,760
-That’s interesting.
-Are you serious?

98
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,840
How is it going?

99
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,680
Really?

100
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,320
Well…

101
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,320
Not Toh or Jess, right?

102
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,400
Dad, with Toh or Jess? That has a snowball's chance in hell.

103
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,920
Well, they’re good.

104
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,920
Nope.

105
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,200
Who are you dating?

106
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
My colleague.

107
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,720
Invite him home to see us.

108
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,360
That’s right. I want to see him.

109
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,760
Bring

110
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,240
Her colleague.

111
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,000
Her colleague is calling her now, dad.

112
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,520
Gotcha!

113
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,520
Speak of the Devil.

114
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,520
Hello, Karn.

115
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Hello, Kris.

116
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
What did Pud say about the clip?

117
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,800
Don’t worry, Karn.

118
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,760
He deleted it before me. The clip doesn’t exist anymore.

119
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,440
Whew! That’s a relief.

120
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Have you called me just for this?

121
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
I thought you missed me.

122
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,120
Does my sweetheart miss me?

123
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, I do. I miss you so much.

124
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,720
I miss you, too.

125
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,880
Kris.

126
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,000
Hello. Kris.

127
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes?

128
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
I thought I’ve lost you coz you stayed quiet.

129
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,800
I/m afraid I’ll run to you now, and I have to be patient.

130
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,520
Do you have time tomorrow? I think I’ll tidy up the house.

131
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,600
Will you come to help me, Kris?

132
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,120
Ok. I have no plan for tomorrow.

133
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,120
Thank you so much.

134
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,360
I’m delighted that we’re dating.

135
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,840
So do I.

136
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,080
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

137
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,480
Bye.

138
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,440
These are recent photos.

139
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,200
Mom, dad,

140
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
we need to talk.

141
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,920
Will you be disappointed

142
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
if I have a girlfriend?

143
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,200
Not at all.

144
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,440
If you love someone, we’ll love them, too.

145
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,280
If you’re happy, we’ll be happy, too.

146
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,800
But I’m never successful at anything,

147
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,920
unlike Pud. He always succeeds at everything he does.

148
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,640
I have a history of failure, but I haven’t told you.

149
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,120
But I gave mom and dad a hard time for 3 years

150
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,680
because I was stubborn working in film production and finally had the accident.

151
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,680
I don’t want to disappoint both of you once again.

152
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,600
I am proud of you every day.

153
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,040
So do I.

154
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,120
My daughter is beautiful, great, and brave to be yourself.

155
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,440
This is just so good.

156
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,120
I’m sorry, dad. I’m sorry, mom.

157
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,840
What are you sorry for?

158
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,120
You don’t have to apologize us for anything.

159
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,760
My puppy is now crying like a baby.

160
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,640
Such a crybaby.

161
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,880
What's going on?

162
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
Sit here, Kris.

163
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
It’s an injustice, mom.

164
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,400
Kris, are you happy now?

165
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,280
I’m really happy, dad.

166
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,120
Invite her home when you can.

167
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,280
I want to know if she’s as beautiful as I am or not.

168
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh, no one is as beautiful as my mom.

169
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,080
Do you want something saying that?

170
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,120
I want this.

171
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,520
Go to your mom.

172
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,760
Oh, come here.

173
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,400
I’ll hug her,

174
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,640
Let’s do this.

175
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,360
This belongs to little Miss Onthakarn.

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,360
Don’t go through my things. This blouse is from my childhood.

177
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,800
Why? It looks so cute. Such a small blouse.

178
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,960
What’s wrong?

179
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,440
Are you sulky?

180
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,640
Just a kiss?

181
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,200
What do you want?

182
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,160
What’s a matter?

183
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,520
Are you teasing me?

184
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
No, I’m not.

185
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,360
Let’s save the best for last.

186
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,120
You’re naughty mimicking my words.

187
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,080
I told my parents about us.

188
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,160
What did they say?

189
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,120
They wondered… how beautiful you are to win my heart.

190
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,680
What did you tell them?

191
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,520
I didn’t say anything.

192
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,600
Oh, why? Am I not pretty?

193
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,160
No, I was crying.

194
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:19,160
There, there. It’s ok. Shhh.

195
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,560
I’m all right.

196
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,920
Let’s continue to do the tidy-up before nightfall.

197
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,600
Ok.

198
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,640
Let me fold it.

199
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Well, have you cleaned your mom’s room?

200
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,960
I haven’t entered her room since the cremation day.

201
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
I’m a terrible child.

202
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,120
That’s all right, Karn. Don’t worry.

203
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,680
I can’t even look at her photos.

204
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,520
I’m afraid I’ll...

205
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,440
Let my clean your mom’s room.

206
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,640
So, I can introduce myself to your mom.

207
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,760
Thank you.

208
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,800
She looked cute as usual.

209
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,200
Kris.

210
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,080
Kris, what’s happened?

211
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
Have you read this letter?

212
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Could you put it back where you found it?

213
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,440
Why?

214
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,800
I don’t want to read it.

215
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,120
I may contain something important, you should read it.

216
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,040
Why do you want me to read it?

217
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,040
I don’t know.

218
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,080
I don’t want to miss her.

219
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:35,520
If I read the letter, I must admit that she’s already gone.

220
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,160
How could I go on all by myself?

221
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,360
Karn, I’m sorry.

222
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,640
I didn’t mean to hurt you.

223
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,200
If you’re ready to read it,

224
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,240
just tell me. I’ll be there for you.

225
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,480
Ok.

226
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,440
Hello.

227
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,040
Hello.

228
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Really?

229
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,320
Next week?

230
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,880
Ok. Yes, I will.

231
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,480
Thank you very much.

232
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,120
Goodbye.

233
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,200
What’s happened?

234
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,360
Kris.

235
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,640
I’ve passed the first round of the audition.

236
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,400
You’ve passed it the first round?

237
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,880
Yes.

238
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,480
Really?

239
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:54,960
Yes.

240
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,160
I’m happy for you. You’re the best, great one.

241
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,480
I’m so excited.

242
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,040
I’ll fall down.

243
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,440
Thank you.

244
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,680
Why did you thank me?

245
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,680
All this happened because you’re great and determined.

246
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,120
Is this all you can give me?

247
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,720
No.

248
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,800
It’s time to reward my boo.

249
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,120
Wait.

250
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,640
How about a special meal?

251
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,080
Wait for a second, my boo.

252
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,200
I’ll prepare you the great one for you.

253
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,840
Eh? Onthakarn’s mother used to be at our school?

254
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,040
I think you. She’s so familiar.

255
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,480
Are you serious?

256
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,840
Is that true? What a small worl.

257
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,320
Can you remember which class she taught?

258
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,920
No, I can’t.

259
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,800
Well, why don’t you ask Karn?

260
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,200
Well.

261
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,720
Alas, you fool.

262
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,200
Your question is too difficult.

263
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,600
There were a hundred of teachers. Can you recognize all of them?

264
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,360
Nope. I’ve never remembered such thing.

265
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,440
Nat only recognized PE Teacher, Miss Bow. Can you remember that?

266
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,160
Yes, I do.

267
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,520
Oh, you got it right.

268
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,400
She’s her type.

269
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,600
That’s right. The teacher was really pretty and good at Basketball.

270
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,480
My girl crush was so cool.

271
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,480
Khanisa, thank you so much.

272
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,760
Thank you.

273
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,680
If I’m in trouble one day,

274
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,000
your child will help me, too.

275
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,080
It’s ok.

276
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,560
Miss Phitsamai.

277
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,640
It’s Miss Phitsamai.

278
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,040
Hmm?

279
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,120
Her child had an accident, and I donated blood for her.

280
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,840
Oh, she was that girl.

281
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,480
Onthakarn.

282
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,480
Gosh!!!

283
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,400
Gosh, I’m getting goose bumps.

284
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,160
Will you tell Karn this?

285
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,000
Oh, why?

286
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,760
She still can’t get over her mom.

287
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,160
I don’t want to reopen her wound.

288
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,320
But this is destiny.

289
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,800
Will you just let it go?

290
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,840
True.

291
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,320
Guys,

292
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,840
I want your advice.

293
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,160
Karn wants to give me a present.

294
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,680
Do you want to change your birthday?

295
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,040
No, it’s not that kind of presents. It’s a present that…

296
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,120
What kind of presents?

297
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,600
Hey, don’t pretend. You know it.

298
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,640
Oh, you’re going to slow.

299
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,480
I slept with my boyfriend on our first date.

300
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,400
Hmm?

301
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,840
I’m not you.

302
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,040
I feel embarrassed to tell this kind of stuff to you all.

303
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,600
It’s ok. We’re happy for you.

304
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,440
Good job, Kris.

305
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,480
No, give me a moment.

306
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,400
I want you to suggest me what to do.

307
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,320
I’m awkward.

308
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,040
Let me teach you.

309
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,160
Whoa!

310
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,080
You slept with a girl?

311
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,800
Slept with a girl? No, I haven’t.

312
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,160
Hey, I read about it. You can learn it through the media.

313
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,880
I’m tensed.

314
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
I don’t know who I can talk to about this.

315
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,560
I’m afraid I’ll become awkward on the day.

316
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,680
You’ve come to the right place and the right guy.

317
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,520
You don’t have to ask anyone but Sol and me.

318
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,440
Hey, do you know Sol is an expert?

319
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,560
No, I’m not. I just like reading Yuri novels.

320
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,560
I’m not an expert.

321
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,880
Oh, I’m just kidding. Why are you yelling?

322
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,880
I know you just read Yuri novels.

323
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,120
If you want to do it properly, you have to research.

324
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,680
Wowww, she opened up a whole new world of Yuri novels for me.

325
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,240
Dis she?

326
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,040
Sol.

327
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,840
Sol.

328
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,840
Sol.

329
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,520
Wait.

330
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,600
Sol.

331
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,920
We can talk later. I’ve got something to do today.

332
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,320
Sol, talk to me.

333
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,480
I’m sorry.

334
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,320
I was drunk that night.

335
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,640
I didn’t mean to do it.

336
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,320
You didn’t mean to?

337
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,960
Didn’t you mean to kiss me?

338
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,760
What are you talking about?

339
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,960
Why did you kiss me in the classroom?

340
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
You’ve known it the whole time.

341
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,400
Why don’t you say something?

342
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,400
Say something?

343
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,600
What do you want me to say?

344
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,720
My close friend kissed me?

345
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,120
Do you have any idea how long I’ve stayed with this horrible feeling?

346
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Why did you this to me, Meen?

347
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,760
Sol.

348
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,960
Sol, wait.

349
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
Where are you going?

350
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,400
Stop treating me like a fool and doing the heck you want.

351
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
I also have a heart.

352
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,400
Sol,

353
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,120
sol, listen to me, please.

354
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,360
I’ve had it.

355
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,120
Leave me alone.

356
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
Sol, I’m sorry.

357
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,040
I don’t care how you feel for me or hate me. F*ck this sh*t.

358
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,520
I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Sol.

359
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,520
Listen to me, please. Sol.

360
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,080
Please.

361
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,240
Sol,

362
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,440
I like you.

363
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,840
I’m sorry,

364
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,840
but I like you.

365
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,920
I’ve never known that a person like Meen could stick in her throat.

366
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,920
I’m sorry.

367
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,800
Because of me, our friend group has broken...

368
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,440
Hey, don’t say that our group has broken up.

369
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,840
It hasn’t. I’m gonna smack you.

370
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,560
I’ve screwed it up, Kris.

371
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,320
Meen, think of yourself.

372
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,120
Don’t just worry about other people.

373
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,560
Now I’m worrying about you just like you worried about me back then.

374
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,000
I’ve been trying hard.

375
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,600
I try not to bother her,

376
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,000
I've tried to ignore my feelings,

377
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,600
not to feel anything, and not to be interested in her.

378
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,760
I think the feeling might be gone some day.

379
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,760
Since when?

380
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,640
Since we were in high school.

381
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,760
Whoa! How could you stay with such feeling for so long?

382
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,040
Why don’t you tell us?

383
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,920
We’re mortally offended.

384
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,920
What should I do?

385
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,440
You just have to accept

386
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,240
that you like her,

387
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,520
that you love her.

388
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
She must hate me now.

389
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,920
Meen, calm down.

390
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,200
Do you really think that Sol is that kind of a person?

391
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
You’ve known her before us.

392
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,280
Will Sol hate someone because of that kind of stuff?

393
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
I see.

394
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,280
Right?

395
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,280
Yet, like I said earlier, she already hates me.

396
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,800
Hey, I’ve told you to calm down.

397
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,960
What happened happened.

398
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,720
Likewise, our feelings are there,

399
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,160
and we cannot change them.

400
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,640
Thanks.

401
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:04,320
Have you talked to her?

402
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,000
See?

403
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,880
You’ve got to talk to her frankly.

404
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,360
Give me a second. I’ll be right back.

405
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,520
What’s going on over there?

406
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,360
She’s having a hard time here.

407
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,760
Let me talk to calm her down.

408
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,520
Are you getting angry with her?

409
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,120
I don’t know.

410
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,840
If you’re not angry,

411
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,080
are you confused?

412
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,000
Confused? What am I confused about?

413
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,040
You could be confused about how you’re feeing for Meen.

414
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,240
Stop repeating it.

415
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,920
Don’t get too emotional.

416
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,240
Thank you.

417
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,480
Do you enjoy it?

418
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,680
Eat properly.

419
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,680
Your mouth is a mess.

420
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,440
Thank you.

421
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,360
Hmm, yes.

422
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:19,040
Thank you. Well, do you refer the special meal to this?

423
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,400
Oh, am I disappointing you?

424
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,560
Nope.

425
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,840
You stay the same drinking some water

426
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,400
when getting shy.

427
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,000
You drank water all the time when we first met.

428
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,560
It happened a long time, Karn.

429
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,960
Please forget it.

430
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,080
I can’t forget it coz you were so cute back then.

431
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,880
How about now?

432
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,120
You’re even cuter.

433
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,200
This is a reward for my great girlfriend.

434
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,200
And this is a reward for my great girlfriend.

435
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,160
Karn, don’t gulp it down like that.

436
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,160
Why?

437
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,920
Today we can get drunk.

438
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,600
No, you can’t.

439
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,120
What do you mean by that?

440
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,160
If you get drunk,

441
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,680
you will forget everything after this.

442
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,280
I will feel so sorry.

443
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,600
Wait a minute.

444
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,920
Aren’t you waiting?

445
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,840
I’m waiting for it,

446
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
but I’d like to take a sip first.

447
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
You’ve become a greater girl.

448
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,320
Don’t you like it?

449
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,160
I do cherish you.

450
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:22,200
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

451
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish you all the best and all those great things you wish for.

452
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:39,280
I wanna be that person of your dream, get close to you, and stay with you all the way.

453
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:47,760
If our feelings are mutual, could I be your boo? Could I be your boo? Could I be your boo?””
