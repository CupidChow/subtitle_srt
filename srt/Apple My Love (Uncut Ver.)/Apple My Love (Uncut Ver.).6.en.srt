00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
The series is not based on a true story, individuals, places, or organizations.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,220
“I surrender,

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,600
and I’ll follow only you

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,840
‘coz I love you. Even though my heart is broken,

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:26,420
I just wish you all the best and all those great things you wish for.

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,770
I wanna be that person

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,040
of your dream,

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,500
get close to you,

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,680
and stay with you all the way.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,730
If our feelings are mutual,

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,010
could I be your boo?”

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,410
Could I be your boo?”

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,320
Could I be your boo?”

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,660
Karn and Kris are close friends.

15
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,400
Close friends?

16
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,600
Kris, wait. Talk to me.

17
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,700
What do we have to talk?

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,890
Listen to me.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,210
What should I listen to? Everything is clear.

20
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,310
I try to be a good lover

21
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,880
and become more confident so you won’t be 	embarrassed because of me.

22
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,130
Now look what you’ve done.

23
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,890
I know. I just want to explain to Pen-Eak so that he...

24
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,430
I’m just your friend, aren’t I?

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,420
No, it is not what you’re thinking.

26
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,420
I just want to wait until everything is in order,

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,890
and I’ll tell Pen-Eak about us.

28
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,570
Waiting until everything is in order?

29
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,160
When? One year, five years, or until you become famous?

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,490
Don’t you see what he wants?

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,130
Or you may see him through but want to use your charm?

32
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,610
Don’t insult me, Kris.

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,100
Isn’t it true?

34
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,350
You didn’t want to publicize our relationship at first.

35
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,240
You even did this to me first.

36
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,850
Why don’t you understand me when I ask you to wait?

37
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,420
Is this my fault?

38
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,500
No, it isn’t.

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,880
We promised each other since that night that we would announce our relationship.

40
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,920
Lovers don’t lie to one another, Karn.

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,620
Kris, wait. Kris, talk to me.

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,660
Get off me, Karn.

43
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,900
Calm down, Karn.

44
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,490
Let me talk to her.

45
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,940
Take it easy, Karn.

46
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,100
Kris.

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,730
Kris, come and talk to me.

48
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,090
-Kris.
-What’s going on, son?

49
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,840
It’s a long story.

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,300
I’ll tell you later.

51
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,960
Kris.

52
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,330
I want to be alone.

53
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,100
Pud, I think you should give her some time to settle down.

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,620
That’s right.

55
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,680
Well, I’m afraid that she will...

56
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,320
Kris is not that kind of a person.

57
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,840
You’re right.

58
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,360
Ok, son?

59
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,500
Kris, your mom, Pud, and I are always here for you.

60
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,810
You can come to us anytime

61
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,970
Boo, are you free tonight?

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,110
Baby, I’m not free tonight because Kris is betrayed by Karn.

63
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,110
What did you mean by that?

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,500
It’s a long story.

65
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,890
I’ll tell you later.

66
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,820
I have to take care of my sister tonight.

67
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,420
What? Karn is cheating on Kris?

68
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,860
How can she do that? That’s awful.

69
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
Hello. You’re calling me at the right time.

70
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,320
I’ve got something to tell you.

71
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,240
Pud’s 	sister is betrayed.

72
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,190
Who is her lover?

73
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,670
A person in the entertainment circle.

74
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,380
A news reporter called Onthakarn.

75
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,990
She’s quiet but wicked.

76
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,660
Whoa! Which one?

77
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,090
I’ll send you an interesting clip

78
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,040
I secretly downloaded. Don’t tell anyone.

79
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,260
Earn, you mistakenly sent it to our Faculty’s LINE group chat.

80
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,530
Oh, sh*t. D*mn it.

81
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:42,580
Kris, I’m terribly sorry. Please give me another chance.
-	Kris, I’m terribly sorry. Please give me another chance.

82
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,170
This is all my fault.
-This is all my fault.

83
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,820
I can’t live without you.
- I can’t live without you.

84
00:06:53,090 --> 00:07:03,370
Kris, I’m terribly sorry. Please give me another chance.
This is all my fault. I can’t live without you.

85
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,530
“I miss you so much.”

86
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,460
I can’t even get angry with you for a day.

87
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,400
Talk Talk App: “I miss you so much.”

88
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,060
I miss you, too, Karn.

89
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,110
Talk Talk App: Kris give a heart to the message, “I miss you so much”

90
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,120
Talk Talk App: Kris give a heart to the message, “I miss you so much”
-	Do you think it’s her?

91
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,310
I think so, but I’m not sure.

92
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,980
It’s her, Onthakarn.

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,410
Isn’t it? I think so.

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,930
really?

95
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,690
But is it really possible?

96
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,150
A friend: Is this you, Onthakarn?
-A friend: Is this you, Onthakarn?

97
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,460
Kris’s typing “I miss you, Karn”

98
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,030
Hello, Karn.

99
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,880
I miss you, too.

100
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,100
Are you pleased, Kris?

101
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,350
Why am I pleased?

102
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,350
You want me to be yours.

103
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,940
You must be satisfied now.

104
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,190
Wait a second, Karn. What’s going on?

105
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,090
Kris, come one. You’re doomed, Kris.

106
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,060
What’s a matter, Pud?

107
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,950
It’s not the time to sit down and cry. Look at this.

108
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,320
D*rn it. How could this ever happen?

109
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,470
I have no idea.

110
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,020
Pud, how come? You said you deleted it.

111
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,260
I did delete it and you saw me do it.

112
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,580
You’re the only person who has the clip.

113
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,090
Karn must think I uploaded it online.

114
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,090
Pud, get out of my way.

115
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,520
Karn,

116
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,770
I didn’t post it. Karn.

117
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,680
Get out.

118
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,900
I didn’t really did it, Karn.

119
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,360
It doesn’t matter who did it.

120
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,210
Don’t you understand? It’s over now.

121
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,250
Karn, but I can do anything for you.

122
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,040
We can tell everyone that we’re not in a relationship, and I’ll...

123
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,260
What possible good would it do?

124
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,870
Don’t you see all the adverse comments on 	me?

125
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,950
They call me a shameless actress.

126
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,980
It's only a tiny minority of people who say that.

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,980
You’re not what they say, aren’t you?

128
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,200
I don’t have a chance

129
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,200
because you’ve already ruined it.

130
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,640
You’ve shattered my dream

131
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,650
and my life.

132
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,300
Just get out.

133
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,160
I’m sorry. I’m genuinely sorry, Karn.

134
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,880
I can’t take this anymore, Kris.

135
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,400
I don’t want to cry owing to you any longer.

136
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,770
We love one another, but why haven’t I been happy at all?

137
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,910
We shouldn’t have met.

138
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,700
My life would have been better without you in it.

139
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,870
What you’ve said may be true.

140
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,020
If you hadn’t met me, you life would have been better.

141
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,270
I want you to be happy.

142
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,140
Let’s break up.

143
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,770
Kris.

144
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,020
ris, listen to me.

145
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,750
Kris.

146
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,950
It’s all my fault.

147
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,320
I thought less

148
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,550
and got angry with Karn about her betrayal,

149
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,850
so I voicedd my anger to Earn.

150
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,690
Yet, I didn’t expect her to save it.

151
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,150
Then what?

152
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,330
Then what? Huh?

153
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,200
It’s all over now, Pud.

154
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,750
We’ve broken up. Do you hear me?

155
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,750
Do you understand, Pud?

156
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,250
Kris, I’m sorry.

157
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,100
I’m really sorry.

158
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,250
Leave me alone,

159
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,320
and don’t do anything.

160
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,180
Stay clear of me, ok?

161
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,350
Kris.

162
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,270
Kris.

163
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,600
Kris, are you ok?

164
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,930
Right. I saw the news.

165
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,510
Am I looking ok?

166
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,550
Darn. Kris’s eyes are swollen.

167
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:17,460
I broke up with Karn.

168
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,160
Eh?

169
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,600
Really?

170
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,930
Have you talked to her earnestly?

171
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,090
Nope, I don’t think you sensibly talked to her.

172
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,320
I did talk to her.

173
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:42,260
She said that she shouldn’t meet me

174
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:50,130
and that she wasn’t happy with me.

175
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,720
Oh, how could she said such thing?

176
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,550
Absolutely.

177
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
I’d better leave her

178
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,960
and find someone who appreciates you.

179
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,120
Don’t blame her.

180
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,330
Oh, I’m sensing a broken trust.

181
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,130
Let’s not blame Karn

182
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,820
coz she faces dishonor most in this situation.

183
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,970
Kris is not in the entertainment circle.

184
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,870
I think you all should calm down and discuss later.

185
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,140
There’s no difference between you and Karn.

186
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,780
Do find out who posted the clip online?

187
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,100
Earn, Pud’s girlfriend.

188
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,100
Oh!! What’s even more astounding is the fact that Pud has a girlfriend.

189
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,610
She’s a trainee in our company.

190
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,490
D*mn it. She’s wicked.

191
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,980
Why did she do that?

192
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,660
I have no idea, and I don’t want to know.

193
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,940
Karn won’t come back to me anyway.

194
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,380
How could you do that?

195
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,290
I didn’t mean to, Pud.

196
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,500
Kris, what’s going on?

197
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,700
I’ll be right back.

198
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,100
Hey, Kris.

199
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,060
Wait.

200
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,750
Kris.

201
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,110
Do you have any idea that you hurt someone, Earn?

202
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,630
I just wanted to send the clip to my friend, but I sent it to the wrong chat.

203
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,010
I was also angry about the fact that Kris was cheated.

204
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,550
Did I told you that Kris was cheated?

205
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
You don’t know anything and posted the clip.

206
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,440
Both of them have broken up, Earn.

207
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,680
How could you take responsibility for this?

208
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,700
That’s good for them.

209
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,760
They’ll break up anyway when Karn becomes an actress.

210
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,710
Earn!

211
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,140
Pud!

212
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,470
Even though Karn cheated on Kris, you have no right to judge anyone.

213
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,120
I know.

214
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,360
Who do you think you are?

215
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,380
I know what I did was wrong, but I didn’t mean to.

216
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,020
You’ve disappointed me.

217
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,780
Let’s break up.

218
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,660
No, Pud.

219
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
I didn’t mean to do so. I’m sorry.

220
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,980
It’s my fault I trusted you too much.

221
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,150
Pud, no. I’m sorry.

222
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,640
I’ll apologize to Kris and Karn.

223
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,020
Let’s take responsibility for this.

224
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,970
Pud, please don’t break up with me.

225
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,000
Pud, don’t you love me?

226
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,740
I love my sister more than you.

227
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,280
Are you dead?

228
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:32,870
Yep.

229
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,360
Darn, come on.

230
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,690
Consider it a short-term relationship.

231
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,980
Well, Nat.

232
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,900
You also said that when you broke up with Joe for the first time.

233
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,280
Well, Sol.

234
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,920
Hey, stop.

235
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,920
Look at her face.

236
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,580
Is Kris enjoying your silly talk?

237
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,930
I don’t want to break up with her.

238
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,200
Oh, you told her to break up.

239
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,480
But I don’t want to break up with her for real.

240
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,730
Yet, she was not happy with you.

241
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,730
Why will you be together?

242
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,240
Think carefully.

243
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:23,410
If she really loves you, she’ll publicize your relationship and

244
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
won’t make you wait.

245
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,620
But I think it’s difficult

246
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,020
because there are a lot of trolls who like to judge people on social media.

247
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,140
There’s good fortune in misfortune though.

248
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,580
I think A-Plus has a distinct smell to it.

249
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,890
The inner circle said their contracts are unfair

250
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,150
and that some actors and actresses must have off-the-record, private meeting with some guests.

251
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,870
Don’t they press charges?

252
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,230
The company is powerful,

253
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,410
and A-Plus is only its subsidiary.

254
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,740
The rest of them are million-THB companies.

255
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,090
How is Karn doing then?

256
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,720
I heard that Pen-Eak didn’t extend the contract.

257
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,250
Their customers may not want an actress in a blaze of publicity.

258
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,280
This is all my fault.

259
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,130
Oh, Kris,

260
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,520
stop blaming yourself.

261
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,750
When you were in a relationship, you loved each other, didn’t you?

262
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,970
There is no right or wrong in love.

263
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,690
I know you can do it, girl.

264
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,340
Well, you can rather blame other people than yourself.

265
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,170
Where did you learn that r*bbish?

266
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,410
The netizens.

267
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,920
Oh, my lil’ Kris.

268
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,110
God, you dumb*ss.

269
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,720
What’s wrong with you?

270
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,690
I can’t live without her.

271
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,760
How did you live before meeting her?

272
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:03,780
Without her, you just live on your own.

273
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:11,670
Pal, when I had her, I was happy and felt better and better every day.

274
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,470
Was she really unhappy back then?

275
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,370
Well, I don’t have to be her girlfriend.

276
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,210
I can be anything to her.

277
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:30,550
I just want to see that she’s all right.

278
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,580
Kris, you’ve got a manly heart.

279
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,580
What about letters, Kris?

280
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,190
What about Ms. Apple?

281
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,260
You can cheer her up through Ms. Apple’s letters.

282
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,010
Yeah, that sounds great.

283
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,750
Apple.

284
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:07,350
Talk Talk App: Karn is offline.

285
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,380
Did we break up for real, Onthakarn?

286
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,770
I’ll forever be your Apple, Onthakarn.

287
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,600
Onthakarn, someone left a letter for you.

288
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,110
Thank you.

289
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,780
(On the envelop) Dear my beloved one.

290
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,380
Dear my beloved one.

291
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,890
How are you doing?

292
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,950
Do you eat properly each day?

293
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,690
Have you got some sleep?

294
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:04,500
Someone once said misery is like wind that will blow away some day.

295
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:10,400
You may not feel happy today, but it doesn’t mean that you can’t laugh tomorrow.

296
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:18,640
Just know that no matter something happens or changes,

297
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:24,010
I will always and forever be your Apple.

298
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,780
From Apple.

299
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,350
Things with me and Karn are as good as they can possibly be.

300
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,430
Kris.

301
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,530
Kris.

302
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,950
Hey, get up. Don’t do this.

303
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,800
I’m terribly sorry.

304
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,220
I know it.

305
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
I didn’t mean to,

306
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:49,150
and I know that my apology cannot fix anything, but, well...

307
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,900
Well...

308
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,930
I accept your apology.

309
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,200
I feel angry,

310
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,890
but it’s ridiculous for you to do so.

311
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,730
Well,

312
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,560
don’t do this to anyone else.

313
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,170
Could you wait and give us some time?

314
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,170
I’d like to talk to Pud.

315
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,140
I broke up with Earn.

316
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,460
I know.

317
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,310
I just want to compensate her act.

318
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,500
I don’t know how to be responsible for it.

319
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,680
You’re such a crap *ss

320
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:24,680
You broke up with her, but Karn and I couldn’t reconcile anyway.

321
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,730
You don’t have to break up with her,

322
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,750
If you feel sad, I shouldn’t stay happy, should I?

323
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:44,480
But I know how you feel when you have to break up when still in love.

324
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,140
I don’t want you to feel that way, like me.

325
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,640
And one more thing,

326
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,820
the relationship of Karn and I is impossible anyway.

327
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:08,740
I’d better let her go... that’s the best way for us.

328
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,200
Kris.

329
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,430
Kris.

330
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,430
Yes?

331
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,660
What’s a matter? Are you ok?

332
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,190
I’m all right.

333
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,210
Kris.

334
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,890
Yes, what is it?

335
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,330
Can I court you?

336
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,800
Pardon?

337
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,640
Well, I like you at first sight,

338
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,620
but I know that you were dating Karn.

339
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,790
So, I thought I didn’t have a chance.

340
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:40,480
Yet, I think I now have a chance, don’t I?

341
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,920
Kate, I think it's...

342
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,390
Kate: Please don't reject me just yet.

343
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,420
Please give me that chance.

344
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,520
Shall we have a meal together today?

345
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,090
You can choose a restaurant.

346
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,940
Do you particularly crave something?

347
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,710
Mom, I feel so lonely..

348
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:46,210
If you’re ready to read this letter, just tell me.

349
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,490
I’ll be there for you.

350
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,530
Huh, she said she would be here for me.

351
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,770
Eat more cake. You eat like a bird.

352
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,200
I’m sorry, Kate,

353
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,410
but I can’t do it.

354
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:32,290
Do you know why I like you at first sight?

355
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,800
It’s because you looked happy.

356
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,390
So, I love to see you all the time and I finally like you.

357
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:55,220
So, I know that you were happy when you were with Karn.

358
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,780
Why did you invite me then?

359
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,600
Although this scene is quite terrible, but I’m elated

360
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,430
at having you all to myself.

361
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,310
I’m really sorry, Kate.

362
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,690
You don’t have to be sorry.

363
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,870
Can you just, at least, pretend to feel happy while you’re with me?

364
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,490
What are you doing here?

365
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,150
Here, come here.

366
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,700
Why are you so clumsy?

367
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,930
Take off your shoes. It’s my house, take off your shoes.

368
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,620
What are you doing here?

369
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,180
You’re trespassing on my house.

370
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,100
Just come with us.

371
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,180
Hurry up unless we’ll miss it.

372
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,300
Hurry up unless we’ll miss it.

373
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,460
We may fall down the stairs.

374
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,340
I’ll press charges of trespassing.

375
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,940
Just come here with me. Come on.

376
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,520
Sit down.

377
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,890
What’s wrong with you guys?

378
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,940
You’ve come to my house and dragged me to my Room.

379
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:22,740
Now what are you doing?

380
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,510
D*rn it!!! What are you doing?

381
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,180
Oh.

382
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,720
No, no, no. Just stay here with me.

383
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,790
Stay with you? I’m staying here with all of you now.

384
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,650
That’s it. Just stay here.

385
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,450
What’s a matter?

386
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,810
Come on. Guys, hurry up.

387
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,350
Nat, come here quickly.

388
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,030
Quickly.

389
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,360
Hey, I’m sorry.

390
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,720
Well, cheers.

391
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
Cheers!!!!

392
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,170
It’s time to start the party. Cheers.

393
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,950
Yay!

394
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,010
Yay my *ss. My room is dirty.

395
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,490
Why are you having a party?

396
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,840
Well, to celebrate your being alone. We should celebrate, right?

397
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,240
Nat, shut your nasty mouth.

398
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:14,480
. We just want to cheer you up. Can’t we do it?

399
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,410
Oh, where have you been and returned hom so late?

400
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,950
You ‘ve almost missed it.

401
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,030
What have I almost missed?

402
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,340
You’ve almost missed the party.

403
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,900
We should chit-chat all in good time, right?

404
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,900
Of course.

405
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,170
Where have you been then?

406
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,450
I had dinner.

407
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,460
With whom?

408
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,320
With a trainee at the company.

409
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,490
Is she courting you?

410
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:49,130
Not really, well, I told her that I’m not ready to feel that way again

411
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:50,900
because

412
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,650
I still love Karn

413
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,050
and I don’t when I can stop loving her.

414
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,210
Are you getting angry with Karn?

415
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,680
How can I get angry with her?

416
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,140
Kris, did she make you sad

417
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:21,450
and tell you that she never felt happy while being with you?

418
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,070
It doesn’t matter.

419
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,170
I was always happy while being with her. That’s just enough for me.

420
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
Here it comes.

421
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,440
What?

422
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,630
Son wants to listen to this radio program.

423
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,180
It’s her favourite one.

424
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,330
Come on, turn on the radio.

425
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:58,480
There, the first line for today is from a woman who is worried about love issues.

426
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,900
Hello, it’s Lily speaking.

427
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:08,970
Well, my husband’s asked me to have an affair with a mistress and I can’t bear it.

428
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,990
I and that woman love my husband so much that we’re afraid of losing him.

429
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,570
What should I do?

430
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,570
Oh, it gave me the shivers.

431
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:29,380
Alas, it’s just a problem about a Casanova.

432
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:33,580
Just break up with him, girl. Our life is more important than him, right?

433
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,870
It’s a lesson, a life lesson. Just learn it.

434
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,110
-That’s right.
-Yes.

435
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:40,960
Hold on, well, do you really enjoy listening to this radio program?

436
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,200
Yes, it’s my favourite program.

437
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,260
Mine, too.

438
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,460
Same here.

439
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,240
Sol also listens to it, so I listen to it with her.

440
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,340
Yes, we like it.

441
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,000
Meen recommended it to me, so I like it.

442
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,910
Is it good?

443
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,080
Yes, it offers us helpful love advice.

444
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,140
I told you.

445
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,570
Their stories are great.

446
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,840
Agree.

447
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,620
As for the second line, what is your name?

448
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,710
Hello, my name is Apple.

449
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,930
Apple, what love story do you want to tell us today?

450
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,670
It’s about my love story that ended.

451
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,800
We’re just aware of its importance when we’ve lost it.

452
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,970
It may be true.

453
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:31,090
Our ambition could make us lose our most beloved one.

454
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,720
We blame it all on them and hurt them repeatedly owing to our hesitation

455
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:43,540
and weakness.

456
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,210
Even though the truth is like that, they never hate us.

457
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:56,960
We want to meet and hug them once again,

458
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
but we’re not brave enough.

459
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,540
Why are you courageous enough to call us today?

460
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,660
It’s all because of my mom’s letter.

461
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,480
She was a teacher.

462
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,970
When I was a child, I almost died, crashed by a car,

463
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,400
and needed blood.

464
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:33,900
Yet, my blood type is rare, and my mom was nearly discouraged.

465
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:43,000
Fortunately, one of her students had the same rare blood type

466
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,820
and donated blood to me.

467
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,530
And that student is my lover

468
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,910
who was the last present my mom gave me.

469
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,720
She’s my desttny.

470
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:10,670
If she’s now listening to us, what do you want to tell her?

471
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,140
Whether you are Kris or Apple,

472
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,440
I love you.

473
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,420
Could you give me another chance to love you once again?

474
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,820
This is a heartfelt confession.

475
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,520
Kris, if you’re listening to this.

476
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,690
Please know that your destiny is waiting for you.

477
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,540
Thank you, Apple.

478
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,530
I didn't think she would say something so sentimental.

479
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,730
This is how good destiny is.

480
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,100
What the hell am I listening to?

481
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,900
You guys already know this?

482
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,060
Karn told us to let you listen to this program.

483
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,810
How did she know that I was Apple?

484
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:17,750
Hey Kris, this is not the time to be suspicious.

485
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:20,370
You need to go see Karn now.

486
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,100
Okay.

487
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,900
-Hey! No, no, no.
-	Hey! Sit down.

488
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,210
You can’t go like this.

489
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,010
Yes, ‘cause she might break up with you again.

490
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,010
You need a makeover.

491
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,870
Make-ups! Make-ups!

492
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,220
You can’t go like this.

493
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,020
Why?

494
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:36,990
It’s not beautiful.

495
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,500
I’ll make it for you.

496
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:43,950
Wipe your nose first.

497
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,070
Turn to look in the mirror.

498
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,440
Then why did you use my snot to wipe my tears?

499
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,590
Sorry. Sorry.

500
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,390
Damn! You're really bad!

501
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:52,260
I change it now.

502
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,630
Guy, one moment.

503
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,420
What?

504
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,760
I love you all.

505
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,610
Oh, you talk too much.

506
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,010
Oh, it's not the time.

507
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,180
This is to wipe my snot. Why are you using it to wipe my tears?

508
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,260
-This is to wipe your snot. This is to wipe your tears
-It’s done!

509
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,590
Go, go, go! It’s your time to shine.

510
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:21,790
You can do it! You little fool! Yu can do it!

511
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,320
Karn

512
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,000
Kris

513
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,620
Don't disappear again.

514
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,720
I won’t disappear again.

515
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,760
I’m sorry.

516
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,880
I’m sorry, too.

517
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:09,890
Let me see.

518
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,940
Your face is all red.

519
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,820
Your face is even redder.

520
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,640
It’s because of you and that surprise you gave me.

521
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,070
You even set it up with my friends.

522
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,340
I had to go all out in order to make up with my girlfriend.

523
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,460
You tease me again.

524
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,980
You almost made me cry again.

525
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,010
I miss you very much.

526
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:54,610
I'm sorry, Kris, for saying that I'm not happy being with you.

527
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,800
It’s me without you that makes me unhappy.

528
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,260
What about your series?

529
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:21,570
Never mind.

530
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,790
Success without someone I love by my side is worthless.

531
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,010
Thank you for giving me a second chance.

532
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,740
I'm the one who should say that.

533
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:40,330
My destiny.

534
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:01,870
Karn

535
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,580
Hum?

536
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
Did you read your mother’s letter?

537
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,600
Yes, I did.

538
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,780
You should read it, too.

539
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,730
Read it.

540
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,690
My dear Aonthakarn,

541
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:54,820
If you are reading this letter, I am no longer in this world.

542
00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:00,790
But I want to leave a gift for you, my daughter, so that you won’t be alone.

543
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,480
Do you remember the girl who donated blood to you?

544
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,700
Her name is Karisa.

545
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:20,260
When she donated blood to you, she told me that

546
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:27,720
if she ever had a hard time, my daughter would help her too.

547
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:33,860
That day I heard that she had an accident and became blind.

548
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:39,250
I don't have much longer to live anyway,

549
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,560
So I've made an application to donate my organs.

550
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:54,210
I know it's unlikely, but I'm praying that she receives my eyes.

551
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,330
So that I can repay her once,

552
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:03,030
and you will have eyes to look at you like I do.

553
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:07,090
So that she can be your spiritual support instead of me,

554
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:15,920
To be the world without me that you will always have her by your side.

555
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:18,480
With love.

556
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,330
From you morther.

557
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:33,700
So these eyes…

558
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,090
It may be, or maybe not. I’m not sure.

559
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:52,440
But I want to believe that you are really the gift from my mother.

560
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,160
Thank you, Kris.

561
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:02,720
I really appreciate it.

562
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:27,660
I almost can’t see anything now.

563
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,210
Me neither.

564
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,340
I can't go to work tomorrow.

565
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:43,500
There, there. Don't cry.

566
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,080
Don't cry anymore.

567
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,840
Then... shall we take the day off tomorrow?

568
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:53,790
Okay?

569
00:52:55,110 --> 00:53:04,790
So we can have time to talk all night.

570
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,610
We’ll…do that…

571
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,010
as soon as we made up?

572
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,830
Well, I miss it.

573
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,750
You idiot!

574
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,300
See? You stop crying now.

575
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,990
Anyway, it's a good thing you didn't read your mother's letter.

576
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,600
Why so?

577
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:04,150
Because I didn’t want to be your friend.

578
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,680
I love you.

579
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,530
I love you, too.

580
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:50,140
Er…why did you know that I was…

581
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,140
Apple?

582
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,620
She must be disappointed if she knows that I am her Apple.

583
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,690
How is it not good if it’s you?

584
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:07,810
I want Apple to be her ideal fan.

585
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,260
then what’re you gonna do?

586
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,080
I’ll find a way to apologize her.

587
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:41,200
Karn, it's Meen. We work at the same company. Do you remember me?

588
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,320
What if I told you that Kris was Apple?

589
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,570
How do you know about Apple?

590
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:52,090
Because I helped Kris choose the letter paper with my own hands.

591
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,030
Kris likes you very much.

592
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,180
She wants to encourage you, but she is not good at speaking.

593
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
It’s okay if you don’t believe me.

594
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,870
You can prove it yourself.

595
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,380
How?

596
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,520
Take her to drink.

597
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,270
Your friends love you very much.

598
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:01,930
I knew it! I wondered why they seemed to know everything.

599
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:07,060
Actually, I have to thank Meen for making us reconcile.

600
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,890
You’re right.

601
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:14,400
Then I'll go treat her to a meal.

602
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:23,870
Another thing, you already know that I'm Apple,

603
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:30,290
but why do you still think that Mr. A, Pen-Eak, is Apple?

604
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,450
Let's stop talking about this, Kris. I am really blind.

605
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,820
Stop punishing yourself.

606
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,350
I’ll punish you myself.

607
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,970
You have to make amends until I'm satisfied.

608
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,160
I’ll make amends until you’re satisfied, my Apple.

609
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:14,610
Really? Really?

610
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:16,400
Is it true?

611
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,410
Is it true? Is it true?

612
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:25,840
Krisใ

613
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,290
Kris, it’s tickling!

614
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,710
Let me help you undress.

615
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,670
Be gentle.

616
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,480
I like it, too.

617
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,750
After that day, Kal returned to work at App Talk.

618
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:55,960
This story became a lesson for us and many others.

619
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,770
Don't let a momentary emotion destroy the happiness you have.

620
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,130
And don't let the past hold you back from seeing the future.

621
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:14,090
Because the happiness in the future that we can't see is waiting for us.

622
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:30,690
The two of us decided to tell our story to everyone.

623
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:36,180
To be another voice for society to accept sexual diversity more.

624
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,750
Even though there are both people who encourage us

625
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,860
and people who hate us.

626
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,120
Mr. Toy, coffee for you.

627
01:00:58,990 --> 01:00:59,940
Thank you.

628
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:13,780
But small changes have started

629
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:18,010
and are spreading like waves in the ocean

630
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,640
As for those who have done bad things,

631
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:29,640
the karma has already done its job.

632
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,820
I’m innocent.

633
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,080
I’m innocent.

634
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,400
I told you to leave me alone

635
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:47,860
Meen and Sol are still close friends, I think.

636
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:55,190
Well, if they’re ready, they’ll probably tell us.

637
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:14,330
Natty has become a mother and a bride as she's been waiting for.

638
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:18,930
I feel sorry for her children to have a mother like her.

639
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,290
I guess their lives must be very chaotic.

640
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:28,500
I feel a bit lonely when I see my friend getting married.

641
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:33,500
But people have to grow up on their own paths.

642
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,000
Dad. Mom.

643
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,970
Hello. Hello.

644
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,060
You're introducing your girlfriend, aren't you?

645
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:12,050
As for my brother Pud, the secret is no longer a secret.

646
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:26,500
But it's a good thing because both of them seem happy

647
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,200
To the point of being annoying sometimes.

648
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,130
But I can't blame them, right?

649
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:39,100
Now, App Talk has grown to the point of having its own conference.

650
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:41,770
It's really worth the effort.

651
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:50,450
Kris

652
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:51,700
Huh?

653
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:54,560
There is another thing you haven’t told me.

654
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,580
What is it?

655
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,250
Why is it Apple?

656
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,620
Do you really want to know?

657
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,340
Of course, I do.

658
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:12,950
No matter how much I think about it, I can't figure out why it has to be this name.

659
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:31,300
I already gave you a hint.

660
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:37,970
I still can’t figure it out. Give me a hint again.

661
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:48,760
I can’t figure it out. I surrender now.

662
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,970
You are apple of my eyes.

663
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:01,760
my beloved.

664
01:06:45,796 --> 01:06:49,949
“I surrender,

665
01:06:49,963 --> 01:06:52,370
and I’ll follow only you

666
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,625
‘coz I love you. Even though my heart is broken,

667
01:06:56,661 --> 01:07:03,076
I just wish you all the best and all those great things you wish for.

668
01:07:03,112 --> 01:07:06,981
I wanna be that person of your dream,

669
01:07:07,018 --> 01:07:11,258
get close to you,

670
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,410
and stay with you all the way.

671
01:07:13,432 --> 01:07:19,869
If our feelings are mutual, could I be your boo?”

672
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:28,254
Could I be your boo?

673
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:38,087
Could I be your boo?
