1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,942
The series is not based on a true story, individuals, places,
or organizations.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,457
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:26,062
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish you all the best, all those great things you wish for.

4
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:34,453
I wanna be that person of your dream, get close to you, and stay with you all the way.

5
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:44,328
If our feelings are mutual, could I be your boo?”

6
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,684
What did you mean by that, Toy?

7
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,808
That’s right.

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,737
Our company wants to hire App Talk to review our cushion,

9
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,017
on the condition that Karn serves as our brand’s presenter.

10
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,564
Our team will control the production.

11
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,120
On the condition

12
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,591
that the reviews must be shot here

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,457
by App Talk’s team who reserves the 60% right to make decisions.

14
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,453
Ok. I agree with that,

15
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:41,564
but we can’t provide you with platinum level of sponsorship anymore.

16
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,728
Well, it’s all right.

17
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:50,275
I’m glad to work with you all.

18
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,920
We’re glad to work with you, too.

19
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,466
Kindly send me invoices later.

20
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,130
See you soon, Karn.

21
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,155
Damn it.

22
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:42,835
Can I join you?

23
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,200
It’s all because of me.

24
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,391
You shouldn’t think that way.

25
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,022
If Ms. Apple saw me now,

26
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,982
she must be disappointed.

27
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,986
Nope.

28
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,777
Everything is all screwed up just because of my ex.

29
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,711
Not at all.

30
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,697
It would be great if I could talk to M. Apple now.

31
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,480
Talking to Ms. Apple?

32
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,177
Yeah,

33
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:43,022
I want to reply to Ms. Apple’s letters ‘coz I’m only a taker,

34
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:46,560
and I’m afraid that she might feel offended.

35
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,880
So, I’ve signed up for Talk Talk account.

36
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,782
She wouldn’t feel offended, Karn.

37
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:57,688
Why do you think so?

38
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:08,391
I am a fan of yours, too.

39
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,822
You just smile and feel happy,

40
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,973
and we all are pleased to see that.

41
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:41,582
Smile a lot, ok?

42
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,351
Wow, she followed me.

43
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,035
Wow, she followed me. Yay!

44
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,840
Dear My beloved one.

45
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,515
Are you weary today?

46
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,493
You can take

47
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,213
Ow... She gave me a heart.

48
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,266
I’ll always be your Ms. Apple, Aonthakarn.

49
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,080
My routine has been adjusted since then.

50
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,764
Here I come.

51
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,048
This is yours.

52
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:37,093
Thank you.

53
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,324
Awww... so sweet.

54
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,808
Your sister’s really something.

55
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:43,413
Yep.

56
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,728
I’m Kris during the daytime.

57
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,257
On the day where Karn works at the television station, we usually meet at a café.

58
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:06,977
As Kris, I have a chance to Aonthakarn’s hidden aspects. ล

59
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,062
She has a sweet tooth, and her blood sugar is often low.

60
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:13,013
She’s a muttering girl who gets testy more easily than I expected.

61
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,453
We talk about all kinds of things and almost don’t have no secrets from one another

62
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,084
except for one thing.

63
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:29,164
Dear my beloved one, you look cute and lively in the recent clip.

64
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,306
I’ve been a fan of your work.

65
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,422
It’s rainy, and the weather tends to change a lot. Don’t get a cold.

66
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:41,946
If you feel lonely, try listening to 92.25 radio station.

67
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:48,231
At 7 pm, they have a session for love letters from listeners. Apple.

68
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,368
Thank you, Ms. Apple.

69
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:56,657
Look,

70
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,151
she’s so kind.

71
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,022
She’s written 2 words for me:

72
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,680
‘thank you, Ms. Apple.

73
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:08,240
I see.

74
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:11,253
2 words! and she calls me, Ms. Apple.

75
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:15,804
Oh, Kris, what’s wrong with you? I’m in a hurry to finish my work.

76
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,848
But don’t you see her every day?

77
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:19,253
It’s different.

78
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:24,328
That’s Kris, but this is about Ms. Apple.

79
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:27,662
I want to support her at all moments.

80
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:29,431
Ok, ok.

81
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,222
Have you gone to bed yet?

82
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:37,671
No, not yet. What’s the matter?

83
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,613
Will you come to stay over at my place tomorrow?

84
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,937
Of course. Why are you suddenly inviting me to stay over?

85
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,937
I’m feeling lonely.

86
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,746
You can come any time coz you’ve got the keys.

87
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,293
Oh, you’ve exchanged house keys.

88
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,960
You can just mind your own business.

89
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,542
Here some water.

90
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,426
Take a sip.

91
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,306
Are you feeling better?

92
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:22,417
Yeah,

93
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,186
whay are you being even nicer to me today, Kris?

94
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,933
Kris?

95
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,937
Please excuse me for a moment?

96
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,142
Hello?

97
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:44,106
Kris, don’t flake out on my birthday party tonight.

98
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:48,355
It’s such a shame that my boyfriend has a farewell party for his boss this evening as well.

99
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,826
I’d flirt around to spite him.

100
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:56,275
Oh, I’ll be there after work.

101
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,840
If you don’t come to the party, you’ll be cursed to be heartbroken and stay single for eternity.

102
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,177
Shut up, Nat.

103
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:04,720
I’m leaving. See you soon, girls.

104
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:05,946
Bye.

105
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,515
Do you have an appointment?

106
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,284
I’ve forgoten about Nat’s birthday party.

107
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,982
Please join me.

108
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,408
Nope, you should go to see your friends.

109
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,530
Are you getting testy?

110
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,302
Really?

111
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,822
We can have a meal together next time.

112
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,600
No,

113
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,088
treat me to some beer too.

114
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,293
You’re naughty drinking beer while sick.

115
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:52,026
Take it easy.

116
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,160
Happy Birthday to You.

117
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,666
Happy Birthday, Nat.

118
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:13,182
Thank you, girls.

119
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,404
You really are something being born on Halloween day.

120
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,786
Of course.

121
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:17,937
We have to be dressed in a Halloween costume every year.

122
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:19,013
I want to dress beautifully.

123
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:20,471
It’s all because of you.

124
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:22,293
Damn it. I feel bad about my birthday.

125
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,453
Well, Kris,

126
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,231
you don’t dress following the theme to day. Look at us.

127
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,800
That’s right.

128
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:29,715
It’s Nat’s birthday anniversary.

129
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:30,951
You don’t respect me, do you?

130
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:35,484
Hey, give me a break this year.

131
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:37,480
I haven’t got my pay deposit this month.

132
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:38,560
Just let it go this year.

133
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:39,600
Ok.

134
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:43,404
Nat, we’ve got a present for you.

135
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,902
Ta-da!

136
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,271
Hey!!

137
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,871
are you serious?

138
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:56,320
Take a look at it quickly.

139
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:57,555
Oh.

140
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,888
Use them well with your boyfriend, girl.

141
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:05,555
We all have conducted research. It works well with all men.

142
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:08,951
Wait, what do you mean by ‘research’, Meen?

143
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:12,720
Are you dating someone and you don’t tell us?

144
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,266
I work in the studio every day, how could I find a boyfriend?

145
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,000
There’re a lot of handsome guys at the studio.

146
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:20,240
That’s right. Many actors have been in and out all the time,

147
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:23,208
or are you secretly dating an editor?

148
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:25,200
Absolutely not.

149
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:26,924
Do you like it? Natty, stop it.

150
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,568
How are you, Karn?

151
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:02,888
Kris.

152
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,960
Kris.

153
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:05,653
What?

154
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,577
Is it my funeral or birthday party?

155
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,570
I agree. You looked as though your friend died.

156
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,182
Sol, I might as well said that myself.

157
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,604
I think there’s only one person who can make her feel that way.

158
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,893
Oh.

159
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:24,250
You’ve become lonely frequently.

160
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,915
Hey, Kris, my dear friend.

161
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,755
Hey, what’s wrong with you, guys?

162
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,666
Are you dating her?

163
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,888
Nope.

164
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:38,951
Uh-oh. See what she’s said.

165
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,950
All of them think the same.

166
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:42,133
Right, we think so.

167
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,986
I agree with Nat.

168
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,320
See?

169
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:46,320
Can you stop it? You’ve just talked trash.

170
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,568
Oh, love. You look like you’re enchanted by her and keep insisting on denying it.

171
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:53,244
True.

172
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:54,871
You’re really falling for someone.

173
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:57,662
She looks like you when you fell in love with your boyfriend in the begining.

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,271
Hey!

175
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,102
What will you do?

176
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:01,848
Yeah.

177
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:06,186
All in all, how is the relationship between you both?

178
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,751
don’t know. I’m confused.

179
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:12,453
Kris.

180
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,591
What?

181
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,208
Yikes!! That’s creepy.

182
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:18,551
Do you feel anything? / Disgusting!

183
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:19,600
Disgusting!

184
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,870
What if Karn kissed you?

185
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,870
Now you’re smiling.

186
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,706
Whoa!!!!

187
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:30,888
You’re in love.

188
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:32,711
Why are you smiling?

189
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:36,800
Kris, it’s too obvious. Don’t you know it?

190
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:40,408
Hello, Karn.

191
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,480
Hello,

192
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:46,986
Karn.

193
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,835
Karn?

194
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,560
I think this doesn’t look good.

195
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:51,404
Hello!

196
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,857
You need to see her.

197
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:55,982
But, it’s your birthday party.

198
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,400
She can have another one at any time.

199
00:14:58,435 --> 00:14:59,386
I can have it again tomorrow.

200
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:02,124
Off you go!

201
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,746
Bring her bag.

202
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,186
Off you go.

203
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,897
Karn, how are you?

204
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,804
Kris, why are you here?

205
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,604
How can I leave you alone?

206
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,493
I’m sorry, Kris.

207
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,297
What are you sorry for?

208
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,831
I’m sorry for disturbing you and your friends.

209
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,906
That’s all right. It’s nothing.

210
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,773
I’m sorry for being happy to see you.

211
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:57,182
I’ll find a wet towel to cool you down, wait a second,

212
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,573
Can you stay with me?

213
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,200
I feel lonely.

214
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,813
I’m here for you.

215
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:23,564
Can you hug me?

216
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:51,048
I’m sorry.

217
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,564
I’m sorry, Kris.

218
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,577
What are you sorry for?

219
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:29,540
Please don’t dislike me.

220
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:35,540
How could I dislike you.

221
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,057
I adore you.

222
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,897
Kris,

223
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,164
I have to go to work.

224
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,551
Don’t go.

225
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:45,297
Stay in bed so you’re getting better quickly.

226
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,817
I can’t. I’ll be late for work.

227
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:42,195
I’m off to work. See you at the office.

228
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:45,093
Ok.

229
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,528
Karn, can you really go to work?

230
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:55,520
You shouldn’t go.

231
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:58,444
It’s ok. I’m feeling better.

232
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:04,302
But you had high fever last night.

233
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:06,300
You had high body temperature.

234
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:08,586
Don’t leave and stay home, Karn.

235
00:22:08,657 --> 00:22:10,151
Do you care for me?

236
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,022
Yes, I do.

237
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,306
See? I don’t have high body temperature,

238
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:39,830
and the fever is brought down

239
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,555
I haven’t brushed my teeth.

240
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:51,550
Your mouth smells just fine,

241
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,764
and your lips are soft.

242
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,440
Go back to sleep.

243
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,977
Err…I…I’ll go with you.

244
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:08,453
I will drop you off at work.

245
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,240
Let me brush my teeth.

246
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:12,240
Give me 2 minutes. Wait a sec.

247
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,191
You can come with me.

248
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,564
I’d better not.

249
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,168
That’s a pity. I plan to take you on a tour of my newsroom.

250
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,684
I haven’t showered.

251
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:37,573
You friends will suffer a terrible smell from me.

252
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,475
That’s fine. I normally don’t have friends.

253
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,395
I go to work now.

254
00:23:47,422 --> 00:23:49,591
I’ll hurry back. Bye.

255
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:50,604
Bye.

256
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,875
Fighting!

257
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:54,826
Okie.

258
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:03,733
Get ready to enter the program…

259
00:24:03,768 --> 00:24:04,408
Yep.

260
00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:07,360
4 3 2

261
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:15,457
Hello. Welcome to Sports News today with me, Aonthakarn Rakthai.

262
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:17,351
Aonthakarn Rakthai.

263
00:24:17,386 --> 00:24:18,080
Kris,

264
00:24:19,662 --> 00:24:21,431
how did I do today?

265
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,155
You are very professional.

266
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:27,857
It didn’t look like you were sick.

267
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:30,310
That’s my working mode.

268
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,360
I bought some snacks for you.

269
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:39,528
You can take medicine after you finish eating. I’ve got your medicine here.

270
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,217
Thank you.

271
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,324
Let’s go.

272
00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:51,040
Hey, guys.

273
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,151
Do you think Karn will be okay?

274
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:56,764
Okay or not, she must get it done, mustn’t she?

275
00:24:57,048 --> 00:25:01,137
Yeah. Karn is professional enough. No problem.

276
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:02,871
It’s only the customers that will have a problem.

277
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:06,631
Gosh. I’ve never felt stressed like this in my entire life.

278
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:08,293
You ever had anything serious in your entire life?

279
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,564
Damn Pud!

280
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,928
Here we are!

281
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:13,440
Oh, so now you came.

282
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:15,226
Sorry, I’m late.

283
00:25:15,253 --> 00:25:16,337
It’s alright.

284
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,951
I’m going inside to change my cloth and get ready now.

285
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,053
Pud, please make it quick today.

286
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,777
It seems like Karn is sick.

287
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:27,173
Roger that!

288
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,924
Hey, since when did you become her manager?

289
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,631
Going bossy and all.

290
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:34,586
I’m her friend.

291
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,200
You come to welcome me, Kris?

292
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,488
Come in.

293
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,604
What a sweet welcome.

294
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:52,177
You listen to me now.

295
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,862
Today when the shooting is done, then it’s done.

296
00:25:57,795 --> 00:25:59,937
Don’t you dare to show your face in front of Karn ever again.

297
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:03,680
Something like this, you’d better let Karn say it herself.

298
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:06,050
You’re just her friend, aren’t you?

299
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,253
C-Cushion. Perfectly smooth. Completely cover the skin. Perfect every day.

300
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,902
And…cut!

301
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,666
You did great today.

302
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:19,964
Thank you.

303
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,000
May I check the footage?

304
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,435
Yes, sir.

305
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,604
Pause.

306
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,391
I think we need more shooting here.

307
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:33,368
Where?

308
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,240
Come and take a look.

309
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:39,253
Damn Toy!

310
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:43,804
Kris, we’re working here.

311
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,737
Don’t mix personal matters with work.

312
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,520
Just e-mail us where you want to edit

313
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:51,662
and we’ll edit it as specified in the contract.

314
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,933
You’re very professional, Karn.

315
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,324
Unlike somebody here.

316
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,933
I’m an educated person, Kris.

317
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,106
I won’t do anything if Karn is mot okay with it.

318
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,106
It’s not about education.

319
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,400
It’s about nature.

320
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,977
Karn hasn’t said anything, Kris.

321
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:17,342
Why do you hurry to come forward instead?

322
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:20,035
Are you her lover?

323
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:21,031
No. / Yes.

324
00:27:25,253 --> 00:27:31,173
Karn, do you want to break up with me to the point of being a lesbian?

325
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:32,684
And with a woman like this?

326
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,866
You can insult me all you want. But don’t insult her.

327
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:37,351
I’ve seen a lot.

328
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,573
Women dating women but finally come back to dating guys.

329
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,444
Maybe, it cannot make you reach orgasm, isn’t it?

330
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,480
Get the fuck out of here! Otherwise, I’ll file a report for harassment.

331
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,426
Nothing will happen even if you reported it.

332
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:56,026
I don’t know about that.

333
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,942
If your father hears this clip,

334
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,915
the position of a good son would be shaken.

335
00:28:05,013 --> 00:28:08,302
Are you going to take it like this, Karn?

336
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,075
I know a lot of people in this industry.

337
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:18,284
If they know you’re a lesbian, it wouldn’t be that happy, I guess.

338
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,840
Damn, Toy! You’ve gone too far.

339
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:23,075
I told you to stop now.

340
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:25,448
Toy!

341
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,520
Kris,

342
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,200
is there something wrong?

343
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,915
There’s nothing wrong, Pud.

344
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,137
We just talk about work. Is that right, Karn?

345
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,626
Yes. Nothing wrong.

346
00:28:39,662 --> 00:28:42,195
No! This fucking bastard, he…

347
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:49,288
Okay, I’d better get going now.

348
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,960
Oh, and,

349
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,484
congratulations on being able to see again, Kris.

350
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:59,324
How did you know about this?

351
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:00,844
What is it?

352
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,897
Nothing, Karn.

353
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:09,111
Kris was blind for 3 years

354
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,564
and only recently regained her sight.

355
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,813
Even though I’m Kris’s ex-boyfriend, I still know it.

356
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,564
Why did I never know about this?

357
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,755
Because it’s not important, Karn.

358
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:26,750
How could it not be important?

359
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,680
Karn.

360
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,360
Alright, I think I really need to get going now.

361
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,875
See you later, Pud.

362
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,306
Wait!

363
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,711
Were you Kris’s ex-boyfriend?

364
00:29:48,106 --> 00:29:49,368
When did you guys date?

365
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,382
Oh, about that.

366
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,844
It’s just…we used to date since high school

367
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,333
but it was not a big deal. Forget it.

368
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,235
Karn.

369
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,591
Karn.

370
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:16,850
Please open the door, Karn.

371
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:22,488
Please, Karn. Please talk to me,

372
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:36,071
Karn.

373
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,330
Why don’t you use your key to open it?

374
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,906
I won’t enter if you don’t allow me to.

375
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:11,751
Karn, you already drink too much.

376
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:18,862
That’s enough.

377
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:20,133
Fuck off!

378
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,973
Karn

379
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,244
Give it to me.

380
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:24,204
No.

381
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,120
Why did you drink like that? What will you do if you get drunk?

382
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,075
I must be this Kris

383
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,346
so you will talk to me?

384
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,871
You will forget it tomorrow.

385
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,870
Just you remember is enough.

386
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,151
Selfish.

387
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,222
I’m sorry.

388
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,417
Why are you doing this, Kris?

389
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,280
I’m worried about you.

390
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,760
Worried?

391
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,151
I thought we were close.

392
00:32:24,302 --> 00:32:26,300
You know everything about me.

393
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,453
But you never tell me about yourself.

394
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:33,100
I always know it from other people.

395
00:32:41,822 --> 00:32:43,440
Who am I to you, Kris?

396
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,644
Karn. Karn.

397
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:51,640
You are an important person for me.

398
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,666
I really mean it.

399
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,008
About Toy,

400
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,342
you may have your reputation damaged because of me.

401
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,408
And it will destroy your dream.

402
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,537
About my eyes,

403
00:33:27,484 --> 00:33:29,480
it’s not that I didn’t want to tell you.

404
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,702
But when I’m with you, I’m so happy

405
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,120
that I didn’t think about it at all.

406
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,924
It’s just an excuse.

407
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,337
Karn,

408
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,755
you really are an important person for me.

409
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,062
For me.

410
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,373
You are the first person that makes me know what love is.

411
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:54,053
Enough of that.

412
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,208
You will forget it tomorrow.

413
00:35:34,897 --> 00:35:36,524
Leave the house key for me.

414
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,102
Kris! Karn!

415
00:35:57,128 --> 00:35:57,946
Yes?

416
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,995
Go to Chonburi instead of us tomorrow.

417
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,240
We will be busy with some other works.

418
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:13,724
Aha. It’s a big job that might give us funding to further the life of our company.

419
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:19,662
It’s such a big job and you’re going to let me go instead.

420
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:22,080
We’ll be on an urgent business.

421
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:22,755
Umm.

422
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,977
So you must go instead of us.

423
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,355
What fucking urgent business!

424
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,768
Aha… The event starts in the evening.

425
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:39,591
As soon as we are done with our business, we’ll hurry and follow.

426
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:41,244
But…I…

427
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:47,280
You just give away our business cards and make connection in case, err…

428
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:50,222
Okay. Tomorrow, right?

429
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,688
Let me go out and get something to drink.

430
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,311
Karn!

431
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:05,635
Karn!

432
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,364
About last night,

433
00:37:09,155 --> 00:37:10,026
I…

434
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:12,670
Did you leave the house key for me?

435
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,853
Then give it back to me now.

436
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:56,850
Have you finished packing your bag?

437
00:37:57,128 --> 00:37:58,266
Almost done now.

438
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,231
Want some help?

439
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,102
Pud…

440
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,568
What?

441
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:09,288
I’m confused.

442
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,520
About what?

443
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:13,982
About Karn.

444
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,333
Are you confused or scared?

445
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,404
I think you’re just scared.

446
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,004
Scared?

447
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,093
You’re scared of making a mistake, aren’t you?

448
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,702
I’m scared of making dad and mom sad again.

449
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,462
They won’t be sad.

450
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,817
How do you know?

451
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,777
How can they be sad if you’re happy?

452
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,386
And what if the answer isn’t what we think?

453
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,342
You just have to accept it.

454
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,204
Accept the self expression.

455
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,262
And move on. That’s it.

456
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,960
Then, have you ever made a wrong decision?

457
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:11,004
Too often.

458
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,862
Really?

459
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,368
Do you think I’m a God?

460
00:39:17,102 --> 00:39:18,551
Then what was it about?

461
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,968
Please take care of my sister for me.

462
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,257
Don’t worry. Your sister is like my sister.

463
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,986
Your sister looks very talented. She should be able to help with my work.

464
00:39:37,137 --> 00:39:38,980
Okay. Next scene. Come on. Now.

465
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,777
Please take care of her for me.

466
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:21,770
Stop thinking too much.

467
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,302
Be brave.

468
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
Do you think I can do it?

469
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,102
You can do it.

470
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:34,711
I always believe that.

471
00:40:37,546 --> 00:40:38,710
Thank you.

472
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:51,093
Karn, are you hungry?

473
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,186
Do you want some snacks?

474
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:01,470
How is my driving?

475
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,733
I haven’t driven a car for such a long time.

476
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,862
Just drive.

477
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,422
Gosh.

478
00:41:21,484 --> 00:41:22,497
What?

479
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:24,213
Such a worrisome.

480
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,804
It’s my eyes that you should worry about.

481
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:28,017
What idiot put a camera there?

482
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:31,440
Damn, Toh! Have you never watched a Korean series?

483
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:32,853
Gosh…whatever.

484
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,111
Pud calls.

485
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:46,231
Answer it for me.

486
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,271
Hello.

487
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,764
Hello. Kris,

488
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,093
are you on a motorway?

489
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,164
How do you know?

490
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,613
I heard the sound, like, the car is moving fast.

491
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,128
I’m just worried so I call to check on you.

492
00:42:03,164 --> 00:42:04,631
Okay. What, then?

493
00:42:13,804 --> 00:42:15,800
You set it as the background on your screen?

494
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:16,933
Umm…

495
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,960
’coz it was our first date.

496
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,515
Is it cute?

497
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:28,657
Yeah, it is.

498
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,004
They booked only one room?

499
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:36,702
Yes, ma’am.

500
00:42:36,977 --> 00:42:38,995
The name is Putthichart, right?

501
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,426
Yes.

502
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,982
Damn, Jess! What’s wrong with your car?

503
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,844
Damn! The car won’t start.

504
00:42:48,888 --> 00:42:50,560
You didn’t put gas in your car, did you?

505
00:42:50,622 --> 00:42:53,920
Hey! Toh. Pud. My car uses electricity,

506
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,782
but I forgot to charge it.

507
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,200
You idiot, Jess!

508
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,284
What about the guys?

509
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,866
I called them but no answers.

510
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,808
Try again.

511
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:37,640
Hello. My dear sister.

512
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,380
Hello. Pud, where are you?

513
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,986
Well, our car broke down.

514
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,493
We probably won’t make it in time for the pitching.

515
00:43:45,528 --> 00:43:48,088
But we will hurry and catch the van there.

516
00:43:48,115 --> 00:43:51,048
So what do we do?

517
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:57,271
You helped me make the slides so you must understand the work process.

518
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,600
Pud

519
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,057
Kris, you can do it.

520
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,728
Umm.

521
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,146
We’ll hurry along.

522
00:44:15,182 --> 00:44:16,417
See you, sis.

523
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:17,937
Let’s go. Now.

524
00:44:17,964 --> 00:44:19,040
Pud…Pud!

525
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,431
They weren’t likely to arrive in time.

526
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:23,733
So what do we do today?

527
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,986
I must present it myself.

528
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:34,515
Okay. You can do it, Kris.

529
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,693
Can I have some encouragement?

530
00:44:43,057 --> 00:44:43,848
Umm.

531
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,453
Thank you, Jacket Company, the leading company.

532
00:45:04,497 --> 00:45:08,711
Next, please welcome App Talk Company.

533
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:21,733
Hello.

534
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,022
I’m a representative from App Talk Company.

535
00:45:27,084 --> 00:45:30,915
Our App Talk Company has the vision

536
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,217
to present the modern gadgets and technology for everyone.

537
00:45:37,253 --> 00:45:42,480
No matter your gender, age or status,

538
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:45,920
You have the right to access quality technology.

539
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:47,404
I have a question.

540
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:53,306
From what I saw, there are no technology experts at this company.

541
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:58,044
So, can this really present accurate information about technology?

542
00:45:59,013 --> 00:46:02,080
We have a very strong research team.

543
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,017
And there are experts available to give advice as well.

544
00:46:06,044 --> 00:46:07,893
It’s still strange, though.

545
00:46:07,937 --> 00:46:12,871
How can someone who has never been involved with technology make an App Talk?

546
00:46:12,897 --> 00:46:15,484
So, what point can you use to win over your competitors?

547
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,528
Our strength is ignorance.

548
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,026
Because we understand people who don’t know as well as we do.

549
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:31,502
We understand the feelings that they want to learn new things that is restricted to experts only.

550
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:37,235
App Talk is not a media that only presents specific information.

551
00:46:37,457 --> 00:46:43,724
But we want to be a media that is ready to make mistake, learn and start over with everyone.

552
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:55,137
Fighting alone, there may come a time when you’re so tired you want to give up.

553
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:00,800
But if you have a friend to help beside you

554
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:05,848
Those mistakes will become something funny to talk about later.

555
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:13,600
Our App Talk does not want to be a media that presents only the technology.

556
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,422
But we want to be a space, a community for people of all ages and genders.

557
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:25,777
A space for those who dares to make mistakes and start over.

558
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:29,866
We want to be a safe zone for everyone.

559
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,488
Hey, your sister is quite talented.

560
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:42,524
She’s my sister.

561
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,480
Well done, sis!

562
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:49,093
Hey, don’t rub my head.

563
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,090
Our company survives because of you.

564
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,808
Thank you, Toh.

565
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,488
So, what happened to your car?

566
00:47:56,524 --> 00:47:59,671
Umm. Don’t bother about the car.

567
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:02,435
Ah, the work is done.

568
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:05,760
I give you 3 days off.

569
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:07,964
3 days?

570
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,960
Yes. Take some rest

571
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:13,626
and…

572
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,608
make her your wife now.

573
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:21,333
You idiot!

574
00:48:23,804 --> 00:48:26,266
Go, go, go! I’ll get going now.

575
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:27,964
Get plenty of rest.

576
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,266
Safe journey home.

577
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:30,933
See you later.

578
00:48:30,968 --> 00:48:32,666
Hey, it hurts my leg.

579
00:48:32,728 --> 00:48:34,524
Hurry and go now.

580
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,777
Gosh, it’s really exhausting.

581
00:48:50,124 --> 00:48:51,360
That’s true.

582
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,160
What are you doing sitting there? Come here.

583
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,275
Kris / Karn

584
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,475
Looks like we are of the same mind.

585
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,368
Well, I…

586
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,057
I….

587
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:35,155
Let me go and take a look.

588
00:49:35,191 --> 00:49:35,991
Okay.

589
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:48,862
Did you order this?

590
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,320
No. Pud ordered it.

591
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:57,920
A reward for his talented sister.

592
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,502
No.

593
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:02,364
He must have ordered for us both.

594
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:09,230
I have something I want to tell you.

595
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:10,995
Okay.

596
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:15,351
I’m listening.

597
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,444
Well..

598
00:50:22,755 --> 00:50:24,750
All of life,

599
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:29,450
I have made mistakes.

600
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,026
I often make people around me sad.

601
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:41,208
So often that I don’t dare to decide or do anything.

602
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,297
But when I met you,

603
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:49,484
I want to become a better person.

604
00:50:51,066 --> 00:50:52,648
I want you to be proud of me

605
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,382
We may have to argue many more times.

606
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:08,773
But I want to reconcile with you every time.

607
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,835
Same with me.

608
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,751
When we argue, it’s really bad.

609
00:51:22,782 --> 00:51:24,780
I maybe foolish,

610
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,106
fussy

611
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,404
and touchy-feely.

612
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,937
I may want to keep you for myself.

613
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,906
But I want to be with you.

614
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,413
Karn,

615
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:48,968
will you be my girlfriend?

616
00:51:56,675 --> 00:51:57,502
Umm.

617
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,391
I’m so happy.

618
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:36,702
Even if you ask, I won’t give it back,

619
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,524
ever.

620
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,471
Okay,

621
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,404
‘coz I already gave it to you.

622
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:29,751
You wanna drink me instead of wine?

623
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:16,711
Karn,

624
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,808
I have something to tell you.

625
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,920
You’re my first.

626
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:36,471
You’re my first, too.

627
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:32,604
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

628
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:41,466
Even though my heart is broken, I just wish you all the best, all those great things you wish for.

629
00:58:41,511 --> 00:58:51,893
I wanna be that person of your dream, get close to you, and stay with you all the way.

630
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:58,257
If our feelings are mutual, could I be your boo?”
