1
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,700
Why are you calling? I’m chilling out.

2
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,900
Bruh, you little brat, enjoy your vacation too much that you forget your own brother.

3
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,550
Are you chilling out again?

4
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,780
Do you really want to meet that ghost?

5
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,210
Is that my own business?

6
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,160
Be careful! It might be the eye donor’s memories.

7
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,020
Pud!

8
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,910
There you’re teasing your little sis again.

9
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,500
Mum! Kris’s cursing me again.

10
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,000
I’m scared.

11
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,740
That’s all you have to say? I’m hanging up.

12
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,990
Hey, wait a second, are you in a hurry?

13
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,590
When are you coming back home?

14
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,590
Tomorrow, bye.

15
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,590
Why so hasty?

16
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,820
What’s made your blood boil? I’m set on finding a job for you.

17
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,160
Listen to me.

18
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,750
My dear sister.

19
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,400
Would you work at my company?

20
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,960
A great job with a good salary and a workplace with good vibes

21
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,480
suit my sister best.

22
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,680
Meh, negative.

23
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:12,930
Why did you say so, my dear sis? The company is great.

24
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,000
Is it the company in which you work with Toh and Jess?

25
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,310
I don’t want to work in that field.

26
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,610
Mum, Kris is saying no to me again.

27
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,310
Kris. Just join your brother.

28
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,000
Working with him is better than working as a production crew.

29
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,720
What will you do if something’s going wrong while working on the set in other provinces?

30
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,410
Okay, mum. I see what you mean.

31
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,780
Hmm, let her be. Let me talk to her.

32
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,200
How’s your trip, Kris?

33
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,200
Everything is fine, dad.

34
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,920
Oh, and how are your eyes?

35
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,720
The sea is beautiful. After having been blind for 3 years,

36
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,070
I have no idea that the sea can be such wonderful.

37
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,840
Ok, that’s great.

38
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,670
Come home tomorrow, I miss you.

39
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,800
I miss you, too, dad.

40
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,540
Bye.

41
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,120
Who are you?

42
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,600
Sol, have you seen my straw?

43
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Sol, have you seen my straw?

44
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,540
What’s wrong with you?

45
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,890
I’m watching TV. Aww. Silence!

46
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,880
Hey, Kris. Have you been sunbathed again?

47
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,280
Sunbathed or run away from the sun?

48
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,820
Why do you still look pale?

49
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,130
Don’t tease her. (laughing)

50
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,440
But, that’s true.

51
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,260
What’s wrong?

52
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,240
Kris?

53
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,980
Do you think I’m crazy?

54
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,080
Definitely!

55
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,180
Extremely crazy!

56
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,600
You’ve just learned that, Kris?

57
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,570
We can be friends because you’re that crazy.

58
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,530
Come on, we’re ready now.

59
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,990
Tell us what’s on your mind.

60
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,880
After the eye transplant,

61
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,420
I’ve been constantly dreaming of a woman.

62
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,560
Don’t tell us that…

63
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,280
Is it like ‘The Eye’ movie?

64
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,980
You told me you don’t watch horror movies.

65
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,060
Nat told me the story.

66
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,500
Silly, I didn’t force her to watch it. She might watch it herself.

67
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,300
It’s you. / You!

68
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,800
Why me again?

69
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,990
Guys, wait a minute.

70
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,820
The dreams are not that scary,

71
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,140
but every time I dream of her,

72
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,010
I feel…

73
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,420
As for the UEFA EURO 2024 group stage first match results,

74
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
England held to 1:1 draw by Denmark.

75
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,100
England first scored at the 38th minute of the match. / Let see what happens to her.

76
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,210
Go checking her up. / Harry Kane’s goal,

77
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,740
while Denmark / You care for her.

78
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,980
equalized at the 34th minute of the match./ 	Oh, don’t you care for her?

79
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,740
I’m going to work, mommy.

80
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,030
Welcome everyone to sports news today with me, Aonthakarn Rakthai.

81
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,820
You’ve gazing longingly at her for weeks, aren’t you fed up?

82
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,820
Don’t blame only me. Look at those two.

83
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,280
Look.

84
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,740
Jun is gorgeous.

85
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,880
Absolutely.

86
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,220
He looks so handsome in this scene I’m gonna die.

87
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,900
Oho. (laughing) If you think he’s gorgeous, now look at my boy’s pictures.

88
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,470
Look, Jaemin is so cute.

89
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,400
In this concert, the guy looks good in the outfit and vice versa.

90
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,870
Those two are acceptably strange,

91
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,360
but what’s fragging wrong with you?

92
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,070
You’re beaming alone.

93
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,960
Oh, I see. You like the news reporter.

94
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,440
Hey!

95
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,750
You don’t like watching news.

96
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,470
You say what you like.

97
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,880
Hey!!

98
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,900
She’s a woman.

99
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,090
I’m her big fan, ok?

100
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,250
I like her as an idol.

101
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,760
Ok. Just tell us so, and we get it.

102
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,780
Kris. These days women can be huge admirers of female idols.

103
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,140
Absolutely.

104
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,140
Don’t you feel shy.

105
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,830
You can idolize anyone, pal.

106
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,580
Don’t overthink.

107
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,330
True.

108
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,160
You all are good at idolizing people.

109
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,680
Your non-fan life is tedious.

110
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,030
I accept it.

111
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,760
Your Jun is out of this world.

112
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,760
Don’t you dare insult Jun, my idol

113
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,680
Why? Can’t I?

114
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,000
Stop it.

115
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,180
I’ll be happier if you don’t argue with each other today, Ok?

116
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:32,030
I’ve found the chick that you talk about.

117
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,600
Gosh!!! You’ve made it super-fast.

118
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,220
You can count on me for that!

119
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,800
Gosh. I think it’s weird. All her posts.

120
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,670
Krisjo?

121
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Hey, Mr. Kristopher.

122
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,500
What?

123
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,430
Can you tell us that this is you?

124
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,140
Are you a spammer? You like all her posts.

125
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,500
Well., isn’t that what a huge fan does?

126
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,910
I just signed up a new account to give her Likes.

127
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,560
Sol told me to do so.

128
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,920
Nah, I didn’t tell you to do this.

129
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,430
You did tell me. You told me to give her a lot of likes.

130
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,650
Nat, what did I do wrong?

131
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,030
There, there. Stop talking about this.

132
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,010
What should I do?

133
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,600
Kris, I really want to know if you sent her a DM.

134
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,530
I did send her a DM, but I had nothing to say, so I just sent her a heart.

135
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,090
How many hearts?

136
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,960
Lots of hearts.

137
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,520
How many, to be exact?

138
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,250
Lots of, lots of, lots of hearts

139
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,710
Be precise!

140
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,500
Lots of, lots of, lots of, lots of, lots of…

141
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,240
Oh, Kris.

142
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,240
You’ve been blocked.

143
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,150
It’s the first time I’ve ever idolize someone.

144
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,660
What should I do? I have no clue.

145
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,380
Then you have to shout that you love her.

146
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,260
Hey, Sol, shut up.

147
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,700
You can tweet a love message and tag her like I did for Jun,

148
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,200
but I have no idea for a huge admirer of a new reporter like you.

149
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,930
Well, as far as I know, I think the reporter carefully preserves her privacy on this Account.

150
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,030
If you send her a message, she won’t simply reply.

151
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,010
But I didn’t mean to harass or anything.

152
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,510
Oh, Kris.

153
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,630
Why?

154
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,760
You must find something that relate you with her.

155
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,660
What is it?

156
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,880
Well, Meen refers to anything that is not too inquisitive.

157
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
How about letters?

158
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,590
People still write a letter nowadays?

159
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,730
Look, Meen, letters have classic vibes and can express all emotions.

160
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,100
How should I write a proper letter that doesn’t look like a spam?

161
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:13,190
Hey, the new letter writer, you just have to tell her how much she is cherished.

162
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,990
How much is she cherished?

163
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,810
I have to greet her first.

164
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,990
Hello.

165
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,310
Let’s start again.

166
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:29,660
Oh, I can’t even speak clearly, and you tell me to write a letter.

167
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,660
Shall I try another way?

168
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,070
Oh, it’s great that you come downstairs.

169
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,310
I’m busy comtemplating.

170
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,030
Whoa! You’re contemplating?

171
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,620
Pud!

172
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,070
Don’t be silly. Just help me pack these things up.

173
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,690
I’m going to the office tomorrow.

174
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,650
What?!?

175
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,760
You’re even shaking your own brother down?

176
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,140
That’s it.

177
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,640
Ah.

178
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,280
A coffee?

179
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,540
Oh, you cheapskate.

180
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,690
What do you want then?

181
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,130
3 coffees after meal.

182
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,910
Whoa!

183
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,150
Ok, deal.

184
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,150
Are you launching the company tomorrow?

185
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,570
Yes, I am.

186
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,710
Have you prepared for the job?

187
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,170
Tomorrow is your first day of work.

188
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,320
Yes, I have.

189
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,270
. Well, what is the name of the block?

190
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,470
(laughing)

191
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,060
App Talk!

192
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,280
The name’s cool, right?

193
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,380
Toh, Jess, and I even spent a week on naming the company.

194
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,500
Wow, so cool,

195
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,160
such a brilliant name.

196
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,280
Just wow, My eyes are out on stalks. Bravo!

197
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,920
Are you mocking me?/ 	Excellent!

198
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,020
Excellent!

199
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,360
Hey, don’t hurt me.

200
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,140
And sports news today with me, Aonthakarn Rakthai.

201
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,250
And sports news today with me, Aonthakarn Rakthai.

202
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,080
And sports news today with me, Aonthakarn Rakthai.

203
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,570
Why are you absent-minded?

204
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,900
Let me take a look.

205
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,200
Oh, it’s Aonthakarn.

206
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,320
Do you know her?

207
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,980
Yeah, she’s Toh’s sister.

208
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,470
I heard she’s gonna quit her job.

209
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,000
Why? Why is she resigning as news reporter?

210
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,130
I have no idea. She might be burnt out.

211
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,500
Ouch! Kris, did you just kick me?

212
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,520
Yeah.

213
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,270
Kris.

214
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,140
Do the rest on your own. I have something to do.

215
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,700
What are you doing?

216
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,300
This is your job.

217
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,390
I can fire you right now, you little brat.

218
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,920
Pud, don’t call your sister names.

219
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,920
I don’t, mum.

220
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,990
Dear...

221
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,220
Dear my beloved person

222
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,700
Hello, what are you inquiring about?

223
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,360
I’d like to leave something for Ms. Aonthakarn, the sports news reporter.

224
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,190
From whom?

225
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,380
From Kri..

226
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,110
from Apple.

227
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,100
Ms. Aonthakarn, you’ve got a package.

228
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,710
Thank you very much.

229
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,980
My dear sis, where are you?

230
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,140
So cute.

231
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,200
Of course. I know I’m cute.

232
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,160
Just rush to the office, everyone is waiting for us.

233
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,710
I’m not talking about you, silly brother.

234
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,470
I hope you smile a lot today,

235
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,830
my beloved person.

236
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:41,030
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

237
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,500
Even though my heart is broken,

238
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,270
I just wish you all the best.. all those great things you wish for.

239
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:04,960
Hey

240
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,160
Toh

241
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,840
Kris.

242
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,270
The last time I saw you, you were just a high school girl, right?

243
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:11,760
Yeah

244
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,760
Oh, you’ve grown up a lot.

245
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,680
Am I prettier?

246
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,400
You look just the same.

247
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,320
Of course, I always look youthful.

248
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,450
Not at all, you look funny.

249
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,470
Here comes our little sister.

250
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,330
Wow, Kris, we haven’t seen each other for ages.

251
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,580
Hello, Jess.

252
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,180
Hello.

253
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,960
Come one, take a seat.

254
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
Wow, you’re becoming really prettier.

255
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,120
Very true.

256
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,520
Do you have a boyfriend?

257
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,040
Hey!

258
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,210
She might not have one, but I’m single.

259
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,110
Are you interested in me?

260
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,830
Nope.

261
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,630
Just take a seat.

262
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,960
All of you are just the same.

263
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,770
Handsome as always.

264
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,630
Goofy!

265
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,420
I think she’s arrived.

266
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,520
Oh, bring her along here.

267
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
There’s more to come?

268
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,040
This is Aonthakarn, the leading host of App Talk.

269
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,400
She’ll work as a part-time host for our afternoon programmes

270
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,770
for a month until she quits the previous job.

271
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,630
That’s right.

272
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,180
This is Pud, our CEO.

273
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,190
Hello.

274
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,360
Hello.

275
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,420
I’m glad to work with you.

276
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,540
I’m glad to work with you, too.

277
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,620
And, Karn, this is Jess, our large shareholder.

278
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,080
He’s a friend of mine from university.

279
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,160
Hello, Jess.

280
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,060
Hello, you can call me Bro. We’re like family.

281
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,290
And this is Kris, Pud’s sister, from the Production Department

282
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,200
Hello, Kris. I’m Aonthakarn.

283
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,950
You can call me Karn.

284
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,700
(laughing)

285
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,990
There’re only 2 female staff members, so you’d better make friends.

286
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,240
Yes, only 2 girls.

287
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,840
Hey, welcome Karn with some drinks over there.

288
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,410
Ok, take a seat and have some drinks.

289
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,260
Please have a seat here.

290
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,850
Thank you.

291
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,220
What’s wrong with you?

292
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,760
You’ve forgotten your manners.

293
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,360
Ouch!! What are you doing?

294
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,440
Isn’t it a dream?

295
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,840
No, it’s not.

296
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,260
Oh, Kris, what have you done?

297
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,210
The first impression is bad.

298
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:39,120
Why don’t you tell me that Karn is gonna be our host?

299
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,560
I’ve told you, but you don’t listen to me.

300
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,830
Why don’t you…

301
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,830
Don’t waste time arguing.

302
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:51,860
Go there, hurry!

303
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,110
Oh,

304
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,110
what are you doing there?

305
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,000
Are you talking with the curtain? Come here right

306
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,730
now.

307
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:27,280
Hi, everyone, welcome to App Talk.

308
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,930
Woo hoo, woo hoo.

309
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Even though we are now a small company,

310
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,040
I believe our company will become

311
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,660
a leading online media in the technology industry.

312
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
Absolutely.

313
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,010
We have a team of qualified staff members of all positions and partners.

314
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:54,370
Karn works at the company as well.

315
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,840
She’s smiled at me, and she is so cute.

316
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:04,160
I could die of her smiles.

317
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,440
As today is the first working day, let’s try creating a content.

318
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,150
Ok.

319
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,000
Good. / Kris.

320
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,510
Kris?

321
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,270
Kris.

322
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,030
What?!?

323
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,790
Get ahold of yourself.

324
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,060
Today, I want you to create a content with Karn.

325
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:26,590
Huh?

326
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,280
Toh, give me the script.

327
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,300
Karn, the script was written by Toh.

328
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,620
And I’d like you to read and adjust it to suit you.

329
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,260
Ok.

330
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,360
Provided that it’s Toh’s writing, adjustments is probably not needed.

331
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
No doubt.

332
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,290
Here’s cold water for you all.

333
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,740
Yay.

334
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,500
This is an auspicious time, everybody.

335
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,680
Kris.

336
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,460
Kris, come on.

337
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,850
Cheers!

338
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,890
Oh!

339
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,860
Please excuse me, I’ll be back in a minute.

340
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,010
Kris

341
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,620
Yeah?

342
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,650
Can I call you Kris?

343
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,050
What would I say? Come on, come on.

344
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,460
Yes.

345
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,290
How old are you?

346
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,100
We’re of the same age.

347
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,220
Do you know how old I am?

348
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,600
Um, we’d better start shooting in the natural light.

349
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,900
I’ll tilt the camera up, um, upward.

350
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,670
You can speak according to the script.

351
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,000
Ok.

352
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,360
Record.

353
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:50,790
Another outstanding features of these headphones is sound quality,

354
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:55,540
Particularly they offer all music genres with detailed sound of high quality.

355
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,180
Aonthakarn

356
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:13,930
Yes?

357
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,480
Have you called me?

358
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:20,940
No, I haven’t.

359
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,810
Can I see the clip?

360
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,700
That’s. Too. Close!!!

361
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,700
You don’t like me?

362
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,540
Argg! Waah!

363
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,180
What the fuck did you do, Kris?

364
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,080
What the fuck did you do?

365
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,340
How are you, Kris? Please keep me posted. Don’t be silent. It stresses me out!

366
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,900
Are you okay?

367
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,740
I thought she might be dead now.

368
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,520
Damn you all!

369
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,650
What’s going on? Tell us now.

370
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,230
You caused a problem again, huh?

371
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,790
I did bad with Kan.

372
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,840
Why did you do that?

373
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,650
Who would want to do that on purpose? I was just too shy.

374
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,260
Damn you, Kris! You little fool!

375
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,990
Argg! You really let me down.

376
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,980
So, what do I do?

377
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:11,850
I don’t dare to look her in the eyes. She’s too cute.

378
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,820
Oh my god! Such an inexperienced die-hard fan!

379
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,400
Stop dancing on my grave!

380
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,400
I’m stressed and dying here.

381
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:23,100
Tomorrow, go apologize to her and behave yourself. That’s simple.

382
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,630
How? I can’t even look her in the eyes.

383
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,020
Argg! Are you a little baby?

384
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,650
Just say, I’m sorry”. That’s simple.

385
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,310
Nat, you yell at me again!

386
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,890
Because you’re annoying!

387
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:42,520
Now, Kris, when you talk to her, you just look at her nose, not her eyes.

388
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,730
I can do that?

389
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,960
This is a good recommendation.

390
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,850
Huh. I’m a genius, aren’t I?

391
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,170
Of course! My Sol is a super genius!

392
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:01,770
Alright, then. I’m going to talk with Kan’s nose and behave myselg.

393
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,040
Go for it, girl!

394
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,140
Very good.

395
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,320
Consciousness comes and wisdom arises.

396
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,330
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!

397
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,020
You little fool! You can do it!

398
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,440
Thank you all! Bye.

399
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:26,070
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it! You little fool!

400
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,290
Would it really help? Damn!

401
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,660
Guys, what’s wrong with Kris?

402
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,490
I wonder, too.

403
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,500
Pud, you should take you sister to get some help.

404
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,890
You mean to see a doctor?

405
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,580
Pud! You dumbass!

406
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,080
The exorcist, of course! Judging from her condition, bathing in holy water might not enough.

407
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,900
Then, what do I have to do?

408
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,180
Bring the whole bottle!

409
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,490
Fuck!

410
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,100
You can do it! You can do it! You like fool!

411
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,490
Go for it!

412
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,750
Kan?

413
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,200
Yes?

414
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,600
Is the script ready?

415
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,370
Oh, almost.

416
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,670
Argg! You fool, Kris!

417
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,900
Looking at her nose doesn’t help at all!

418
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,150
Hmm.

419
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,660
Don’t for get to click ‘Like’ and ‘Share’ and subscribe to App Talk, too.

420
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,920
and Cut!

421
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,200
May I check the clip?

422
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,400
Ah, go ahead.

423
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,890
What’s this letter?

424
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,280
A letter from my important fan.

425
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,190
To…My Dear.

426
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,860
I’m not good at talking so I write this letter instead.

427
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,000
I want to say thank you.

428
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,280
I am a useless person.

429
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,790
Whatever I tried, it always failed.

430
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,750
But one day I saw you on TV.

431
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,890
Your eyes were full of dreams.

432
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,230
It has become the force for me to want to fight again.

433
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,810
Are you tried?

434
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,630
It’s alright.

435
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,420
Let’s try together.

436
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,490
I hope my feeling will get through to you.

437
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:25,030
From…Your fan. Apple

438
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:30,650
Toh, about the M.C. job you used to ask me. Can I have it a try?

439
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,020
My fan doesn’t want me to give up.

440
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,020
An important fan.

441
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,710
Yes. Any problem?

442
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,560
No. I just… I don’t think that you have a fan, too.

443
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,700
You fool, Kris! What the fuck did you just say?

444
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,600
May I have it back, Kris?

445
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,270
Let me get some rest now.

446
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,630
Hey, you finish the shooting?

447
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,960
Hmm.

448
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,120
And where is Kan?

449
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,460
Don’t tell me that you caused a problem again.

450
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,880
I did not.

451
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,270
Are you sure?

452
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,020
It’s not easy for me to get Kan to help.

453
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,260
I almost had to beg Toh.

454
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,260
I know that.

455
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,840
เออ..

456
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,310
Kan is beautiful, isn’t she?

457
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,880
But she looks sad.

458
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,170
I heard that her mother just died.

459
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,590
Are you serious?

460
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,550
Yes.

461
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,470
Toh just told me.

462
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,040
He said there were just the two of them, mother and daughter.

463
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,010
That’s pitiful.

464
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,670
Doesn’t she have a boyfriend?

465
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:35,370
She did. But...they probably broke up when her mother died.

466
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,950
Really? Then…she’s single now, isn’t she?

467
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,210
What are you happy about?

468
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,380
Nothing.

469
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:53,600
I just feel that all beautiful women must have a boyfriend, isn’t it?

470
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,090
She must have a fan as well.

471
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,090
A fan.

472
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,290
What are you laughing about?

473
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,800
A fan.

474
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,000
A fan, you know? A fan!

475
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,440
Kris.

476
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,550
why are you laughing at her?

477
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,870
Do you hate her?

478
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,730
Hey!!!

479
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,630
Argg! Go apologize to her.

480
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,630
What are you waiting for? Go now!

481
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,080
Let me get over it first.

482
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,140
No time for that.

483
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,890
Kan!

484
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:43,110
Pud, I will resign.

485
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,500
What?

486
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,610
I will send you the resignment form later.

487
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:52,540
Kan, let’s calm down and talk.

488
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,710
I can’t stand working with someone who hates me.

489
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,540
Me? Hating you?

490
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,710
I don’t think I heard it wrong.

491
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,330
You should have told me frankly that you hate me so we don’t waste our times.

492
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,800
Kan…

493
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,340
Kan!

494
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,170
Talk to me, Kan.

495
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,290
Talk to me, Kan.

496
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,180
I have nothing to talk.

497
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,180
But you misunderstood.

498
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,390
About what?

499
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,790
About how I have no mothers, no boyfriends, or no one at all.

500
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,710
It’s not like that, Kan.

501
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,510
Or about how I have a fan that’s funny?

502
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,070
Negative.

503
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,080
You don’t have to try to explain.

504
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,510
What you’ve done to me for all these days is clear enough.

505
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,300
Het, Kan!

506
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,790
Wait! Please calm down, okay?

507
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,790
I calm down now, Toh.

508
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,900
But this is really too much for me.

509
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
I have to apologize for my sister.

510
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,650
She likes to speak bluntly

511
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,390
and make annoyed face but she is harmless.

512
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,790
You don’t have to apologize, Pud. It is no one’s fault.

513
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,030
It’s just someone hating the other.

514
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,680
So it’s better to not push it to work together.

515
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,020
Okay, Kan. I get it.

516
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,920
Just give me one week.

517
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,500
Let me find a new M.C. first. Please.

518
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,250
For my sake. For your Apple’s sake.

519
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,830
I get it.

520
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
Today I’m leaving first.

521
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,990
Why do you always cause problems, Kris?

522
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,190
Do you how hard it was to get Kan t work with us?

523
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,610
Do you know that she wouldn’t accept the job at first?

524
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,710
But I heard that there was this fan that caused her to accept the job.

525
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,340
Is it too hard for you just to behave yourself?

526
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,520
You’re a grown-up now, you know?

527
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,870
Don’t say like it is easy thing to do.

528
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:32,180
I’m not like you who always succeed in everything you do.

529
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,840
Hey, Kirs, don’t be a bully.

530
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,020
I am useless anyway.

531
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,410
Where’re you going, Kris? It’s late at night.

532
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:40,380
Fuck off!

533
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,280
Kris!

534
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,020
Damn you, Kris!

535
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,050
You fool!

536
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,520
How could you forget your purse?

537
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,440
Hello, Meen. Come pick me up.

538
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,540
I forgot my purse. Please, my friend.

539
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,280
Hmm. Don’t worry, Pud. She’s with me now.

540
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,950
Okay. Not so good.

541
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:42,110
Okay. I’ll take her home. Don’t worry.

542
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,590
Yes. Bye.

543
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,480
Now tell me what problem you have caused. Look at how bad shape you are in.

544
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,480
I’m so bored with myself.

545
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,770
It seems like I always make a mistake in everything I do.

546
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,610
I quit studying pharmacy and chose to study film.

547
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,850
In the end, I was unemployed for almost a year.

548
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:23,200
When I finally got a job as an assistant director, I became blind.

549
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,180
But that’s something no one wants it to happen to you.

550
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:36,330
And this time, my main hates me now.

551
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,750
Kris, listen to me.

552
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,750
Are you a God, huh?

553
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:56,000
You have to be a God if you choose something and it is always correct.

554
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,940
You win some, you lose some. That’s life.

555
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:05,700
You don’t get to be a pharmacist but you are Kris from Film Major

556
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,710
and you get to meet us, your gang of lovely friends.

557
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,390
It’s because you became blind that you got to dream about Kan, isn’t it?

558
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,760
Life is not right or wrong.

559
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:25,460
Just live your life the most correct way in your own way.

560
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,020
Wow.

561
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,620
Such an eternal truth of life.

562
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,180
And about Kan, hurry and finish clearing things up with her.

563
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:42,050
It’s easier said than done.

564
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,810
I am shy even when she stands out there.

565
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,300
So you’re going to let it be like this?

566
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,510
Just tell her that you are her Apple.

567
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,280
Definitely not! No one can’t tell her at all.

568
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,680
It must be a secret.

569
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,280
Why?

570
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,490
She must be disappointed if she knows that I am her Apple.

571
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,250
How is it not good if it’s you?

572
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:13,370
I want Apple to be her ideal fan.

573
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,690
then what’re you gonna do?

574
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:26,540
I’ll find a way to apologize her.

575
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:35,590
“I surrender, and I’ll follow only you ‘coz I love you.

576
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,830
Even though my heart is broken,

577
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:45,440
I just wish you all the best.. all those great things you wish for.
