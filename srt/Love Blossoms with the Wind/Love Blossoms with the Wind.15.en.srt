1
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,720
Do you know how much it costs to renovate this kind of commercial street

2
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,040
every day?

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,280
If we fail to fulfill the contract,

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,810
we'll have to pay penalties to the merchants.

5
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,480
I've done the calculations.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,400
Compared to breaching the contract,

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,920
keeping the guesthouses has more significance.

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,520
Nonsense!

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,080
It can be developed into

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,200
a unique cultural experience center for guesthouses.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,800
In the future, it will not only attract tourists,

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,160
but also serve as a business case study

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,320
to guide more diverse cultural tourism investments,

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,440
and even become a focal point for such developments.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,560
Create a popular cultural tourism and commercial district.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,440
From a long-term perspective, the business potential is unlimited.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,200
In the long run, the company doesn't belong to you alone.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,640
Which shareholder is willing to put up the money

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,100
to take this risk with you?

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,760
If you think the risk is too high,

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,620
I can use my shares as collateral.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,120
if it fails,

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm willing to give up my shares

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,640
and resign from the board of directors.

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,020
Nonsense. Legal department.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,800
Take the renovation contract to the guesthouse.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,759
you must negotiate it down, it's imperative.

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,800
There's no room for negotiation.

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Yes, Director Gu.

30
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,520
In my opinion,

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,560
from what I know about the chairman,

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,560
he's going to be ruthless this time.

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,479
As long as I'm standing in the courtyard,

34
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,140
I'd like to see who dares to touch a single brick of the guesthouse.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,170
Wait, that's not right.

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,540
If the legal team arrives, won't your identity be exposed?

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,900
Then what should we do?

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,120
In my opinion,

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,840
Help!

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,530
I'm warning you,

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,680
don't interfere with this matter anymore.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,410
Young Mr. Gu,

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,640
please don't put me in a difficult position.

44
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,840
I'm just an employee.

45
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,320
If the chairman finds out about this,

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,640
I can't bear the consequences.

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,170
Besides,

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,930
how am I supposed to explain this to my family?

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
Just tell them you were abducted by aliens.

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,480
This is no time for jokes.

51
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,140
Can you say something useful?

52
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,520
You're staying here for a week and not going anywhere.

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,360
I'll have someone bring you three meals a day.

54
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,640
That won't work, Young Mr. Gu.

55
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,079
I have a parent-teacher conference for my son tomorrow.

56
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,000
No problem, I'll go in your place.

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,240
The thing is, kidnapping me like this

58
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
won't do you any good.

59
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,960
Mr. Gu has also sent a lawyer.

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,960
What?

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,600
I guess

62
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,440
they've already arrived at Qimeng Residence by now.

63
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,100
Go quickly.

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,960
Hello.

65
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,410
Excuse me, are you Miss Song Qiyue?

66
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,240
I'm the legal counsel from Gu Corporation.

67
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,480
I'm here to discuss

68
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,160
some matters related to the renovation project with you.

69
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,890
Renovation?

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,700
Who's renovating?

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,240
Gu Corporation?

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,120
According to the agreement,

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,200
the corporation is willing to compensate the businesses

74
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,730
for losses caused by the project renovation.

75
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,620
How much can you offer?

76
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,640
According to professional assessment,

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,880
the converted amount is 2.3 million.

78
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,640
I'm not the one to make this decision.

79
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,240
It's up to our boss to decide.

80
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,560
2.3 million?

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,240
That's just a fraction of our annual rent.

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,500
It seems acceptable. Let's go with that.

83
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,690
What if we don't want money?

84
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,560
There's another form of compensation.

85
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400
You can choose from our group's

86
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
all tourist attractions and core commercial centers

87
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,080
to select a storefront

88
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,640
and reopen your guesthouse on a one-to-one basis.

89
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,900
We can subsidize 80% of all initial costs

90
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
and expenses for opening the store.

91
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,240
But this place

92
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,140
holds our memories and emotions.

93
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,120
It's like home to me.

94
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,959
Go back and tell your boss

95
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,279
our minds are made up.

96
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,519
Some things can't be measured by money.

97
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,680
Even 4.6 million

98
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,140
can't buy our guesthouse.

99
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
Our boss sent me to inform you.

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,490
It's not up for discussion.

101
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,570
No one is negotiating with you.

102
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,010
Alright.

103
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,200
I will convey your decision to the group.

104
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,860
I'll take my leave.

105
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,480
Duoduo,

106
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,880
why are you gluing the contract?

107
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,740
This is the closest I've ever been

108
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,080
to becoming a rich lady in my life.

109
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
I'm not gluing the contract.

110
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,920
This is my heart.

111
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
If our little shop becomes popular,

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,400
I'll hang it in the store.

113
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,930
I'll tell everyone,

114
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,760
'This shop was once worth 2.3 million.'

115
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,280
2.3 million!

116
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,340
Can we ever earn 2.3 million in our lifetime?

117
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,320
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,940
I might have been too impulsive then.

119
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,920
Impulsive?

120
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,000
Who was impulsive?

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
What were you impulsive about?

122
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,240
Wasn't it Gu Ci'an who was impulsive?

123
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,900
He's just destined to be poor.

124
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,600
What does it have to do with you?

125
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,060
No one consulted with you.

126
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,240
Is that so?

127
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,330
I actually think

128
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,490
he was quite cute back then.

129
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,960
He's still pretty cute now.

130
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,850
Stick to your contract,

131
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,480
money, money.

132
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,760
July,

133
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,360
actually, my true identity is

134
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,360
the vice president of the group.

135
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,600
No, that's too stiff.

136
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,240
July,

137
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
the one who wants to renovate our guesthouse

138
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,610
is the group's president, Gu Buli,

139
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,360
who is also my father.

140
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
This is going to cause too much resentment.

141
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,480
July,

142
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,090
there's something I've been hiding from you.

143
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
I have to tell you now.

144
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,640
Actually, it's also my father's fault.

145
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,450
What about your father?

146
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,020
You heard everything?

147
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,600
I heard the gist of it.

148
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
You said you were hiding something from me.

149
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
Why is your face red?

150
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
I understand now.

151
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,740
You think the timing isn't right yet,

152
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,640
but your father has already started pressuring you.

153
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,280
I get it.

154
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
My mom has pressured me like this too.

155
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,880
Huh? What?

156
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,480
Is anyone at the guesthouse?

157
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,280
Dad.

158
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,120
Dad.

159
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,700
You must be the owner, Song Qiyue, right?

160
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,330
Hello, uncle. Yes, it's me.

161
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,730
No need to call me uncle.

162
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,800
Let me introduce myself.

163
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,360
I am Gu Buli, the chairman of Gu Group.

164
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,440
May I ask,

165
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,159
when can our group start the construction?

166
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,020
Construction?

167
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,440
It's terrible, Qiyue!

168
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,480
There's a bulldozer parked at the entrance.

169
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,760
And there are construction workers too.

170
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,690
What's going on?

171
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,600
Dad, I hope you'll stop making things difficult for us.

172
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
You're the one making things difficult for me.

173
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,240
I regret it now.

174
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,740
letting you come here in the first place.

175
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
You didn't let me come here.

176
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,210
I was the one who first saw potential in this project.

177
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,440
You said you could help the company reclaim this place.

178
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,680
That's why I let you come.

179
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,920
Tell me, during this time,

180
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,240
what have you actually done?

181
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,000
You haven't made any progress on the relocation and renovation.

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,280
Instead, you've been helping out at the guesthouse.

183
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,920
Is this what a vice president should be doing?

184
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,770
Vice president?

185
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,570
Vice president of the Gu Group?

186
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,200
Gu Ci'an?

187
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,330
Is everything he said true?

188
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,360
July,

189
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,159
this is exactly what I wanted to tell you earlier.

190
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,520
But I swear I have never betrayed the guesthouse.

191
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,380
I'm asking you,

192
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,120
are you his son?

193
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,840
Are you?

194
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,240
Yes.

195
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,160
You were sent by the company to take back our guesthouse,

196
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,890
weren't you?

197
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,690
But I changed my mind later.

198
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm asking if you were or not.

199
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,440
Initially, yes.

200
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Hello, do you need any help?

201
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,560
Why did you help me today?

202
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,840
I guess you could call it coming to your aid.

203
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,960
Can you two girls handle such a big guesthouse?

204
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
Are you hiding something from Qiyue?

205
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,600
What could I possibly be hiding from her?

206
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,860
So you've been lying to me from the beginning, haven't you?

207
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,080
I...

208
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,500
No wonder you're so familiar with this town.

209
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,000
And here I thought you were different from them.

210
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,040
you really do like this place,

211
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,770
and truly wanted to support me.

212
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,280
But in the end?

213
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
I've been kept in the dark all along.

214
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Qiyue, that wasn't my intention.

215
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,090
Listen to me, I hate being lied to more than anything.

216
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,960
This is the second time I've been deceived in this courtyard.

217
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,080
I originally thought you were sent from heaven to save me,

218
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,780
but you've been lying to me all along.

219
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,490
Do you know how ridiculous this makes me feel?

220
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,080
Qiyue, I really wanted to help you,

221
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
from the very beginning until now.

222
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,940
That's enough.

223
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,730
I'll never trust you again.

224
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,920
From today on,

225
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,370
I hope you can stay away from me,

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,330
the farther the better.

227
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,400
