1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,080
Ci'an, your father and I

2
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,000
thought you were exaggerating.

3
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,570
But seeing it today,

4
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
this shop owner

5
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,560
is indeed difficult to deal with.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,120
Yes.

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,480
After all that trouble,

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,880
they sent someone familiar.

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,160
It made me paranoid,

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,970
and I even offended Song Qiyue.

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,960
You've really had a hard time.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,080
Right from the start,

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,610
you've encountered such a tough nut to crack.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,760
It's alright.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,570
I'll take it as experience.

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,480
Please tell my father when you go back

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,440
that this might be a prolonged battle.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,920
But I won't give up easily.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,480
Tell him not to worry

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,010
and just wait for good news.

21
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,970
No need for that.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,560
Do you know who your Uncle Zhang is?

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
What kind of storms

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,039
haven't I weathered?

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,160
No matter how fierce she is,

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,560
she's just a young girl.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,400
Watch how I handle this for you.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,240
Uncle Zhang, you've misunderstood.

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,100
It's fine, I can handle it myself.

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,160
Ci'an,

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,680
since I've eaten your meal today,

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,759
this meal can't be for nothing.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
Those behind me, watch this.

34
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,759
No, that's not...

35
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,340
Uncle Zhang, that's not what I meant.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,160
I'm so sorry.

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,360
I wasn't paying attention yesterday.

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,690
I accidentally hit you.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,400
Yes, yes.

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,200
We really didn't mean to.

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,720
Please don't be angry.

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,090
About hitting me...

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,640
It could be a big deal or a small one.

44
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,500
Well, let's see

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,840
how sincere Manager Song is.

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,300
If Manager Song shows enough sincerity,

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,720
I'll consider this matter

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,160
as if it never happened.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,160
What sincerity?

50
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,800
I forgot to tell you,

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,840
this Uncle Zhang

52
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,280
is a food and travel blogger.

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,000
He's here this time

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,880
to make a video

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,260
about our guesthouse.

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,440
Am I right?

57
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,400
Young master, what game are we playing here?

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
This is Plan A for our group to acquire other hotels.

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,840
Yes, yes, yes,

60
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
that's exactly right.

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,410
Gu Ci'an, aren't you going to explain?

62
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,880
I wanted to explain yesterday.

63
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,140
A review blogger insisted on coming.

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,400
I felt our guesthouse wasn't ready yet.

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,120
to avoid unnecessary trouble,

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,680
I booked all the rooms.

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,960
I have a few questions I'd like to ask you.

68
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,240
Why did you choose to open a guesthouse here?

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,960
How does this guesthouse differ

70
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,120
from other competitors?

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,480
What's the intention behind

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
this kind of decoration?

73
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,840
What are you trying to express?

74
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,640
At that time, I chose... Don't rush.

75
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,840
I'm not finished yet.

76
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
What's your current occupancy rate?

77
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
How many staff do you have?

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
If the hotel is fully booked,

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
can you guarantee

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,040
that every guest

81
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,680
will have the best stay experience?

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,640
Regarding your ques-

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,320
Also,

84
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,040
have you made any long-term plans?

85
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,960
For example, a three-year plan

86
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,880
or a five-year plan?

87
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,120
Is there anything in the future

88
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,920
that people can look forward to?

89
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,400
Sir,

90
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,329
could you give us a chance to speak?

91
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,079
Is this your hotel staff?

92
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,120
Are you the owners?

93
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,120
I am a guest.

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,720
You interrupted me.

95
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,160
and then you turn around and question me?

96
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,840
Haven't you received any training before starting your job?

97
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,880
What kind of attitude is this?

98
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,440
No,

99
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,040
you...

100
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Please, sit down.

101
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,040
Alright,

102
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,280
you can answer my questions now.

103
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,040
Remember, all of you.

104
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,520
Make sure to do exactly as I said.

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,840
Call me when it's done.

106
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,240
It's over. It's all over.

107
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
All our work on the guesthouse was for nothing.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,200
July, don't be too discouraged.

109
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,180
Try to look on the bright side.

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,680
The key is, now that he's pointed it out,

111
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,159
our guesthouse really doesn't have

112
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,090
any standout features to speak of.

113
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,520
I talked to that blogger.

114
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,800
I asked him not to promote our guesthouse yet.

115
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
Once we've made improvements,

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,260
we'll invite him back.

117
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,320
I forgive you for what happened yesterday.

118
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,760
So you're not angry with me anymore?

119
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,560
Not for now.

120
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
I've been thinking.

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,760
Although that blogger's words were harsh,

122
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,000
he did have a point.

123
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,960
Our guesthouse lacks character.

124
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,200
If this continues,

125
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
we'll lack competitiveness.

126
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
We really need to make some changes.

127
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
I agree with that.

128
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
So, how do you want to change it?

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,920
I don't have a specific direction yet,

130
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,840
but we can start by checking out other places,

131
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
and learn from their successful experiences.

132
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,300
That's always a good idea.

133
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,640
That's a good direction.

134
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,920
I've done some research.

135
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,720
Our first stop

136
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
will be a local luxury hotel,

137
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
Gu'an Residence.

138
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,200
I disagree.

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,520
As expected of a five-star hotel.

140
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,040
It looks so culturally rich.

141
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
Why are you acting so sneaky?

142
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,560
Keep your voice down.

143
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,090
We're here as competitors.

144
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,850
It's better to stay hidden.

145
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,480
Let's go.

146
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,180
I must have this report today.

147
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Okay, okay, okay.

148
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,360
I've said it many times.

149
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,890
Alright.

150
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,120
Brother Zhao,

151
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,880
why does that person look so familiar?

152
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,340
It looks like Young Mr. Gu.

153
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
No way.

154
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,520
But he does look very familiar.

155
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,680
Why are there two women with him?

156
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
It couldn't be...

157
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't talk nonsense. Let's take a look.

158
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,360
Young Mr. Gu, you don't need to hide anymore.

159
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,240
I recognized you right away.

160
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,440
You didn't even say hello when you arrived.

161
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,170
Let me make some arrangements.

162
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,680
She's my friend.

163
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,000
She doesn't know this hotel belongs to my family.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,800
she also doesn't know about my family background.

165
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,720
I see, I see, I see.

166
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,180
What's with that expression?

167
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,280
Well, we should let her know then.

168
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
No problem, I'll take care of it.

169
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,520
The facilities here

170
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
we can take a look at for reference.

171
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,720
It's too expensive.

172
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,840
But the service is really good.

173
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,040
I think it's good too.

174
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,760
Why were you gone for so long?

175
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,480
The bathroom was crowded.

176
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,210
I had to wait in line for a while.

177
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,240
Look,

178
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,520
we've summarized quite a few

179
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,360
aspects of this hotel worth learning from.

180
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,200
Why don't we look around some more?

181
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,000
This industry.

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,080
Hello, this is our hotel's

183
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,720
complimentary afternoon tea for the three of you.

184
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,920
It's complimentary?

185
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,840
And this service.

186
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,240
Mascarpone velvet cake,

187
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,360
Take note of this, I'll take a picture.

188
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,760
paired with macarons,

189
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,520
Paired with macarons.

190
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,159
Heart-fluttering éclair,

191
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,240
What kind of puff?

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,200
Heart-fluttering éclair.

193
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,600
Darling, foie gras toast.

194
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,930
There's also foie gras.

195
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,880
And this one.

196
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,120
It's our hotel's specialty.

197
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
Love Wins Cake.

198
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,920
That's a nice meaning.

199
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,280
This looks delicious.

200
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,130
Why is everything related to love?

201
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,880
After looking around these past few days,

202
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,480
it has truly opened my eyes.

203
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
I've summarized a few categories.

204
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,210
Decor features,

205
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
performance features,

206
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,340
service features,

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,730
and culinary features.

208
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,160
So,

209
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,240
do you have a favorite?

210
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,679
The one that impressed me the most

211
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,280
was Gu'an Residence.

212
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,770
Their decor and service are both on point.

213
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,720
And that afternoon tea set

214
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,320
really caught my attention.

215
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,120
Yes, yes, yes.

216
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,919
Gu Ci'an, what do you think?

217
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,280
I think it's just okay.

218
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,280
The names are all too cringeworthy.

219
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,000
The names are a bit, you know...

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,280
But the concept is quite good.

221
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,810
And their food tastes good.

222
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,570
I've been thinking,

223
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,680
renovating in other areas

224
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,040
would require a significant investment.

225
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,880
Only the food aspect

226
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
is relatively easy to implement in a short time.

227
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,320
Moreover,

228
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,400
it won't cause us

229
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,930
too much financial burden.

230
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
Well said.

231
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,460
When I was young, I ate a kind of peach blossom pastry

232
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,680
that was different from anywhere else.

233
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
It was sent by my mother's friend.

234
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,080
It's the traditional recipe from Wuxi.

235
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,940
Peach blossom pastry.

236
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,800
That thing is not easy to make.

237
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,840
It's time for you to know

238
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,900
about my exquisite culinary skills.

239
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,080
Please call me the gourmet replicator.

240
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,600
You can?

241
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,400
Gu Ci'an,

242
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,360
you're from Wuxi.

243
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,620
I hereby dub you the gourmet food taster.

244
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,880
You really know how to make it?

245
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,080
Who do you think you're looking down on?

246
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,400
Should I put the noodles in first

247
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,640
or the water first?

248
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,460
Maybe we should just forget about it.
