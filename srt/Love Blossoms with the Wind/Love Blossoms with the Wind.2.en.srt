1
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,600
Wuxi, here I come!

2
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,740
It's so beautiful.

3
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,290
If there were a picture frame right now

4
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,240
to frame this scenery before us,

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,970
it would be Vincent's 'The Starry Night.'

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,880
Isn't 'The Starry Night' by Van Gogh?

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
His full name is Vincent Willem van Gogh.

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,700
Perhaps you've seen too many big cities,

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,650
that's why this place has a special charm for you.

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,180
You don't understand.

11
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,920
I've imagined scenery like this countless times before.

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,600
I've dreamed of being in a beautiful small town like this,

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,080
opening a guesthouse with my loved one,

14
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
managing our little life together.

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,250
Unfortunately,

16
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,680
I chose the right place,

17
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,920
but the wrong person to love.

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,380
If you chose wrong,

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,400
then choose again.

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,640
I don't want to

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,979
waste my energy on this matter again.

22
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,240
By the way,

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
why did you

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
help me today?

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,579
Robbing the rich to help the poor.

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,880
No, that's not right.

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,960
It should be considered coming to your aid, I suppose.

28
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,160
Right.

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,400
I have good connections around here.

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,200
Tomorrow, I'll get a few of my buddies

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,660
to teach him a good lesson.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,960
I guarantee he won't dare to open his door.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,200
That's not a bad idea.

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,160
Here's to your brilliant plan.

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,320
Go.

36
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,320
Transfer it to Song Qiyue for free.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,960
Isn't this store part of our group's unified renovation plan?

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,120
It's none of your business. Don't pry.

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,920
Just do what you're told.

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,320
But I don't have any experience with major negotiations.

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,940
How about this?

42
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's have someone from our group's project department come to negotiate tomorrow.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
Fine. Then I'll deduct your salary for this month.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,120
half goes to the project department staff,

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,320
and half to enroll you in a business communication class.

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,200
Look,

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,440
see, with this motivation,

48
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,800
I can do anything now, can't I?

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
So, leave this to me.

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,360
Wait for my good news.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,560
You can't just transfer it as you please.

52
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,890
Who do you think you are?

53
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Zhe Zi,

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,280
I gave you a chance, but you couldn't seize it.

55
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,960
You also...

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,079
Fine. From now on,

57
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,600
your store won't have a single customer.

58
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,560
Who are you trying to scare with those tough words?

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,040
If you dare to make my store...

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,680
have no customers today,

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,880
do you believe

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,140
I'll make sure you can't leave this place today?

63
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,090
You're scaring me to death.

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,200
You...

65
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,890
Go ahead, try it.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,399
Xiao Zhu, we've arrived.

67
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,760
Start digging from here.

68
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,440
from here,

69
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,480
all the way to here.

70
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,880
Understood.

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
What do you mean?

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,280
The drainage pipeline in front of your house

73
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,640
has reached its service life.

74
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,720
It must be replaced immediately.

75
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,440
But

76
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,100
if you dig like this

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,280
How am I supposed to do business?

78
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
The flood season is approaching.

79
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,100
If we don't dig, it will affect the drainage of the park, right?

80
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,680
If it really causes significant losses to the park,

81
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,409
will you take responsibility?

82
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,000
Come on, let's start working.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,060
Alright, brother.

84
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,720
Is this it, brother?

85
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,360
Yes.

86
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Stop, stop, stop!

87
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,210
Big brother,

88
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,970
let's go inside and talk some more.

89
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,730
Let's talk more.

90
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
You think you can dismiss me with a few pieces of old furniture?

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
It's mine, I'm taking it all with me.

92
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,400
I personally designed the carvings on this exterior wall.

93
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,640
I'm going to pry them off.

94
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,000
And the design of the storefront,

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,920
it took me two weeks to be satisfied with it.

96
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,650
I'll carry it, I'll carry it back even if I have to.

97
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Stop smashing! Stop smashing!

98
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,970
I'll return the guesthouse to you.

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,200
I've thought it through carefully.

100
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,360
You come here making trouble every day like this,

101
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,400
I can't keep this guesthouse running at all.

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,520
After all, we were once in love.

103
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,720
Don't mention those two words to me.

104
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,520
Disgusting.

105
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,840
Rather than both of us ending up hurt,

106
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,440
it's better to save one of us.

107
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,810
We did have love between us, didn't we?

108
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,200
So, I'll only ask for 500,000.

109
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,400
Give me 500,000.

110
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,280
I'll leave right now.

111
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,240
500,000?

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,580
Is your entire body and your miserable life worth 500,000?

113
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,610
Can't you speak more politely?

114
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm doing this for your own good.

115
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,600
You paid for the store's renovation.

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,760
But Meng Xuan paid all the rent.

117
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,880
This is the best I can do.

118
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,160
I'll give you 10,000 at most.

119
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,800
Are you even being sincere?

120
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
450,000.

121
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,480
Then how about 40,000?

122
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,000
An auspicious number suits you better.

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,320
440,000 is even more auspicious.

124
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,520
Don't push your luck.

125
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,640
I'll add another 4,000.

126
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,480
44,000.

127
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,010
400,000. Let's make it a round number.

128
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,080
One hundred thousand.

129
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,680
This is my final bottom line.

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,480
Alright.

131
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,240
One hundred thousand. Transfer it now.

132
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,500
I'll leave right away.

133
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,280
July, are you out of your mind?

134
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,920
He's using your money to open a guesthouse with another woman.

135
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,560
And now you want to spend another hundred thousand to buy it back?

136
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Do you even have that kind of money?

137
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,080
Maybe you should get your head examined first.

138
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,240
Duo Duo, no matter how much money you have,

139
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,080
transfer it to me first.

140
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
I'll explain it to you later.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
I've really borrowed all I could.

142
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,480
I have money. It's the severance pay I just received.

143
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,810
I was planning to use this money for a trip.

144
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
Forget it.

145
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,640
What can I do? You're my best friend after all.

146
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,560
July,

147
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,840
are you sure you've thought this through?

148
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,500
This guesthouse is where your heart was broken.

149
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,640
Let's give it up.

150
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,240
Wouldn't it be better to open a new one?

151
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,120
No, I want this one.

152
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,960
This is my years of hard work.

153
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,920
Fine.

154
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,640
I can't believe you.

155
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,400
I'll transfer it right away.

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,560
Did you receive the money?

157
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,690
You can get lost now.

158
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,620
I'll be going then.

159
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,800
Actually, Qiyue...

160
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
Get out!

161
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
My guesthouse...

162
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
You're finally back.

163
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,520
Which one is the boss?
