1
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,680
July.

2
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,720
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

3
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,560
We can still negotiate about the renovation.

4
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,960
Let's get that 2.3 million first.

5
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,600
Then you can leave if you want.

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,960
It's not about the money.

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
This place makes me sick.

8
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,160
Just a few days ago, you said this was your life's work.

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,890
Now it suddenly makes you sick?

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,010
Where should I put these books?

11
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:09,800
Chocolate.

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,440
Why are you meddling in this?

13
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,160
Aren't you one of the Gu family?

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,020
You don't know.

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,740
about this matter,

16
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,570
I also think they did wrong.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,640
Then I had a little argument with young Mr. Gu.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,500
Now it's great.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,160
He's ignoring me now.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,610
At least you have some conscience.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,280
Boss Song,

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,780
do you still want these two hotel management books?

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,280
I probably won't need them anymore.

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
You can have them.

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,640
You keep them for her for now.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,560
They might come in handy in the future.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,690
Let's first get that 2.3 million back.

28
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,520
We can still make a comeback later.

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,320
We can't let that Gu guy off easy.

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,840
It doesn't matter anymore.

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,100
I don't want to see him ever again anyway.

32
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,450
Alright then, if you won't go, I'll go.

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,960
If you don't care, I'll care on your behalf.

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,220
I'm going to find that Gu Ci'an right now.

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,320
Cheng Duo might replace Song Qiyue

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,760
to ask for that 2.3 million.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,680
Get ready.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
Cheng Duo might replace Song Qiyue

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,400
to come and ask for that 2.3 million.

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,360
Get ready.

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,480
Gu Ci'an.

42
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,050
I have two messages for you from Qiyue.

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,560
Today,

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,200
I had a professional agency

45
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,079
reassess the amount of damages.

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,160
The result differs

47
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,360
from the previous calculation.

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,280
Indeed.

49
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,610
I should have known.

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,120
Last time when you tore up that contract,

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,320
you did it on purpose.

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,640
It should be 3.2 million.

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,120
Three.

54
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,120
Cheng Duo,

55
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,240
please help me convey a message to Song Qiyue.

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,170
No matter what decision she makes,

57
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
I will firmly stand by her side

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,880
and do my best to secure her best interests.

59
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,730
Alright.

60
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
Didn't you say

61
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,620
she had two more things to tell me?

62
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,080
What's the other one?

63
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,079
Another sentence is that Song Qiyue said,

64
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,500
she will never forgive you in this lifetime.

65
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,200
Duoduo, have you eaten?

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,160
I'll order you a milk tea.

67
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,410
You seem quite free.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,320
Qiyue is leaving.

69
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,160
Chengduo will definitely leave with her.

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,290
You're not worried?

71
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,610
Then I'll leave too.

72
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,090
You can leave right now.

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,200
Look at you.

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,320
It's no use for me to just worry.

75
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,760
The one who tied the bell must untie it.

76
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,720
I think you need to personally

77
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,320
talk to Song Qiyue

78
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
and clear up the misunderstanding.

79
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,640
She was so angry yesterday.

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,160
I'm afraid she won't even give me a chance to speak.

81
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,290
That's impossible.

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,120
As long as you sincerely try to make amends,

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,050
she will feel it.

84
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,260
The problem is I can't even get through the door now.

85
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,360
Then get through the door first.

86
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,880
July, I...

87
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,040
Duoduo, is the milk tea good?

88
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,300
I'll order you another bowl of hot and sour noodles.

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,440
I don't know if sincerity will be enough.

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,400
But my nose really hurts.

91
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
I feel for you too.

92
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,000
Given the circumstances,

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,860
we can only use our trump card now.

94
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,090
What trump card?

95
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,560
Relentless pursuit.

96
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,360
Will it work?

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,800
How exactly should I go about it?

98
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,680
Literally what it means.

99
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,080
Duoduo,

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,360
Do you want the sour and spicy noodles mildly spicy or medium spicy?

101
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,720
Pestering.

102
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,560
Song Qiyue.

103
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,520
Song Qiyue.

104
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,360
Qiyue, if you don't forgive me,

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,040
I'll...

106
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,730
This won't work.

107
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,940
Even dying won't have any effect.

108
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,700
Maybe we should think of another way.

109
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,240
Actually, during all these days we've been together,

110
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,720
you know very well what kind of person Gu Ci'an is.

111
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,380
You understand that clearly.

112
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,240
Do you really

113
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,360
not want to hear any of his explanations?

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,120
I know.

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,160
But what I want

116
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,360
is someone who can walk side by side with me,

117
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,420
someone to face the future together.

118
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,360
He can't do these things.

119
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,730
I might as well leave on my own then.

120
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,980
Gu Ci'an is so disgusting.

121
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,860
There are eight billion people on Earth.

122
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,240
but of all people, I met you.

123
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,360
Oh my god!

124
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,520
A heartfelt confession!

125
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,200
Whether you like it or not,

126
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,250
the fact that we met has already happened.

127
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,640
This is fate.

128
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,820
If you can't change your fate,

129
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,650
then let it come rushing in.

130
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,720
At this very moment,

131
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,120
I just want to tell you...

132
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,650
I'm warning you,

133
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
stay away from me.

134
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,200
Qiyue, why don't you reconsider?

135
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,040
What's there to reconsider?

136
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,610
The delivery is already on its way.

137
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,960
Excuse me, is the owner here?

138
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm sorry,

139
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,880
we're no longer in business.

140
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,680
Who are you looking for?

141
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,320
I'm looking for the owner of this place.

142
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,050
I'd like to hold a wedding here.

143
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm sorry,

144
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,060
we're closing down tomorrow.

145
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,440
Why don't you try somewhere else?

146
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,840
Can I take a look around?

147
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
Please, go ahead.

148
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,680
Please, I'm begging you.

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,880
Can you please not close this place yet?

150
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,940
Half a year ago,

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,220
my girlfriend and I traveled to Wuxi,

152
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,040
in this small courtyard,

153
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
we spent the most,

154
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,240
beautiful time of our lives.

155
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
We also promised,

156
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,730
to get married here.

157
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,680
But now,

158
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,900
my girlfriend is already,

159
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,200
running out of time.

160
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,560
So I'm begging you to help me,

161
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,930
give her the most unforgettable wedding.

162
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,600
Hey,

163
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,200
I promise you,

164
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,120
to let you have,

165
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,240
an unforgettable wedding here.
