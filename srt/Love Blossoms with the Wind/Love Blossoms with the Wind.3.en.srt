1
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,850
Go ask whoever owes you.

2
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,840
You little girl, you're being so unreasonable.

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,640
Move the stuff.

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,960
Who dares to touch anything of mine?

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,480
I swear I'll fight you to the death.

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,600
Your guesthouse owes us one million for renovation.

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,040
It's perfectly justified for us to take your things.

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
I'll say it again.

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,490
Go ask whoever owes you.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,560
Then let me ask you.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,200
Is this guesthouse yours now?

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,920
Yes, it's mine.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,320
We renovated this guesthouse.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,560
I don't care who the owner is.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,440
I'm only asking the current owner for money, no problem.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,240
Hey, you guys.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,360
Fine.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,380
It's okay if you don't pay.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,520
From now on, we're not leaving.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,960
Let's see how you run your business.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,720
Dong Zhe, you jerk!

22
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,680
This homestay

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,120
could very likely become our future

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,280
benchmark and breakthrough for renovation.

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't think we should take it back.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
The old town commercial district

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
renovation involves many aspects.

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,960
Do you expect everyone to cater to your personal taste

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,840
and start over?

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,800
I'm saying, what if you

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,280
were wrong from the beginning?

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Nonsense.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,160
I can repay the money.

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,320
But I don't have any money right now.

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,380
Give me two months.

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
I promise that in two months,

37
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,720
I'll pay you back in full with interest.

38
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,720
Why should we believe

39
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,960
a little girl like you?

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,200
What if you run away tomorrow?

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,759
Who are we supposed to get the money from then?

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
Brother, call home.

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,720
Tell them

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,920
that for the next couple of days,

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,160
we'll be staying here.

46
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,680
If you stay here,

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,920
how am I supposed to do business?

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,759
If I can't do business,

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,360
how am I going to pay you back?

50
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,360
I, Song Qiyue, always keep my word.

51
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,650
Just two months.

52
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,960
If you don't believe me, I can write you an IOU right now.

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,490
Alright.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,760
We're not unreasonable people.

55
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,920
But you must find a local person

56
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,320
to be your guarantor.

57
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,840
Brother, don't you think you're going too far?

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,919
I'm an outsider,

59
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,760
unfamiliar with this place.

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,360
Where am I supposed to find a guarantor for you?

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,760
Alright,

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,160
I'll give you two more weeks.

63
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,720
Just two weeks, okay?

64
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,840
Get the people in the guesthouse to agree to our renovation plan.

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,700
Don't bring up those childish ideas of yours again.

66
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,000
Chairman,

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,000
Director Gu,

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
he must be very busy lately.

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,320
Let's go, come with me to July Cottage again.

70
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,040
Okay.

71
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,960
When will the guarantor you called arrive?

72
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,760
Should be soon.

73
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,180
It's already noon.

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,620
Let's order some takeout.

75
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,880
Brother, I want to eat braised chicken with brown sauce.

76
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,000
What braised chicken?

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,880
Let's have hotpot.

78
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,120
Go to the market next door and buy some meat.

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,160
And some vegetables too.

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,960
I'll find a pot here at her place.

81
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,040
Alright!

82
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,860
I don't have a pot here.

83
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,120
We're going to be staying here for a while.

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,850
How can we manage without a pot?

85
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,680
You two grown men,

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,380
what's so impressive about bullying a girl?

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,130
Who do you think you are?

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,560
Come on.

89
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,240
This... this is Gu...

90
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,200
I'll explain everything to Brother Wang for you.

91
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,520
Big brother, we can't find the pot.

92
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,760
Should we buy a new one?

93
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,640
Buy my ass!

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,420
All you think about is eating.

95
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,880
With your guarantee,

97
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
we feel at ease.

98
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,520
We'll be heading back now.

99
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,640
Let's go.

100
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Stop right there.

101
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,800
Don't you have anything to say

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,720
to this young lady for your rudeness and impulsiveness earlier?

103
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,290
We're sorry, Miss Song.

104
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,000
We'll draft the contract as soon as we get back.

105
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,120
With Mr. Gu as the guarantor,

106
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,800
you can set the repayment date.

107
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,010
Thank you for your trouble.

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,360
Let's go quickly.

109
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
Your business card is so effective.

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
Their boss owes our travel agency money for car rentals.

111
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,740
He should be able to give me some face.

112
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Travel agency.

113
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,320
Thank you.

114
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
What's the reason this time?

115
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,560
Is it still coming to the rescue?

116
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,480
To be precise,

117
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,960
to be precise,

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,290
it should be offering timely assistance.

119
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
It's not for free.

120
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,160
Once your guesthouse starts making a profit.

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,720
Just give me some dividends.

122
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Why are you so certain

123
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,480
that my guesthouse will definitely be profitable?

124
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
I haven't had a single customer yet.

125
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,520
Making a million in two months,

126
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm not even confident about it myself.

127
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Investment,

128
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,960
is not about the present,

129
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
but the future.

130
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,200
Anyway,

131
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,530
I still want to thank you

132
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,760
for helping me again.

133
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,640
Well, as the guarantor of your guesthouse,

134
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,840
I need to understand your business vision for the guesthouse.

135
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,640
Wait a moment.

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
before that,

137
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,810
I have two more things to do.

138
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,040
Chairman Gu,

139
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,000
We've received news from Young Mr. Gu.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,720
He says he's already burned down the signboard of the guesthouse.

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,040
At this rate,

142
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,570
we'll definitely secure it within two weeks.

143
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,640
Ci'an truly lives up to his reputation.

144
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,440
His ability to get things done is impressive.

145
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,170
Quick, precise, and ruthless.

146
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,540
Don't be fooled by this guy's usual clumsiness.

147
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,360
when it comes to dealing with women,

148
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,320
he's actually quite skilled.

149
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,200
He really has

150
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,620
Director Gu's style from back in the day.

151
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
That's too sappy.

152
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,200
On your first day taking over, you're already destroying your own reputation.

153
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,659
You're really something.

154
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm destroying the old, foolish Song Qiyue.

155
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,090
The new store opens tomorrow morning.

156
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,740
Can you help me come up with a name?

157
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
You're the boss.

158
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,640
It wouldn't be appropriate for me to name it, would it?

159
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Then let's call it

160
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,940
Yangshan Cottage.

161
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,240
That doesn't sound very good.

162
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,440
Think of another one.

163
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,440
How about 'Peach Blossom Spring Cottage'?

164
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
That sounds nice.

165
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,100
Let's call it 'Dream Dwelling' then.

166
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,880
Go to sleep.

167
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,900
Are you always this casual about naming things?

168
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,960
Is this the second thing you mentioned?

169
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,360
This is the entire Wuxi.

170
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,820
my second favorite place.

171
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,120
Whether locals or tourists,

172
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,000
everyone comes here to pray for blessings.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,720
The final step before opening the guesthouse

174
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,320
is to strengthen our belief.

175
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you know about the law of attraction?

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,730
I don't believe in such things.

177
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,000
I only believe in your complete business plan.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,530
The law of attraction means

179
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,280
as long as you believe you can do it,

180
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,800
then the power of the entire universe

181
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
will be on your side.

182
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,360
About you guaranteeing for me,

183
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,690
I won't let you lose out.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,840
I'll give you ten percent of the guesthouse's share.

185
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
Now we're in the same boat.

186
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,760
