1
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,920
Let me introduce you.

2
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,400
This is my senior from when I studied abroad.

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,080
Sun Peng.

4
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,120
Hello.

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,040
I can't believe that in these few months we haven't seen each other,

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,600
so much has happened to you.

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,480
But at that time,

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,720
why didn't you tell me?

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,040
I could have come back to help you.

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,520
I was so angry at the time,

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,640
besides,

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,720
such an embarrassing thing,

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,120
how could I talk about it everywhere?

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,160
Fortunately, Gu Ci'an was there

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,090
to give me a hand.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,160
Let's not talk about my troubles anymore.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,960
Tell me, why did you come to Wuxi?

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,680
I accepted an offer from a real estate company.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,810
They liked my design

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,160
and want me to help them renovate a commercial street.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,240
Slow down.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,960
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,090
the water is too hot.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,080
please continue your conversation.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,880
About your study abroad experience.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,080
I'm quite interested in it.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,600
There's nothing special to say about studying abroad.

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,880
It's pretty much the same as studying here.

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,120
Sun Peng, do you remember?

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,000
The food there was terrible when we first arrived.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,720
We had to cook at home.

32
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,640
Speaking of food,

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,720
Aren't you going to tell your friend

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,280
about our recreation of the peach blossom pastry?

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,920
July, she worked so hard to recreate the traditional pastry.

36
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,520
She really put in a lot of effort.

37
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
And we also visited

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
so many elderly people in Wuxi.

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,000
Hey, hey, hey,

40
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,479
wait a second.

41
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,340
I think he's my classmate.

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,479
Move aside.

43
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,680
How long are you planning

44
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
to stay this time?

45
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,780
I haven't decided yet.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,039
But if certain things go well...

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,539
I might just stay here.

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,010
Not leaving?

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,720
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,880
He's not usually this rude.

51
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,120
Boss, we're in trouble.

52
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,760
That Sun Peng said he needed to use the bathroom.

53
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,960
Then he disappeared from the restroom.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,640
Where do you think he could have gone?

55
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,560
He's in the private room next door right now.

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,290
having dinner with Song Qiyue.

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,500
No matter what method you use now,

58
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,320
quickly get Sun Peng to come over,

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,200
immediately.

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,920
What? Someone ran away halfway?

61
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,120
Yes.

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,280
I was on my way to drop him off,

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,040
when he said he needed to use the bathroom.

64
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,880
Then he climbed out the bathroom window and ran away.

65
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,520
When I finally found him,

66
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,320
guess what?

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,890
He was having dinner with his friends.

68
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,720
Chairman,

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
this designer you hired

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,290
doesn't seem to be focused on work.

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,360
That's impossible.

72
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,400
When I interacted with him,

73
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,860
he seemed quite reliable.

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,720
How could he suddenly do something like this?

75
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,400
Chairman,

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,000
everything I've said is true.

77
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,280
In front of you,

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,250
he appears very honest.

79
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,250
After all, you are the big boss.

80
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Behind your back,

81
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,490
who knows what he might be up to?

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,880
Why don't you call him yourself and ask?

83
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,520
What?

84
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,980
Do I need you to teach me how to handle things?

85
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,440
Hello, Sun Peng.

86
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,380
It's like this.

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
The design requires advance research.

88
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,040
Written materials are simply not enough.

89
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,480
only through personal experience

90
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,520
can one truly design

91
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,000
the essence of cultural flavor.

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,560
As long as I understand enough,

93
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,220
in one week,

94
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,960
I can produce a rough design sketch.

95
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,160
It won't be a problem.

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,160
I don't need anyone to accompany me.

97
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,360
I can manage on my own.

98
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,880
Rest assured,

99
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,280
since I've promised you,

100
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,480
I will definitely get the job done well.

101
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
Here are a few more books.

102
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,280
They're all about local architecture.

103
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,560
After staying in Wuxi for a while,

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,360
I increasingly feel

105
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,420
that I didn't choose the wrong place.

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,760
The people here are nice,

107
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
the scenery is beautiful,

108
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,020
the food is delicious,

109
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,940
and the pace of life isn't so fast.

110
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
Oh, by the way,

111
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,560
if you come to work here,

112
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,159
what about your girlfriend?

113
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,420
I broke up with her.

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,880
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
So, what are your plans now?

116
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,020
I haven't decided yet.

117
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I might leave after finishing work,

118
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,770
or I might stay here for a while.

119
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,440
July, which one do you prefer?

120
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,220
Of course, I hope you'll stay.

121
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,480
That way, when I'm bored,

122
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,200
we can do things like we used to in school,

123
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,920
organize everyone to go sightseeing,

124
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,250
and eat delicious food.

125
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
This Sun Peng,

126
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,040
what kind of look is that?

127
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,170
Looks like I need to teach him a lesson.

128
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
When you have time,

129
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,800
I'll take you out to have fun.

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,400
I know you don't like onions.

131
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,730
You even remember that?

132
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,500
How could I forget?

133
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,480
Last time everyone came to my place for a gathering,

134
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,280
each person brought their specialty dish.

135
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,800
Da Hua, being from the Northwest,

136
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,360
made stir-fried lamb with scallions.

137
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Da Sha, from Qingdao,

138
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,200
made braised sea cucumber with scallions.

139
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,880
Meimei, being from Beijing,

140
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,120
made shredded pork in Beijing sauce.

141
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,380
Throughout that meal,

142
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
you only ate rice,

143
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,640
not touching any of the dishes.

144
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,680
Since then,

145
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,680
I've known

146
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,760
that you don't like anything

147
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,840
related to onions.

148
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,920
That's right.

149
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,760
I went back to my dorm hungry that day.

150
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,480
As soon as I got back,

151
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,880
I made myself two packs of instant noodles.

152
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,080
When we eat noodles in Wuxi,

153
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,200
we can ask for extra noodles.

154
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,000
Waiter,

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
add two liang of noodles for him.

156
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,000
Are you okay?

157
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,840
Did you choke?

158
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,080
The book says

159
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,840
someone is going to confess their feelings to July today.

160
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,600
No way.

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,060
What about my boss?

162
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,040
However,

163
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,480
it looks like it won't work out.

164
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
That's fine then.

165
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,960
Boss, is everything going smoothly over there?

166
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,120
Smooth my ass.

167
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,760
If this continues, everyone will leave.

168
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,200
Hurry back to the office and work overtime.

169
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,730
Alright.

170
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,160
I have something to do when I get back.

171
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,420
I'll be leaving first.

172
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,050
Take a peach.

173
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,860
Chairman, please take a look.

174
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,240
The work has been done very meticulously this time.

175
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,160
It also shows that I didn't misjudge the person.

176
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,800
Yes.

177
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
Sun Peng is indeed learning about

178
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
our local culture in Wuxi.

179
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,320
This young man is quite good.

180
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,040
Director Gu,

181
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
what I want to express

182
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,680
doesn't seem to be this meaning.

183
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,480
Look,

184
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,120
from the first day he came to our company until now,

185
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,040
he hasn't done any real work at all.

186
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,900
He's been eating, drinking, and having fun all day.

187
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
What do you know?

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,260
Understanding our local characteristics,

189
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,080
investigating the features of various commercial scenic spots,

190
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,120
is his

191
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,540
most important work focus right now.

192
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,570
I'm telling you,

193
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,650
you continue to accompany him.

194
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,970
Make sure to arrange his daily life

195
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
properly.

196
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,880
If there's anything,

197
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,480
feel free to ask the company.

198
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,800
It seems like this little report

199
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,260
wasn't quite successful.

200
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,400
Chairman,

201
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,480
it's about the new project, right?

202
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,080
Alright.

203
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,040
No problem.

204
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,140
I just recruited a designer from abroad.

205
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,240
Let's have a meeting tomorrow

206
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,570
to study it thoroughly.

207
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,520
Okay!

208
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,370
Is there anything else?

209
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,360
Nothing else.

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
Nothing else.

211
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,340
Don't you have to go to work every day?

212
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,049
This guesthouse

213
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,440
doesn't seem to be yours, right?

214
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Stop right there.

215
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
I want to ask you something.

216
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,360
How long are you planning to stay here?

217
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,200
When will your work be finished?

218
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,920
My work situation

219
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,680
you should know better than I do, right?

220
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,650
What do you mean?

221
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,000
I need to go back to the company

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,260
to attend the overall planning meeting.

223
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,020
I came by to say hello to Qiyue.

224
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
For the next few days,

225
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,580
I won't be coming here.

226
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,320
But I've already decided,

227
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,600
I'm going to rent a place nearby.

228
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,420
I'll be bothering you more often for a while.

229
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,280
Hello?

230
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,410
Qimeng Guesthouse.

231
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,810
We have rooms available for tomorrow.

232
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,600
Alright.

233
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,760
One king-size room.

234
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,440
