1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,960
What a pity.

2
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,020
I don't have a talent for cooking either.

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,160
Since my mother passed away,

4
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,930
I haven't been able to taste

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,260
that flavor again.

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,690
You mentioned earlier that you had another request.

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,640
I was wondering

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,000
if we could keep the original packaging.

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,240
My mother's greatest wish

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,680
was to pass down the peach blossom pastry

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,040
from generation to generation.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,880
Although someone else is making it now,

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,520
if its packaging

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,440
and taste remain the same as before,

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
unchanged,

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,680
I think that would fulfill

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,530
my mother's greatest wish.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,060
This is the recipe.

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,960
Here.

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,320
I'm sure you can do it.

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,840
Try it.

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,200
How is it?

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,880
Congratulations.

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,210
It tastes just like it did in my childhood.

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,680
That's wonderful.

26
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
What's this?

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,730
This is my sudden inspiration.

28
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I wanted your mother

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
to be able to

30
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,000
accompany the peach blossom pastry

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,680
and see the beautiful landscape of the new era in this way.

32
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,200
I don't know if you like it.

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
I like it.

34
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,400
I love it very much.

35
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,920
Try it quickly.

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,240
see if the taste is right.

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,600
Grandma, I want to eat.

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,260
Go ahead, eat. Try it quickly.

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,460
Grandma, these peach blossom pastries are delicious.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,480
Delicious.

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,650
It's still the original taste.

42
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,120
Tasty.

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,960
I think I suddenly understand.

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,560
the meaning of inheritance.

45
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,920
Two boxes, please. Two boxes.

46
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,320
Don't rush, everyone. Don't rush.

47
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,200
There's enough for everyone.

48
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,800
My mom loves this flavor.

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,440
She says it tastes just like when she was a child.

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,920
Really?

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,840
Thank you for your approval, auntie.

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,600
Please spread the word.

53
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,660
There's a discount if you buy in bulk.

54
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,640
You go ahead with your work.

55
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,970
Don't rush, don't rush.

56
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,839
Hello, Mom. What's the matter?

57
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,520
July, do you remember

58
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,200
what I used to tell you about

59
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,530
an auntie from Wuxi?

60
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,240
I remember.

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,600
The one who used to send you peach blossom pastries.

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,240
Didn't her phone number change later

63
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,520
and we lost contact?

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,159
I don't know who it was, but

65
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,120
someone sent me a box of peach blossom pastries.

66
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,480
Oh my, it's the same taste as back then.

67
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,280
Do you think it could be that auntie?

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,640
I don't know.

69
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Maybe it is.

70
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,159
Mom, I've got to go now.

71
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,360
I need to get to class.

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,159
Give me a hand, put it here.

73
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,960
Freshly made.

74
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,520
Here, take some for your family.

75
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,480
No need.

76
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,540
My family doesn't like sweet things.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,480
This is different.

78
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,210
This is the fruit of your labor.

79
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,640
The store is busy.

80
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,700
you take care of it.

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,080
take it and deal with it yourself.

82
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
You can eat it or give it away.

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,850
My father must not know about this.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,800
Don't worry.

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,970
I'll handle this for you properly.

86
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Everyone, enjoy!

87
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,560
Please help us spread the word.

88
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,720
Scan the code to pay.

89
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,980
Scan here for payment.

90
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,450
Wasn't he acquiring guesthouses?

91
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,400
How come he's making peach blossom pastries now?

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,520
And he even gave me a box.

93
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,000
What's the meaning of this?

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,659
Chairman, please eat slowly.

95
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,640
Eat? What eat?

96
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,280
What's there to eat?

97
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,340
He's provoking us.

98
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,320
This is going to cause an uproar.

99
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,040
Chairman,

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,640
don't be angry.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Young people these days,

102
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
they have their own way of doing things.

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,800
Maybe Ci'an is doing this

104
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,400
because he has his own plans.

105
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,960
Plans? What plans?

106
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,930
We're the ones worrying about him, aren't we?

107
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,730
I almost forgot,

108
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,800
let me introduce you to someone.

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,520
This is the

110
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,800
commercial landscape designer I invited from abroad,

111
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,520
Sun Peng.

112
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,480
Good,

113
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,410
nice to meet you.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,520
Sun Peng will be

115
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,160
involved in and responsible for

116
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,620
planning the old town's commercial street.

117
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,210
Oh, you're here too.

118
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,970
Take Sun Peng to look around the guesthouse area,

119
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,880
to understand the situation

120
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,520
and prepare the preliminary designs.

121
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,120
Don't delay the renovation progress later on.

122
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,400
Ah,

123
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,820
is there a problem?

124
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
No problem at all.

125
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,720
Hello, I'm Sun Peng.

126
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Please guide me.

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,890
You really sent it to my dad?

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,520
Did you get your head stuck in a door?

129
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,520
I... I saw you frantically winking at me.

130
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,240
I thought you wanted the old man to...

131
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,760
...feel indebted to us.

132
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,040
Forget it.

133
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,280
I really can't deal with this urgency with you.

134
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,360
That guy called Sun Peng,

135
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,600
stall him for me first.

136
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,130
How long should I stall him?

137
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,860
Until I figure out a solution.

138
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,080
What's the matter? Why so urgent?

139
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,360
Thank you for your hard work.

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,000
It's nothing.

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,720
Let's go.

142
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,760
It's nothing.

143
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,000
The travel agency ran into a small problem.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,130
it's been resolved.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,860
Do you have something important?

146
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,360
Why did you change your clothes?

147
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,880
I have a classmate from my study abroad days.

148
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
She's coming to see me.

149
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,960
It's been a long time.

150
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,690
I have to dress up a bit, don't I?

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,880
Classmate?

152
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,560
Then you should treat her to a nice meal.

153
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,920
I have a good relationship with the restaurant manager.

154
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,840
I can get you a discount.

155
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,080
I'll arrange a private room for you.

156
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,520
Alright.

157
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,360
I'll tell him then.

158
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,960
tell him to meet us directly at the restaurant.

159
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,240
When will we arrive?

160
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,960
The road is a bit long.

161
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,640
But why do I feel

162
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,320
like we're going in circles?

163
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,120
Really? That's impossible.

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,660
I've seen this place for the third time already.

165
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,720
Right.

166
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,040
Well, the Earth isn't flat, you know.

167
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,570
Why isn't this navigation working properly?

168
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Don't worry.

169
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,380
I need to use the bathroom.

170
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,880
Number one or number two?
