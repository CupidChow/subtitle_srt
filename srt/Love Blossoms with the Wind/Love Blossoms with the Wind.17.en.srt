1
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,560
Yes, that's it.

2
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,960
I still remember that day.

3
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,360
We had dinner in bed.

4
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,080
She even placed the Huishan clay figurine on the bedside table.

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,010
Is someone living in this room now?

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,000
It's my room now.

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,280
But it's okay.

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,580
I'm about to leave.

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,880
Duoduo, let's pack up.

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,960
Alright.

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,960
Whose suit is this?

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,880
It's Gu Ci'an's.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,740
Don't misunderstand.

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,160
this was the first night I met him.

15
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,539
He lent it to me to wear.

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
You should get a good night's sleep.

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,320
don't think about anything.

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,840
maybe when you wake up tomorrow,

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,970
things will take a turn for the better.

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
You have a point.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
You're not going to sleep here, are you?

22
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,440
It's so nice here.

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,120
so beautiful.

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,479
I'm sure I'll have a good dream tonight.

25
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,079
Could you throw it away for me?

26
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,079
Ah, I...

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,050
One must learn to let go.

28
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,360
say goodbye to the past.

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,020
discard unnecessary things.

30
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,640
Only then can one turn a new page in life.

31
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,160
Alright then.

32
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,420
I'll go prepare the wedding venue first.

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,640
With Mr. Gu as a guarantor,

34
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,200
you can set the repayment date.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,600
What's the reason this time?

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,800
Is it still coming to the rescue?

37
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,760
To be precise,

38
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,079
to be precise,

39
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,480
it should be offering help in times of need.

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,640
It's not for free though.

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,360
Once your guesthouse starts making a profit,

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,960
just give me some dividends.

43
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,200
The peach blossom pastry is delicious.

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,160
The key is, I don't know which one you want to eat.

45
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,880
which restaurant's flavor are you talking about?

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,740
It's the flavor you used to eat when you were a child.

47
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,880
Congratulations.

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,010
it is indeed the taste from childhood.

49
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,080
I've arranged everything for you.

50
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,880
When the time comes,

51
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
the groom will hold a bouquet of flowers,

52
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,240
then the bride will get out of the car.

53
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,640
Then we'll walk through this

54
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,770
heart-shaped arch.

55
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,480
Along the path, we've already scattered

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
beautiful rose petals for you.

57
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
Wait a moment.

58
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Actually,

59
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,120
our idea is

60
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,690
to keep everything simple.

61
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,400
Yes.

62
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,560
After all, we've been seeking medical treatment everywhere this year.

63
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,520
Our savings are almost depleted.

64
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Actually,

65
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
everything that could be simplified has been simplified.

66
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,800
The remaining procedures

67
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,880
But I think

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,080
we only need a simple ceremony

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,520
and then invite some relatives and friends

70
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,780
to witness our marriage. That's enough.

71
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,720
I disagree.

72
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,280
You only have one wedding in your lifetime.

73
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,720
How can we treat it casually?

74
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,200
Right.

75
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,920
Although we won't be extravagant,

76
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,280
it should still be dignified and proper.

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,360
The necessary procedures,

78
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
the required items,

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,240
the people we should invite,

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,640
we can't miss any of them.

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,960
In that case,

82
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,400
our costs will increase.

83
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,460
We'll have to rent all these things from a wedding shop.

84
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
Regarding the costs,

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,440
you two don't need to worry.

86
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,040
We'll help share the burden.

87
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,200
Duoduo,

88
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,810
this is my bank card.

89
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,220
Use it to pay for the necessary items.

90
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,560
How much money is in this card?

91
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,250
A little over 5,000.

92
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,900
That's not nearly enough.

93
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,210
How much do you have?

94
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,940
Didn't I lend you all my money?

95
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,440
Why don't you lend me some first?

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,920
I... I'm out of money.

97
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,440
How can you be out of money?

98
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,400
What about your salary?

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,600
Salary? I don't even have a job anymore.

100
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
To be precise,

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I was fired.

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
But don't worry,

103
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,760
although I don't have money,

104
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,600
I have a way.

105
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,240
July,

106
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,660
take your things back.

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,740
I don't want to owe you any favors.

108
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,840
Don't forget,

109
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm a shareholder here.

110
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
I'm also an employee here.

111
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,200
The affairs of this guesthouse are my affairs.

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,040
July.

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,220
Mr. Gu, don't be discouraged.

114
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,520
These things take time.

115
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,250
I'll try to persuade her again.

116
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,960
Oh, wait.

117
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,120
Come here.

118
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,880
Ouch.

119
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,240
Go over there.

120
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,159
My ears are real leather.

121
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,040
Chocolate.

122
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,280
Don't think I don't know.

123
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,940
You've been lying low all day.

124
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,280
You have good eyesight.

125
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,560
I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself.

126
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,200
How much money did you spend on this?

127
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,920
Write down every expense.

128
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,960
After the wedding,

129
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll pay you back.

130
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,040
I don't want to owe the Gu family

131
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
a single penny.

132
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,480
Actually, there's something you don't know.

133
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,140
All this money was spent by young Mr. Gu himself.

134
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,520
He and I, we no longer have

135
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,320
any connection with the Gu family.

136
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,250
What do you mean?

137
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,000
At this morning's board meeting,

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,440
young Mr. Gu and his father

139
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,600
had a falling out over the guesthouse issue.

140
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,640
In front of the entire company board,

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,800
he announced his resignation from the board.

142
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,680
Who are you trying to fool?

143
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,740
I don't believe it.

144
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,280
Look at you.

145
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,080
There's no trust between us now.

146
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,440
Look.

147
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,720
Mrs. Gu is calling me to find young Mr. Gu.

148
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,280
Should I answer or not?

149
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
I'll do as you say.

150
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,680
Ouch, my ear!

151
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,840
You've got quite a grip.

152
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,300
it's like a pair of pliers.

153
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,640
Now, let's give a round of applause for...

154
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,200
the dazzling entrance of our newlyweds!

155
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,300
Alright, I hereby declare...

156
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,040
the groom, Zhao Zihang,

157
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,360
and the bride, Feng Qiqi's wedding...

158
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,600
officially begins!

159
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,020
Applause, please!

160
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,960
Come, let's bow to heaven and earth.

161
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,799
Now, let's bow to the parents.

162
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,760
The parents aren't here.

163
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,160
Who should we bow to then?

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,960
Why don't we skip it?

165
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,290
No, no, we can't do that.

166
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,520
How about we ask Manager Gu to stand in?

167
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,850
He is the boss after all.

168
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,120
I don't think that's appropriate.

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
I'll fill in.

170
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,920
Mom.

171
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,200
about the board meeting.

172
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
Let's not talk about that today.

174
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,980
I came specifically for the wedding.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,840
Let's all remain calm.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,560
Now, let's welcome with applause,

177
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
the wife of the chairman of Gu Group,

178
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,120
to give a speech.

179
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,780
Come on, applause, applause!

180
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,320
Thank you all.

181
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,480
Today, we're all family here.

182
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
There's no need for formalities like 'Mrs. Gu'.

183
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,840
However,

184
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,640
I'd still like to say a few words.

185
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,360
I'm honored to attend

186
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,200
the wedding of this lovely couple.

187
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,400
Their unwavering love

188
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,690
has deeply moved me.

189
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,690
I've been thinking,

190
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,080
in this life,

191
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,160
what truly matters the most?

192
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,520
Is it money?

193
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Is it happiness?

194
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Or is it dreams?

195
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,400
I believe everyone here

196
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,480
has their own answer in mind.

197
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,600
But in my opinion,

198
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,120
all of these

199
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,120
are insignificant in the face of life.

200
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,760
Now,

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,280
we have conflicts over money and profits,

202
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
we have disputes,

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,040
or quarrels over emotions.

204
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,200
Looking back decades from now,

205
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
all of these will seem meaningless.

206
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,380
I'm very sorry.

207
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,560
for taking up the newlyweds' wedding time.

208
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,360
I'd like to announce two things.

209
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,600
First,

210
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,720
I have contacted

211
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,780
the best oncologists in the country.

212
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,570
Someone will come to pick you up tomorrow.

213
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,920
And second,

214
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,840
regardless of whether Song Qiyue

215
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,240
decides to stay at Qimeng Residence or not,

216
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,890
I will continue to run the guesthouse.

217
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,020
I will keep it running indefinitely.

218
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,680
Mom.

219
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,280
