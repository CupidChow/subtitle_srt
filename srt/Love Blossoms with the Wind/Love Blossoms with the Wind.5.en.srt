1
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,280
Chairman, I really didn't lie to you.

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,180
Recently, young Mr. Gu

3
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,800
has been negotiating the buyback of homestays,

4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,960
and it's going very smoothly.

5
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,220
Still being stubborn.

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,960
Don't move, don't move.

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,640
My feet smell.

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,300
Don't move.

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
I really didn't lie to you.

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,879
Chairman,

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,760
It's okay if you don't tell me.

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,360
I'll send someone personally

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,000
to check, and then we'll know.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,280
From now on,

15
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,300
you can't go anywhere.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Just stay here

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,280
and wait for news with me.

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,850
Come, let's look at your love fortune.

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,800
The answer is right beside you.

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,000
Someone close to you has a secret crush on you.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,280
This thing is just for fun.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,640
You actually believe it?

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,400
Besides,

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,479
who else is around me except you?

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,840
Duoduo,

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,200
do you have

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,330
any inappropriate thoughts about me?

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,520
Well,

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,280
what about that Gu Ci'an?

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,479
Don't talk nonsense.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,880
Come on, turn to the next page.

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,080
Hurry up.

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,320
Trust your intuition.

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,120
Look.

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,040
It's definitely him.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,920
Gu Ci'an.

37
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,280
Come on.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
Are you hiding something from Qiyue?

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,920
I...

40
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,340
What could I possibly be hiding from her?

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,560
See? Your book is not accurate.

42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Put it away.

43
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,120
Impossible.

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,370
I calculated it so accurately.

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,520
You must be hiding something.

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,050
Quick, come out now!

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
Wait, I have a stomachache.

48
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
You scared me.

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,360
Hurry up.

50
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,560
Don't try to trick me, I'm warning you.

51
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,160
Alright, alright.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,090
I got it, I got it.

53
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Hurry, hurry.

54
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,440
What are you looking at?

55
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,570
Haven't you seen a handsome guy use the bathroom before?

56
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,010
You're the boss.

57
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
Manage your own image.

58
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,680
This kind of small matter,

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,800
just leave it to me.

60
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,520
Rushing to help you with work,

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,240
could it be a sign of affection towards you?

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,440
That can't be, right?

63
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,840
That can't be, right?

64
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,279
Is there anything else?

65
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,480
How much did you pay to rent this homestay?

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
What do you mean?

67
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,640
I'll give you triple compensation.

68
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,160
It's enough for you to stay in a better hotel.

69
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,800
Pack your things and leave now.

70
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
Are you crazy?

71
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,640
I just unpacked and you're asking me to leave?

72
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,040
Are you looking for trouble or a bad review?

73
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Five times.

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,180
You're not allowed to write a bad review.

75
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,400
How much money do you want?

76
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,260
You can stay at a different hotel.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,980
I'll pay for this meal.

78
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,840
And I'll cover your hotel expenses.

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,800
Plus triple compensation for breach of contract.

80
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,060
Pack your things and leave immediately.

81
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Don't test me.

82
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,960
I won't even give you

83
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,440
the chance to stay here.

84
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,840
Dear guest,

85
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
are you unsatisfied with our homestay in any way?

86
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,800
Oh, no.

87
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,640
I suddenly have some family matters to attend to.

88
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,360
So we won't be staying.

89
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,480
I'm really sorry, excuse us.

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,440
Gu Ci'an.

92
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
What's going on?

93
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,440
They said they all have some family matters to attend to.

94
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,000
some said their children are sick,

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,080
some said their parents are hospitalized,

96
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,400
and some even said their house is on fire.

97
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,130
They're all rushing back home.

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,640
Family emergency?

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,370
And they seem so happy about it?

100
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,480
What's the situation today?

101
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,880
All the guests have left the hotel.

102
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,480
And everyone's grinning from ear to ear.

103
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,080
Didn't they say they had emergencies?

104
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,280
I could understand if it was just one person.

105
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,840
But how can everyone have an emergency at the same time?

106
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,960
Don't worry.

107
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,880
Out with the old, in with the new.

108
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,640
Then tell me,

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,980
where are the new ones?

110
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,250
They're all booked.

111
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,840
I told you not to worry.

112
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,240
You've been working hard lately.

113
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,480
I'll treat you to something nice.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
let's relax a bit.

115
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,360
I think I'll pass.

116
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
After all, someone needs to stay at the guesthouse.

117
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,170
You two should go ahead.

118
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,720
Wait for me a moment.

119
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,180
I'm going to the restroom.

120
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,720
Hello, boss.

121
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,600
I'd like a room.

122
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
Um, we're fully booked.

123
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,530
That's impossible.

124
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,200
I've already placed an order.

125
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,440
That's impossible. We're fully booked.

126
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,360
Where did you place your order?

127
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,880
Look.

128
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,770
This can't be right.

129
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,600
Okay, here's what we'll do.

130
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,760
You cancel your order.

131
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,420
Triple the cancellation fee.

132
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,730
What do you mean?

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,280
Who do you think you're looking down on?

134
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,940
Five times.

135
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,620
Even ten times won't work.

136
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,440
I'm definitely staying here today.

137
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
If you keep talking nonsense,

138
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,159
I'll file a complaint against you.

139
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,200
Where's your manager?

140
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
Manager!

141
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,280
I am the owner here.

142
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,960
There's no such thing in this world as

143
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,160
a deal that can't be made.

144
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
There's only insufficient profit.

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,600
How much do you want to leave?

146
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,200
I've really seen something new today.

147
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,800
Since you've put it that way,

148
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Twenty times.

149
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,690
QR code for payment, quick!

150
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,040
Gu Ci'an.

151
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,480
July, let me explain first.

152
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,560
Explain what? Causing trouble here,

153
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,360
driving away all my customers.

154
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,520
You must be bored, right?

155
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,560
I have my reasons.

156
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,440
What reasons

157
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,280
could make you act crazy here?

158
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,440
No, it's just that I saw you were too tired.

159
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,840
I wanted you to take a break.

160
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,320
Do you think I'm a three-year-old child?

161
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,080
July.

162
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,560
Fine.

163
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,080
I'll give you one more chance.

164
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,480
What are you really up to?

165
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,440
I really can't say.

166
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,800
It's okay if you don't want to say.

167
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,330
I sent someone personally.

168
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,090
you'll know when you go and see.

169
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,600
I really can't say.

170
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,760
Can't say, huh?

171
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
If you can't say it, then get out.

172
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,240
Ouch!

173
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,740
Ouch! Oh my goodness, who's this?

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,730
Uncle Zhang.

175
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,410
They're just concerned about you.

176
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,360
Was it necessary to drive everyone away?

177
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,000
Concerned about me?

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
Yet they're about to ruin my career.

179
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,280
If he likes me,

180
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,740
it would be the death of me.

181
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,000
I think

182
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,920
he might have something he's uncomfortable telling you,

183
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,200
that's why he's acting this way.

184
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,720
Stop.

185
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,960
Don't make excuses for him anymore.

186
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,080
You're my sister.

187
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,560
Sister, I'm just looking out for you.

188
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,920
