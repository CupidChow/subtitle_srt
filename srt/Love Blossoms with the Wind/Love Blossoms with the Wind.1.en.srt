1
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,280
Happy birthday to you.

2
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,960
Happy birthday to you.

3
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,840
Happy birthday to you.

4
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,440
Happy birthday, baby.

5
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,720
Who is she?

6
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,440
Why are you back?

7
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,920
People always say

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,320
don't casually surprise your partner,

9
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,360
because surprises can easily turn into shocks.

10
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,560
That's right.

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,009
This woman who looks like a madwoman is me.

12
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
I, Song Qiyue,

13
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
never thought

14
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,660
that I, with my higher education,

15
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,680
would one day

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,810
lose control of my emotions like this.

17
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,240
I also never imagined

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,360
that the boyfriend I've loved deeply for seven years

19
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,920
would actually betray me.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,560
Driver, to Yangshan Old Street, please.

21
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Are you here for sightseeing, miss?

22
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,480
No, I'm here to settle down.

23
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,440
Well, you've got a great eye then.

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,760
The delicious food in our Wuxi

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,520
is amazing.

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,520
Wuxi spareribs,

27
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,440
meat-stuffed gluten,

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,720
xiaolongbao, peaches,

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
the flavors are just right.

30
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,440
What does 'te xian' mean?

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,320
You'll understand later.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,380
Look forward to it.

33
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,760
Yes,

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,660
I'm also looking forward to my future life here.

35
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,880
There's no hustle and bustle here,

36
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,800
no fast-paced life.

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,520
I really love it here.

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,920
What do you say,

39
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,280
shall we settle down here in the future?

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,340
Open a guesthouse.

41
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,520
Sounds good.

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
I'll be the boss,

43
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,820
and you'll be the man behind the boss.

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,760
So, may I ask,

45
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,320
this intelligent and clever sir,

46
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,090
what name do you plan to give

47
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,280
our guesthouse?

48
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Let's call it

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,240
July Cottage.

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,360
Really?

51
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,960
That's all you could come up with after thinking for so long?

52
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,680
July,

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,120
actually, it doesn't matter what we call it.

54
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,779
As long as I'm with you, that's all that matters.

55
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,839
Then for this guesthouse,

56
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,170
I must be the one to design it in the future.

57
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,960
Alright,

58
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
whatever you say.

59
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,290
As long as you're happy, that's all that matters.

60
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,780
Now that everyone is here,

61
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,180
let's officially begin our meeting.

62
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,240
Our Gu Group

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,640
is responsible for

64
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,600
the unified renovation project of Yangshan Old Street.

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,120
Currently, the project has progressed 70 percent.

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,440
Most tenants

67
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,690
have been very cooperative with us

68
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,520
and are willing to further communicate with us

69
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,800
about the unified decoration of their shops.

70
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,000
However, there's only one shop

71
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,920
The owner of this guesthouse

72
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,980
is very uncooperative with our work.

73
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,120
he means

74
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
the renovation of this place

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
took a lot of effort.

76
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,800
Therefore, regarding the compensation,

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
they are not very satisfied.

78
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
Negotiate with them properly

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,680
and try to give them a satisfactory response.

80
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,440
But our budget is limited.

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
The compensation they're asking for

82
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,200
far exceeds our budget.

83
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,360
Let me handle this matter.

84
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,820
Miss, we've arrived at the cake shop.

85
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,240
Speak.

86
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,160
Mr. Gu, I don't understand.

87
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,080
you say this kind of thankless task,

88
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,880
why do you want to do it yourself?

89
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,840
Next question.

90
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,680
Why do domineering CEOs

91
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,880
all like to put on this inscrutable act?

92
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,800
I heard that.

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,360
Mr. Gu,

94
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,100
shall I go buy you a bubble tea?

95
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,680
The design has a strong Richard Meier style.

96
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,610
I really like it.

97
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,159
You seem quite knowledgeable.

98
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,080
Waiting for the Wind, did you also study architecture?

99
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,880
No.

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,690
It's just a personal interest.

101
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,520
My little courtyard.

102
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,740
I've finally come back to see you.

103
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,800
Happy birthday, baby.

104
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
Can someone tell me

105
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,640
what's going on here?

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,680
And you,

107
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,080
who are you?

108
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,280
My name is Song Qiyue.

109
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,040
I'm his girlfriend.

110
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,170
You're his girlfriend?

111
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,120
Then who am I?

112
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,880
Meng Chan.

113
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,220
Enough, stop talking.

114
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
How long have you two been together?

115
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Seven years.

116
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,040
Seven years? You've been together for seven years?

117
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,820
Dong Zhe, you bastard!

118
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,520
Now I finally understand

119
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
why this guesthouse

120
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,850
is called July Cottage.

121
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
You lied to me back then,

122
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,760
saying it was because we had been together for seven months

123
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,220
that it was named this way.

124
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,120
How could I have been so blind

125
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
to fall for someone like you?

126
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,880
I was even stupid enough to give you

127
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,340
five years' worth of rent.

128
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,559
I'm giving you two days

129
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,640
to transfer the money to my card.

130
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,320
Otherwise,

131
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,570
we're not done here.

132
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,640
But...

133
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,890
Why did you suddenly come back?

134
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,400
If you hadn't come back,

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,330
there wouldn't be so much trouble.

136
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,160
Dong Zhe.

137
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,240
the way you are now

138
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,560
really makes me sick.

139
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,560
Song Qiyue.

140
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,360
What right do you have to accuse me?

141
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,720
You're no better yourself.

142
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
All these years we've been together,

143
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,080
it's always been your way or the highway.

144
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,440
You said you wanted to study abroad,

145
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,640
so we went abroad to study.

146
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,280
Have you ever considered my feelings?

147
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,640
I'm a man too.

148
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,800
I need companionship as well.

149
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,730
All these years,

150
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,490
have you ever fulfilled your duties as a wife?

151
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,320
Get out!

152
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,800
I'm leaving.

153
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,760
Although you designed this guesthouse,

154
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,120
and paid for the renovation,

155
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,000
but on the rental agreement,

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,530
The signature is in my name.

157
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,640
I am the real owner of this store.

158
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,740
Give me back my renovation costs.

159
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,360
Your money

160
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,560
is all on this wall.

161
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,640
If you have the guts, tear it down.

162
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,320
You!

163
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,960
Hello.

164
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,480
Do you need any help?
