1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,690
Gu, I really can't accept this.

2
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,640
Take it. The password is 666666.

3
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,760
You'll need money for many things in the future.

4
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,680
Thank you both.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,240
You've given us hope.

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,960
I'll definitely pay you back in the future.

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,220
That's not important.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
I'll be going now.

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,570
Take good care of your wife.

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,920
Oh, right.

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,840
When Qiqi recovers,

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,440
Be sure to invite us

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,400
to your and Miss Song's wedding.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,480
Well...

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
You'd better not get your hopes up too high.

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,520
Young Mr. Gu,

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,120
Chairman Gu wants you to return to the company.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,160
Don't call me Young Mr. Gu anymore.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,690
I've already resigned from the family board.

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,280
It's about Qimengju.

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Qimengju?

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,520
Dad,

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,240
didn't you say

24
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,940
there was a meeting today?

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,460
Where is everyone?

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,880
Today,

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,880
it's just a meeting between us, father and son.

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,810
Chairman Gu,

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,479
regarding the matter of Qimeng Residence,

30
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,140
I absolutely won't back down.

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,600
I say, you young people,

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,040
why are you so radical?

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,200
Can't we just sit down and talk calmly?

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,600
Ci'an,

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,480
I

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,540
haven't had a close look at you in a long time.

37
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,010
I was there on your wedding day too,

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,579
just didn't go inside.

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,120
When I saw

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,720
you striving so hard for a couple

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,320
who were complete strangers,

42
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,380
trying to create happiness and hope,

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,730
I suddenly realized

44
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,170
you were indeed doing something meaningful.

45
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,890
These past few days,

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,000
I've been investigating some

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
guests who have stayed at your guesthouse.

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,880
Their feedback about you

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,620
is very satisfactory.

50
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,840
I've come to realize

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,840
you've done so much for the guesthouse.

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,120
It is indeed, as you said,

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,000
of cultural and commercial value.

54
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,440
Ci'an,

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,520
this time,

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,500
Dad was wrong to blame you.

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,720
I'm getting old,

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,040
and in the future, the group's affairs

59
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,440
will have to be handled by you young people.

60
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
So,

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,840
you need to come back

62
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,000
and present your latest planning proposal

63
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,820
to the board of directors.

64
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Gu Group

65
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,780
welcomes you back.

66
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,079
It hurts.

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,960
It really hurts.

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,020
Where does it hurt?

69
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
My stomach hurts.

70
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,080
I'll go buy some medicine.

71
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,120
Hurry, hurry!

72
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,880
Oh, wait.

73
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,400
Why are you back again?

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
What medicine should I buy?

75
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,400
I'll buy that, that one.

76
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,760
Compound metronidazole dopamine secretion.

77
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,840
Loquat syrup, go quickly!

78
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
Is this Chinese or Western medicine?

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
I didn't remember it just now.

80
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
Didn't remember.

81
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,360
Just buy that compound metr-

82
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,959
Oh, loquat syrup, go quickly, hurry!

83
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,160
This is different from what you said before.

84
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
It's the same, it's the same.

85
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,720
Okay, okay.

86
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,640
Run forward!

87
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,520
Quick, we must

88
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,780
finalize the confession process today.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,680
While she's not here,

90
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,440
let's discuss it.

91
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,570
Should I choose daytime or nighttime?

92
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,880
Nighttime is romantic.

93
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,640
Let's do it at night.

94
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,159
Alright, we need to find a place with streetlights.

95
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,920
A place with streetlights.

96
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,880
I have an important announcement to make.

97
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,920
Hey, don't announce it yet.

98
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,120
Nothing is more important

99
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
than Zhu Guli confessing to Cheng Duo.

100
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,250
Come on, let's talk as we go.

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,360
Chocolate.

102
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,200
Why did you choose this place to confess your feelings?

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,840
I met her in Wuxi.

104
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,920
so,

105
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,000
I wanted to choose

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
the most beautiful night view in Wuxi

107
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,920
to let this city

108
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,640
witness this moment.

109
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,680
Who recommended this place to you?

110
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,120
Of course, it was Mr. Gu.

111
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,480
He said this is where his happiness began.

112
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,600
Duoduo, I've brought you here.

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,080
She's in the car with her eyes covered.

114
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,520
Okay.

115
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,720
Then let's proceed as planned.

116
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,159
If there were a picture frame right now

117
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,960
to frame the scene before us,

118
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,570
it would be Vincent's 'Starry Night.'

119
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,280
Song Qiyue, I like you.

120
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,440
Hello, Song Qiyue.

121
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,480
My name is Gu Ci'an.

122
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,490
I'm also known as Dengfenglai.

123
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm the young master of the conglomerate, full of lies.

124
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,730
I'm also the online fan who has always supported you.

125
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,760
I want you to get to know me again.

126
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,740
I'm twenty-six years old.

127
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,080
I'm 183 cm tall.

128
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,440
I'm a Scorpio.

129
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,040
The thing I hate most in daily life

130
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,970
is having meetings with my father.

131
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
My favorite food is soup dumplings,

132
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,700
and the peach blossom pastries you make.

133
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,620
I first started following you

134
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,000
when I was in school.

135
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,560
Your designs gave me strength.

136
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,480
I've always wanted to find an opportunity to meet you.

137
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,560
But I admit,

138
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,720
when I first saw you,

139
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,380
you were different from what I had imagined.

140
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,920
But I quickly realized

141
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,100
that I hadn't mistaken you for someone else.

142
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,240
Before I knew it,

143
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,880
I became captivated by your cheerfulness and optimism.

144
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,080
I also admired the independence and strength you showed.

145
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,480
In the past, I only knew

146
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,420
that one couldn't be honest in business.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,460
But you made me understand

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,500
that feelings were never a kind of business.

149
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,760
Can I pursue you?

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,400
Song Qiyue,

151
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,330
without any reservations,

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
pursue you again?

153
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,400
You fool,

154
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,160
when did I teach you

155
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,620
to pursue a girl like this?

156
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,120
Then can you teach me one more time?

157
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, listen carefully.

158
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,760
I'll teach you one last time,

159
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,400
and this is the only time.

160
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,770
In this water town of Jiangnan surrounded by rivers,

161
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
my dream

162
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,240
has truly taken root and sprouted here.

163
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,440
Although there were some twists and turns along the way,

164
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,720
fortunately, everything turned out well.

165
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,920
In the end, I gained a lot.

166
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,440
Walking on the bluestone paths,

167
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,840
wading through streams,

168
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,450
kissing recklessly under the moonlight,

169
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
listening to the wind from Huishan

170
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,130
blowing through the pine forests.

171
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,520
In this unhurried city,

172
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,200
it seems that any difficulty

173
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,120
will flow away with the river,

174
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
leaving only the lingering sound of water

175
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
to soothe me.

176
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,200
I fall into a deep sleep in my dreams.

177
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,920
All of this has finally come to an end.

178
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
The old street,

179
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
my guesthouse,

180
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
I've returned.

181
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
And you and I

182
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,920
are just beginning.

183
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Cheesy.

184
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,880
I've given you all my shares,

185
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,090
but the future development of the guesthouse

186
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,780
I still need to supervise.

187
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,360
Then do you want to

188
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,520
sign a new agreement with me?

189
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:12,740
