1
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,500
This must be the place.

2
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,720
How come there's not even a sign?

3
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,850
Is this legitimate?

4
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,440
Who are you folks?

5
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,200
We're from the Culture and Tourism Society of Sunan University.

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,800
a week ago, on that platform,

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,200
we booked that

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,810
90% off group deal of yours.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,080
How many messes did that scumbag Dong Zhe leave me?

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,800
Um, I'm sorry,

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,360
the guesthouse has just changed hands,

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,120
so we're not accepting guests at the moment.

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,640
Why didn't you notify us in advance that you're not accepting guests?

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,920
We've been on the train for over seven hours

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,850
just to get here.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,160
We can offer a refund.

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,440
This is a matter of credibility.

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,760
I'm going to file a complaint against you on the platform.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,420
Say no more.

20
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,640
ID cards.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,160
This homestay is pretty nice.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,320
It even has a swimming pool.

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,000
It's so big.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,000
Why did you follow me up here?

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,280
There's no one at the front desk anymore.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,440
That's why I say you're too impulsive.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,759
The opening today was too rushed.

28
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,520
Four or five rooms,

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,600
we don't have nearly enough staff.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Oh, it's fine.

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
I hired a temporary cleaner online.

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,840
She'll be here soon.

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,700
She'll clean everything inside.

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
I'll go in and arrange the ANT.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,360
It'll be done in ten minutes.

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,080
Boss, why haven't the sheets in my room been changed?

37
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,360
Boss, the air conditioner remote in my room isn't working.

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,440
Who used the toilet in my room and didn't flush?

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,560
It's disgusting.

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,850
Twenty minutes.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,960
July.

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Song Qiyue.

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,289
Where is she?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,130
I hope I didn't come to the wrong place.

45
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
You're in the right place. You've come at the perfect time.

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,880
You are...

47
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,920
Who I am is not important.

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,850
I'll go get your clothes for you to change into first.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,060
Here, put these on.

50
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,320
Oh, right.

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,250
Which room should I go to later?

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Go to the room on the second floor first.

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,960
Someone will be there to assist you.

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,480
Okay.

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,850
Cleaning supplies.

56
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,480
No need.

57
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,570
I brought my own.

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,650
I've prepared everything for you.

59
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,480
Why is it all disinfectant and toilet cleaner?

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,840
Duoduo.

61
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,960
July.

62
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,760
Oh, you're finally here.

63
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,880
Why are you wearing cleaning staff clothes?

64
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,140
I thought she was the cleaner you called.

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,250
Hello, is this the housekeeping company?

66
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,520
Thank you for your hard work these past two days.

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,680
But you don't need to come anymore.

69
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,610
You don't need to worry about this homestay anymore.

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,330
What do you mean?

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,920
I'll work hard to earn a million in these two months.

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,040
I'll pay back the money as soon as possible.

73
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,800
Don't worry, as long as I make a profit,

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,860
I'll definitely give you dividends.

75
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,200
Duoduo.

76
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,160
The hundred thousand I owe you,

77
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,760
I might not be able to pay it back right away.

78
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,680
Oh, it's okay.

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,170
Just consider it...

80
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,480
I also got to experience being a boss.

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,360
Such a big homestay,

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,890
can you two girls handle it?

83
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,320
Our Duoduo graduated with a degree in hotel management.

84
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,320
With her here, you can rest assured.

85
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,360
It's so hot.

86
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,960
Hey, hey!

87
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,079
Don't take it off yet.

88
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,340
I think this outfit suits you perfectly.

89
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,050
Let's go.

90
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,380
Come upstairs with me.

91
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,100
Being a boss and still having to clean rooms?

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,220
The air conditioner in our living room isn't blowing cold air.

93
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,760
Is the toilet brush ready?

94
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,440
Duoduo.

95
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,800
What's wrong with the air conditioner?

96
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,960
I don't know if this air conditioner is broken

97
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,840
or if the remote control is out of battery.

98
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,640
It's not responding at all.

99
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,440
It's driving me crazy.

100
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,170
Don't worry.

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
Let's find a technician online who can fix air conditioners

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,320
and also knows how to unclog toilets.

103
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,840
Hurry!

104
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,280
Alright, I'll go first then.

105
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,400
Boss, there are no dental kits in this room.

106
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,560
Please take care of it quickly.

107
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,720
I'll take care of it.

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,480
Boss, there aren't even any slippers in my room.

109
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,959
Bring me a pair of slippers right away.

110
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,320
I'll get them, I'll get them.

111
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,720
There are no slippers here either.

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,800
Can this guesthouse even function properly?

113
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,040
What's going on here?

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,840
Did you arrange this?

115
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,560
Everyone, please don't panic.

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,890
I can solve everything.

117
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,620
Everything can be solved.

118
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,080
Hey, Duoduo.

119
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Tell that air conditioning technician

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,760
to bring twenty pairs of slippers and twenty dental kits as well.

121
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,840
Hurry!

122
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,159
Oh my, these ancestors.

123
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,320
When will they ever settle down?

124
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,300
When can I finally get some sleep?

125
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,960
Ouch!

126
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,680
Duoduo,

127
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
what's wrong?

128
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,360
These ancestors are treating this place like a bar.

129
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,240
They keep turning the lights on and off.

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
By now, several light bulbs have already burned out.

131
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,640
I just climbed up a ladder to change the bulbs,

132
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,170
and accidentally fell off.

133
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,880
Are you okay?

134
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,480
July,

135
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,920
I think

136
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,570
our guesthouse really needs a man around.

137
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,010
Where's Song Qiyue?

138
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,159
You're here.

139
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,840
Qiyue went to rest.

140
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,680
We've been up for two nights straight.

141
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,920
Now we take turns sleeping in the morning.

142
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,640
Those college students are wearing us out.

143
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,060
We don't get to sleep until 6 AM every day.

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,520
Sleep at 6?

145
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,560
Then what time do they go out during the day?

146
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Since they arrived,

147
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,960
they haven't gone out at all.

148
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
They sleep during the day

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
and party in their rooms at night.

150
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,520
Not only are they not sleeping,

151
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,800
they won't let us sleep either.

152
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,640
They ask for this one moment,

153
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
and that the next.

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,860
Look how exhausted our Duoduo is.

155
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Gu Ci'an, since you're such a good person,

156
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,160
tonight,

157
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,290
could you help us take the night shift?

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Taking the night shift

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,760
is just treating the symptoms, not the cause.

160
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,560
They're going to be staying here for several more days.

161
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,600
You need to find a way

162
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,460
to get them out to play somewhere.

163
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,500
Go out and play?

164
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
They go out during the day,

165
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,700
exhaust their energy,

166
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,280
so they won't have the energy to bother us at night.

167
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Then we can get a good night's sleep.

168
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
I do know

169
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,000
there's an Ironman triathlon travel route.

170
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
It covers over a dozen attractions in one day,

171
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,460
and college students get a 30% discount.

172
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,170
Are you a tour guide?

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,380
He's my assistant and driver.

174
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,360
Alright,

175
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,159
print this travel itinerary as a poster.

176
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,200
Spread all over the guesthouse.

177
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,800
Okay.

178
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,000
Cut.

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,960
What exactly went wrong?

180
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,160
College students nowadays are all about novelty.

181
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
ordinary tourist attractions

182
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,560
can't attract them anymore.

183
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,200
There needs to be something different

184
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,480
to attract them.

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,260
Something different.

186
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640

187
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Treasure hunt at the mountain top, new notebook waiting for you.

188
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,040
Sunrise at Anyang Mountain.

189
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,400
Treasure hunt at the mountain top, new notebook waiting for you.

190
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,640
How far is Anyang Mountain from us?

191
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,560
It should be around here.

192
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,480
You're not really going, are you?

193
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,610
What's so special about this sunrise?

194
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,040
The point isn't the sunrise.

195
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,770
Look at this.

196
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,210
Treasure hunt at the mountain top.

197
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,080
I can't go on, I can't go on.

198
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,320
I really can't walk anymore.

199
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,200
Come on, let's go.

200
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,920
Do you still want the notebook?

201
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,159
We're already halfway up.

202
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,920
Hurry up.

203
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,220
Let's go, let's go.

204
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,640
Move it.

205
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,960
If I had known it was this kind of notebook,

206
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,400
I wouldn't have come even if you killed me.

207
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,480
Yeah, climbing the mountain all night.

208
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,740
I'm so tired from this.

209
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,480
This isn't treasure hunting at all.

210
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Shouldn't they just give out the notebooks when we get up there?

211
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,880
We can't trust posters like this next time.

212
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,130
They've gone back to sleep.

213
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,640
During the day today,

214
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,880
you'll have some peace and quiet for a while.

215
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,080
Duoduo, this trick of yours is too mean.

216
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,360
The problem is they sleep during the day.

217
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,920
If they start bothering us again at night,

218
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,180
what are we going to do?

219
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,970
Don't worry.

220
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
I've prepared another

221
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,600
poster for a night climb of Huishan Mountain.

222
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,240
They've already been fooled once.

223
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Will they fall for it again?

224
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,840
The prize is bigger this time.

225
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,120
It's an electric car.

226
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,159
Where are you going to get an electric car from?
