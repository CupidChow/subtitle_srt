1
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:07,378
(Zuho as Ko Gun)

2
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:11,218
(Jo Soo Min as Cha Se Young)

3
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:14,318
(Seo Ji Won as Joo Tae Ha)

4
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:25,627
(Under the Gun)

5
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:36,907
Nice, you're dead meat now.

6
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:38,877
All right. Here's your beer.

7
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:39,907
Thank you.

8
00:00:39,908 --> 00:00:41,676
Mr. Jung, join us for a game.

9
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:43,576
I can't. I'm working.

10
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,576
Come on. Sit down and join us for a game.

11
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:47,746
Lady Luck hasn't exactly been on my side lately.

12
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,017
By the way, I heard a part-timer here...

13
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:51,856
beat Mr. Yoo big-time the other day.

14
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:53,787
- He beat Mr. Yoo? - I'm sure he can't beat this guy.

15
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:55,256
He has won a number of amateur tournaments.

16
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:57,426
So? Who's this part-timer?

17
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:58,757
Well, he is...

18
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:03,397
Speak of the devil.

19
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:09,507
(Ko Gun)

20
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:16,777
Hey, Gun.

21
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,677
- I won't do it. - Just one game.

22
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:22,416
I don't want to do it.

23
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,358
Come on. Just 1 game. Just play 1 game, please.

24
00:01:25,988 --> 00:01:28,827
What? You know how it is. Why are you being like this?

25
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:30,997
- They'll get two bottles of liquor. - Forget it.

26
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:32,027
How about a bonus, then?

27
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:34,468
I'll give you a fat bonus.

28
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:37,938
It's that table, right?

29
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,307
That stubborn brat.

30
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:46,207
Right, I heard it was no joke.

31
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,238
- Like I said... - Hello.

32
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,408
Well, shall we play?

33
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,697
All right, then. Let's see how good you really are.

34
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:21,007
- I guess you got good cards. - They're so-so.

35
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:24,318
- Fifty dollars. - Call.

36
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:28,117
They're all betting 50 dollars in the preflop round?

37
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:29,688
I guess they all got a decent hand.

38
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:33,118
He's trying to keep a poker face but can't drop the smirk.

39
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:35,588
This one keeps fiddling with his cards,

40
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:37,457
so he probably has to play with a mediocre hand.

41
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:41,028
I suppose this one just wants to play.

42
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:44,267
Raise.

43
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:48,167
- I guess you've got a good hand. - We'll see.

44
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,037
- Fifty, call. - Call.

45
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:57,147
- Check. - Check.

46
00:02:57,148 --> 00:02:58,817
I guess these guys all like to play it safe.

47
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:00,547
Raise. Three hundred dollars.

48
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,688
- Hold. - Hold.

49
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,417
Three hundred, call.

50
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,487
Clearly, he's got a good hand.

51
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:08,588
Hold.

52
00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:14,297
- Check. - Raise.

53
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:16,628
Twelve hundred.

54
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:21,567
He's probably bluffing, right?

55
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,736
(Bluffing: Acting as though you're holding a good hand)

56
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:23,737
You're bluffing, right?

57
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:26,378
He's just fiddling with his chips instead of going all in,

58
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,547
so it can't be American Airlines.

59
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:31,348
Darn it. Fold.

60
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:37,658
What were your cards?

61
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,417
The ace of hearts and the three of clubs.

62
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:43,528
Can't you show us the river?

63
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:46,327
Show us. It won't cost you anything.

64
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:49,398
Triple five.

65
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:51,696
So I was bound to win anyway.

66
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:52,737
What's with that smirk?

67
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,968
What is it? I bet you're bluffing.

68
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:56,607
I don't know.

69
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,877
Wait, can you show your hand? I want to know.

70
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:02,207
Come on. Put the money on the table, and I'll show you.

71
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:04,848
My goodness.

72
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:08,517
Fine, I'll give you the money. Here you go.

73
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:14,287
All right, then. Enjoy your game.

74
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:19,928
Gosh.

75
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:21,998
- What the... - Darn it.

76
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:28,437
(The player that is first to act on any given betting round...)

77
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:30,267
(and therefore is in the most disadvantageous position)

78
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:38,647
I should take a selfie.

79
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,847
My gosh. I look so pretty.

80
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,488
Hi.

81
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,157
Oh, hey.

82
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:54,767
Didn't you miss me?

83
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:58,168
There are so many handsome men in LA.

84
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,597
Why would I miss you?

85
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:01,207
I'm so hurt.

86
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,137
Why did I bother preparing that thing?

87
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:04,837
What thing?

88
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,447
- Here. - How come you're suddenly so sweet?

89
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:14,517
I was always sweet to you.

90
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:17,287
By the way, this is a nice car.

91
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:18,788
How much do cars like this cost?

92
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:22,428
I make this much when I win a tournament or two.

93
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:24,027
My gosh. You're such a braggart.

94
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:26,157
Why don't you marry me?

95
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,396
What's the number for the police hotline?

96
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,437
I must report you for hitting on a minor.

97
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:34,467
Hey, another woman will snatch me up if you keep ignoring me like this.

98
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,007
- Be careful. - Whatever. Date someone else, then.

99
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:41,178
There.

100
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,727
- Welcome home! - Welcome home!

101
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:01,567
My daughter. I missed you much.

102
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:04,498
My gosh. You've gotten even lovelier since the last time I saw you.

103
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:08,006
Mom, you never seem to age.

104
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:09,967
If people saw us together, they'd think you're my sister.

105
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:13,577
My gosh.

106
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:16,946
Thanks for picking her up, Tae Ha.

107
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,647
No problem. Of course, I should pick her up.

108
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:20,377
Bye, Tae Ha.

109
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:22,747
Hey, don't be like that. You're hurting his feelings.

110
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,656
Tae Ha, stay and eat with us since you're here anyway.

111
00:06:24,657 --> 00:06:26,357
I'll call your mom.

112
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,127
- May I? - Yes, of course.

113
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:30,058
You, of all people, are more than welcome to join us.

114
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,827
My gosh. If others saw you two, they'd think he was your son.

115
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:34,667
They say a son-in-law is loved the most by his mother-in-law.

116
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:36,196
It must be true, Mother.

117
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:38,197
I mean, my mother-in-law.

118
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:40,596
Hey, what's with you?

119
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:42,507
Are you trying to ruin my bright future?

120
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:46,207
Come on.

121
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:00,618
You don't need to remind me. I was about to give it to you.

122
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:03,988
It would've been nice had you handed it over before I reminded you.

123
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,128
Here, I'm being generous.

124
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,298
A hundred dollars?

125
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,808
Now that my boss is getting old,

126
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,776
he's becoming petty and thinks that 100 dollars is good enough.

127
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:22,407
My gosh. You stubborn brat, seriously.

128
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:25,818
Gosh, here. Take this.

129
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:29,587
Thank you. I'll work harder from now on.

130
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:31,717
Will you go home today?

131
00:07:32,257 --> 00:07:33,288
I have a shift at the convenience store.

132
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:35,257
Do you get any sleep?

133
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,688
I sleep when I can.

134
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:38,397
I'm off.

135
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:45,897
Thank you.

136
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:50,368
(Dad: Gun, I'm going to sleep at the hospital tonight.)

137
00:08:07,957 --> 00:08:09,058
I'm home.

138
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,428
My gosh. The school uniform is so pretty.

139
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:45,096
My school in the US didn't have a uniform,

140
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:46,928
so I didn't feel like a student.

141
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:48,626
How does it feel to be back in Korea?

142
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:49,826
You're happy to see me, right?

143
00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:51,898
Yes, I'm so happy.

144
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,398
Oh, right.

145
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,737
Mom, this is for you.

146
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:57,538
My gosh. What is this?

147
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,076
I didn't buy this with your credit card, Mom.

148
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:04,648
I saved up my allowance and bought this with my money.

149
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:06,576
My dear daughter, you're the best.

150
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:08,586
Thanks, daughter. I'll put this to good use.

151
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:09,648
Okay.

152
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,388
Anyway, Se Young. Do you really not have any feelings for Tae Ha?

153
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,626
I feel so bad whenever I see his mother. You know that, right?

154
00:09:17,627 --> 00:09:19,096
She needs to get with the times.

155
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:21,497
Why does she want her son to get married at such a young age?

156
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,496
We just want you guys to start dating.

157
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,267
No one said you should get married right away.

158
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,138
Besides, Tae Ha is a good catch.

159
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:30,437
He's from a good family. Also, he is competent...

160
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:31,477
and good-looking.

161
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:34,807
Well, I don't feel like he's the one for some reason.

162
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,606
My goodness. Keep that up, and you'll end up like me.

163
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:39,877
Come on. Dad's great.

164
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:45,387
Mom, I heard...

165
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:47,487
everyone had a special someone destined to be their life partner.

166
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:49,986
The thing is, I've known Tae Ha for ten years,

167
00:09:49,987 --> 00:09:52,727
and I've never felt that way about him. Not even once.

168
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:55,697
If Tae Ha hears this, he'll be hurt.

169
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:58,497
It's hurtful, but what can I do? It's the truth.

170
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:03,307
The uniform is so nice.

171
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:04,707
I can't wait to go to school.

172
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,308
(High School)

173
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:24,457
Attention, everyone. We have a new transfer student.

174
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,527
She's from LA.

175
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:29,727
Be nice to her, all of you. Okay?

176
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:32,438
Hi, it's nice to meet you all.

177
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:33,938
I'm Cha Se Young.

178
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:41,038
All right. Do we have an empty desk?

179
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:44,877
There's one right next to Gun. You can sit there.

180
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:48,788
Okay.

181
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:05,538
Hi, I'm Cha Se Young.

182
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:07,138
Nice to meet you.

183
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:16,048
Hey, you're very good-looking.

184
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:17,678
Do you have a girlfriend?

185
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:21,377
Oh, is it rude to ask a question like this?

186
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:28,057
I moved to the US when I was in middle school,

187
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,857
so I don't have many friends in Korea.

188
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:32,597
- So of course, no boyfriend. - Really?

189
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:35,898
Did I ask you?

190
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,197
Oh, sorry.

191
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,707
Hey, let's be friends.

192
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,707
- I want to be your friend... - I'm sorry,

193
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,347
- What? - but can you be quiet?

194
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,648
All right.

195
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:07,758
Is he going home already?

196
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,568
Hi, I'm Shin Yoon A.

197
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:16,168
I'm Lee Ji Min. I heard you were from the States.

198
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,568
Yes, LA.

199
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:20,076
I see. The USA.

200
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:22,207
I studied English in the US too.

201
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,407
I was in Manhattan, New York.

202
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:27,717
You were only there for three weeks over the summer.

203
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,947
It doesn't matter because I did study there.

204
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:33,888
Besides, I was very popular when I was there.

205
00:12:34,457 --> 00:12:36,827
By the way, where did you get your nose done?

206
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:38,898
It looks so natural.

207
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:42,028
What? I didn't get a nose job.

208
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:44,627
- Seriously? - Okay, then you qualify.

209
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:48,206
Do you want to join the Princess Club?

210
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:49,637
- What? - We believe...

211
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:52,207
you're qualified to join the Princess Club.

212
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:55,577
If you have any questions, ask away. We'll tell you everything we know.

213
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:58,318
We know everything about this school.

214
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:01,377
Well, then...

215
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,347
You know, that guy.

216
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:08,757
His nickname is HZ, which stands for "Hot Zombie."

217
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:10,527
I heard he got along with everyone in his freshman year,

218
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:13,456
but he totally changed as soon as the second year began.

219
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:14,696
He sleeps all day at school,

220
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:16,567
and he always looks so depressed.

221
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,496
He doesn't even eat lunch at school.

222
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,437
His parents went bankrupt, so he can't afford school lunch.

223
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:22,236
Rumor has it that he now works as a male escort.

224
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:23,966
He's got a handsome face, but what's the point?

225
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,736
A pretty face is all you need.

226
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:28,847
Anyway, he never opens up to anyone at school these days.

227
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:30,907
Even if you want to get close to him, you can't.

228
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,277
He might seem approachable at times, but he's out of your reach.

229
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:34,446
You know what I mean?

230
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,048
He can be like that because he knows he's good-looking.

231
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,956
Gun, good work today.

232
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:39,957
Thank you.

233
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:42,787
I have to say, you deserve a pat on the back.

234
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,558
You're working hard, unlike those kids doing bad stuff.

235
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,197
Your parents are very lucky.

236
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:47,528
Right?

237
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:51,127
I want to see them become lucky.

238
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,068
Hey, how much did you spend?

239
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:59,107
Three thousand dollars. I put it on my mom's credit card.

240
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:00,977
Hey, have you lost your mind?

241
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,307
Won't she kill you if you get caught?

242
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,307
Darn it. She won't get mad at me if I win.

243
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:05,377
You're nuts.

244
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,318
Hey!

245
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:11,587
This is nuts. I got AA.

246
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:12,818
That is nuts.

247
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:14,687
Hey, if you win this round, you'll get 20,000 dollars.

248
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,226
What are you waiting for? Go all in.

249
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:17,758
I wouldn't, if I were you.

250
00:14:21,357 --> 00:14:22,428
What did you say?

251
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:25,668
Don't destroy your family...

252
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,438
by gambling.

253
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,508
What's he saying?

254
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,077
- Darn it, seriously! - Why? What happened?

255
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:35,408
- Darn it. I'm done for. - Hey, let me see.

256
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,148
- Did you lose all of it? - What will I say to my mom?

257
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:40,377
Darn it.

258
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:43,317
Hey, I lost all my money because of you.

259
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:45,658
Who are you to lecture me? Do you have a death wish?

260
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,918
If you hit me now,

261
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,626
you'll have to compensate me on top of the money you just lost.

262
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:51,627
Are you okay with that?

263
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:54,457
Are you trying to look cool, loser? Do you want to die?

264
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:56,627
I said what I said out of concern.

265
00:14:56,898 --> 00:14:57,898
Seriously, you little...

266
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:00,997
Who are you?

267
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:02,867
Me?

268
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,638
I'm Cha Se Young.

269
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:07,407
You nosy idiots, mind your own business.

270
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,847
I'm not being nosy. I'm saying this out of concern.

271
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:13,318
You just blew your parents' hard-earned money.

272
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:14,446
Instead of arguing with me,

273
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,687
shouldn't you go home and beg for their forgiveness?

274
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:19,258
Why, you little... Shall I teach you a lesson today?

275
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:25,357
Just so you know, I hold a fourth degree black belt in taekwondo.

276
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:27,097
You little...

277
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:30,397
Are you sorry or not?

278
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:32,466
Okay, I heard you.

279
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:35,038
- "I heard you?" - Well understood.

280
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,637
All right, then. You can go.

281
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,707
Darn you...

282
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:42,107
Go.

283
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:46,048
I told you to be careful.

284
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,038
Why are you following me?

285
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:17,477
Well...

286
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:19,778
My place is this way too.

287
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:22,247
Your place?

288
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:24,518
Yes. Why?

289
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,497
Do you work there?

290
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:34,428
Yes.

291
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,967
- Every day? - Yes.

292
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:38,867
Every single day? Until this late?

293
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,038
What about you?

294
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:45,377
I went there to get this.

295
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:47,038
At this late hour?

296
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:50,508
I'm still having a hard time adapting to the time zone change.

297
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:53,877
Anyway, that's not important now.

298
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:56,788
Did you have dinner?

299
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:00,158
- Dinner? - Yes, dinner.

300
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,487
Why do you want to know that?

301
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,626
He doesn't even eat lunch at school.

302
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:07,697
His parents went bankrupt, so he can't afford school lunch.

303
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:13,468
Good question. Why am I asking you about it?

304
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:17,238
Well, I'm just curious.

305
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,008
Am I not allowed to be curious?

306
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:43,028
Don't you think I'm very pretty?

307
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:47,667
Well, a girl is going home alone.

308
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:51,467
A pretty girl at that. She's going home alone at this hour.

309
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,738
Shouldn't you at least offer to walk me home?

310
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,548
I thought you were a fourth degree in taekwondo.

311
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:02,318
Well, even so. It could be dangerous to walk alone at night.

312
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:05,458
Based on what I saw earlier,

313
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:08,656
anyone who runs into you would be in bigger danger.

314
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:11,897
Well, I was just trying to help you...

315
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:24,568
Go home already.

316
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,038
What?

317
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:28,647
Okay.

318
00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:35,948
I'll see you tomorrow at school!

319
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:41,458
Thanks for that.

320
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:47,058
(High School)

321
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,867
That's it for today's class.

322
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:53,167
Your attitude will affect your performance assessment scores.

323
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,337
- No. - No.

324
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,337
Don't be like that.

325
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:58,708
Enjoy your lunch!

326
00:18:59,508 --> 00:19:00,778
- Thank you. - Thank you.

327
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:13,617
Princess Se Young, do you want to go to the snack shop?

328
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:17,258
You girls can go without me. I don't want to go.

329
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:25,198
Don't you think she's acting strange today?

330
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,106
All right. We'll now begin the award ceremony...

331
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:09,748
for the 2017 Junior Elegance Piano Competition.

332
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:15,417
The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-place winners have been announced.

333
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,988
Next up is the Encouragement Award.

334
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,788
It goes to Cha Se Young. Congratulations.

335
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:25,728
(Junior Elegance Piano Competition)

336
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:09,436
(Elementary Piano, 3rd place, Cha Se Young)

337
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:12,208
(Piano, Bronze Award, Cha Se Young)

338
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:18,107
- Se Young. - Yes?

339
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:20,617
Mom, when did you get home?

340
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:24,718
I promise you I'll win first place this time.

341
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,288
You can stop practicing the piano.

342
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:30,028
Why don't you start focusing on school now?

343
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:02,657
You're good.

344
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,237
I used to love Hold'em more than anything else,

345
00:22:15,238 --> 00:22:17,067
but I started to hate it...

346
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:18,836
because of those who make people...

347
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,277
think of Hold'em as a form of gambling, not a mind sport.

348
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:23,146
I was wondering if fate brought us together.

349
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:25,048
They say if you experience recurring coincidences,

350
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:27,748
it's fate.

351
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:29,047
Joo Tae Ha?

352
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,048
Why are you so angry? I was just asking how he was doing.

353
00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:34,017
- You jerk. - My gosh!

354
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:35,386
You had a one-sided crush on me.

355
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,487
- Don't make me look bad. - Is it because of Ko Gun?
