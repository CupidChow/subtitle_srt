00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,589
(Under the Gun)

5
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:32,069
Give me your phone.

(Cha Se Young)

7
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,279
Don't delete the heart.

8
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:48,179
Let's go. I'll take you home.

9
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,420
No, I don't want that.

10
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:52,450
What?

11
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,120
Today, I'll walk you there.

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,759
Forget it.

13
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:57,490
Why?

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,800
Then let's just part ways here. That's fair, right?

15
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,568
No, then I'll just go with you.

16
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,240
- I have to work. - I won't be a nuisance.

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,940
Besides, I may be able to help you.

18
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:14,410
Even the last time, I protected you...

19
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,880
from those kids playing the illegal game.

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,610
Am I wrong?

21
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,879
Anyway, I know where the convenience store is,

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,390
so I'll go there even if you tell me not to.

23
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:32,759
Hey, by the way...

24
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,030
What?

25
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:37,729
Can I ask you why you're working so hard?

26
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:41,440
To make money, of course.

27
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,179
My sister is ill.

28
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,850
She's 16.

29
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,020
She has leukemia.

30
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,690
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

31
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,330
Let's go.

32
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,669
I guess she's your girlfriend.

33
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,568
Yes, that's right.

34
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,079
She's staying glued to you while studying.

35
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,479
I thought it was so cute.

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,049
Thank you.

37
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,849
- Study hard. - I will.

38
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,280
- Take it easy. - Thank you.

39
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:34,489
Hey, what are you doing?

40
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,060
I have to study anyway, so why does it matter where I do it?

41
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,460
I can do it here, sitting right next to you.

42
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,229
What?

43
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:47,639
Those who get good grades will always do well no matter what.

44
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,138
You really don't look like the type to do well in school. My gosh.

45
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,180
What?

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,220
I'll help you.

47
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,948
It's fine. Just go and study.

48
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:07,090
No, I want to help you.

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,630
Won't your parents scold you if you stay out until this late?

51
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,600
I may not look it, but I lived in the US for many years.

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,768
I'm a free spirit who's quite adventurous.

53
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,609
I don't let my parents control me in any way.

54
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,880
Yes, ma'am.

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,009
What? Why is this here?

56
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:33,250
Should I put this here? Like this?

57
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,090
Why are you so surprised?

58
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,359
Well... Just because.

59
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,629
Come on. We kissed. Holding hands is no big deal.

60
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,699
Hey!

61
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:51,430
This is where I live.

62
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,039
Get home safely.

63
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,310
Get home safely.

64
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,850
Don't turn around. I'm blushing!

65
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,120
Why are you blushing?

66
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:16,060
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

67
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:38,378
(Fold: The act of surrendering one's hand...)

68
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,579

(High School)

70
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,918
You guys dozed off again as usual,

71
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,119
so I'll be sure to include what I said today on the test.

72
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:50,519
- No! - No!

73
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,160
Don't give me that.

74
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:56,359
Enjoy your lunch, guys!

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,169
- Okay. - Okay.

76
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:03,539
Hey, Se Young. Why are you so downcast today?

77
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,939
Just because.

78
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,939
There must be a reason.

79
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:13,010
I bet it's because Gun isn't here today.

80
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,289
My goodness. This is a disease.

81
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,760
- Love fever. - Fever!

82
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,280
(You won't message me back?)

83
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,619
Did something happen?

84
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:54,090
Doctor.

85
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,330
What can we do?

86
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,030
Imatinib is more effective...

87
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:07,299
than the other treatment options in prolonging...

88
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:10,169
and improving the quality of life,

89
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,439
but it's quite expensive.

90
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,239
How much does it cost?

91
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,209
It's not covered by insurance.

92
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,379
Just tell us how much it costs.

93
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,859
Hey, I'm here.

94
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:34,189
- Dad. - Yes.

95
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,499
Gun.

96
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,929
Don't worry too much.

97
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:42,470
You'll recover in no time. They say you're getting better.

98
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,539
How come you've lost so much weight?

99
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,809
Worry about yourself first.

100
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,479
- Dad. - Yes.

101
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,080
Can you go and pick up some juice for me?

102
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,080
- Juice? - Yes.

103
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Gun.

104
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,900
Yes? What?

105
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,369
Don't try so hard because of me.

106
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:19,710
Jun Hee.

107
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,780
You don't need to struggle like this all by yourself.

108
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,710
- I'm okay. - Ko Jun Hee.

109
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,150
I don't want to be a burden to you.

110
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,820
- So please... - You're not a burden.

111
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,489
Please don't say that again. Okay?

112
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,359
You see, I know...

113
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,629
that my surgery will cost...

114
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,629
Jun Hee.

115
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,499
I don't want to stress you out anymore.

116
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:49,700
What do you mean you're stressing me out?

117
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:53,470
It's not true.

118
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,039
It really isn't.

119
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,010
Nothing's going my way.

120
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,519
Hello?

121
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,869
Hey.

123
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,440
He's been waiting for you.

124
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,779
I'm folding.

125
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,220
Let's make a bet.

126
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,790
- I'm not interested. - Hear me out, and you will be.

127
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:20,560
Let's play a game.

128
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,060
If you win, you'll never see me again.

129
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,899
But if I win,

130
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,899
I want you to stop confusing Se Young.

131
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,440
Who's confusing whom?

132
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,779
I've never confused her,

133
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,009
but she has confused me many times.

134
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,109
- You little... - I haven't even done anything yet.

135
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:42,950
You doing this...

136
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,320
will only make me want to make her mine.

137
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,019
You'd better not provoke me like this.

138
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,029
I'm trying to live quietly. If you keep provoking me like this,

139
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,359
I don't know what I'd do.

00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:51,930
He must be at the convenience store now.

185
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,259
I already went there and checked.

186
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,029
I came here because he wasn't there.

187
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,830
Can you see if you can get hold of him?

188
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,069
- Your call cannot be connected. - Is he not picking up?

189
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,608
- Please leave a message after... - No.

190
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,238
He left before his shift at the convenience store,

191
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,409
so that's odd.

192
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,508
Some obnoxious jerk was here earlier,

193
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:12,509
looking for Gun.

194
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,108
"Obnoxious jerk?"

195
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:15,349
Yes, his name is Joo Tae Ha.

196
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,979
People call him a Hold'em idol.

197
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,619
Joo Tae Ha?

198
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:22,619
Hello?

199
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,720
Yes.

200
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:26,989
The police station?

201
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,800
(Criminal Investigation Division)

202
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,200
Hey, Gun!

203
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Gun.

204
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,440
Hey, what happened?

205
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,279
You must be his guardian.

206
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:46,249
Yes.

207
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,050
Gosh, finally.

208
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,050
This way, please.

209
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,570
Then what will happen to Gun now?

210
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:16,579
You see, I understand that he's still a minor,

211
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,749
but engaging in illegal gambling activities and operations...

212
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,580
is a serious crime.

213
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,719
Once we're done investigating the case,

214
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,649
it'll probably be sent to the juvenile court.

215
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,220
Gosh, Detective.

216
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,659
I feel so bad for Gun.

217
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,930
It's not like he wanted to go to that place.

218
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,059
Please believe me. He had a bit of a situation...

219
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,229
My goodness. Listen, sir.

220
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:40,430
Everyone has their own circumstances, right?

221
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,539
Anyway, you can take him home now.

222
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,269
I'll let you know when we need him back here.

223
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:46,070
- Get home safely. - Wait, but...

224
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,460
That must've been stressful, Gun.

225
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,830
I'm sorry, Ji Chul.

226
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,629
You had to come here because of me.

227
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,899
Hey, why did you...

228
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,369
Forget it. I'll nag you some other day.

229
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Who's at the pub?

230
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,510
It's closed, thanks to someone who caused trouble.

231
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,510
I'm heading back there to earn money.

232
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,780
- I'll come with you. - You should get some rest.

233
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:29,080
Thank you, Se Young.

234
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,719
Please don't mention it. I didn't even do anything.

235
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,250
It's getting late. You should take Se Young home.

236
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,919
- I'm off. - Wait, Ji Chul.

237
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,889
What?

238
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,730
Thank you.

239
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,369
I'll see you tomorrow.

240
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:56,879
Are you all right?

241
00:17:58,949 --> 00:17:59,980
No.

242
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:02,719
Did you really have to do that?

243
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,958
You said you'd never play in the tournament.

244
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,619
So why are you working at an illegal gambling house?

245
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,060
I didn't play there.

246
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,399
- You don't believe me either. - I do believe you.

247
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,139
The tournament is completely legal.

248
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:30,009
Besides, it's not like you can't participate because you're a minor.

249
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,438
Win fair and square with your skills alone...

250
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,510
and get the prize money.

251
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,378
Do you think it's the same thing as gambling...

252
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:39,419
because of the prize money?

253
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,560
My family...

254
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:49,899
lost everything because my dad gambled.

255
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:55,540
How's playing for the prize money...

256
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,269
any different from gambling?

257
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,340
Are you saying...

258
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:01,740
it's okay to work at an illegal gambling house...

259
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,080
because you're not there to gamble?

260
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:06,209
Do you think that makes sense?

261
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,550
I don't need it.

262
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,060
If you don't need it, throw it away yourself.

263
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,030
It's not like you have other options right now.

264
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,399
You're working at a gambling den to pay your sister's hospital bills.

265
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:27,928
Cha Se Young.

266
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,800
Do you know what's upsetting me the most right now?

267
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:32,409
I like...

268
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,409
and understand everything about you, including your wounds and situation,

269
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,510
but you are...

270
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,149
dragging yourself down.

271
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,820
I think it's such a pity, Gun.

272
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,658
Think rationally...

273
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,300
and try to figure out what's truly important.

274
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,869
I'm off.

275
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,300
Dad?

276
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,830
What are you doing?

277
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:35,699
Sit down.

278
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:51,480
Let's make a bet. Just one game.

279
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,090
You promised me...

280
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:59,129
that you'd never play Hold'em again.

281
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:01,560
Ji Chul told me everything.

282
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,969
He said you must have the KPL entry ticket.

283
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,770
Just one game, okay?

284
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:16,609
If you win, you'll participate in the tournament.

285
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,810
If I win, I'll do it.

286
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,580
What do you say, son?

287
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:24,520
It's been a long time.

288
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,119
How about a showdown with me?

289
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:48,909
Let's play.

290
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:57,879
I'll go my way now.

291
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,050
Gun.

292
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:00,750
Thanks for everything.

293
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,730
Now, you should challenge yourself for your own good.

294
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,629
Fine, I'll give it a shot.

295
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:21,770
Let's...

296
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,280
play fair and square.

297
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,719
(Under the Gun)
