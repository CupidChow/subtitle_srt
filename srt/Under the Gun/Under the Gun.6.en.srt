00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:07,340
(Zuho as Ko Gun)

00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,250
(Jo Soo Min as Cha Se Young)

3
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:14,379
(Seo Ji Won as Joo Tae Ha)

4
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:25,459
(Under the Gun)

5
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:30,229
All right. The much-awaited 2022 KPL Championship...

6
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:31,499
begins now.

7
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,690
Darn it.

8
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,690
Nice, yes!

9
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,579
(How did it go? Can I just think no news is good news?)

10
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,609
(Why am I more nervous than you?)

11
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,678
(Can't you go to the restroom and text me back?)

12
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,679
(It's going well. Don't worry.)

13
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,959
Se Young.

14
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:35,000
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,429
I'm here because I missed you.

16
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,890
Is this okay?

17
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:05,429
Yes, it's fine.

18
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,639
Why are you staring at me like that?

19
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,380
Because you're pretty.

20
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,859
What are you doing?

21
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,639
Let's get some sleep.

22
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,970
Sleep?

23
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,810
You mean, like this?

24
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,880
Cha Se Young.

25
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,910
You're one fearless lady.

26
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,789
Of course. That's why I'm here.

27
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,758
You little naughty girl.

28
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,819
What?

29
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:22,340
Hey, Gun.

30
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,810
Ko Gun.

31
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,910
- Let's sleep. - You just want to sleep?

32
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,710
I'm playing in the finals tomorrow.

33
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,150
Hey.

34
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,680
Are you really just going to sleep like this?

35
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,650
How about now?

36
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,799
What if I lose tomorrow? Will you take care of me?

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,069
Of course. You don't think I can take care of you?

38
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,229
I don't want that.

39
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:55,269
What do you mean?

40
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,539
I want to be able to take care of you.

41
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:02,410
- So please... - Please, what?

42
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,949
Cut me some slack, just for today.

43
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,190
Okay.

44
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,759
Sleep tight, Gun.

45
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,560
You too.

46
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,410
(Showdown: A duel in the last round to decide the final winner)

47
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,319
The 2022 KPL Championship. The winner...

48
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,080
will get one million dollars. Round Three has begun.

49
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,019
Just like yesterday, I can feel all the excitement and enthusiasm.

50
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,090
Let's keep it up until the finals.

51
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,108
All right. The final round.

52
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:11,450
Ten finalists are moving on to the finals.

53
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:15,478
One of them will receive the honor of becoming the final winner,

54
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,220
which will be decided at this very table.

55
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,330
Just like that, everyone was eliminated...

56
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,160
except for the final three.

57
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,059
And of course, Joo Tae Ha was one of them.

58
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,070
Hold.

59
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,869
He sure knows how to keep a poker face.

60
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,439
All in.

61
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,539
Does he have a good hand? Or is it just a bluff?

62
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,150
I really can't figure it out.

63
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,299
My gut tells me that Joo Tae Ha will win.

64
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:39,299
Call.

65
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,570
Showdown. Show your cards.

66
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:09,700
This means the final two are...

67
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,669
Joo Tae Ha and me. We're the only players left.

68
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,288
Ko Gun, the dark horse who suddenly burst onto the scene,

69
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:35,559
versus last year's winner and the Hold'em idol,

70
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,129
Joo Tae Ha, the Hold'em superstar.

71
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,628
Who will be the winner of the 2022 KPL Championship?

72
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,260
I can't wait to find out.

73
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:50,970
- Are you ready? - Yes, of course.

74
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,379
The truth is,

75
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,609
I'm more nervous than anyone else right now.

76
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,689
The Queen of Clubs and the King of Clubs.

77
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:08,260
It's not bad.

78
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:12,729
Action.

79
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:15,100
Ten thousand dollars.

80
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:17,460
I really can't figure out...

81
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,470
what Joo Tae Ha has.

82
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,570
Raise.

83
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,280
Call.

84
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,679
The Ace of Hearts, Jack of Clubs, and Nine of Clubs.

85
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,249
It looks like I have the upper hand, but...

86
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,690
All in.

87
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,430
Will you call an all-in too?

88
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
All in.

89
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,879
Showdown. Show your cards.

90
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,979
That doesn't help Gun.

91
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,710
I need the Ten of Clubs for a straight flush.

92
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,019
The probability of a straight flush is 0.0014 percent.

93
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:47,889
You played well.

94
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,930
No.

95
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:57,800
It's nearly impossible.

96
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:01,499
Until the river is flipped,

97
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,369
it's not over yet.

98
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:08,909
Ten.

99
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,810
He needs the Ten of Clubs to win.

100
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:18,790
Even if the odds are slim, I want to bet on it.

101
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:21,220
No, I must.

102
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,960
For Dad and Jun Hee.

103
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,229
And most importantly...

104
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,570
For myself.

105
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,790
Gun!

106
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,460
Gun, you did it!

107
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,329
- Nice! - He won!

108
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,739
Congratulations. The final winner of the 2022 KPL Championship...

109
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,369
is Ko Gun!

110
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,149
Congratulations.

111
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Next time, I'll beat you.

112
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,659
I'll look forward to it.

113
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,690
(High School)

114
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:03,858
- No way. Hey, isn't this Ko Gun? - What is it?

115
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:05,429
- Yes, I think so. - Isn't it a guy with the same name?

116
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,790
- My gosh. - I can't believe this. Hey.

117
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,999
Hey, Se Young. Did you know about this?

118
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,300
(Ko Gun, Winner of KPL Championship)

119
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,430
Yes. Of course, I did.

120
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,738
- No way. - My gosh. This is huge.

121
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:18,470
This is such a nice picture of him.

122
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:21,739
There are so many articles about him.

123
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,840
- I bet he's on his high horse now. - Totally.

124
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,149
All right. So what's the title of the poem by Yun Dong Ju?

125
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,849
- "Counting the Stars at Night." - "Counting the Stars at Night."

126
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,850
Correct.

127
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,049
Why bother carrying his phone around...

128
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,119
if he's not going to check his messages?

129
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,889
- Cha Se Young. - He should at least text me back.

130
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,190
Seriously.

131
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,560
- You are too much. - Gosh.

132
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,959
Oh, sir.

133
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,600
You must focus in class.

134
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:46,829
You're in your second year of high school.

135
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,830
Are you giving up on college?

136
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:49,399
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,969
Besides, love doesn't put food on the table.

138
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,739
Right, it doesn't.

139
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,409
But thanks to it, I feel full even if I don't eat.

140
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,679
- What? - Hey, you're making us cringe.

141
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,978
- What was that? - My goodness.

142
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,820
Even just seeing him makes me so happy.

143
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,519
- Gosh. - Hey, stop.

144
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,220
I know he skipped school without permission.

145
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,920
I'd like to sincerely apologize again for that, ma'am.

146
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:14,960
Gun.

147
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,470
You'll study hard from now on, right? Without causing trouble.

148
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,100
Ma'am, when did I cause trouble?

149
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,099
I just didn't study...

150
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,040
and napped in class.

151
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,440
I've never caused trouble.

152
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:30,180
My goodness.

153
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,810
You always have something to say, don't you?

154
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:35,420
Anyway, I feel like you're back...

155
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:37,420
to being the Gun I knew in your first year.

156
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:40,519
- I'll do my best from now on. - All right.

157
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,560
Study hard, please.

158
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:44,619
Your grades have hit rock bottom.

159
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:46,590
Being good at Hold'em isn't everything.

160
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:50,460
Ma'am, what it takes to be a good Hold'em player...

161
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,600
isn't the same as what it takes to do well in school.

162
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,269
That is true.

163
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
You always have to have the last word.

164
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:06,249
Gun.

165
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:09,550
I read the article. Congratulations.

166
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,950
Thank you.

167
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,290
So you won the tournament. But shouldn't you hurry up and go?

168
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:16,960
Go where?

169
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,159
To see your girlfriend.

170
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,729
She's been waiting for you all day.

171
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,728
You can go.

172
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:29,499
I'll head home first.

173
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,369
I'll really go, then.

174
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,540
- Yes, go. - Don't scold me later.

175
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,009
Okay. Just go, you brat.

176
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,479
- I'm off, then. Bye! - Hey!

177
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,279
My goodness.

178
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,690
Gun.

179
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,859
Why did you get up? Keep playing.

180
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,369
It's so nice to see you at school.

181
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:01,200
- You're that happy to see me? - Yes, I'm so happy.

182
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,570
Come here, quick.

183
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,009
Keep on playing. I want to hear it.

184
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,180
Can't we just stay like this?

185
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,290
A woman who's so straightforward and proactive isn't attractive.

186
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,790
What?

187
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,460
I was just kidding.

188
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,029
Oh, right.

189
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,970
Did you see this?

190
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,670
Are they allowed to publish this without my permission?

191
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,199
Yes, who cares?

192
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,970
It's such a great picture of you.

193
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:48,080
Hey, Gun. I did some thinking.

194
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,978
About what? You're always busy thinking with that head of yours.

195
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:54,090
The Under the Gun is the least desirable position in Hold'em.

196
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,460
You know that?

197
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,988
It may be the least desirable position,

198
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:01,960
but if you think about it, it's called "Under the Gun."

199
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,059
It means everyone is under you, Gun.

200
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
I know you're from the US.

201
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:06,330
Look at you flaunting your pronunciation.

202
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,070
About you winning the tournament too.

203
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,609
Maybe it was your fate too.

204
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,879
Here we go again. You love talking about fate.

205
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,080
They say your name determines your future. If that's true,

206
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,149
only great things will happen to you from now on.

207
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
Trust me on that.

208
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,690
You're so good at interpreting things however you want.

209
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:30,388
I'm dead serious right now.

210
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,430
All right. Go on and play for me.

211
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,229
You look the prettiest when you play the piano.

212
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,470
Am I not pretty when I'm not playing the piano?

213
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,499
You are pretty.

214
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:44,999
All right.

215
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,440
I will play for you.

216
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,459
I can't deny that the Under the Gun is the least desirable position...

217
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,169
because it is true.

218
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,939
However, overcoming the weight of it and continuing to play.

219
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,980
Then winning.

220
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,619
Nothing's more thrilling than that.

221
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,790
They say life's a constant gamble.

222
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,659
If that is true...

223
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,469
I'm betting on you,

224
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,540
Cha Se Young.

225
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,570
What?

226
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:53,270
What did you say?

227
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,939
Nothing. Keep playing.

228
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,179
Dad.

229
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,409
Gun.

230
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,590
Are you all right? How are you feeling?

231
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,689
Jun Hee. You're okay, right?

232
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,619
I had a dream.

233
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,090
About what?

234
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,129
Mom was in my dream.

235
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:54,369
Mom said...

236
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,570
not to worry anymore.

237
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,609
She told me not to come to her.

238
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,209
Dad, Gun. She told me to stay by your side.

239
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,679
She said I was the only one...

240
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,780
who could take care of you two.

241
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,459
I want to go outside.

242
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,649
I'm curious about something.

243
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:47,990
What is it?

244
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,320
Why do you like me?

245
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,260
Do I need a reason to like you?

246
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,600
I just like you because it's you.

247
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,070
Really?

248
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,070
If I like you for a reason,

249
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,109
I'll stop liking you once that reason is gone.

250
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,379
I don't like that.

251
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,850
I just like you.

252
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:20,689
I don't need a reason to like you...

253
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,889
because I like you so much.

254
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,359
To be honest, it's all a lie.

255
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:30,060
I like you because you're good-looking.

256
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:32,899
What?

257
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:39,469
Gun.

258
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,350
Stay by my side forever.

259
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:00,459
What you said just now. I've really wanted to say that to you.

260
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,010
(Under the Gun)
