Well, it's just...

11
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,813
It's not like I follow anyone and everyone.

12
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,852
- If you're done, I'm off. - Hey, wait.

13
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,762
Sorry. Well...

14
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:36,833

You're telling me to eat again?

17
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:43,602
Well, food is a big deal to us Koreans.

18
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,803
Also, you must eat well to grow well.

19
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:49,313
You must be going through a growth spurt, so you should eat well.

20
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:54,113
Am I going through a growth spurt now?

21
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,133
I think I'm at least 20cm taller than you.

22
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:14,503
What?

23
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,503
You should eat well before you lecture me.

24
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,243

There's no definitive cause of acute leukemia,

40

Doctor, how is Jun Hee?

45
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:07,111
Judging by her current condition,

46
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,783
she needs another bone marrow transplant.

47
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,782
She'll need to undergo chemotherapy followed by surgery,

48
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:12,822
but it'll cost quite a bit.

Those who abandon even the last shred of their conscience...

54
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:21,892
can do so because they've given up on being human.

55
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,492
I used to love Hold'em more than anything else,

56
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:26,162
but I started to hate it...

57
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:28,462
because of those who make people...

58
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,762
think of Hold'em as a form of gambling, not a mind sport.

Yes.

65

I told you not to drink.

66
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:32,922
If you keep drinking, your leg will never heal.

67

Large structures in space...

76
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:26,482
such as space telescopes and satellites...

77
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:30,613
can range from a few meters to a few dozen meters in length and width.

78
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:33,821
They can only cover a limited area,

79
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:35,692
hence the folding structure.

80
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:37,923
As you can see here, they orbit...

81
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:40,692
To solve this problem,

82
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,962
an American company came up with...

83
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,613
I didn't know his face could look like this too.

84
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,983
Hey, Princess Se Young. Let's...

85
00:08:04,753 --> 00:08:05,782
Why?

86
00:08:06,582 --> 00:08:07,623
My gosh.

90
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,032
Okay, I'll be quick.

91
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:32,883
You woke up.

92
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:36,082
The class is over.

93
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:39,652
Oh, I put that on you. I thought you might be cold.

94
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,551
You can give it back another time.

95
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:45,593
Hey.

96
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:47,323
Me?

97
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,093
Why are you doing this to me?

98
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:53,503
Well...

99
00:08:56,772 --> 00:08:58,203
Because fate brought us together?

100
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:01,872
- What? - I mean, think about it.

101
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,742
From how I ran into you at the convenience store...

102
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,012
to how we're sitting together in class.

103
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:07,012
Fascinating, isn't it?

104
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:11,652
They say if you experience recurring coincidences,

105
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:14,353
it's fate.

106
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:17,152
So?

107
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:21,562
So I was wondering if fate brought us together.

108
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,633
- What's with that scoff? - Cha Se Young.

109
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:30,973
My gosh. You remember my name?

110
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:34,973
Oh, right.

111
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,942
You think fate brought us together?

112
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,712
Yes.

113
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:44,113
Fate is something you can only think about...

114
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,453
when you can afford to have such thoughts.

115
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:50,192
After all, fate is...

116
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,223
It's like taekwondo or the piano.

117
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:56,833
It's nice to have, but you can live without it.

118
00:09:57,493 --> 00:10:00,103
You need to feel that you don't lack anything psychologically...

119
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,402
to think about "fate."

120
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:08,572
Right now, I can't afford to think about such things, so...

121
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,042
You can't live your life if you think like that.

122
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:15,512
I don't know what you'll say about this,

123
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,282
but I have to think like this to survive.

124
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:27,922
I'm off.

125
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,902
Loving someone while having to worry about all those things...

126
00:10:39,402 --> 00:10:40,973
That's not true love.

127
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:51,112
His car is so nice.

128
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:52,781
- Oh, my. - Can I get your autograph too?

129
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:55,551
- It really is him. - He's so hot.

130
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:56,552
- My gosh. - Seriously.

131
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:58,993
- I watched your games. - Hey, Cha Se Young!

132
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:00,993
- What's with her? - Gun!

133
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:07,733
Are you all right?

134
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:13,042
Yes, I'm fine.

135
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:15,912
Why did you follow me?

136
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:19,142
This time, I had a reason.

137
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:22,552
You forgot this.

138
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:27,253
Shouldn't you thank me first?

139
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:29,093
I never asked you to bring this to me.

140
00:11:29,953 --> 00:11:31,022
What?

141
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:32,823
Thanks anyway.

142
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:35,333
Well, all right.

143
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:37,162
Se Young.

144
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:39,902
Tae Ha?

145

148
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:49,772
How have you been?

149
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:54,982
All right. Thanks again for losing to me, as always.

150
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:56,412
Let's begin.

151
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,483
Gosh. Will we be reprimanded if we get caught?

152
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:00,652
What if we get penalty points? I'm scared.

153
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:02,093
If you're scared, just drop out.

154
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:10,493
Which one of you is Ko Gun?

155
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:16,233
All right. I'll be your dealer, then.

156
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:21,442
The one who loses will buy everyone here a meal. Deal?

157
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,941
- All right, sure. - Are you as good as your father?

158
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:25,113
Let's play, and you'll find out.

159
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:33,682
The turn.

160
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,093
One hundred dollars.

161
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,902
One hundred dollars.

162
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:48,973
I'm all in.

163
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,642
He's going all in.

164
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:54,843
Drop out if you're scared to go all in.

165
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:57,542
All in.

166
00:12:58,113 --> 00:13:00,113
A real man goes all in even when he knows he'll lose.

167
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:05,252
- Oh, my. - Three of a kind.

168
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:07,253
- My gosh. - Hey, it's three of a kind.

169
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:10,092
- Gosh! - What is it?

170
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:11,521
- Oh, my. - What is this?

171
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:12,922
Until the river is flipped,

172
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:15,532
it's not over yet.

173
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,003
I'll deal the river now.

174
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,272
- My gosh! - Amazing.

175
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,942
Thanks for your all-in bet, friend.

176
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,852
- Who wants to go to the snack shop? - Me!

177
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,253
- Me! I'm coming. - Nice, a free meal!

178
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:43,052
How do you guys know each other?

179
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,353
It's been a long time.

180
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:47,292
Has it been a year?

181
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:51,902
I'm busy right now.

182
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:54,333
I'm off,

183
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:56,633
so mind your own business.

184
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,442
Hey, how's your dad? Is he doing well too?

185
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,172
Honestly, you of all people...

186
00:14:03,512 --> 00:14:05,483
should not talk about my father.

187
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:08,883
Why are you so angry? I was just asking how he was doing.

188
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,952
- Hey. - My gosh. Tae Ha, that's enough.

189
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:13,052
Hey, what did I do?

190
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:14,853
I was just asking how he was doing.

191
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,551
Why are you so on edge?

192
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:18,593
Tae Ha.

193
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,963
I'm sorry, Gun. You should get going.

194
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:28,672
You two look cute together,

195
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:31,802
like you're fated to be a couple.

196
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,323
Thanks for the ride. Get home safely.

197
00:14:52,963 --> 00:14:53,963
Hey, Se Young.

198
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,463
I like you. I mean it.

199
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,003
If you want my answer, I'll have to say the same thing again.

200
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:08,743
I never led you on.

201
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:11,011
You had a one-sided crush on me.

202
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:12,482
Don't make me look bad.

203
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:14,882
- Is it because of Ko Gun? - Why are you bringing him up?

204
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:15,912
So it's not because of him?

205
00:15:16,812 --> 00:15:17,912
Gun is...

206
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,953
He has nothing to do with our relationship.

207
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:23,692
Okay, then I'm relieved.

208
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:26,692
Se Young.

209
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,993
Since the moment I met you, I've only liked you. No one else.

210
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,703
So can you please like me back?

211
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:44,343
I'm sorry, Tae Ha.

212
00:15:45,282 --> 00:15:46,483
I should head in.

213
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,922
If a roadblock keeps blocking my way,

214
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:55,292
I should get rid of it.

215
00:15:58,723 --> 00:15:59,792
I'll shuffle.

216
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:32,492
My gosh. You got here early.

217
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,493
- This is great. - How much is that?

218
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:37,061
All right, look. I'm shuffling fairly.

219
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,233
Let's see.

220
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:47,542
No, wait! Wait until you see the rest.

221
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:52,312
- Oh, no! - Someone lost big-time!

222
00:16:57,953 --> 00:16:59,623
Thanks for this.

223
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,051
- Oh, boy. - I feel bad for him.

224
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:06,062
- Come on! What are you doing? - Please, help me.

225
00:17:06,162 --> 00:17:08,792
- Hey! What are you doing? - Save me.

226
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:11,792
- Just this once. - Come on.

227
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:13,931
- What do you think you're doing? - Hey!

228
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,633
- Come on! - Hey!

229
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,432
- You idiot. - Please...

230
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:30,482
- Hey! - Please help me.

231
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,922
Come on. Hurry up.

232
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:39,192
(Court)

233
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,892
Se Young.

234
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:51,492
Tae Ha?

235
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,773
Why does it bother me?

236
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:08,543
- Gun, can I get a beer? - Sure.

237
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,383
Thank you.

238
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:15,182
Will Mr. Ko not play in the upcoming tournament?

239
00:19:15,992 --> 00:19:17,023
There's a tournament coming up?

240
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:24,792
What's your father up to these days?

241
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:27,862
Come on. Don't ask him about his father.

242
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:29,103
How about a game?

243
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:31,802
Gun, how about a game with them?

244
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,103
What's with you, Mr. Jung? Can't we ask how Mr. Ko is doing?

245
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:37,313
My father is...

246
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:39,283
He's doing pretty well.

247
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:41,742
Lately,

248
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:44,583
I've had many people ask me about my father.

249
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:46,622
He should make a comeback.

250
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:49,691
Yes, he's a legend.

251
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:51,152
It's such a shame.

252
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:53,863
He officially made it into the world's best player rankings.

253
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:56,192
He's dealing with some health issues.

254
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,062
So? How about a game?

255
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,303
What? You want to play with us?

256
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,732
- Sure, we'd love that. - Yes, sounds good.

257
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:09,843
I was quite surprised earlier.

258
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:11,773
Why?

259
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,211
It was my first time...

260
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,952
hearing you ask the customers to play a game with you.

261
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:17,783
I just didn't want to talk about my father.

262
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:21,323
Says the guy who swept the table clean.

263
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,523
Well, it just happened that way.

264
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,363
Hey. Something's up, right?

265
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,133
It's nothing serious.

266
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,172
What is it? What's going on?

267
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,843
Well, it's just...

268
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:44,373
It's about Jun Hee.

269
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:47,182
What did the doctor say? Is she in critical condition?

270
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:52,123
She has to undergo treatment, but it's...

271
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:55,123
It'll cost quite a bit.

272
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:57,093
How much?

273
00:20:57,692 --> 00:20:58,722
A lot.

274
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:06,432
Gun, why don't you participate in the tournament?

275
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:08,263
I don't want to.

276
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,103
Why don't you want to do it? If you win, you can make a lot of money.

277
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,172
You're very young. How else could you earn that much money?

278
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,273
Really, think about it.

279
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:18,013
You're too stubborn for your own good.

280
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:20,812
Your father ended up like that...

281
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,083
because he frequented illegal gambling dens.

282
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,252
It wasn't because of Hold'em.

283
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:30,353
He gambled, and that was the problem. Don't blame it on Hold'em.

284
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:38,232
(Slide to answer)

285
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:44,502
I'll be there shortly.

286
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:48,242
I have to go.

287
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:49,613
You have a shift at the convenience store?

288
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,343
Well, yes.

289
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,053
Is Gun really that good at Hold'em?

290
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:03,921
Even as a little kid, he never played outside.

291
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,152
He only played cards.

292
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,093
I'm into it.

293
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:10,492
What?

294
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:13,303
Give this to Gun.

295
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,033
What is this?

296
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:17,802
Can I ask you why you're working so hard?

297
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:18,972
My sister is ill.

298
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:21,672
She has leukemia.

299
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:24,773
Get home safely.

300
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:34,252
(Under the Gun)
