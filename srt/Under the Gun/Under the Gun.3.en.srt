00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,340

(Under the Gun)

5
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,469
You think fate brought us together?

6
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:06,469
Yes.

7
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,069
Fate is something you can only think about...

8
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,770
when you can afford to have such thoughts.

9
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,339
You two look cute together...

10
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:15,240
like you're fated to be a couple.

11
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:18,809
Oh, right.

12
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,419
He missed his shift today?

13
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:25,990
Why?

14
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:27,118
Not sure.

15
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,559
He just said something urgent had come up at home.

16
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,300
Hey, you're here.

17
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,500
I knew you'd come back.

18
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,470
There's no easier way to make money than this.

19
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:46,669
It's just like gambling. You can never quit this.

20
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,579
For running a few errands,

21
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,539
you can earn from a few hundred to thousands of dollars in one day.

22
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,350
But you should be careful.

23
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:59,819
If you mess with the wrong people, you really are done for.

24
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:01,490
Come on. Let's go in.

25
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:22,209
(Semi-bluff: A bet made when a player still has a chance...)

26

(of improving to make the best hand on future cards)

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,380
He said he worked there every day.

28
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,750
I can't even call him because I don't have his number.

29
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,758
- Did you find it? - No.

30
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,799
Hey, check his socks.

31
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:48,600
Hey, what are you guys doing right now?

32
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,069
Just be on your way, will you?

33
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:53,769
You little brats. You've got some nerve.

34
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,239
Hey, you're really annoying.

35
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,880
Just so you know,

36
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,478
I'm a fourth-degree black belt in taekwondo.

37
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,549
Hey, let's go.

38
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,979
- Be good, you brats. - Darn you.

39
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,030
Sir, are you all right?

40
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,400
Sir. My gosh.

41
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,940
Where am I?

42
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,880
Where do you live, sir?

43
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:32,609
Me?

44
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,049
The Republic of Korea.

45
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,989
Thank you.

46
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,930
(I just sent it. You'll find the marked card on top.)

47
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,369
We'll begin as soon as the cards arrive.

48
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,370
Here are the cards.

49
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,429
Hey, stop!

50
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,368
- Let go! - My gosh.

51
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:26,799
How dare you try to trick me?

52
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:29,140
- I'm sorry! - Who picked them up? Come here!

53
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:33,939
It was you, right? Come here!

54
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,280
- Is this where you live? - Yes.

55
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,689
Gosh. It'll be really hard to walk all the way up there by yourself.

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,020
It's fine. I can do it by myself.

57
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,988
Don't say that.

58
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:54,030
You can lean on me.

59
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,229
- All right. - Watch your step.

60
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:58,929
I'm strong, you see.

61
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,999
Sir, you shouldn't drink this much again.

62
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,239
This is me.

63
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,679
- Take care of yourself. - Thank you.

64
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,390
Cha Se Young?

65
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:25,689
Ko Gun?

66
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:29,859
Hey, what are you doing here?

67
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,470
Let me check on my dad first.

70
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,900
- What were you doing? - Oh, nothing.

71
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,410
Hey, how's your father? Is he okay?

72
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:16,840
Yes, he's asleep now.

73
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:22,479
What happened to your face?

74
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,489
It's nothing. Don't worry.

75
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,590
Don't you have a first aid kit at home?

76
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,799
I knew you were brave, but you really are fearless.

77
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:40,429
Me? Why?

78
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,039
You have to be fearless to follow a drunk man to his place.

79
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,549
Hey, it's not funny.

80
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:56,720
Hey, can I ask you something?

81
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,090
No, you cannot.

82
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,320
I'm still going to ask, you know.

83
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,919
I won't answer your question.

84
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,530
How do you and Tae Ha know each other?

85
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,429
- I just know him. - You just know him?

86
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,640
What about you?

87
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:17,239
Well, we just know each other.

88
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,340
"Just?"

89
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,808
His mom and my mom are friends,

90
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,410
so we grew up together.

91
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,178
Seriously, that's all. We grew up in the same neighborhood.

92
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,220
We really are just friends.

93
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,150
I didn't ask.

94
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,119
Right.

95
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,330
Is your father a Hold'em player?

(Award Certificate, KPL Tournament)

97
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,629
Not now.

98
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,239
I see.

99
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,070
What about you? Are you good at it too?

100
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
I'm into it.

101
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:01,379
What? What did you say?

102
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,689
Not you. I was talking about Hold'em.

103
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,590
I'm into Hold'em.

104
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,619
I see. Right, Hold'em.

105
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:14,489
Go home already.

106
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,629
Can I ask you what happened to your face?

107
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,470
No.

108
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,510
Well, then I'm off.

109
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,649
Hey, thanks.

110
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:19,759
You know, your scrapes...

111
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,729
Please just let me dress your wounds.

112
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,070
Then I'll go home quietly.

113
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,739
My gosh. This must really hurt.

114
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,879
What's with that scoff? How could you scoff right now?

115
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,050
I just find it funny.

116
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,619
I don't find this funny at all.

117
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,729
Did you know that this was...

118
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,729
our third time running into each other by chance?

119
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,839
If something happens by chance three times...

120
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
It's fate?

121
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,080
I bet you think it's kind of fascinating too.

122
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,409
They say silence means yes.

123
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,550
Who said that?

124
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,149
Me.

125
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:22,320
Hang in there. I'm almost done.

126
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,170
What is it? What now?

127
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,710
What? Oh, it's nothing.

128
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,359
I must be going crazy.

129
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,259
My gosh, bye. I'm off.

130
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,979
What should I do?

131
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,350
Should I stop?

132
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,259
No, you can kiss me.

133
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,070
Let me take you home.

134
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,700
Okay.

135
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,049
I must be going crazy.

136
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,619
My gosh. What do I do?

137
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:51,909
Are you going to school?

138
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Gosh, you scared me.

139
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,779
Hey, you scared me.

140
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,950
Hey, Gun.

141
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:03,420
What?

142
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,350
Here, what is this? Oh, I'm sorry.

143
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:09,659
It happened at the construction site.

144
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,790
Gun.

145
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:18,899
I'm sorry.

146
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,639
All I do is make you suffer.

147
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,670
I'm too ashamed to face you.

148
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,469
Even now, I'm just a burden to you.

149
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,479
Dad.

150
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,989
Dad, look at me. Come on.

151
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,670
I'm okay.

152
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,070
I'm really okay,

153
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:56,540
so let's cheer up.

154
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,070
I'm sure a good day will come.

155
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,580
Also,

156
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,379
you haven't fully recovered yet, so you should take it easy.

157
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:06,509
Don't work behind my back.

158
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:09,519
Dad, I'm running late.

159
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,649
- I have to go to school. - All right.

160
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,290
- All right. - Be careful.

161
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,359
Will do.

162
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,060
Who are you waiting for?

163
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,330
Ko Gun at school and Joo Tae Ha outside of school.

164
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,970
Talk about a perfect life.

165
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,040
Hey, friend. Don't tell me you're two-timing them.

166
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:34,309
No, I'm not!

167
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,039
Why are you getting so worked up?

168
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,278
- They say a strong denial... - Means a strong affirmation.

169
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,149
I told you. It's not what you think.

170
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,350
Come on. We understand.

171
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:47,149
It's something that can totally happen to pretty princesses like us.

172
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,019
Hey, Se Young.

173
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:53,790
You haven't told us anything yet.

174
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,930
About what?

175
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:58,399
What's going on between you and Joo Tae Ha?

176
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,529
My gosh. Like I said, it's not what you think.

177
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:12,710
There you are.

178
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:14,609
Hi.

179
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,350
All right. Let's get started.

180
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:22,290
You guys are ready, right?

181
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,259
Don't be distracted. Just study.

182
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,859
Me? I wasn't distracted.

183
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Really? Forget it, then.

184
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,499
I'm going to take a nap.

185
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,149
Enjoy your lunch, guys.

186
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,420
- Thank you! - Thank you!

187
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,988
- Let's go and eat. - What? Okay.

188
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:54,350
- You're coming too, right? - Go ahead.

189
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,090
All right.

190
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,570
He looks like a painting.

191
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,149
Oh, you woke up.

192
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:22,279
What time is it?

193
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,590
- I have to go. - What?

194
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,759
Wait up, Gun.

195
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,159
My gosh.

196
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,399
Why are you walking so fast?

197
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,670
Hey, stop.

198
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:42,940
What is it? What now?

199
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,970
Well, I was just...

200
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,479
- Do you want to kiss me again? - Hey, don't get the wrong idea.

201
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:58,720
Also,

202
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,720
it's not like I did it alone.

203
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,060
Then what is it?

204
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,560
Why are you giving me this?

205
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,198
You probably haven't eaten anything yet.

206
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,800
You should eat it.

207
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,840
Don't skip meals, please.

208
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,340
Like I said, food is a big deal to us Koreans.

209
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:24,139
Didn't you say you were from the US?

210
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:27,108
Well, I did live in the US for a few years,

211
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,580
but I'm still Korean.

212
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:30,649
That's true.

213
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:32,449
So you agree that I'm right?

214
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,090
I'm done talking to you.

215
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:36,619
Hey.

216
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,030
What?

217
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,459
Remember what I said yesterday?

218
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,159
Can you reconsider?

219
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,330
What are you talking about?

220
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,139
What?

221
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:53,070
Well, I'm talking about...

222
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,340
how I was at your place last night,

223
00:17:57,939 --> 00:18:01,208
and that peck on the lips...

224
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,080
- Hey, Cha Se Young. - What?

225
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,889
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

226
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,520
It was a kiss.

227
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,428
What did you say?

228
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:15,600
Last night, that was a kiss, not a peck on the lips.

229
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,600
What?

230
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,580
I enjoyed it too.

231
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,980
Oh, really?

232
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:35,918
I see.

233
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,250
I didn't know you were shy.

234
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,188
Hey, don't make fun of me.

235
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:41,850
- That hurt. - Did it hurt?

236
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,320
I'm sorry.

237
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,458
I can't control my punches.

238
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,590
- Se Young. - Yes?

239
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,000
It's nothing. I'm off.

240
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,639
Can I come with you?

241
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:06,948
Hey.

242
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:08,350
What's with the fuss?

243
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:10,080
How could I not make a fuss about this?

244
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,419
You, of all people... I mean, the Ko Gun I know...

245
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,289
brought his girlfriend here.

246
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,718
Don't make a big deal out of nothing.

247
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,790
Well, I was just...

248
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:22,659
We're classmates.

249
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,429
What do you mean it's nothing? This is a big deal.

250
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,428
- Seriously, who is she? - I told you. She's my classmate.

251
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:29,898
You punk. Stop lying to my face.

252
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:31,569
Why would a classmate follow you here at this hour?

253
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,809
What about school? Is she cutting class?

254
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,069
I'm telling you the truth.

255
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,780
We're just classmates.

256
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,949
- I mean, for now. - What? "For now?"

257
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,649
"For now?" You little...

258
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,280
- Classmates, my foot. - Gun.

259
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,418
I'm Gun's friend, Jung Ji Chul.

260
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:50,419
I own this Hold'em pub.

261
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,129
Oh, hello. I'm Cha Se Young.

262
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,628
How long have you two been going out?

263
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:55,958
Gosh, stop it.

264
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,359
He hasn't asked me out yet, so I'm going to do it.

265
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,730
My, you're brave.

266
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:01,669
It's fine if I have to do it,

267
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:03,740
but can't you just ask me out?

268
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,609
Hey, I like how straightforward she is.

269
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:09,409
Seriously, you don't want to date me?

270
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,750
Hey, Gun. I'll have whiskey.

271
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,350
Sure.

272
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,689
He's so cheerful when he's here.

273
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,990
Why is he like a zombie at school?

274
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:30,600
- Do you like him that much? - Gosh, you scared me.

275
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,699
What is this?

276
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,840
Give this to Gun.

277
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:41,010
Is Gun really that good at Hold'em?

278
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,908
Even as a little kid, he never played outside.

279
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,139
He only played cards.

280
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,780
Did Gun say he didn't want to participate in the tournament?

281
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,250
He'd rather die than play cards if he had to make bets.

282
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,050
- Why? - His family has some problems...

283
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
It's nothing.

284
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,060
His family?

285
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:00,859
Anyway, try to persuade him, Se Young.

286
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,128
Here, whiskey for both of you.

287
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:09,340
- Thanks. - Nice, thank you.

288
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,169
Hey, how about a game today?

289
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,169
- I've been practicing hard. - I have to work.

290
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,310
Tell me. Why are you so good at poker?

291
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,080
Is it because you're smart?

292
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:23,178
Study the poker odds calculator, and you can figure it out.

293
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:24,519
I told you the other day.

294
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,320
Right, but how do I do that?

295
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,719
I didn't know Gun had such a cheerful side.

296
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,189
At school, he probably looks like he's dying.

297
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:36,899
Yes, all he does is sleep.

298
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,830
In my opinion,

299
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:42,540
this is the only solution to his problems.

300
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,840
So please persuade Gun, okay?

301
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:58,649
Don't try so hard because of me.

302
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:00,389
Jun Hee.

303
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,858
I want you to stop confusing Se Young.

304
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:04,189
You doing this...

305
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,560
will only make me want to make her mine.

306
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,829
- Darn it. - You're under arrest...

307
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,500
- Gun! - for illegal gambling activities.

308
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:16,740
What happened?

309
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:19,469
I don't need it.

310
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:22,709
If you don't need it, throw it away yourself.

311
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,840
You're working at a gambling den to pay your sister's hospital bills.

312
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:25,949
Cha Se Young.

313
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:31,750
(Under the Gun)
