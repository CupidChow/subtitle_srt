00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:07,370
(Zuho as Ko Gun)

2
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,250
(Jo Soo Min as Cha Se Young)

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,320
(Seo Ji Won as Joo Tae Ha)

4
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:25,589
(Under the Gun)

5
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,859
You seemed to be in a bad mood, so I just wanted to check in on you.

6
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,690
It's nothing.

7
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,429
Tell me. What's going on?

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,969
My dear daughter, you're hurting my feelings here.

9
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:09,539
I'm your biggest cheerleader, Se Young.

10
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,369
From the moment you were born until now.

11
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,780
Mom.

12
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:20,309
There's this boy I like.

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,919
But the thing is,

14
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,490
he keeps thinking stupid thoughts.

15
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,959
I had no other intention.

16
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,729
I just wanted to help improve his situation.

17
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,500
That's why I did it.

18
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,740
But he...

19
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,580
He looked at me with sad eyes, as if I hurt him.

20
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:56,020
And that really broke my heart.

21
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:05,160
If he cares for you too,

22
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,330
he must know how you feel even if you don't tell him.

23
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,739
You see, love can throw you off balance sometimes,

24
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,380
but it can also help you find a greater balance in life.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,210
That's life. It helps you grow as a person.

26
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,859
You might think love is all sunshine and rainbows,

27
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,690
but a love that breaks your heart is also love.

28
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,059
It means you truly love the person...

29
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,530
and care for them.

30
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,209
I don't know who he is, but he's one lucky guy.

31
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,250
My daughter loves him this much.

32
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,159
(All in: When a player bets all of their remaining chips)

33
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,228
(Court)

34
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,500
Defendant Ko Gun, please come forward.

35
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,970
(Defendant)

36
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:31,150
Even though you are a minor,

37
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:34,818
you frequented an illegal gambling den...

38
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,319
to engage in illegal gambling activities,

39
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,350
and you also worked there.

40
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,859
This violates the Game Industry Promotion Act...

41
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,499
as well as Article 246.1 and Article 247 of the Penal Code.

42
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,659
(Judge)

43
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,699
Mr. Ko.

44
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,729
You may give your closing argument.

45
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,370
(Defendant)

46
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:09,319
"Your Honor."

47
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,590
"I am Defendant Ko Gun, who is being tried for illegal gambling."

48
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,989
Around 10pm on August 21, 2022,

49
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,159
"I was arrested at an apartment in Inje-gu..."

50
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,299
"for engaging in illegal gambling activities."

51
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,530
"I deeply regret what I did."

52
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,600
I will make sure this never happens again.

53
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,049
This statement I wrote...

54
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:51,330
won't show you my sincerity.

55
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:54,999
(Judge)

56
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:56,929
I swear...

57
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,570
I never gambled.

58
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,939
Your Honor, even if I were to be faced with the same situation,

59
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:06,840
I would make the exact same choice.

60
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,609
Picking up cigarettes as an errand boy and getting beaten up.

61
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,979
I did those things to pay my sister's hospital bills.

62
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,080
I couldn't find any jobs that paid better.

63
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,789
I knew it was wrong,

64
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,960
but I had no choice.

65
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,229
Even so,

66
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,129
I sincerely regret what I did.

67
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,499
I promise you that I won't do it again.

68
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,539
(Judge)

69
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:39,069
(Petition)

70
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,140
(Your Honor, I'm Jang Jun Chul from Sunhwa High School.)

71
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:43,608
(Petition, Cha Se Young)

72
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,149
(I could not believe it when I heard Gun was involved...)

73
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,479
(in an illegal gambling case.)

74
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,989
We received...

75
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,559
many petitions from your school.

76
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,400
Mr. Ko.

77
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:05,799
Even if you didn't do anything you should be ashamed of,

78
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:08,200
it's important to live an honest life.

79
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,410
I'm very sorry to hear about your sister's situation,

80
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,070
but one wrong choice...

81
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:17,510
can completely destroy your future.

82
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,379
Never forget that.

83
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,379
I will announce the court's decision.

84
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,049
Mr. Ko...

85
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,460
did violate the Game Industry Promotion Act,

86
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,119
but considering that he has no previous record...

87
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,629
and that he is still a minor...

88
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,760
as well as his circumstances,

89
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,999
the court sentences him to 100 hours of community service.

90
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,169
Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you so much.

91
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,809
Son!

92
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,910
(Defendant)

93
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,579
- My gosh, this is nuts. - It's crazy indeed.

94
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,580
I knew it.

95
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:58,219
- What will happen to him now? - Will he go to juvie?

96
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,849
I have no idea. What is he going to do?

97
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,988
I knew he would...

98
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,058
This is nuts.

99
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:04,188
My gosh. A high school student participating in illegal gambling?

100
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,529
- He's got some nerve. - Yes, indeed.

101
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,559
What's that?

102
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,058
How come the atmosphere suddenly changed when I walked in?

103
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,260
It's nothing.

104
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,270
What is it?

105
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,339
(Like Father Like Son, Both Illegal Gamblers)

106
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,070
(Professional Hold'em Player K's Son Arrested for Illegal Gambling)

107
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,248
- I knew it. - What will happen to him now?

108
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,979
I have no idea. What is he going to do?

109
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,819
Seriously, what's he going to do now? He's doomed.

110
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,059
This is crazy.

111
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,229
Be quiet, all of you.

112
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,600
You guys.

113
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,260
You're only interested in gossip.

114
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,499
Have you ever shown concern for your classmate, even just once?

115
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,369
Shouldn't you at least ask him if he's okay, knowing what happened?

116
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,869
And you guys think you're his friends?

117
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,339
Anyone who says mean things...

118
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,179
or spreads false rumors...

119
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,749
will pay for it.

120
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,780
If you hurt him, I'll teach you a lesson. I don't care who you are.

121
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,119
- Let's go. - Go where?

122
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,260
Come on. Let's get out of here.

123
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,039
I'm hungry.

124
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,239
Yesterday, you left as if you'd never see me again.

125
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,450
You frustrated me so much yesterday.

126
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,549
I felt like I was starting to hate you.

127
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,489
But today...

128
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,290
Today, what?

129
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,460
Today, I'm back to liking you.

130
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,440
What are you, really?

131
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,739
What do you mean, what am I?

132
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,579
Hurry up and eat something...

133
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,139
so you can perk up.

134
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,519
Hey.

135
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,090
Why are you doing this to me?

136
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,190
Why? You really don't know?

137
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,330
Because I like you.

138
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,700
My mom told me...

139
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,739
that love could throw you off balance sometimes...

140
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,540
but that it could help you find a greater balance in life.

141
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,409
I don't really get what that means.

142
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,249
You dummy.

143
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,119
Because of you, I'm all out of balance right now.

144
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,018
But thanks to you,

145
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,519
I'm in the process of finding a greater balance.

146
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,269
Hey, where are you going?

147
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:04,739
I have somewhere to be.

148
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:06,839
The Hold'em pub?

149
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,680
- Se Young. - Yes?

150
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,350
I said a while back...

151
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,090
that fate...

152
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,489
was like taekwondo or the piano.

153
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,859
It's nice to have, but you can live without it.

154
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,029
Then you said,

155
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,070
"You can't live your life if you think like that."

156
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,070
You know very well...

157
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,540
that I can't afford to think about stuff like that.

158
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,749
I'll go my way now.

159
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:49,519
You should do the same.

160
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,350
Gun.

161
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:54,960
I realized once again...

162
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,159
that I shouldn't get greedy.

163
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,159
- Get greedy for what? - You know that you and I...

164
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,700
were given very different starting lines.

165
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,399
- Gun, what are you talking about? - Cha Se Young.

166
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,769
Thanks for everything.

167
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
I'll be off, then.

168
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,590
(Cha Se Young)

169
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,159
How could you leave without listening to what I had to say?

170
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,070
Why is it that you always take off after saying what you need to say?

171
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,340
They say fate finds those who can withstand the weight of life.

172
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,979
I'll be your fate,

173
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,450
your destiny that finds you because you're too busy to come to me.

174
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:00,619
I'll go to you,

175
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,220
- so... - Se Young.

176
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,389
All you need to do is...

177
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,629
You don't need to do anything.

178
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,899
Just like me back, please.

179
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:15,540
Hey, Cha Se Young.

180
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,019
Hey, I like you.

181
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:46,869
Gun, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at school?

182
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:49,670
I skipped class to see you.

183
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,170
Whatever. Aren't you playing hooky because you don't want to study?

184
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:55,440
Bingo.

185
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:58,580
Hey, how are you feeling?

186
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,350
Look at me. Can't you tell?

187
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:02,450
Oh, you seem energetic.

188
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,420
My doctor also said I didn't look like someone with leukemia.

189
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,889
He said I was cheerful and mentally strong.

190
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,159
Really? I see, Ms. Ko Jun Hee.

191
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,529
Hey, Dad was here in the morning.

192
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,670
He said something interesting.

193
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:20,769
What did he say?

194
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,499
- That you'd participate in KPL. - What?

195
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,369
He said you guys played Hold'em last night.

196
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,040
He laughed and said he was no match for you.

197
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,009
For the first time in so long, I got to see Dad laugh so heartily.

198
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,190
Now, you should challenge yourself for your own good.

199
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,259
You'll lose everything if you keep hesitating like that.

200
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,690
You're talking like a grandma.

201
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,899
There are some things you can only see once you fall ill.

202
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,369
If only I didn't have to stay in the hospital...

203
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:56,269
You see, there are so many things I want to do.

204
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,170
You're at least in good health,

205
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,609
so you can do more things than I can.

206
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,580
My gosh. Are you crying?

207
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,519
No, I'm not.

208
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,420
Don't cry. You're as big as a bear.

209
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,560
Stop limiting yourself because of us.

210
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:51,460
If you don't need it, throw it away yourself.

211
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,700
Stop limiting yourself because of us.

212
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:13,450
I kept you waiting long, didn't I?

213
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,379
Did you see your sister?

214
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Yes.

215
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:21,119
How is she?

216
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,590
She's doing pretty well.

217
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,259
I'm glad to hear that.

218
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,670
About the tournament,

219
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,840
I decided to do it.

220
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,409
What?

221
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,550
I kept being stubborn and tried to push you away.

222
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,420
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,690
When I see you... How should I put this?

224
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,060
I feel so small.

225
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:02,100
I think that's why I kept trying to push you away.

226
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,570
Fine, I'll give it a shot.

227
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,139
You made the right decision.

228
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,639
I'm not talking about Hold'em.

229
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,710
I mean, you.

230
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,149
I like you too, Se Young.

231
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,060
This time, I should say it first.

232
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,470
Would you go out with me?

233
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
What's wrong?

234
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,220
Well, it's just...

235
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,889
What can I do?

236
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,759
Can you tell me again that you like me?

237
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,259
What?

238
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:08,189
I want to hear it again.

239
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,168
I like you.

240
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:15,299
I like you. I love you.

241
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,699
- Gosh, stop. - I like you.

242
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,570
- Hey, by the way... - What?

243
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,409
What if you keep following me around like this...

244
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,409
and can't get into college?

245
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:25,980
I don't know.

246
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,909
It's all your fault.

247
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:29,480
I don't know!

248
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,740
Good luck, Gun.

249
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,740
I'll do a good job, for you and Jun Hee.

250
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:57,108
No, do it for yourself. So you won't have any regrets later.

251
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,709
Okay, all right.

252
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,209
Come here.

253
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,020
- Go on in. - I'll see you later.

254
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,090
- Hey, Gun. Hello. - Yes, hi.

255
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,459
Here.

256
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,730
- What's this? - A gift from me.

257
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,729
- A gift? - That's right, buddy.

258
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,158
Your place is very far from this hotel.

259
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:18,500
You can't keep going back and forth.

260
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,369
So I booked a room for you.

261
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,168
You need to be well-rested to play well, you know?

262
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,499
- Ji Chul. - I'm not giving it to you for free.

263
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,740
Win and pay me back double.

264
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,939
Consider this an investment.

265
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,109
Thanks, Ji Chul.

266
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:31,409
We'll split the prize money 70-30.

267
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:34,709
- Thief. - What? You little...

268
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:37,149
Just be glad that I'm not asking for a 40-percent cut.

269
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:38,989
You want a 30-percent cut? Dream on.

270
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,790
- So you'd better stay focused. - Hey, Gun.

271
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:43,060
Oh, hello.

272
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,560
I said you didn't need to come until the finals.

273
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:48,730
I wanted to give you this.

274
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,330
- What is it? - My good luck charm.

275
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:53,099
- Good luck charm? - Yes.

276
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,239
From my English test and the TOEIC...

277
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,840
to going out with you...

278
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,840
Anyway, it has made all my wishes come true.

279
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,179
It's going to protect you in my place.

280
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,480
Good luck, okay?

281
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,659
Hey, lovebirds. It must be nice.

282
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,560
Old bachelors like me should just drop dead or something.

283
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,260
Hurry up and go inside, or they won't let you in.

284
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,359
Bye.

285
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,968
Wait, make sure you eat well.

286
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,010
And you have to text me!

287
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,609
I'll study hard.

288
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:37,208
Goodness. If others saw this,

289
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,850
they'd think he was going away for days.

290
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,820
Hello.

291
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,919
Thank you.

292
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:52,959
It's cute.

293
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,458
(Tae Ha, You Are My World)

294
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:58,968
You're so handsome.

295
00:19:58,969 --> 00:19:59,969
Look here, please!

296
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,769
(Tae Ha Forever, Joo Tae Ha)

297
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,770
Please step back.

298
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:04,600
I'll play fair and square.

299
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,669
How do you feel today?

300
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:23,490
That thing.

301
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:29,459
Oh, this.

302
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,070
My girlfriend gave me this.

303
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,540
"Girlfriend?"

304
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,869
Let's...

305
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:43,409
play fair and square...

306
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,080
and put the past behind us.

307
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:13,869
All right. The much-awaited 2022 KPL Championship...

308
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:15,270
begins now.

309
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:32,689
Darn it.

310
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,830
Nice, yes!

311
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:55,109
(How did it go? Can I just think no news is good news?)

312
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,218
(Why am I more nervous than you?)

313
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:57,279
(Can't you go to the restroom and text me back?)

314
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,189
(It's going well. Don't worry.)

315
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,429
Se Young.

316
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:13,500
What are you doing here?

317
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,939
I'm here because I missed you.

318
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,608
KPL Championship. The winner...

319
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,310
will get one million dollars. Round Three has begun.

320
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:29,080
Ten finalists are moving on to the finals.

321
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:30,949
Even if the odds are slim,

322
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:32,949
I want to bet on it.

323
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,419
No, I must.

324
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,590
He sure knows how to keep a poker face.

325
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:44,300
My gut tells me that Joo Tae Ha will win.

326
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:46,169
All in.

327
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,639
(Under the Gun)
