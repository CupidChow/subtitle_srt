Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,380
Q already knows I pretended to hit on Toey.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,060
How could we stick to the original plan?

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,100
So Q will finally realize his feelings.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,010
I think he has already realized it.

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,980
But what we should worry about or figure out is

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,259
whether Q will admit how he feels.

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:32,810
That’s the point.

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,840
Hello, everyone. We’re from the volunteer camp.

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,960
We’re going to Kanchanaburi.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,130
You can drop off your books here for donation.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,580
Why are you going to the camp?

16
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,600
It’s Pun’s idea.

17
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,180
He wants Q and Toey to spend time together.

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,150
I feel at ease being with you guys.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,920
I can do whatever I want.

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,920
I can be silly if I want to.

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,330
I can act like a kid if I want to.

22
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,210
This is my friend, Kluen.

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,260
He’s coming solo.

24
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,100
He’ll be joining us.

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,370
When I’m with you, I don’t have to worry much about things.

26
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,500
I get to do what I haven’t tried.

27
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,780
I can do whatever I want to.

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,400
That sounds like you’re confessing to me.

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,420
Maybe I am.

DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

31
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,329
Hey. Let me help.

32
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,780
You left me alone last night.

33
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,980
Left you alone?

34
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,310
Look at what you did.

35
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,650
You were packing so much stuff.

36
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,500
I couldn't help feeling sleepy.

37
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,090
I have so many clothes.

38
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,140
That’s why I couldn’t decide.

39
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,660
So do you want me to say sorry?

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,710
Or what should I say?

41
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,870
I’m sorry, baby boy Phum.

42
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,120
Peem.

43
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,230
What’s up?

44
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,260
When did you get here?

45
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,579
Just now.

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,510
I’m excited.

47
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,210
Why? Is this your first time going to the camp?

48
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,340
I’ve been before,

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,600
but I’m going solo this time.

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,990
Can I stick with you all the time?

51
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,250
I’m going with you wherever you go.

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,610
That much?

53
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,290
Fine.

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,300
What’s up?

55
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,040
Guys, if you’ve loaded your luggage,

56
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:40,950
get on the bus.

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,110
Let’s go.

58
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,770
Let’s get on the bus.

59
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,320
Hey, dude.

60
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,570
Move.

61
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,890
You’re blocking my way.

62
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,760
Come on in, guys.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,550
Come. Come.

64
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,120
Take a seat.

65
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,010
Peem, sit with me.

66
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,260
Oh, sure.

67
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,310
Comrade Mick, sit with me.

68
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,830
Sure.

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,820
Come.

70
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,300
Sit where the sun shines.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sit next to Chain.

72
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:22,980
Huh?

73
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,980
Sit with Chain.

74
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,910
Trust me.

75
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,900
Bro, we’re all set.

76
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:39,580
Let’s get going!

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,320
That’s mine.

78
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,660
Yours.

79
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,790
Get your luggage

80
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,910
before meeting the kids.

81
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,160
Toey.

82
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,310
Here’s yours first.

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,310
Thank you.

84
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,170
Chain.

85
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,380
Q.

86
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,580
It’s super hot.

87
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,510
Alright.

88
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,060
Guys, pick where you want to sleep.

89
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,510
The rest of our members are sleeping in another room.

90
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,680
Let’s go.

91
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,810
Toey, sleep next to me.

92
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,510
Right here.

93
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,780
Why are you sleeping here?

94
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,410
Why?

95
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,060
Pun said we could choose any bed we wanted.

96
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,110
Or did you write your name there to reserve it?

97
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,909
Guys, once you’re done organizing your stuff,

98
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,510
let’s meet at the ground area in front of the school.

99
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,800
Let’s go.

100
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,000
Let’s go.

101
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,520
Let’s go.

102
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,409
Chain, Peem, Tan,

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,980
besides camp activities,

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,460
don't forget that we’re on a mission too.

105
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,220
You want me to keep pretending to hit on Toey?

106
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,090
Yeah.

107
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,310
But Q is mad at Toey.

108
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,690
But Q hasn’t realized his feelings,

109
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,520
so we must make him express them.

110
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,660
Okay. Let’s go.

111
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,720
Let’s go.

112
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,410
Here are the books, teacher.

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,100
Thank you.

114
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:14,770
Let’s take a photo.

115
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,370
Sure.

116
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,360
Okay.

117
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,610
Everyone, we’re holding a volunteer camp here for two days.

118
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,610
We’re playing some games later.

119
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,150
After class, these seniors will teach you art.

120
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,650
We hope you’ll bring back good memories.

121
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,330
Are you ready to play some games?

122
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,250
Yes!

123
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,820
If you’re ready, stand up!

124
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,080
Chain!

125
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,810
Mother snake.

126
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,830
Yes?

127
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,840
Which pool do you drink water from?

128
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,340
Sand pool,

129
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,040
moving and moving.

130
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,780
Save me. Save me.

131
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,230
Save me. Save me.

132
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,440
Eh? You won’t save me?

133
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,070
What?

134
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,020
Save me.

135
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,310
There you go. You’re in for it.

136
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,690
You didn’t save me.

137
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,430
Mick. Mick.

138
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,740
What? You already saved me?

139
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,380
Stay there.

140
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,080
Follow me.

141
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,050
Form one line only.

142
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,520
Come in.

143
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,520
Teacher Peem, take care of them.

144
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,610
Sure.

145
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,810
Come in.

146
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,110
Come in.

147
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,940
Hello.

148
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:53,970
Take your seat.

149
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,470
Hello, everyone

150
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,660
I’m Peem.

151
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,660
I’ll teach you how to draw today.

152
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,550
Teacher Peem.

153
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,390
Make some noise if you want to draw pictures.

154
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,250
Everyone, there are three options here.

155
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,210
Draw it.

156
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,320
Yeah.

157
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,440
Bro, I want to color a whale.

158
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,190
Please draw a whale for me.

159
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,810
A whale?

160
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,520
What are you drawing?

161
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,350
I asked him to draw a whale.

162
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,230
I want to color a whale.

163
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,530
Really?

164
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,640
You want to draw a whale?

165
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,010
Let me help you, okay?

166
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,060
You want a whale, right?

167
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,130
A whale, right?

168
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,450
I’ll draw it for him.

169
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,120
Thank you.

170
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,580
Teaching kids to draw something simple is nice for a change,

171
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,260
unlike what we draw at the university,

172
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,910
True.

173
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,430
I haven't done something this easy in ages.

174
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,610
But it’s nice.

175
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,420
I’m happy.

176
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,610
What is your major?

177
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,070
Painting.

178
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,280
Really?

179
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,230
That’s cool.

180
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,020
Why did you choose this major?

181
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,160
Well, I like it.

182
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,730
Actually, I can sketch,

183
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,500
but I think painting is…

184
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,010
Jealous, huh?

185
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,210
What?

186
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,370
What else should we teach them to draw?

187
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,620
Help me with something.

188
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Teacher Peem.

189
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,410
Yes?

190
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,350
I’ll be right back.

191
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,660
Teach me how to draw a lion, please.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,780
A lion?

193
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,710
Sure.

194
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,730
Why do you want to draw a lion?

195
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,980
This bro told me that

196
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,310
if I could make Teacher Peem stop talking to that guy,

197
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,410
he’d give me some chocolate.

198
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,710
Really?

199
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,110
He said that?

200
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,060
Yes.

201
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,910
Sure.

202
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,040
I’ll help you draw.

203
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,420
Q, how do I start painting?

204
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,380
Gradually dip the brush in the color and then paint it.

205
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,510
But don’t get it too soaked.

206
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,890
Okay.

207
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,280
Toey, are you feeling hot?

208
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,560
Yeah.

209
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,010
I didn’t expect it to be this hot.

210
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,580
I’ll get you some water.

211
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,780
Is your hand stained?

212
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,540
Nope.

213
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,310
I feel hot, too.

214
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,220
Alright.

215
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,010
I’ll get one for you too.

216
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,470
Matt, do you want some water?

217
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,380
I’m good, bro.

218
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,810
It seems Chain has already won your heart.

219
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,920
You told me to act like I usually do.

220
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,390
How could I stand it?

221
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,910
Well,

222
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,710
what did you just say, Q?

223
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:47,980
Q.

224
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,910
Thanks a lot.

225
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,220
Toey, your water.

226
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,530
Thank you.

227
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,760
Hey. Turn this way.

228
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,310
I’ll wipe your sweat off.

229
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,110
I’ll handle other tasks.

230
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,580
Your mentor is so easy to read.

231
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,300
He’s obviously jealous.

232
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,980
Blanch some minced pork for me.

233
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,410
Look at how you’re using a knife.

234
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,180
Pun, Mick.

235
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,010
What’s up?

236
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,510
Stop playing around and help me here.

237
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,900
What’s up?

238
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,840
I’m helping you now.

239
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,330
That’s not much help, obviously.

240
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,150
Ouch.

241
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,370
Shame on you.

242
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,070
I’m fine.

243
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,180
Watch it.

244
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,550
Babe, do you need my help?

245
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,290
Blanch noodles for me.

246
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,420
Sure.

247
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,460
But can I get some encouragement first?

248
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,480
Tan.

249
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,120
What?

250
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,110
Pun, Mick.

251
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,840
Come here.

252
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,900
This is my mustache.

253
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,070
Come here.

254
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,980
Quickly.

255
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,970
What do you want?

256
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,020
What?

257
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,180
Cut these tomatoes

258
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,570
into round shapes.

259
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,320
Round glasses?

260
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,210
You can handle this, right?

261
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,480
This is easy peasy.

262
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,610
Wait and see.

263
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,250
No blood, okay?

264
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,980
Of course.

265
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,030
Come on. You’re underestimating my skill too much.

266
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,310
Let’s wait and see.

267
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,940
I think I’m right.

268
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,980
Let’s wait and see.

269
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,170
Pass me the ketchup.

270
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,600
I want the ketchup.

271
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,160
How strict you are.

272
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,910
What?

273
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,320
I think you did it wrongly.

274
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,080
This isn’t right.

275
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,710
It’s already correct. Trust me.

276
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,300
Do this for me.

277
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,180
I’ll check over there.

278
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,980
Eh?

279
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,500
Hurry up.

280
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,430
It’s already correct.

281
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,190
How could you say it’s wrong?

282
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,260
I think you cut them at the wrong angle.

283
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,690
What’s going on here? What’s taking you so long?

284
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,430
I finished,

285
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,410
but he said it's wrong.

286
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,190
What the hell did you just do?

287
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,380
You asked me to cut them into round glasses, didn’t you?

288
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,890
How stupid you are.

289
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,010
I told you already.

290
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,100
You must cut them into rectangular shapes.

291
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,100
Got it? Rectangular, you know.

292
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,200
Am I right, Khaofang?

293
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,000
Dumbass.

294
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,430
Here, round shapes.

295
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,460
You could do it.

296
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,089
It’s an onion.

297
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,060
It’s an onion, isn’t it?

298
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,020
What’s the difference?

299
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:11,980
Round glasses.

300
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,240
Same for this one.

301
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,750
But I didn’t cut them into round glasses.

302
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,710
We cut them into rings.

303
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,339
Bye-bye.

304
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,000
Bye-bye.

305
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,900
What?

306
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,110
Chocolate.

307
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,100
Guys, the food is ready.

308
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,110
Let’s eat.

309
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:37,760
Let’s go.

310
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,310
It’s sweating hot.

311
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,780
I shouldn’t have worn this one.

312
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,600
Hey, did we bring any chocolate?

313
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,890
Chocolate?

314
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,260
- Yeah.
- Why are you asking?

315
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,810
Nope. I’m just asking.

316
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,980
I just want to know if we have any.

317
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,360
Pun,

318
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,120
why does the volunteer camp’s food look so luxurious?

319
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,230
Absolutely.

320
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,030
Enjoy the food I cooked.

321
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
You cooked?

322
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,160
My boyfriend did.

323
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,830
I did help.

324
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,180
Fang, you can cook?

325
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,220
He can only cook one dish

326
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,960
to win his babe’s heart.

327
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,350
I don’t have to win anything.

328
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,710
Your friend won’t leave me no matter what.

329
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,030
That’s right, babe.

330
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,030
But I want to eat some rice.

331
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,230
Eating noodles won’t get me full.

332
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,300
You assigned me to this position.

333
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,610
Freaking eat it if you can,

334
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,880
but if you can’t, cook it for yourself.

335
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,210
Eh? What?

336
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,200
We’re always like this.

337
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,530
Don’t be shocked, Kluen.

338
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,580
It’s alright.

339
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,010
I think you guys are funny.

340
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,780
Kluen, why did you come to this camp?

341
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,670
Your friends didn’t join you.

342
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,090
Or did you follow Peem here?

343
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,590
Gotcha.

344
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,920
Are you hitting on my friend?

345
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,950
Pun, you’re talking nonsense.

346
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,380
I guess so.

347
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,300
Hey, which one are you talking about?

348
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,900
About you following Peem here

349
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,540
or you hitting on him?

350
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,520
Well, I won’t answer this question then.

351
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,200
Oho.

352
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,380
My friend is on another level.

353
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,980
Shut up and eat, Tan.

354
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,720
Let me help.

355
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,210
You know how to do it?

356
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,310
It’s just washing dishes.

357
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,810
Fine.

358
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,100
Go ahead.

359
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,790
Just rinse it with water to make it clean.

360
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,530
That’s it.

361
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,900
Phum.

362
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,530
Hey.

363
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,820
Phum, what’s this?

364
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,180
Phum, what are you doing?

365
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,780
I’m washing dishes.

366
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,470
Washing dishes?

367
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,630
It’s all wet here.

368
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,930
Look at your trousers.

369
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,010
Take a shower.

370
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,410
You’re wet too, aren’t you?

371
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,620
I’ll wash them.

372
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,810
Get changed, Peem,

373
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,870
or you might be sick.

374
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,480
Because I’m already wet now, I want to finish washing them.

375
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,600
Just a few more to go.

376
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,440
Hand it to me.

377
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,560
I can handle it alone.

378
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,510
Let me help.

379
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,630
I’ll do it.

380
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,980
Why are you fighting over this?

381
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,210
Both of you, do it,

382
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,410
so we’ll finish this quickly.

383
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,700
You take a shower first.

384
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,560
You go first.

385
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,190
You go first. I’ll let you go first.

386
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:08,740
You go first.

387
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,580
I know you’re in a hurry.

388
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,300
I’m giving in.

389
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,100
Don’t worry. Go ahead.

390
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,800
- You go first.
- Why do you keep evading this?

391
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,130
There are many rooms inside.

392
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,500
You both can go in.

393
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,000
What are you looking at?

394
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,010
Take a shower.

395
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,110
I like Peem.

396
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,620
Why are you telling me?

397
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,800
In case you want to know.

398
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,930
Tan, so what’s the story?

399
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,110
Can you tell us already?

400
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,610
What story?

401
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,100
Between Fang and you.

402
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,890
How did the whole thing start?

403
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,360
Oho.

404
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,610
Here comes a full gang of nosy peeps.

405
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,210
I guess I have to talk about it, huh?

406
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,960
What do you want to know?

407
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,370
How and when did you two start dating?

408
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,980
I’ve met Fang since high school.

409
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,870
Do you remember

410
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,630
that football competition between schools?

411
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,220
Fang was the head of the cheer team.

412
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,110
Hey, where’s your cheer team head?

413
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,660
Do you have eyes?

414
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,450
If you don’t see him around, then I don’t either.

415
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,260
You’re getting on my nerves, huh?

416
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,320
What’s with you?

417
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,480
Why?

418
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,190
Why?

419
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,050
Why did you get on my nerves?

420
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,820
I just wanted to.

421
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,660
I was just asking nicely.

422
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,420
- TA:	You think you’re the real deal or what?
- Bring it on.

423
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,650
- Get on my nerves now.
- Sure.

424
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,350
Bring it on.

425
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,070
Wait.

426
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,910
You punched Fang?

427
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,800
Right.

428
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,260
Imagine this.

429
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,910
The whole football team and the cheer team were at the stadium.

430
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,450
Fang walked in alone.

431
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,980
He didn’t bring any friends.

432
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,030
I couldn’t lose face, so I punched him back.

433
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,910
Both of us ended up with bloody lips.

434
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,410
You’re totally rivals-turned-lovers.

435
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,380
Was that when you were the school’s football team representative?

436
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:03,910
That’s right.

437
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,360
Was that when you said your motorcycle fell down

438
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,530
and you hurt your lips?

439
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,150
That’s right.

440
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,920
Come on, guys.

441
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,160
Don’t be mad at me.

442
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,270
I didn’t dare tell you

443
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,630
because you guys told me that

444
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,720
if I got into a fight again,

445
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,380
you would stop being friends with me.

446
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,410
What a waste of my time to dress the wound for you.

447
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,720
I even prepared food, water, medicine, and so on for you.

448
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,130
I should have just let you die.

449
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,410
That was a long time ago.

450
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,170
Don’t be mad at me.

451
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,860
Then, what happened next?

452
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,580
Continue the story.

453
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,810
After that, I got to know Phum

454
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,920
because of that fight with Fang.

455
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,910
Then, we kept arguing

456
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,110
until one day…

457
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,300
Ouch!

458
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,560
Hey, let’s go.

459
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,120
Hurry up.

460
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,010
Fang, come.

461
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,450
Where are they?

462
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,960
They left already.

463
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,780
Why did you help us?

464
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,980
I saw the whole gang assault you two.

465
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,710
I just don’t like dirty tricks.

466
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,210
Hold on.

467
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,510
Won’t you dress your wound?

468
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,190
It will hurt a bit.

469
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,410
A lot.

470
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,810
What are you looking at?

471
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,410
Do you want me to dress your wound?

472
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,570
I don’t.

473
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,010
On the cheek, too.

474
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,180
Are you alright?

475
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,070
Yeah.

476
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,690
This is annoying.

477
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,760
Let me help.

478
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,700
Turn your face.

479
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,900
Bear with it.

480
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,380
You acted bold just now, didn’t you?

481
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,290
Don’t move.

482
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,200
Enough already.

483
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,050
Give me that.

484
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,780
Turn this way.

485
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,980
Ouch.

486
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,760
Hurt or not?

487
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,380
You’re really ungrateful.

488
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,390
Shit.

489
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
That’s what a falling-in-love moment feels like

490
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,350
in that second that you got to meet him.

491
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,300
And punched him?

492
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,000
Ptooey.

493
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,960
Nope.

494
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,280
It’s not to that extent.

495
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,890
Back then, I saw him as a friend.

496
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,300
When did you start developing your feelings for him then?

497
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,220
I don’t know.

498
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,720
I don’t know when it started.

499
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,350
But after thinking about it,

500
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,980
I’ve realized he’s the only one in my heart all along.

501
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,840
Whatever I do, I think of him.

502
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,090
But I was so stressed, guys.

503
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,320
I was totally confused back then.

504
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,300
Why?

505
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,010
I once had a crush on my close friend.

506
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,720
I knew it was impossible.

507
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,240
I freaking wanted to confess my feelings,

508
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,820
but I knew I stood no chance.

509
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,500
But why did you suddenly become crazy in love with him?

510
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,910
Well,

511
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,910
at first, I thought I would give up on him already.

512
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,000
But have you ever heard of this “forbidden fruit is always sweeter”?

513
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,160
Damn it.

514
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,920
Back then, it seemed as if I was haunted by black magic.

515
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:34,950
Imagine this.

516
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,800
When I walked, whatever I did, and wherever I went to,

517
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,910
I thought of him.

518
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,310
When I ordered a pizza, I wanted him as my pizza topping.

519
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,210
Seriously.

520
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,410
I didn’t know how to deal with this,

521
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,670
so I decided to make a move on him.

522
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,180
But honestly,

523
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,380
even now I still can’t believe I’m dating him.

524
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:57,960
Damn it.

525
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,600
I feel like I won a jackpot.

526
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,710
But what’s funny is

527
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,180
Fang had feelings for me, too,

528
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,580
but he just kept cool, making me make a move first.

529
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,670
Come on.

530
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,830
I was stressed for so long, wondering if he liked me too.

531
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,720
I knew it.

532
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,920
That’s why you’re head over heels in love with him, right?

533
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,160
Exactly.

534
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,520
Now, I want to change the owner’s name of my house, car, land, condo,

535
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,090
and everything to Fang.

536
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,400
To make Fang pay for the rest of the installments?

537
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,140
Exactly.

538
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,220
This proves you know me well enough.

539
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,260
What are you guys doing?

540
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,680
He’s gossiping about you.

541
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,310
Gossiping? Nonsense.

542
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,310
You’re making my baby misunderstand me.

543
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,870
I’m explaining to my friends about how we started dating.

544
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,960
How wicked you are, Fang.

545
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,510
My friend is sold.

546
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,980
Yeah. Totally.

547
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,450
That’s because

548
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,480
I knew from the start he liked me anyway.

549
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,060
See?

550
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,630
My baby is the best.

551
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,780
I’m sticking with you forever.

552
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,180
My baby is the best.

553
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,320
What’s with you, Pun?

554
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,240
What?

555
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,200
You’re envious, huh?

556
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,020
Ouch.

557
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,180
Peem!

558
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,230
That struck right into my face.

559
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,100
But I’m alright.

560
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,730
You’re taking care of me, right?

561
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,470
You’re taking care of me, right?

562
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,860
Peem.

563
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,210
You haven’t gone to bed?

564
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,180
Uh-huh.

565
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,110
I’m not sleepy yet.

566
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,700
How about you? Still awake?

567
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,310
I can’t fall asleep.

568
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,010
It’s probably because I’m not familiar with this place.

569
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,580
You know what?

570
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,350
I’ve never met someone like you.

571
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,770
What do you mean?

572
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,780
Strange.

573
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,400
I didn’t mean something negative.

574
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,610
It seems you have happiness around you.

575
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
I can’t explain it,

576
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,120
but I can feel

577
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,900
that you’re kind-hearted

578
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,300
It feels good being around you.

579
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,590
Why are you saying that?

580
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,520
We’ve just met for few times.

581
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,000
Quite so.

582
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,620
But that’s what I really feel.

583
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,300
It seems you can radiate happiness.

584
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,180
Radiate?

585
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,700
What do you see in me?

586
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,580
A monster or what?

587
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,780
Come on.

588
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,310
This is what you’re like.

589
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,090
Thanks a lot.

590
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,780
Hey, let’s do a swing competition.

591
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,620
Show me first.

592
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,600
Give it a try.

593
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,570
How is it?

594
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,510
Doing something like this for a change is nice.

595
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,510
Just like when we drew for kids?

596
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,310
Yeah.

597
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,210
It’s fun.

598
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,050
Yep.

599
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,610
I haven’t played something like a kid for ages.

600
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,680
What do you think?

601
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,000
Are you having fun?

602
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,960
It’s kind of relaxing.

603
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,170
You like Peem, right?

604
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,810
You aren’t that hard to read, Phum.

605
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,110
We’ve been friends for so many years.

606
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,620
What’s bothering you now?

607
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,220
Actually, Peem and I have a deal.

608
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,170
When we had that fight,

609
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,310
I made him agree to be my slave.

610
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,310
Slave?

611
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,910
You haven’t told us about this.

612
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,510
Peem didn’t want anyone to know.

613
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,500
Also,

614
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,710
back then, I just wanted to tease him.

615
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,120
After teasing and staying together, you developed feelings for each other?

616
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,430
I don’t know.

617
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,580
But honestly, I like it that Peem came into your life.

618
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,710
I’ve noticed you’re more lively these days.

619
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,010
Just show how you feel.

620
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,250
If you’re too slow,

621
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,320
someone else could still your thunder, and it can’t be helped.

622
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,100
You heard what Kluen said already.

623
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,910
Kluen told me

624
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,820
he likes Peem.

625
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,830
Shit.

626
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,350
That’s bold.

627
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,820
But if you want to do anything, go ahead.

628
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:28,910
I’ll be rooting for you.

629
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,110
If you’re okay, go to bed already.

630
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,710
You go ahead.

631
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,570
Are you sure?

632
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,600
I’ll join you soon.

633
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,270
Don’t take too long.

634
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,610
Thank you.

635
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,780
You haven’t gone to bed?

636
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,970
Is something wrong?

637
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,770
Nothing.

638
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,380
Can’t sleep?

639
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,180
Phum.

640
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,920
I’m trying to sort out my feelings.

641
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,190
Don’t talk to me now.

642
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,000
What’s wrong?

643
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,310
Are you angry with me about something?

644
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,310
What are you doing?

645
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,900
I’m trying to lull you to sleep.

646
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,810
You treat me like a kid.

647
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,470
What are you doing?

648
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,160
You want to lull me to sleep, don’t you?

649
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,670
If you want me to fall asleep, let me hug you like this.

650
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,600
Don’t move.

651
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,920
How can I fall asleep then?

652
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:51,960
What are you doing?

653
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,420
Your hair smells good.

654
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,310
Phum.

655
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,470
Let me smell this side too.

656
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,860
You freaking take advantage of me.

657
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,110
Sleep already.

658
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,170
Let me have a goodnight kiss first.

659
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,570
Please.

660
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,200
Please.

661
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,280
Please.

662
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,260
Charming prince.

663
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,910
Sleep already.

664
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,500
Thank you.

665
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,870
Goodnight.

666
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,770
Do you like Toey?

667
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,110
If I like him, then why?

668
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,470
You know Toey likes me.

669
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,230
If you don’t truly like him,

670
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,420
stay out of this.

671
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,110
I’m begging.

672
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:08,950
Begging for what?

673
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,010
To get Toey back

674
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,610
or to get your love back?

675
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:16,010
The person who can make me fall in love again must be you.

676
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,820
Do you really like me?

677
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,510
I wouldn’t kiss someone I didn’t like.

678
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,740
Let me sit with you.

679
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,590
If something’s bothering you, just tell me straight.

680
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,300
Are you two that close?

681
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,610
I think so.

682
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,260
I don’t like it when you’re with Kluen.

683
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,920
What’s that supposed to mean?

684
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,040
I think I’ll cancel our deal.

685
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,110
You can’t do that.

686
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,390
Or…do you like me?
