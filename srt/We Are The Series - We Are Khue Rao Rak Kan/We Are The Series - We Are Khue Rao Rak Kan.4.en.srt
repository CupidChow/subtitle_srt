Take it.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,780
Give it to Fang for me.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,400
Oh? Are you hitting on him?

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,860
I just…

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,060
Next time, be sure to have many of them ready.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,980
When you do your work, pencils are necessary.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,540
I’ll run an errand after this.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,340
Wait here.

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:31,950
It won’t take long.

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,280
But are you sure you’re coming back?

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,730
You told me to wait, so I did.

16
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,730
It seems you have something to talk to my friend often.

17
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,650
Can you forgive me?

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,240
I’m sorry.

19
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,700
DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

20
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:16,740
What did you say?

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,640
Are you alright?

22
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,720
You aren’t sick, are you?

23
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,010
You don’t seem to have a fever.

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,070
I’m fine.

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,300
Who are you?

26
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:33,810
What happened to Phum I know?

27
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,650
I’m hungry.

28
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,120
Hurry up. Let’s eat.

29
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,130
Hey, wait.

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,590
What did you just say?

31
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,630
Hurry up and get your stuff now.

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,070
Nope.

33
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,100
What did you say at the beginning?

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,440
You said something just now that started with sor--?

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,079
What was it?

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,390
Nothing.

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,270
Fine.

38
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,230
Give me a second.

39
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:52,980
I’m coming.

40
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,320
You bought one for me?

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,660
I didn’t.

42
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,200
The seller messed up the order.

43
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,660
I didn’t want it to go to waste.

44
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,370
Really?

45
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,190
Why?

46
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,770
You thought I would buy one for you, huh?

47
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,470
Not really.

48
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,600
You’re damn slow.

49
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,810
I’m freaking starving.

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,000
That’s Chicken Rice.

51
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,060
You can eat it, right?

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,410
I guess it’s not unhealthy for you.

53
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,260
Peem?

54
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,560
What are you doing here?

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,990
between you two?

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well…

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,250
Or you…

58
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
I…

59
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:36,880
You…

60
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,850
I…

61
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,310
You…

62
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,370
Well, I…

63
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,670
You like our faculty’s canteen, don’t you?

64
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,190
Nice food, isn’t it?

65
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,640
Exactly.

66
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,300
The sauce for Chicken Rice here is superb.

67
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,170
I came to this canteen

68
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,160
and met him by chance.

69
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,000
So you’re sitting together?

70
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,450
Yeah. Correct.

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,260
Oh. I see.

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,380
What’s with you?

73
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,860
It just happened that way.

74
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,220
Peem.

75
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,500
I talked to Q last night.

76
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,880
You were moody, didn’t you?

77
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,810
What was wrong?

78
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,860
Oh, well,

79
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,580
nothing much.

80
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,590
Someone pranked me.

81
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,950
He’s already a grown-ass man

82
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,310
but behaving so damn childishly.

83
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,030
Someone pranked you?

84
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,800
Yes.

85
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,790
I’ll handle him.

86
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,560
I’ll slap him.

87
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,040
Slap.

88
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,170
Slap.

89
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,959
Need my help?

90
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,930
It’s alright.

91
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,660
Just forget about it.

92
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,839
It’s alright.

93
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,280
If you didn’t stop me,

94
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,990
I would knock his head off.

95
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,630
I want to teach him a lesson, though.

96
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,450
Phum,

97
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,110
about that snack I bought,

98
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,460
what did he say?

99
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,360
What are you talking about?

100
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,260
What?

101
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,470
The snack I bought him that day.

102
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,350
Did he like it?

103
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:43,900
Did he?

104
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,170
Oh.

105
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,230
He liked it.

106
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,159
Really?

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,159
He liked it.

108
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,270
Hello?

109
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,820
I’m eating.

110
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,250
You want me to get it for you now?

111
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,750
Alright.

112
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,400
I’ll buy it for you.

113
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,620
I’ll hang up.

114
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,350
Who called?

115
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
It’s Fang.

116
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,910
He asked me to buy some glue for him.

117
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,180
He said it’s for urgent work.

118
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,260
Where is Fang now?

119
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,610
First floor at his faculty building, probably.

120
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,520
Really?

121
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,870
Are you going?

122
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,440
I’m going now.

123
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,280
Don’t go.

124
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,470
I’ll take care of it.

125
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,160
Keep eating.

126
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,080
I’ll do it for you.

127
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,110
I guarantee he will finish his work in time.

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,610
I’ll get going.

129
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,250
Bye.

130
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,110
Bye, buddy.

131
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,420
See you later.

132
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,760
Do you need me to do anything else for you?

133
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
If you don’t, I’ll get back to work.

134
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,560
What’s with that nod?

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,020
I’ll give you a lift.

136
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,320
Hurry up. Eat it up.

137
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,230
Thank you.

138
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,860
Are you free?

139
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,990
Can you help me with something?

140
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,700
I am.

141
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,480
What brings you here?

142
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,960
Phum isn’t free,

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,300
so I came.

144
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,230
What do you want me to help you with?

145
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,020
Nothing.

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,900
Come on.

147
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,430
Let me help.

148
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,440
I’m free.

149
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,650
I have nothing to do.

150
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,520
Help me cut it then.

151
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,700
Sure.

152
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,950
How do I do it?

153
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,150
Cut it into this shape.

154
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,830
Remove the head portion

155
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,830
and cut through in the middle.

156
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,510
I never thought we could end up like this.

157
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,960
True.

158
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,110
I didn’t expect we would become friends.

159
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,040
Who knows?

160
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,700
We can probably become more than just friends.

161
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,430
Pardon?

162
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,900
Nothing.

163
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,050
You’re done?

164
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,960
Yep.

165
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,910
Are you sure you’re free?

166
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,100
You aren't going anywhere, right?

167
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,230
I’m free.

168
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,330
I can make time for you all day long.

169
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,760
Well, help me glue it.

170
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,070
This one?

171
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,460
Here. Stick it like this.

172
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,840
Can you do it?

173
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,640
Of course.

174
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:29,600
Ouch!

175
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,400
Ouch!

176
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,310
Fang, I got glue on my finger.

177
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:32,990
Let me see.

178
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,990
Here.

179
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,760
Can I hit on you?

180
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,300
What are you playing at?

181
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,900
I need to finish this and submit it quickly.

182
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,110
I’m just teasing a little.

183
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,200
Take it.

184
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,490
Cut this one, too.

185
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,170
Speed up.

186
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:29,840
Peek-a-boo!

187
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,450
Hey?!

188
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,429
What are you playing at?

189
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,620
I’m working.

190
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,799
What work?

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,909
It’s not your business.

192
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,659
Go play somewhere else.

193
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,650
Go already, Toey.

194
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,410
Toey!

195
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,610
I told you to play somewhere else!

196
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,650
I’m working.

197
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,600
Fine.

198
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,370
I’ll play somewhere else.

199
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,610
I’m sorry.

200
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Is this really a place to skateboard?

201
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,860
And is this a place to sit and draw?

202
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,180
Toey!

203
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,840
Wait.

204
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,440
Toey!

205
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,350
Toey!

206
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,200
Peem!

207
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,430
Help me.

208
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,040
What are you guys doing?

209
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,620
Q is teasing me again.

210
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,730
You got on my nerves first.

211
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,080
Toey.

212
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,750
Eh? Bro?

213
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,960
Why are you here?

214
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,800
Shouldn’t I be asking you that?

215
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,800
You told me you’d study abroad, didn’t you?

216
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,330
I changed my plan.

217
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,400
You’re doing great, right?

218
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,690
Yeah.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,530
Take me to meet Fang later, okay?

220
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,680
I didn’t think you’d join this university.

221
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,500
Well, you two know each other?

222
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,570
We went to the same high school.

223
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,070
Are you two dating, Phum, Peem?

224
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,670
What?

225
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,210
What are you talking about?

226
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,130
That’s nonsense.

227
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,320
Eh?

228
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,010
I saw him pick you up the other day.

229
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,580
I remember his car.

230
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,960
If it’s not dating,

231
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,870
what is it?

232
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,720
What a small world.

233
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,720
He’s not my boyfriend.

234
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,030
He’s not your boyfriend.

235
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,470
I’m going to the park to skateboard with some friends.

236
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,850
Do you want to come along?

237
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,300
You change subjects fast, huh?

238
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,050
Join me, will you?

239
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,840
Let’s hang out.

240
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,740
Alright.

241
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,490
I’ll go with you.

242
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,730
I’ll draw there.

243
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,630
Q, let’s go.

244
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,250
Let’s go.

245
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,100
Fine.

246
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,350
The park in front of the university?

247
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,740
Get in.

248
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,490
I’m heading that way.

249
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,120
No need to.

250
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,480
We will…

251
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,580
Phum, you’re kind-hearted as always.

252
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,720
Hurry up. Get your stuff, Peem.

253
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,440
Q, hurry up.

254
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,090
Get your stuff.

255
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,200
I’ll wait in the car.

256
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,920
Bro, I missed you so much.

257
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,180
You’ve been doing okay, right?

258
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,770
Does anyone still tease you?

259
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,700
Someone does.

260
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,690
If anyone teases you, let me know.

261
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,470
Got it?

262
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,490
But I can still take care of myself.

263
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,910
You don’t have to handle him for me.

264
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,290
Ouch.

265
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,520
Q.

266
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,730
Sit properly.

267
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,480
You’re blocking the air con.

268
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,290
It’s good we’re all at the same university,

269
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,750
so Fang and I can look after you.

270
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,460
By the way,

271
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,970
who were you waiting for yesterday, Peem?

272
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,170
Waiting?

273
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,340
I wasn’t waiting for anyone.

274
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,870
When I called you,

275
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,750
were you talking in your sleep or what?

276
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,780
Oh.

277
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,300
I was dreaming.

278
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,300
I was talking in my sleep about a random dog.

279
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,120
What was that dream, Peem?

280
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,190
In my dream,

281
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,700
I met a dog,

282
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,160
and it told me to wait for it.

283
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,820
I did, but then it left me there.

284
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,140
It left me there without even telling me.

285
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,090
It didn’t come back.

286
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,590
At first, I thought that dog was dead already.

287
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
That’s rude of the dog.

288
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,770
Let’s not talk about it.

289
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,640
I’m up in arms.

290
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,280
Just damn forget about it.

291
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,720
Let it die wherever.

292
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,920
Aren’t you heading home?

293
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,820
You said you’re passing through this way, didn’t you?

294
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,350
I’m off to skateboard.

295
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,870
I’ll find somewhere to draw.

296
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,580
Aren’t you heading home?

297
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,580
I have nothing to do after this.

298
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,850
Also, it’s not wrong to chill out in the park, right?

299
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,020
Or what would you say?

300
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,410
Do you own this park?

301
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:46,850
You’re wrong

302
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,410
because you keep staring at me.

303
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,590
I feel

304
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,080
uncomfortable.

305
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,310
I’m not staring at you.

306
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,200
Fine.

307
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,140
I’m doing that.

308
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,520
What’s wrong with you?

309
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,720
You’re acting strange.

310
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,140
Well,

311
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,750
about what happened yesterday,

312
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,030
honestly,

313
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,530
I didn’t expect that you’d wait for me.

314
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,960
But I pranked you on purpose.

315
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,790
I’m sorry.

316
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,700
Maybe you should also learn to wait.

317
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,440
You’re tired already?

318
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,720
Yeah. I’m tired.

319
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,070
I’ll sit here and watch you draw.

320
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,210
What? Why are you staring at it?

321
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,560
What do you see in my work, huh?

322
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,010
Well, watching you work could probably improve my skills.

323
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,630
You must have practiced a lot

324
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,280
to be able to draw at this level, right?

325
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,480
I’d say I practiced really hard.

326
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,160
Before the exam, I drew every day.

327
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,330
But since it’s what I enjoy doing,

328
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,320
I never felt tired.

329
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,400
What’s with that face?

330
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,870
Huh?

331
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,050
Or do you feel stressed being my mentee?

332
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,180
I don’t.

333
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,690
Why would I?

334
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,240
People keep saying that I’m good at this and that,

335
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,110
so I don’t know if that puts some pressure on you

336
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,780
since you’re my mentee.

337
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,320
Not really.

338
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,420
I don’t have that thought in mind at all.

339
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,240
I find no reason to compare myself to you, Q.

340
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,280
I just feel that

341
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,370
I want to keep improving.

342
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,370
That’s it.

343
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,500
That’s good.

344
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,950
I’m not perfect at everything, actually.

345
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,430
I still need to improve in many ways, too.

346
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,880
You’re nodding? You understand what I said?

347
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,420
Nope.

348
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,050
What is the thing you’re still not good at?

349
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,680
That one.

350
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,500
Skateboarding.

351
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,620
Really?

352
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,840
Nice.

353
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,620
I’ll teach you to be good at it.

354
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,560
Come. Put the pencil down.

355
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,200
No.

356
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,820
I don’t know how to skateboard.

357
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,060
Come.

358
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,580
Hey, I don't know how to do it, Toey.

359
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,440
I can’t.

360
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,590
I’ll teach you.

361
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,619
Which leg do you feel more comfortable leading with?

362
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,400
Your left leg, right?

363
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,200
Like this.

364
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,480
Okay.

365
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,670
The other leg.

366
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,200
Spread them a bit more.

367
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,150
Bend your knees a little.

368
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,319
Toey!

369
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,150
Will I fall down?

370
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,859
Toey!

371
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,150
Alright.

372
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,119
Relax.

373
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,359
Bend your knees a bit more.

374
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,450
Spread your legs a bit more.

375
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,350
I didn’t think you’d wait for me.

376
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,890
Aren’t you afraid I’ll leave you here?

377
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,960
Your stuff is here.

378
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,440
You left your things with me, though.

379
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,490
Do you want them?

380
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,960
Just eat.

381
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,550
If that can ease your anger,

382
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,760
I can give you all of them.

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,130
♪ Every day’s a memory, precious and true ♪

384
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,960
♪ No matter where, just walking next to you ♪

386
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,760
Thanks for your help.

387
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,970
Did you already turn it in?

388
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,190
Yeah.

389
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,190
I have to present it to the professor tomorrow.

390
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,710
You usually have workloads?

391
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,280
It actually depends on

392
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,780
how each student manages it.

393
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,110
But when it’s the work that involves an idea,

394
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,920
I couldn’t plan much.

395
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,760
And then there's the back and forth with the professor on the concept.

396
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,300
Since it takes long before getting an approval,

397
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,120
I’m left with little time to work on the model.

398
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,120
Whenever you need a hand,

399
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,420
just let me know.

400
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,800
But I hear engineering majors are also studying really hard.

401
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,220
Anyway, thanks for helping.

402
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,680
No worries.

403
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,540
I’m happy to.

404
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,910
This drink is so delicious.

405
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,740
It’s just a regular drink.

406
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,880
But you bought it for me,

407
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,130
so it’s extra delicious.

408
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,620
Do you want to try it?

409
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,430
Enjoy it.

410
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,120
I bought it for you.

411
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,650
Cool.

412
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,060
I’m planning to keep it all to myself.

413
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,800
I’m not sharing.

414
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,850
Drink it up.

415
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,370
Hey.

416
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,840
Toey and I are heading back.

417
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,180
See you later.

418
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,000
Bye.

419
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,520
Bye, Phum, Peem.

420
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,960
I’m heading home too.

421
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,360
What is it again?

422
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,640
I’ll give you a lift.

423
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,630
You’re heading that way again?

424
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,230
Let’s go home.

425
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,090
I’m going home.

426
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:40,720
Q.

427
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,640
I’ll send you home.

428
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,270
You didn’t bring your car today, did you?

429
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,080
I’ll accompany you home.

430
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,490
I’m good.

431
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,160
I can go back myself.

432
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,230
I’m running an errand around there.

433
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,480
Where?

434
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,040
I’m buying some gold at your place, I guess.

435
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,720
You don’t need to know.

436
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,440
Just follow me.

437
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,400
What?

438
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,030
Fine.

439
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,920
You know Toey?

440
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,380
Yes.

441
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,820
When he was a kid, he got teased often.

442
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,000
Fang and I looked out for him.

443
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,000
But as we kept doing that,

444
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,530
he became like another brother to us.

445
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,470
I didn’t expect

446
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,120
someone like you would have this side, too.

447
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,530
I’ve got more of that up my sleeve.

448
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,960
Do you want to try it?

449
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,060
Try what?

450
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,780
Whenever I take care of someone,

451
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,440
I will do my best.

452
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,910
For example,

453
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,850
I’m wearing a seatbelt for you.

454
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,240
Like this.

455
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,370
And now, it’s a head pat before you leave the car.

456
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,960
What’s gotten into you?

457
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,840
What do you think?

458
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,360
Warm-hearted enough?

459
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,000
Thanks for the ride.

460
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,530
Hang on.

461
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,840
You already forgave me, right?

462
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,840
Huh?

463
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,020
That I kept you waiting.

464
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,680
Did you really forgive me?

465
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,330
I’m sorry.

466
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,150
Don’t apologize too often.

467
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,550
It will lose its meaning.

468
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,470
I just don't know

469
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,200
how to ease your anger.

470
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,760
Just don’t do this to anyone again.

471
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,480
Fluffy hair.

472
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,920
Is that the painting you told me about?

473
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,120
It’s nearly done.

474
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,240
Yes.

475
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,200
After it’s finished,

476
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,400
you’ll never see me again.

477
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,570
Can you not finish it too soon then?

478
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,240
About what happened yesterday,

479
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,760
I’m sorry.

480
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,650
That I kept you waiting.

481
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,440
Did you really forgive me?

482
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,250
I’m sorry.

483
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,800
I didn’t expect that

484
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,450
someone like you would have this side, too.

485
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,490
Whenever I take care of someone,

486
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,240
I will do my best.

487
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,910
Why are you looking at me?

488
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,310
Well, I’m just curious.

489
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,090
Curious?

490
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,740
About what?

491
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,250
I see you wear earphones all the time,

492
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,080
so I wonder what song you’re listening to.

493
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,350
Nosy.

494
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,100
Come on, Q.

495
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,680
You can just answer nicely.

496
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,360
You know now.

Pun, what’s wrong?

509
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,610
Chain.

510
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,800
What are you doing here?

511
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,550
I’ve just finished hitting the books.

512
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,950
I’m heading home.

513
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,710
Wait.

514
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,720
This is my faculty.

515
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,080
Is it?

516
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,430
You don’t have a fever.

517
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,160
It’s dying.

518
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:42,880
Huh?

519
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
My brain is fried.

520
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,580
If I study one more subject, I will probably…

521
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,890
Pun, are you alright?

522
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,790
I’m tired.

523
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,160
You have been studying hard, right?

524
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,010
Uh-huh.

525
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,330
Haven’t got any sleep?

526
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,390
Uh-huh.

527
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,450
Eat something hot,

528
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,360
so you’ll feel better.

529
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,480
If you can’t make it home yourself next time,

530
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,310
call me.

531
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,290
Why should I call you?

532
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,580
Come on.

533
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,160
I told you to call, so just do it.

534
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,000
Got it?

535
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,490
Eat it so you’ll feel better,

536
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,850
or you’ll collapse somewhere while walking.

537
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,930
Phum,

538
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,720
did you say sorry to your friend already?

539
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,640
Yep.

540
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,440
I already did.

541
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,850
Oh, I mean,

542
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,540
I told my friend to say sorry already.

543
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,290
So why did he wait?

544
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,250
You guys go ahead and eat.

545
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,080
I’ll join you soon.

546
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,320
Where are you going?

547
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,960
I’ll go see Tan.

548
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,960
I’ll be back.

549
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,640
See you.

550
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,820
What?

551
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,100
What’s with him?

552
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,220
Beer, are you hungry?

553
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,640
What should we eat today?

554
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,550
I can’t decide.

555
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,670
Let the food store auntie pick it for you.

556
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,790
You enjoy talking to her, don’t you?

557
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,810
That sounds nice.

558
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,110
Let’s go.

559
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,130
Let-the-auntie-pick menu.

560
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,460
Hey.

561
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,300
You helped Fang cut the model yesterday?

562
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,860
Yep.

563
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,780
He said he needed help,

564
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,890
and I happened to be free.

565
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,150
Why?

566
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,710
Fang asked me to give it to you.

567
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,820
It's a thank-you for helping him yesterday.

568
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,080
Really?

569
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,000
Next time, if you aren’t free, let me know.

570
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,180
I’m always happy to help Fang.

571
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,530
But I was actually free yesterday.

572
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,750
Come on, buddy.

573
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,760
This is for the sake of our friendship, you know.

574
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,960
We’re friends.

575
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,640
Just forget about it.

576
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,070
I’m grabbing lunch.

577
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,970
Do you want to come along?

578
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,760
Nope.

579
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,070
Fang bought this snack for me,

580
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,660
so I already feel imaginarily full.

581
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,970
Hey.

582
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Anyway, thanks.

583
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,540
But remember

584
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,290
to let me know when Fang needs help.

585
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,660
I won’t.

586
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
Phum.

587
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,900
Come on.

588
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,560
It’s alright.

589
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,980
I’ve got this snack, at least.

590
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,150
Buying this doesn’t only mean he has money,

591
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,090
but it also means he has me in his heart.

592
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,600
I’m in such a good mood.

593
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,350
I’ll call my friend.

594
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,730
Q is taking a nap again.

595
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,730
How could he make time to do his work?

596
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,370
He probably does it at home

597
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,420
or at night.

598
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,280
I don’t know.

599
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,280
I really respect him.

600
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,090
I hope to be talented like him.

601
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,500
What’s up?

602
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,370
(Hey, Peem.)

603
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,730
Is your aunt home this evening?

604
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,690
Nope.

605
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,800
She’s on a seminar trip.

606
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:56,440
Why?

607
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,650
(Cool.)

608
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,220
Let’s celebrate tonight.

609
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,120
What occasion is it this time?

610
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,320
(Come on.)

611
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,740
(I’m in a good mood.)

612
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,680
(Invite Q.)

613
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,600
(I’ll ask the others to come.)

614
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,020
It’s my house.

615
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,160
I haven’t given you permission yet.

616
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,710
(Come on, Peem.)

617
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,440
(Please.)

618
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,640
(I want to celebrate.)

619
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,700
Fine.

620
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,990
I’ll invite him.

621
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,400
But I don’t know if he can make it.

622
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,850
(Cool.)

623
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,880
I’m sure someone like Q will join us.

624
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
He’ll certainly be free.

625
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,950
I’ll ask the others to join.

626
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,970
Bye, buddy.

627
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,210
Who called?

628
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,640
Tan.

629
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,990
He wants us to party at my place.

630
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,780
Interested?

631
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,050
Count me it.

632
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,990
By the way, what is he celebrating for?

633
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,160
I don’t know.

634
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,090
There you go.

635
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,640
Your artistic moment has arrived?

636
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,680
Just do your work.

637
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,450
I’m doing it.

638
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,360
What’s up, Tan?

639
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,900
(We’re partying tonight at Peem’s place.)

640
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,280
(Deal.)

641
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,400
Hey, hang on.

642
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,500
(I’ll hang up.)

643
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,440
(I’ll call Pun.)

644
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,750
Hey.

645
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,360
Don’t.

646
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,520
(Huh? Why?)

647
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,160
Come on.

648
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,320
I said, don’t.

649
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,720
I’ll ask him myself.

650
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,090
(Fine.)

651
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,880
Bye.

652
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,160
He’s sleeping like a log.

653
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
You woke up already?

654
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,140
Darn it, Chain.

655
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,670
Give me some tissues.

656
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,480
I’m so lazy.

657
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,560
Peem.

658
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,410
Q.

659
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,100
Where are you guys going?

660
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,470
How about getting something to eat?

661
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,360
I’m hungry.

662
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,470
You're trying to get Peem to pay for you again?

663
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,830
We’re heading home.

664
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,199
We’re drinking with Tan later.

665
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,889
Oh, I see.

666
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,070
Where is Matt?

667
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,830
Matt?

668
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,190
He went home already.

669
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,170
Do you want to have dinner at my place?

670
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,210
Sure.

671
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,570
I want to eat Auntie Pui’s dishes.

672
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,800
She’s not home.

673
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,929
Eat what I cook then.

674
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,690
No, thanks.

675
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,880
I’ll pass.

676
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,920
I don’t want that.

677
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,790
You don’t?

678
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,429
I don’t.

679
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,409
Cook for us then.

680
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:39,989
Why?

681
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,860
What?

682
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,400
You don’t want to eat what I cook,

683
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,380
so you must cook it yourself.

684
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,230
What?

685
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,110
Let’s go.

686
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,480
It’s time to try Chef Q’s dishes.

687
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,460
Chef Q.

688
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,500
Chef Q.

689
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,510
Chef Q.

690
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,850
It’s not happening.

691
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,450
Hi there, Peem.

692
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,660
What’s up?

693
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,990
It took you ages.

694
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,800
- Heavy traffic.
- 	Hey, Tan!

695
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,490
I missed you a lot.

696
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,830
Come take your seat already.

697
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,360
Stop it.

698
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,710
Toey, how come you’re joining us?

699
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,050
I met him while we were heading here,

700
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,890
so I invited him.

701
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,280
So you carried him with you?

702
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,890
Yeah.

703
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,440
It was like carrying a puppy.

704
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,600
What are we talking about?

705
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,480
Tan, why are we celebrating?

706
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,770
Wow.

707
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,260
Look at your snack.

708
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,430
Can I have some?

709
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,640
No way.

710
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,190
Please.

711
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,650
You can’t.

712
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,100
I’m possessive of it.

713
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,660
I’m not sharing.

714
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,580
Buy it with your own money.

715
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,600
Aw, come on.

716
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,280
Whoa.

717
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,740
But it looks mouthwatering.

718
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,370
Can I try some, Tan?

719
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:39,930
Oho.

720
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,930
Look at those puppy dog eyes

721
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,120
and a sweet smile, also.

722
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,130
I can’t resist his adorable mode here.

723
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,310
But I’ll just give you one.

724
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,360
Tan, how kind you are.

725
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,350
Absolutely.

726
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,540
But I’m kind to you only.

727
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,490
What?

728
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,390
You won’t give me even one.

729
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,070
You’re all grown up.

730
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:56,810
Thank you.

731
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,570
- Give me one.
- Nope.

732
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,270
- Please.
- 	No way.

733
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:58,720
One for me.

734
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,500
No.

735
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,240
Just one bite will do.

736
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,440
Stop it.

737
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,300
Stop.

738
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,140
You guys are spoiling Toey too much.

739
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,000
You’re making Q and I irrelevant now.

740
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,080
How could I resist?

741
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,010
Look at those puppy dog eyes.

742
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,510
Come on.

743
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,260
Why are you laughing?

744
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,200
Doctor, what’s funny?

745
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,810
Why are you laughing?

746
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,910
Don’t laugh.

747
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,060
You’re spoiling him, too.

748
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,210
Q, can you resist Toey’s cute puppy mode?

749
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,380
I can’t resist kicking him, obviously.

750
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,200
Oops.

751
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:18,960
How harsh.

752
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,930
By the way,

753
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,090
you said you’d discuss something important.

754
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,820
What is it?

755
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,970
I want to let you guys know that

756
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,540
I have a crush on someone already.

757
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,400
But I’ll tell you who that person is

758
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,550
and so on

759
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,170
as soon as we start dating.

760
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,830
That’s it?

761
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,680
Hey, pay attention to my story, will you?

762
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,760
I’m serious.

763
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,520
That’s it?

764
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,450
You’ve said something similar many times.

765
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,740
But then you broke up two months later.

766
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,300
Oh, my friend.

767
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,140
We’re friends, but you’re saying this to me.

768
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,810
It hurts so bad.

769
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,880
I’m not Chain.

770
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,500
Why are you targeting me?

771
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,620
I’m not a playboy like you.

772
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,340
You are.

773
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:01,890
You are.

774
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,280
Whatever.

775
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,680
This time, things will certainly be different.

776
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,520
I swear

777
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,830
I’ll quit being a playboy.

778
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,730
You swear?

779
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,360
Yes.

780
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,560
If you lie, may lightning strike you.

781
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,940
Sure thing.

782
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,040
If it strikes, we’ll all go down together.

783
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,040
Alright.

784
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,980
I’ll believe you this time.

785
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,970
Amazing friend.

786
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,410
Cheers to

787
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,710
Tan quitting his playboy ways.

788
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,960
Cheers!

789
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:34,160
From now, “bottoms up” is our forbidden phrase.

790
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,340
If anyone utters it again,

791
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,340
may they find themselves in hell.

792
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,380
See you in hell, guys.

793
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,180
Bottoms up.

794
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,750
I’m sleeping.

795
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,320
Bye.

796
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,150
Section 2856.

797
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,100
Anybody who pressures someone into drinking without consent faces fines and imprisonment.

798
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,430
Hey, sleep properly.

799
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,940
Peem, can I use this pillow and blanket?

800
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,110
Sure.

801
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,750
But if it’s not comfy enough,

802
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,270
lean on me, bro.

803
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,310
Toey, come sleep here.

804
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,360
It’s not safe over there.

805
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,360
Why?

806
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,280
He’s drunk.

807
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,340
He’ll keep moving around.

808
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,600
Do you want to get shoved off?

809
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,460
Move.

810
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:21,760
Ouch.

811
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,700
Move.

812
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,340
What’s with you, Q?

813
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,080
Thank you.

814
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,020
But in the end!

815
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,360
Look at him.

816
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,400
In the end, he’s knocked out.

817
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,010
Ouch.

818
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,180
Ouch.

819
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,440
My ear.

820
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,660
Hey? What?

821
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,250
Nothing’s going on?

822
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,600
I’m going back to sleep.

823
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,360
Right.

824
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,670
When the work is completely done,

825
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,990
I really can understand it better than from your sketch.

826
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,020
Peem, your coloring has improved,

827
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,340
and so has your interpretation.

828
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,110
Yes.

829
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,110
Keep it up.

830
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,930
One more thing,

831
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,930
don’t pressure yourself too much.

832
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,780
I’ll try.

833
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,200
That’s it.

834
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,830
Thank you, Prof.

835
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,310
No problem.

836
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:52,990
How did it go?

837
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,370
What did he say?

838
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,760
Good.

839
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,350
His feedback this time is better than that for my sketch.

840
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,890
You can head back first.

841
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,520
It might take me a while longer here.

842
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,730
I can wait.

843
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,930
You can wait?

844
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,350
You’re good at waiting, huh?

845
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,630
Fine. I won’t wait anymore.

846
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,170
What brings you here?

847
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,170
You’re heading home, right?

848
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,010
I’ll give you a ride.

849
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:38,840
No.

850
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,270
I can go back myself.

851
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,110
You told me you’d do whatever I said, didn’t you?

852
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,400
It’s my order.

853
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,460
You must come with me.

854
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,080
Why?

855
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,730
You’re heading that way again?

856
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:54,960
Get in.

857
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,390
Hey.

858
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,020
Pull over at that store.

859
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,070
Why?

860
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,260
We aren’t there yet.

861
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,670
I’m hungry.

862
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,650
I want to eat something.

863
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,420
Why are you coming?

864
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,980
You’re eating, aren’t you?

865
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,540
I’m eating too.

866
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,070
You’ve never eaten at this kind of store, right?

867
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,460
Here’s your water.

868
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,510
What can I get for you?

869
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,190
I’ll have one spicy dry egg noodles, please.

870
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,820
Do you still have some crispy pork?

871
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:35,620
Yes, we do.

872
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,780
May I add some crispy pork and wontons too?

873
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,880
Sure.

874
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,410
How about you?

875
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:39,960
Your order?

876
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,540
I’ll have the same as you.

877
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,270
Huh?

878
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,950
The same thing.

879
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,190
You don’t know how to order here, do you?

880
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,730
One more of that, please.

881
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,300
Sure.

882
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,290
Give me a second.

883
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,130
Thank you.

884
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:58,820
Why?

885
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,170
You’ve never eaten egg noodles with wontons before?

886
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,820
I have,

887
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,060
but not at this kind of spot.

888
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,580
Here you are.

889
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,620
Thank you.

890
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,060
There’s no menu,

891
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,240
so I don’t know what to order.

892
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,420
I’ll spice it up for you.

893
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,720
Don’t.

894
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,030
I can do it myself.

895
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,020
Are you sure?

896
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,850
Delicious?

897
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,580
It’s damn spicy.

898
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,960
It’s spicy.

899
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,180
You can’t eat spicy food?

900
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,910
I’m running out of water.

901
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,860
Are you alright?

902
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,820
I just went a bit overboard with the chili powder.

903
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,750
This store’s ice is super cold, you know.

904
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,560
That’s why.

905
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,300
Are you alright now?

906
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,530
You know what?

907
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:06,970
What?

908
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,170
Your hand tastes salty.

909
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,140
Hey.

910
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,260
Just tolerate the spiciness.

911
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,190
Go ahead. Eat.

912
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,850
Aren’t you going to thank me?

913
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,610
For what?

914
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,450
For giving you a ride home.

915
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,860
You forced me to get in the car.

916
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,100
I didn’t even ask for a ride.

917
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,130
Why would I say thank you?

918
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,340
Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask you.

919
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,860
You dropped me off that night, right?

920
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:02,490
When was that?

921
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,660
I can’t remember it.

922
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,440
Don’t pretend you can’t remember.

923
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,170
Even if I was drunk, I could recall it.

924
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,560
If you could, then why are you asking?

925
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,910
So, it wasn’t a dream that night.

926
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,520
And do you remember

927
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,660
what you said to me that night?

928
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,160
You’ve got a tall nose,

929
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,980
and lovely eyes.

930
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,690
Your mouth is…

931
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,160

933
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,380
Let’s float it together.

934
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,220
Q, come with me to float Krathong.

935
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:41,980
He’s begging you already.

936
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,540
Fine. I’ll go.

937
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,740
Someone like you hangs out at a temple fair?

938
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,420
Hey. What are you playing?

939
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,480
I had so much fun today.

940
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,300
Thanks.
