Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,840
I’ll never forget your kiss,

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,800
so you mustn’t forget mine either.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,610
From now on, whenever you drink,

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,450
it can never get your heart racing like last night's game did.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:31,960
Why?

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,930
Toey likes Q.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,520
Huh?!

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,340
We need to find someone to flirt with Toey.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,060
Me?

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,200
No way.

15
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,880
If Q really has feelings for Toey,

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,860
he must feel anxious,

17
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,040
or show some reactions.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,670
Toey and I will take photos over there, then.

19
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,970
Sure.

20
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,310
See you later.

21
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,510
Chain, it looks beautiful here.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,840
Snap some pictures for me.

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,690
Sure.

24
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:57,750
Here.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,740
Right here.

26
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,760
Got it.

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,270
One, two, three.

28
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,370
One, two, three.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,730
One, two, three.

30
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,670
Hey, Q?

31
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,000
You aren’t drawing?

32
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,280
It’s hot over there,

33
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,390
so I moved.

34
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,250
Is that so?

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,230
Nice.

36
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,650
Can you take some photos for us then?

37
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,910
Oh, right.

38
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,470
We took a selfie, but it didn’t come out well.

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,920
Take some photos for us.

40
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,450
Q, please.

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,400
Hand it over.

42
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,080
Come.

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,160
Like this, okay?

44
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,600
I know already.

45
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,380
Okay. Let’s do it.

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,009
Lean on me.

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,970
Lean.

48
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,690
I’m trying to look as natural as possible.

49
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,090
Count.

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,880
Count for us.

51
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,940
One, two.

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,840
Does it look alright?

53
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,710
I’m snapping nonstop.

54
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,440
Enough already, huh?

55
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,130
We need 2 more.

56
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,160
Hey, I already took a lot.

57
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,240
Take it back.

58
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,550
You guys are wasting my time.

59
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,810
What got you mad, huh?

60
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,150
He’s leaving.

61
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,150
See? How was my plan?

62
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,770
Simple.

63
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,600
So, how did it turn out?

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,690
Relax, man.

65
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,860
Wait for Peem.

66
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,460
I want to know now.

67
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,390
Peem is here.

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,350
Hey, hurry up.

69
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,340
Give me a second, okay?

70
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,360
You guys ordered some drinks, didn’t you?

71
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,880
I’m dying to hear the story.

72
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,840
You want to know, right?

73
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,450
Yep.

74
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
I put my arm around Toey’s neck like this.

75
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,010
Q gawked at me.

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,840
He did?

77
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,370
Yeah.

78
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,530
He looked like he wanted to strangle me.

79
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,740
He gawked at me like this.

80
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,380
Damn.

81
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,100
And when I stared at him like this…

82
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,120
Then what?

83
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,760
Chain.

84
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,700
Chain, what happened next?

85
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,570
What happened after that?

86
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,380
Chain.

87
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,730
Chain!

88
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,240
Nothing much.

89
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,340
That’s all.

90
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,600
Come on.

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,450
I was on the edge of my seat.

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,660
But as I said,

93
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,930
Q doesn’t speak his mind.

94
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,230
Not at all?

95
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,130
I saw this coming.

96
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,750
So, I’ve got the next step planned.

97
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,590
You do?

98
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,230
Yep.

99
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,230
But you looked clueless a second ago.

100
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,790
That’s because I already planned it ahead.

101
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,600
You did?

102
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,190
Yep.

103
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,280
Get ready to act, guys.

104
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,120
You’re giving me a headache.

105
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,020
You can do it.

106
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,850
DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

107
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,710
Alright.

108
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,520
I’ll give it a shot.

109
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,210
But I don’t think Phum is coming.

110
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,140
I’m hanging up.

111
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,080
See you later.

112
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,050
Who called?

113
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,520
Tan.

114
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,159
He invited me to the amusement park.

115
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,140
Do you want to come along?

116
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,060
Nope.

117
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,900
You know it’s not my scene.

118
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,610
Tan asked me to invite you guys, too.

119
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,430
Count me in.

120
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,890
I’m free this semester break.

121
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,730
I’ve played games with Mick all day.

122
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,820
It gets me super bored.

123
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,500
What?

124
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,140
I’m going with you guys then.

125
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,680
Playing games at the amusement park is cool, you know.

126
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,150
Phum, join us.

127
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,940
Let’s go.

128
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,600
Nope.

129
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,230
I’m not going.

130
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,150
Come on.

131
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,160
Why not?

132
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,410
I’ll be so lonely there.

133
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,780
Mick, don’t worry. You won’t feel lonely.

134
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,540
Tan’s friends are all going.

135
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,140
Fair enough.

136
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,090
Alright. I’ll tag along.

137
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,100
Why the heck are you looking at me?

138
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,130
When is Tan getting here?

139
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,100
I’m curious too.

140
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,110
It’s taking him forever.

141
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,040
Should we call him?

142
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,570
Fang, call him.

143
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,750
He’s arriving soon.

144
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,460
Fang!

145
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,409
Come on. I missed you.

146
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,050
Eh? You’re joining us too?

147
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,650
Yep.

148
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,550
I was afraid Mick would feel lonely.

149
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,660
Me?

150
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,680
Of course.

151
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,220
Let’s get moving, guys.

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,450
Don’t keep them waiting.

153
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,040
Yeah. You’re right.

154
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,680
Let’s go.

155
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,480
Fang, let’s go.

156
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,620
I thought you wouldn’t come if I didn’t come, you know.

157
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,550
Why the sudden amusement park trip?

158
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,630
To feel like kids again, you know.

159
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,470
It’s been ages since we hung out like this.

160
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,860
Toey wanted to come,

161
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,810
and someone here is clearly spoiling him.

162
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,340
Well, you’re the kindest one ever, Chain.

163
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,490
If you want to come, I can always accompany you.

164
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,190
It’s not a big deal at all.

165
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,940
Meet my friends.

166
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,890
Guys, I’m here.

167
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,490
I’m sorry I’m a bit late.

168
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,570
We’ve just got here too.

169
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,570
I haven’t hung out with this many friends in ages.

170
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,490
Comrade Mick, it looks fun, doesn’t it?

171
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,080
Definitely.

172
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,120
I’m slipping.

173
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,110
Your ticket.

174
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,990
Thank you.

175
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,940
For you.

176
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,600
I’m heading in.

177
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,950
I must be the last one or what?

178
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,440
Well, let’s get moving.

179
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,650
Let’s go.

180
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,330
Let’s go.

181
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,620
Let’s go.

182
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,800
I’ll show you around.

183
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,100
They’re adorable together, aren’t they?

184
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,309
Wow.

185
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,280
Chain, this one is cute.

186
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,289
Do you want to try it on?

187
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
I think it’s cute.

188
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,660
To make you see everything more clearly, bro.

189
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,960
Here you go.

190
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,920
Wow.

191
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,140
You’re such a handsome angel.

192
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,340
What are you doing?

193
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,040
Hold still.

194
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,130
I think it suits you well.

195
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,900
Do you think there’s something between them?

196
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,040
Don’t you see something strange?

197
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,960
Let me help.

198
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,760
I see something strange.

199
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,750
Between those two, right?

200
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,350
Strange.

201
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,240
I mean, you’re strange.

202
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,760
What the hell is wrong with you?

203
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,730
Why did you make me wear these sunglasses, huh?

204
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,920
I want to ride this one.

205
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,850
Who’s in?

206
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,770
This ride?

207
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,600
Toey, you’re choosing the most thrilling one first?

208
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,680
Count me in.

209
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,360
I think it’s too intense for me.

210
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,480
I’ll skip.

211
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,130
Matt.

212
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,930
Come on.

213
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,810
Pun and I are also skipping.

214
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,250
What?

215
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,570
These two besties are giving up already.

216
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,320
So, who else is playing?

217
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:39,800
Q?

218
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,580
Yeah.

219
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,060
I’m in.

220
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,830
Cool.

221
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,880
Let’s queue up now.

222
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,250
Let’s go.

223
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,060
Chain, hurry up.

224
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,020
Let’s sit in the last row.

225
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,070
I think I can’t do it.

226
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,470
Beer, let’s go.

227
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,800
You’re scared, aren’t you?

228
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,460
Who are you talking about?

229
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,780
If you’re scared, just skip it.

230
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,810
Someone like me walks the walks.

231
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,360
I’ll show you.

232
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,490
Chain.

233
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,130
Should we ride it one more time?

234
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,740
Chain.

235
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,320
Chain.

236
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,920
Chain.

237
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,560
Chain.

238
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,360
Enough.

239
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,200
Let’s ride again.

240
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,650
Hurry up.

241
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,340
Chain.

242
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,960
How do I unfasten it?

243
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,290
Let go already.

244
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,330
What an amazing vibe.

245
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,550
Chain.

246
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,280
Are you alright?

247
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,440
You shouldn’t have brought me to ride this.

248
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,940
Are you alright?

249
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,920
I’m okay.

250
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,350
You weren’t scared at all?

251
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,470
Uh-huh.

252
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,600
Did you secretly close your eyes?

253
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,440
Come.

254
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,050
- Let’s ride this one.
- I don’t want to.

255
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,780
Come.

256
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,200
Do I really need to?

257
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,600
It won’t take long.

258
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,370
Easy one.

259
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,520
Let’s go with that one.

260
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,360
That one is still available, Q.

261
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,550
I’m not riding it.

262
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,160
I’m buying a drink.

263
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,670
I don’t want to ride it anymore.

264
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,600
It’s not scary at all.

265
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,080
It’s moving so fast.

266
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,090
What are they doing?

267
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,680
Whoa.

268
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,780
Guys, let’s ride that one.

269
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,680
Well, that one?

270
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,110
Chain, hurry up.

271
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,740
Let’s sit in the front row this time.

272
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,760
Chain, go.

273
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
I’m going too.

274
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,320
I’m going to the restroom.

275
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,410
Go already.

276
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,430
I have a stomachache.

277
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,440
I’m going to the restroom.

278
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,120
Fang, take me to the restroom.

279
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,520
Are you riding or not?

280
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,320
Fine. I’ll go.

281
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,660
Fine. Let’s skip this one.

282
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,810
Let’s find something to drink.

283
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,320
That sounds like a good idea.

284
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,860
Let’s go.

285
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,180
Or do you want to try?

286
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,400
It was super fun, Chain.

287
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,400
It was.

288
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,280
Did you enjoy it?

289
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,100
Nice.

290
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,570
Chain, I want to ride it again.

291
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,250
Huh?

292
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,960
Toey, I really can’t.

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,190
If I go again,

294
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
I’m sure I’ll die.

295
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,030
Oh, really?

296
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,080
Tough it out.

297
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,610
Q is watching you guys.

298
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,920
I’m about to pass out already.

299
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,210
How can I continue?

300
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,180
Please, Chain.

301
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,920
One last time, okay?

302
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,400
Just one more.

303
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,370
Please.

304
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,120
Just once.

305
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,300
How self-centered you are.

306
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,770
Me? Self-centered?

307
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,520
I’m being like this with Chain only.

308
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,820
You have nothing to do with this, Q.

309
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,320
What?

310
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,320
You want to ride it, don’t you?

311
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:23,770
Come ride with me then.

312
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,480
Q.

313
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,590
This is freaking bussin’.

314
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,530
Babe, do you want to eat anything else?

315
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,330
I’ll buy it for you.

316
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,210
Nope.

317
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,050
Tan.

318
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:48,920
Come here.

319
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,680
What did you just say?

320
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,450
Nothing.

321
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,400
I didn’t.

322
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,460
Tan, you’re already dating Fang?

323
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,670
You’re hitting on Fang?

324
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,400
Right.

325
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,940
We’re already dating.

326
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,610
Phum, you knew?

327
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,260
Of course.

328
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,520
Fang’s my brother.

329
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,420
How could I not know?

330
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,600
Why didn’t you tell us?

331
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,600
Well, I wanted to,

332
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,190
but I didn’t know how to start.

333
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,930
I didn’t mean to hide it from you guys.

334
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,570
Come on.

335
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,320
It’s too late now.

336
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,040
I’m not listening to you anymore.

337
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,190
It’s too late.

338
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,890
Tan.

339
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,630
So, he’s the person you said you’d be serious about?

340
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,990
Yes.

341
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,600
But I really didn’t mean to hide it from you all.

342
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,890
It’s just that I couldn’t find the right time to say it.

343
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,550
We’re this close.

344
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,650
You didn’t even let us know?

345
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,230
Come on.

346
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,260
I didn’t mean it.

347
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,330
Fang, I’m sorry.

348
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,960
It slipped out.

349
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,810
Are you angry?

350
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,350
You aren’t?

351
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,720
Babe, you’re such a cutie.

352
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,550
You aren’t telling me off.

353
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,330
You aren’t mad, either.

354
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,390
How cute you are.

355
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,230
Well, you’re taken now.

356
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,750
Who will spoil me with snacks then?

357
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,840
Get them yourself.

358
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,790
You’re grown up already.

359
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,640
I thought you’re worried about my friend dating.

360
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,370
But you’re just worried about eating, huh?

361
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,510
What’s wrong, Matt?

362
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,810
I have a sore throat.

363
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,650
But I’m fine without you, Tan.

364
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,970
I have Chain to take care of me.

365
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,200
(Me?)

366
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,090
Right?

367
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,690
Yeah.

368
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,150
I’ll take care of you, Toey.

369
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,870
Don’t worry at all.

370
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,869
I’ll buy you everything you want.

371
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,589
Let me know what you want.

372
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,040
Sure thing.

373
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,420
Well, I’m full now.

374
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,640
Let’s hit more rides.

375
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,440
Hang on.

376
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,460
I’m still eating.

377
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,619
Can I continue?

378
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,540
You aren’t full yet?

379
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,890
Fine. We’ll wait.

380
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,840
Hurry up.

381
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,600
We’re waiting for you to finish it.

382
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,360
Fang, which ride should we hit next?

383
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,340
Guys, which one are we going for?

384
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Which one?

385
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,870
Don’t worry.

386
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,520
Let’s decide later.

387
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,750
Let’s go.

388
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,550
Let’s go.

389
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,250
Chain, let’s chat for a second.

390
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,340
You guys can go first.

391
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,680
So, what’s between Toey and you?

392
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
What do you mean?

393
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,820
You like Toey?

394
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,320
I’m hitting on him.

395
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,990
I’m busy,

396
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,000
so I haven’t told you yet.

397
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,690
Why Toey?

398
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,750
Have you thought this through?

399
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,770
Are you sure?

400
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,720
If you’re doing this just for fun,

401
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,560
I think you should stop.

402
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,950
I like him, seriously.

403
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,760
Do I need more reasons for that?

404
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,640
You’re just his mentor.

405
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,290
Why are you stopping me?

406
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,680
I’m just worried things will get awkward between you two.

407
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,310
It could mess up your brotherhood, you know.

408
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,230
Don’t worry.

409
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,850
I’m really into him.

410
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,610
Let’s go.

411
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,750
Hey, what was that talk with Q about?

412
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,230
About Toey.

413
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,850
Pun, I think your plan is working.

414
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,460
I bet soon enough,

415
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,600
Q will open up about his feelings.

416
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,500
Anyone up for the haunted house?

417
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:15,970
Huh?

418
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,010
No.

419
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,300
Strange.

420
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,240
Something about that seller creeps me out.

421
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,840
Chain.

422
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,360
Let’s check it out.

423
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,370
Hey, I really can’t with this one.

424
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,370
I’m really scared.

425
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,890
It’s fine if you can’t.

426
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,930
Q, how about you take him in?

427
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,120
Q, can you do that for me?

428
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,080
Q, go.

429
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,840
He’s right.

430
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,480
Why me?

431
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,390
I also wonder.

432
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,850
I don’t want to go with you either.

433
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,710
What’s wrong with coming with me?

434
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,360
Come.

435
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,890
What? Q!

436
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,050
He doesn’t speak his mind, does he?

437
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,900
How sweet.

438
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,850
I think we’ll complete our mission more easily than expected.

439
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,040
What mission?

440
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,570
Q, why are you pulling me along?

441
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,560
It hurts.

442
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:09,760
It’s not that scary.

443
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,490
Why are you scared, huh?

444
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,930
Let’s get moving.

445
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,680
If you’re scared, just hold my hand.

446
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,760
You don’t need to act tough.

447
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,200
I didn’t even want to come in here with you.

448
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,560
Why did you stop?

449
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,760
How do you feel about Chain?

450
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:47,960
Huh?

451
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,800
What’s happening between you two?

452
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,880
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

453
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,690
You have feelings for him?

454
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,280
You like him?

455
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,050
Well,

456
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,240
Chain is nice to me.

457
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,870
Do you realize he’s hitting on you?

458
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,710
Well…

459
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,830
What if I hit on you too?

460
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,710
Huh?

461
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,760
Q, what are you doing?

462
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,360
Can I kiss you?

463
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,530
So, what’s your plan, Pun?

464
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,680
Well, it’s…

465
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,120
Let’s talk later.

466
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,460
What’s taking them so long?

467
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,580
Is it that hard to find an exit?

468
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,350
I’m curious too.

469
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,330
It’s taking them so long.

470
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,390
Hey, they’re here.

471
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,570
What’s our next ride?

472
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,340
We’re fine with any.

473
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,320
Let Toey pick.

474
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,640
Which one do you want to ride?

475
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,150
I want to go home already.

476
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:09,870
Eh?

477
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,190
No more rides?

478
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,240
I don’t want to.

479
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,620
Eh?

480
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,270
Should we head back now?

481
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,300
Yeah.

482
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,910
I guess all the attractions are already closed for today.

483
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,000
It’s pretty late also.

484
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,640
Let’s head back.

485
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,100
Has something gotten into him?

486
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,690
Let’s go.

487
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,570
What a nice day today.

488
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,720
It’s my first time hanging out with this many friends.

489
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,040
I had so much fun.

490
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,500
Join us again next time.

491
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,720
You said that yourself.

492
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,720
Let’s go.

493
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,370
It’s semester break,

494
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,490
but you’re still here.

495
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,310
So are you.

496
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,870
Do we even have a semester break, though?

497
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:09,920
True.

498
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,920
The new semester is starting soon.

499
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,640
This is for your friend.

500
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,350
Thanks a lot.

501
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,930
My pleasure.

502
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,380
By the way,

503
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,990
is he really your friend?

504
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,680
Or is he more than a friend?

505
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,360
Is he just your friend?

506
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,890
Hey.

507
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,120
What if it strikes my face?

508
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,030
I came all the way here to give it to you.

509
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,640
I’m heading back.

510
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,470
See you.

511
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,860
(Hey, are you home?)

512
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,840
(Yep.)

513
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,950
(What’s up?)

514
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,000
I’m dropping by.

515
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,620
Huh?

516
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,330
(Come on.)

517
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,050
What’s up?

518
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,120
I’m heading back.

519
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,030
Hang on.

520
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,190
[Phum, a rascal.]

521
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,960
It seems our plan is on track.

522
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,010
I’m sure

523
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
something happened inside the haunted house.

524
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,720
So what’s next?

525
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,920
Do I have to continue hitting on Toey?

526
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,950
I think we must adjust our plan.

527
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,000
We need to figure out how far Toey's gone.

528
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,480
I have no idea how far he has gone,

529
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,270
but what I know for sure is

530
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,620
after he came back from the haunted house,

531
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,250
Toey has been zoning out.

532
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,750
Exactly.

533
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,310
The new semester is starting soon.

534
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,540
Peem, keep an eye on him for me.

535
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,440
Sure.

536
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,280
You can trust me.

537
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Well, let’s toast for a good start.

538
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,360
Yeah.

539
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,140
Cheers.

540
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,890
Pun, you’re watching too many dramas.

541
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,390
What?

542
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,450
Here’s to a good start.

543
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,940
Alright.

544
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,700
Why did the semester break fly so fast?

545
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,700
I’m back to burning the midnight oil again.

546
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,460
I haven’t slept enough.

547
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,260
Me neither.

548
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,770
I also have to see Q around again.

549
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,720
I’m so sick of him.

550
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,380
Why did you freaking follow me into painting major, huh?

551
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,630
I didn’t.

552
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,730
I liked it from the start.

553
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,880
You’re the one tagging along.

554
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,140
Then, you must stand seeing me around for a long time.

555
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,160
Hello, everyone.

556
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,360
Time has flown so fast that it’s your third year already.

557
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,320
In this academic year,

558
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,890
we’ll stick around for a long time.

559
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,080
Please do your best

560
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,880
and put your all into this semester.

561
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,030
Let’s start this first lesson

562
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,960
with an assignment.

563
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,810
Huh?

564
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,000
Seriously?

565
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,120
There’s no orientation like we did last year?

566
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,750
We don’t need that.

567
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,490
We’ve talked a lot already.

568
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,610
Peem.

569
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,470
Toey.

570
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,360
Heading to class?

571
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,750
Well, I’m off to class.

572
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,120
See you tonight, Peem.

573
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,310
Tell me what happened in the haunted house.

574
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,600
After you went inside with Toey,

575
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,890
he has been acting weird.

576
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,130
What happened?

577
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,050
Nothing.

578
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,460
Maybe he got spooked.

579
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,800
By the way, where are you going tonight?

580
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,670
My house, as usual.

581
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,530
Do you want to join?

582
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,060
Strange.

583
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,230
Why are you guys meeting up often these days?

584
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,490
It’s usual.

585
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,260
But tonight’s party is Chain’s idea.

586
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,650
I guess he wants Toey to join.

587
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,880
Count me in.

588
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,380
It’s our third year already.

589
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,080
I’m turning into a new person this year.

590
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,300
No more procrastination.

591
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,330
You said the same thing last year.

592
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,930
In the end, you burned the midnight oil every time.

593
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,960
Do you think other majors are swamped with assignments like us?

594
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,470
[Please keep the area clean.]
[Model cutting on the table isn’t allowed.]
- The professor assigned a freaking tough assignment at the start of the semester.

595
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,340
Oh, the heart is broken.

596
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,920
It’s alright.

597
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,090
I can form a new one.

598
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,640
My heart.

599
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,810
Here you go.

600
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,270
Thank you.

601
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,820
You’ve got a boyfriend already.

602
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,110
Why did you ask your brother to do this?

603
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,590
I have to stay here and support him, you know.

604
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,520
You’re talking nonsense.

605
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:06,880
Move.

606
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,580
I’ll sit here with you.

607
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,830
You’re always interrupting our romantic moments.

608
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,400
You ruined my heart.

609
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,430
Form a new one for me.

610
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,720
Tan hearts Khaofang.

611
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,280
[What are you doing?]

612
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,000
[Why did you ask?]

613
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,380
[I’m at the Architecture Faculty.]

614
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,290
[Come see me here.]

615
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,700
[Huh?]

616
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,850
[I have something to talk to you about.]

617
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,010
Hey, I’m leaving.

618
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,520
Where are you going?

619
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,400
[Just arrived.]

620
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,270
[I’m at the drink store now.]

621
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,990
Shit. You didn't wait for me.

622
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,620
I’m sorry.

623
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,610
I thought you were my friend.

624
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,530
You two look alike from behind.

625
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,470
I’m sorry.

626
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,350
It’s alright.

627
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,570
Pay for the drink then

628
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,510
to make up for it.

629
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,600
Or are you broke?

630
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,130
I’ve got some.

631
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,320
I’ll pay for you.

632
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,900
Well, he’ll cover mine.

633
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,870
Why did you ask me to come here?

634
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,190
I want to drink some coffee at your place.

635
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:27,720
Huh?

636
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,610
Should we go now?

637
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,430
Auntie.

638
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,420
You're back already?

639
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,330
Class ended early today.

640
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,440
Hello, Auntie Pui.

641
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,490
Oh, Phum is here with you.

642
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,820
I’ll make some coffee for you.

643
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,010
Peem will make it for me.

644
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
Peem will make coffee for Phum?

645
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,350
I see.

646
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,210
Sure.

647
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,260
I haven’t turned off the machine.

648
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:00,980
Go ahead.

649
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,070
Alright.

650
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:04,720
Yeah.

651
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,170
I haven’t had a chance to try Peem’s coffee yet, you know.

652
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,490
Decide what you want to drink.

653
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,580
Think about it.

654
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,890
Cappuccino?

655
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
Espresso?

656
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,190
Or Arabika?

657
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,550
Robusta?

658
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,550
Peem, make the best one you can.

659
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,760
You’re so good at acting, huh?

660
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,070
When my aunt is around,

661
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,550
you’re talking in a high-pitched and sweet tone.

662
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,640
What do you want?

663
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,320
Make some latte art for me.

664
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,040
I can’t do it.

665
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,050
What?

666
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,050
You’re an art major, aren’t you?

667
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,470
Eh?

668
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,330
Just because I’m studying art doesn’t mean I can draw on coffee.

669
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,630
What?

670
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,660
You want a latte, then?

671
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,060
My usual is Americano.

672
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,990
If you drink Americano now,

673
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,040
I bet you can’t sleep.

674
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,010
Let’s go with a latte, then.

675
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,750
I don’t like it sweet.

676
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,300
Just to let you know.

677
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,370
You’re picky.

678
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,800
So, this is your aunt’s shop, right?

679
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,679
Yep.

680
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,360
My aunt likes making coffee.

681
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,909
That’s why she opened her own coffee shop.

682
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,830
But she usually doesn’t monitor it herself.

683
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,199
She lets her staff handle things.

684
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,560
Sometimes, when she’s free or after she finishes her tutoring class,

685
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,760
she will jump in.

686
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,389
I actually want to help her,

687
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,870
but since I have to meet deadlines

688
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,480
and handle other things,

689
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,590
I’m left with not enough time already.

690
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,060
Are you sure you can do it?

691
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,540
Will you drink it or not?

692
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,260
I don’t like it sweet, okay?

693
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,429
You mean, 100% sweet?

694
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,760
Not sweet.

695
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,290
150%?

696
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,550
Minus 150.

697
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,980
It looks alright, though.

698
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,760
Try it.

699
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,860
It won’t be salty like the food you cooked, right?

700
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,970
Just don’t drink it then.

701
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,960
I’ll drink it.

702
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,280
I’m just kidding.

703
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,710
Why are you looking at me?

704
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,930
You’re acting strange.

705
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,560
I’m not.

706
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,760
I’m not looking at you.

707
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,920
Drink it up quickly

708
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,680
and head home already.

709
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,780
My friends are coming over.

710
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,780
I don’t want them to know about our deal.

711
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,580
But I’m your customer.

712
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,340
How could you chase me away like this?

713
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,020
When your friends show up,

714
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,640
just tell them I’m here for a coffee.

715
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,900
That won’t sound strange.

716
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,690
It will.

717
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,650
Our shop is already closed.

718
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,250
Alright then.

719
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,580
Tell them I’m your special customer.

720
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,100
You’re special?

721
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,300
Am I not special to you?

722
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,980
What are you talking about?

723
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:01,840
How am I not special to you?

724
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,370
Be prepared for that.

725
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,630
Phum.

726
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,990
You’re here, too?

727
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,000
Huh?

728
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,580
Huh?

729
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,560
So?

730
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,290
That’s nice.

731
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,470
I think you can help us prepare our plan.

732
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,400
What plan?

733
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,070
So, you guys brought us to the amusement park because of this?

734
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,340
I knew it.

735
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,340
You seemed strange since you came out of the haunted house.

736
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,450
I bet something happened.

737
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,210
I think I stand a chance.

738
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,360
I agree.

739
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,600
He talked to me also.

740
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,550
If he didn’t feel anything,

741
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,570
he wouldn’t talk to me about it, would he?

742
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,080
True.

743
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:14,780
I’m his friend.

744
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,350
I know.

745
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,090
I can sense it.

746
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,620
When Venus orbits at an obtuse angle

747
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,660
and meets Jupiter at 37 degree,

748
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,900
I’m sure your love will be fulfilled.

749
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,980
Nonsense.

750
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,250
What?

751
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,030
But seriously, Toey,

752
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,040
you stand a chance.

753
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,660
That’s what I believe, too.

754
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,240
Pencil Senior is meant to be with Milk Frappe Boy only.

755
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,240
Shit.

756
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:49,950
Q.

757
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,360
(We’re screwed.)

758
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,710
You knew all along, right?

759
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,740
Q, listen to me first.

760
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,240
And it’s your plan to hide it from me all this time, right?

761
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,260
That’s not true, Q.

762
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,630
Hear me out.

763
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,530
Stop.

764
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,510
Why are you doing this?

765
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,850
Q, listen to me.

766
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,620
Answer me.

767
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,770
Why are you doing this?

768
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,750
Why are you doing this?

769
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:17,870
Answer me, Toey.

770
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,560
What am I to you, huh?!

771
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,160
Hey, hear him out.

772
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,060
Why are you doing this?!

773
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,790
Tell me!

774
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,320
Q, please hear me out.

775
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,020
I won’t!

776
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,580
Tell me!

777
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,390
Answer me!

778
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,120
We’re in trouble now.

779
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,400
I asked what I am to you.

780
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,400
Answer me.

781
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,260
What am I to you?!

782
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,280
Answer me, Toey!

783
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,490
I love you, Q.

784
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,580
I’ve loved you all this time.

785
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,070
Milk Frappe Boy has loved Pencil Senior all this time.

786
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,260
I don’t want to listen to it.

787
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,490
Q, hear me out.

788
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:54,960
Toey.

789
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,140
Q!

790
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:57,830
Q!

791
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,240
Toey.

792
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,200
Go check on him.

793
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,340
I’m losing Q again, right?

794
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,490
Right, Peem?

795
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,050
Let’s go.

796
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,740
Are you alright?

797
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,800
Are you mad at him?

798
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,140
Don’t be.

799
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,510
We’re sorry.

800
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,510
It’s our fault for plotting this whole thing.

801
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,030
Is Toey really that Milk Frappe Boy?

802
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,190
My heart has always been by my side all this time, right?

803
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,490
Did you guys find out about this a long time ago?

804
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,880
Nope.

805
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,060
We did just before the semester break.

806
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,560
I’m sorry.

807
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,160
I know this whole thing is between you and him.

808
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,490
We shouldn’t have been nosy.

809
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,230
But I just want to let you know that

810
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,420
we didn’t mean any harm.

811
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,440
I just meant well to you.

812
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,000
Why?

813
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,400
Why has Toey done this much for me?

814
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,040
I don’t get it.

815
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,010
I think his answer was pretty clear enough.

816
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,150
What about you?

817
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,090
Do you still love Milk Frappe Boy?

818
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,370
Why did you disappear on him?

819
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,740
Back then, I had feelings for someone I never met in person.

820
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,600
It was a bond.

821
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,950
It was a feeling I had never experienced before.

822
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,540
The whole story started with the pencil case

823
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,790
my grandpa gave me before he died.

824
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,810
After that, we started talking through sticky notes.

825
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,290
It felt right.

826
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:59,950
It was a special relationship only both of us knew.

827
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,850
[Nope. I’m afraid mine will be better than yours, hehe.]

828
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,550
We both didn’t know each other.

829
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:05,230
[What faculty do you want to study in?]

830
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,290
We felt comfortable talking.

831
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,880
[I’m not sure. How about you, Pencil Senior?]

832
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,510
We didn’t feel awkward at all.

833
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,540
[Someone like me must study art, of course.]
[Ps. If you don’t want to study medicine, try discussing it with your mom.]
[Have you tried that?!]
[No matter what you do, I’m always rooting for you.]
[Pencil Senior]

834
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,280
[You’ve graduated from high school!]
[Congratulations, Pencil Senior.]
[You did a really great job.]

835
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,840
How about Toey?

836
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,960
We’re talking about Toey,

837
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,510
not Milk Frappe Boy you used to know.

838
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,950
I’m talking about Toey, your mentee.

839
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,360
Toey, who you’re with.

840
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,940
Toey, who loves you.

841
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,190
How do you feel about Toey?

842
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,280
I’ve got a good feeling about him.

843
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,810
He’s a wacky boy.

844
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,940
It’s like he feels no stress in his life.

845
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,580
It seems

846
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,890
there’s something within him that makes me feel good when he’s around.

847
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:03,130
It’s like I’m sitting in a vast grassy field

848
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:09,360
with a gentle breeze under a bright sky.

849
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,040
It’s like I’m watching a masterpiece of art.

850
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,600
Hey.

851
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,510
If you even compare him to a piece of art,

852
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,520
I think this is not normal.

853
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,210
You should clear things up with him.

854
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:32,660
Talk it over.

855
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,260
What’s wrong with you?

856
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,280
Can’t you just sit down?

857
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,750
Q seemed really furious.

858
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,980
Is it because of my plan?

859
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:47,610
Did I cause the argument?

860
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,230
Come on.

861
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,610
I think Q won’t take it seriously.

862
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,540
But he looked really furious.

863
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:53,280
Come on.

864
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,670
I think he just needs some time.

865
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,940
Don’t worry.

866
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,750
If it’s a fault, we all played a part in this.

867
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,970
Here he comes.

868
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,190
You guys are sleeping over tonight, right?

869
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,210
Yeah.

870
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,150
What an amazing idea, Peem.

871
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,660
Let’s sleep here tonight.

872
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,410
Okay?

873
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,510
So, we can have lovey-dovey, adorable moments together

874
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,850
like we had in school.

875
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:16,690
Right?

876
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,600
- Good idea.
- 	Am I right?

877
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,480
Say yes.

878
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,180
I freaking miss our gang of 5 guardian angels.

879
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:22,980
Okay?

880
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:23,660
Am I right?

881
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,980
Make him take a shower too.

882
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:25,570
Alright.

883
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,340
Smile.

884
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,060
Smile.

885
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,430
You’re smiling already.

886
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:30,030
Let’s go.

887
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,490
I’m already grown up.

888
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,180
I can take a shower by myself.

889
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,300
Tan, scrub his body.

890
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,160
I will clean his butt for him.

891
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,280
I will scrub your back then.

892
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,430
Q, take a shower.

893
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,170
I won’t.

894
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,750
Take a shower.

895
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,590
Hey.

896
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:51,760
I won’t.

897
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:52,750
If he won’t shower,

898
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:53,780
then let’s all sleep as we are.

899
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,240
Go ahead.

900
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:54,840
Lie down.

901
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,760
Come on, guys.

902
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,870
- Dirty.
- 	Move over.

903
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,270
Q, move.

904
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,160
Others are sleeping too.

905
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,720
I can’t sleep.

906
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,000
Peem, when will you buy a new bed?

907
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,000
Why should I?

908
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,120
I sleep alone.

909
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,790
It’s big enough already.

910
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:09,560
Let me sleep here.

911
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,810
How could we all fit in one bed in the past?

912
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,830
Look at your body size now.

913
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:17,570
You’re as big as a buffalo now.

914
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,100
You were this tiny in grade 7.

915
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,220
Hey, what’s that?

916
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,670
Don’t.

917
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,560
I want to lean on it.

918
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,320
You can’t.

919
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,360
Come on, Peem.

920
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,020
Why are you possessive of it?

921
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,010
It’s just a buffalo doll.

922
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,390
Should I smack you with it?

923
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,330
Bring it on.

924
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:33,390
Don’t.

925
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,130
I don’t have a blanket yet.

926
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,680
Just sleep.

927
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,990
Give me a blanket.

928
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,030
Ask Q.

929
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,170
Look at him.

930
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,110
Look at how he’s wrapped up.

931
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,880
Q, share it with me.

932
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,760
I don’t feel comfy at all.

933
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,480
Like this.

934
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,750
You almost hit mine.

935
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,210
You want it this way, huh?

936
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:58,800
Move.

937
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,940
Fine!

938
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,280
Tan!

939
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,510
Q.

940
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,620
I’m heading to class.

941
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,430
Hey, Q.

942
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,280
I think Q doesn’t want to see me anymore.

943
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,090
It’s not like that, Toey.

944
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,330
You just have to give him some time.

945
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,070
Trust me.

946
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:29,640
We’ve got your back.

947
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,640
Q, tell me why you like to come here too.

948
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,310
I once hurt someone’s feelings here.

949
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,700
I hurt that person.

950
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,640
But thinking it over,

951
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,720
I was an asshole, anyway

952
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:08,830
for suddenly disappearing just like that.

953
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,530
Why didn’t you say sorry or try to find him?

954
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,280
I guess he must have forgotten about me

955
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,880
and hated me by now.

956
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,480
Why do you like to assume things on your own?

957
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,350
What?

958
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,280
Everything you said is all in your head, right?

959
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,210
You don’t even know how that person feels.

960
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,280
You just ran away.

961
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,920
You assumed he must be mad and forget about you.

962
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,220
It’s all in your head.

963
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,460
You’re being pessimistic.

964
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,690
Why not consider he might be waiting for you?

965
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,540
He probably never felt mad at you.

966
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,700
Why don’t you try to explain it?

967
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,370
Or are you afraid of facing him?

968
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,600
For some stories, it’s better to keep them to myself

969
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,240
rather than saying.

970
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,630
Better? For who?

971
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,450
Is it better for you only?

972
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:24,130
What if that person loves you a lot?

973
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,540
How must he be feeling now?

974
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,780
How much he might be hurting?

975
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,770
He’s waiting aimlessly.

976
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,180
He doesn’t even know what he did wrong.

977
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,050
All you said was so right that I can’t argue even a bit.

978
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,460
I should have been braver.

979
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,650
At least, I should have been braver to express how I felt,

980
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,300
letting him know he’s special to me.

981
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,740
He’s my special love.

982
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,190
I should have told him.

983
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,530
Toey, are you still overthinking about Q?

984
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,190
I’m confused.

985
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,370
About what?

986
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,240
I feel glad,

987
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:43,330
knowing that Q had feelings for the boy he talked with through sticky notes.

988
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:49,110
I’m glad to know we were each other’s special someone.

989
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,740
But that isn’t for me.

990
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,640
I’m just his mentee.

991
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,140
I’m just Toey.

992
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,400
Are you overthinking?

993
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:05,900
Q is still mad at me.

994
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,260
He avoided me this morning.

995
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,450
Your class is done, right?

996
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,460
Let’s eat.

997
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,090
Huh?

998
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:40,580
It’s just your mentor inviting you to a meal.

999
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,730
Why are you so surprised?

1000
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:43,580
Come.

1001
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,360
Where are you taking me?

1002
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,480
You have a problem with your memory or what?

1003
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,300
I told you we’re going to eat.

1004
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:00,780
Nope.

1005
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:01,910
I’m talking about…

1006
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,630
About what?

1007
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,480
You’re no longer mad at me, right?

1008
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:11,860
I’m fine.

1009
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,270
You’re fine?

1010
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,010
Well, then…

1011
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,500
We’re going to a volunteer camp!

1012
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:01,300
Huh?

1013
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,710
I already signed us all up.

1014
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:03,120
Huh?

1015
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,480
The professor already approved it.

1016
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,970
I’m the camp president this time.

1017
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,270
Why are you guys joining a camp?

1018
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,100
It’s Pun’s idea.

1019
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,590
He wants Q and Toey to spend time together.

1020
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,590
You want it this way, huh?

1021
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:16,640
I’m going upcountry.

1022
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,400
Can you really survive without me here?

1023
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,890
Is that you or I who can’t survive?

1024
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:22,160
When I said I had fun when I was with you guys,

1025
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,650
I meant it.

1026
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,240
That sounds like a confession to me.
