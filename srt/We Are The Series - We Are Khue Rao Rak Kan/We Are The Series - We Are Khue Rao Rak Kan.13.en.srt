5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,400
[Be my boyfriend.]

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,760
[Yes, Q.]

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,760
I argued with my dad.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,800
Are you free tomorrow?

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,600
I can’t remember the last warm hug I got.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,120
Why are you thinking about that last hug?

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,840
Just focus on the hug you’re getting now.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,840
Peem, you’re back.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,280
How was your trip to the beach?

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,800
Did you have a good time?

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,920
Yeah, I did.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,720
I got to relax.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,120
If you’re happy, I’m happy too.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,160
But your dad called the other day

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,600
and said he missed you.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,040
Won’t you go visit him?

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,480
I’m planning to.

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,200
I’ll make time to visit and travel around, too.

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,680
Do you want to come with me?

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,200
I can’t.

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,080
I have classes to teach.

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,960
How about inviting your friend, Phum?

27
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,640
Huh?

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,400
Take the plane together.

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,440
What?

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,720
Why would I invite him?

31
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,080
I’ll work on my painting.

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,560
I’ll get going.

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,120
I won’t talk to you.

34
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,680
Eh?

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,560
I suggested you go with a friend.

36
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,400
Phum and you are friends.

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,640
If you aren’t friends,

38
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,840
are you two more than friends?

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,480
If not that, what about…?

40
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,480
Auntie.

41
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,200
How lovely teens these days are.

42
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,840
I totally swoon over this.

43
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,320
M..m..more than…?

44
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,080
DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

45
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,280
“Think about it.”

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,080
“You have the money to support your family

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,840
and hire a doctor to cure your dad because of who?”

48
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,840
Auntie Pui, hello.

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,200
Phum, hi.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,160
Are you here to see Peem?

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,680
Yes.

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,400
I’ve seen him draw in his bedroom since last night.

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,720
I don’t know if he has got any sleep or not.

54
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,480
You can see him in his room.

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,560
Please excuse me.

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,000
Sure.

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,000
“Praew suddenly turns around to look at her brother.”

58
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,200
Peem,

59
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,120
I’m coming in.

60
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,320
Since when have you been here?

61
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,760
Quite a while.

62
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,320
Why didn’t you wake me up?

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Aunt Pui told me you stayed up all night painting,

64
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
so I didn’t want to disturb you.

65
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,040
By the way, it wasn't this picture the last time I saw it.

66
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,400
Did you paint a new one?

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,920
It’s the same one.

68
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,280
I just added some more details.

69
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Is it nearly finished?

70
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,120
Yes.

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,360
I just need to add a few more details.

72
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,360
When you’re done,

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,680
can I take you to submit it?

74
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,760
Why?

75
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,320
Are you afraid someone will kick a ball into my work again?

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,600
There, there.

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
I’m kidding.

78
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay. I’ll let you know when it’s done.

79
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,000
You said it already.

80
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,400
You said it already.

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,440
so don’t change your mind.

82
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
Alright.

83
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,960
Promise?

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,080
What’s with you?

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,360
Hurry up.

86
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,560
What’s with you?

87
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
I have something to tell you.

88
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,920
What is it now?

89
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,400
What?

90
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,000
I give you an inch and you take a mile.

91
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,680
Go already.

92
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,760
I’ve just arrived.

93
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,560
You’re chasing me away already?

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,600
You don’t have anything else to do?

95
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,960
I came all the way here to see you.

96
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,920
If you have nothing to do, just sit here.

97
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,080
“I’ll never get back with that woman again!”

98
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,680
“Ketrat Suparatmaitri told Ploy that there’s no way he’ll…”

99
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,120
Do you need my help?

100
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
No, thanks.

101
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,800
I’m just reading a novel.

102
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,840
Oho.

103
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,760
Looking from this angle,

104
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,520
I think you look handsome, Phum.

105
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,520
You have a nice personality, too.

106
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
Hey, have you already bought into him?

107
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,440
Nonsense.

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,360
It’s a fact.

109
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,040
Look at him.

110
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,120
The person who gets to date Phum is super-duper lucky.

111
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
I don’t know.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,120
I don’t know if anyone wants to be that lucky person.

113
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,240
Come on.

114
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,480
Someone must want to.

115
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,640
Am I right, Peem?

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,840
How would I know?

117
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,880
I’ll wash the coffee machine.

118
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,480
Enjoy your time.

119
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,120
But I want you to be that lucky person.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,480
Auntie, let me help.

121
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,760
It’s alright, Phum.

122
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,560
It’s alright.

123
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
But since you’re already here,

124
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:17,960
come in.

125
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,560
Hurry up.

126
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,480
I’ll help.

127
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,280
Nobody is here.

128
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,560
What?

129
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,520
Do you want to play it?

130
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,520
Come.

131
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,800
I’ll teach you.

132
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,440
The easiest chord is E minor 7.

133
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,600
Touch fret 1, string 5.

134
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,160
Then, try playing.

135
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
Do you want to give it a try?

136
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,600
Which one?

137
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,440
Here.

138
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,400
Touch here.

139
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,840
Try it.

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,360
It’s muted.

141
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,720
Touch it properly.

142
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,120
Try playing.

143
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,480
Again.

144
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,120
It’s no longer muted.

145
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,480
One more time.

146
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,280
Move your hand here.

147
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,400
My finger’s starting to hurt.

148
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,400
I can do it now.

149
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,800
Great job.

150
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,360
We’re coming, guys.

151
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,480
Did I interrupt you two?

152
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,840
Well, we can leave.

153
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,160
Don’t.

154
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,360
Don’t.

155
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,640
Don’t.

156
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,200
Don’t.

157
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,720
I have been waiting for you guys.

158
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
Come.

159
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,640
Let’s practice already.

160
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,640
What were you two doing?

161
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,760
Are you tired today?

162
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,280
I am.

163
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,360
Give me a hug.

164
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,000
How about you?

165
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
You have been waiting long.

166
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,040
Are you bored?

167
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,360
I’m not.

168
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,360
Hey.

169
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,360
What’s going on between you two?

170
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,800
Did you forget to tell us something?

171
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,200
Or are you two dating already?

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,840
Well,

173
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,840
what are your plans after this?

174
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,920
Let’s party at Peem’s place.

175
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,320
Let’s go.

176
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
Good idea.

177
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,040
We haven’t partied for some time already.

178
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,000
You’re right.

179
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,680
Let’s go.

180
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,360
Let’s go.

181
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,160
Hey, hold on.

182
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,360
So, what’s the deal?

183
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,680
Let’s go now, Toey.

184
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,040
Hey.

185
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,480
Eh?

186
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,600
I’m your friend.

187
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,560
Let’s go.

188
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,720
Chain.

189
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,200
Huh?

190
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,040
Let’s go.

191
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,600
Where to?

192
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,440
Don’t be in a daze.

193
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,840
Let’s go to Peem’s place.

194
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,760
I want their answer.

195
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,720
- Are they dating already?
- Relax.

196
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,560
Hello.

197
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
Hi, kids.

198
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,760
Are you here to help me tidy up?

199
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,120
We came for a free meal.

200
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,080
Oho.

201
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
We haven't been here for just a short while,

202
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,520
but he already moved in?

203
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,680
He’s just here to help.

204
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,560
Come on, guys.

205
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,680
Hey.

206
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,760
So, you’re just helping him here?

207
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah. I’m helping him.

208
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,720
Aunt Pui’s cafe has a lot of customers.

209
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,480
Where is Mick?

210
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,040
I don’t know where he is.

211
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,480
Phum, have you already won Peem’s heart?

212
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,600
Come on.

213
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,360
I think he already has since he confessed his feelings.

214
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,440
Stop talking about me.

215
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Let’s talk about you two.

216
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,640
What’s the deal?

217
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,400
Things seem strange between you two.

218
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,600
He’s right.

219
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,680
So, what’s the deal?

220
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,200
I sensed something since we were in the practice room.

221
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,560
You two were sweetly clingy to each other.

222
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,280
Why?

223
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,240
What’s wrong if I want to hold my boyfriend’s hand?

224
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,200
You two are already dating?

225
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,920
Since when?

226
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,400
How?

227
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,480
Who asked first?

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,840
Shit. You haven’t told me about it.

229
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,440
Damn.

230
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,320
Why are you asking so many questions?

231
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,760
Didn’t you want to tell us at all, huh?

232
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
See?

233
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,600
You’ve found out just now.

234
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,880
Why must I tell you?

235
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,000
Anyway,

236
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,840
my Cupid mission is successful already.

237
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,640
Let’s celebrate.

238
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,800
Well, can a Cupid shoot an arrow at himself?

239
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,200
Huh?

240
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,840
If he can, I want to ask him to do it.

241
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,720
Let’s go.

242
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,880
Let’s help Aunt Pui tidy up.

243
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,480
Let’s go.

244
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,480
I’m good.

245
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,400
Take some rest.

246
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,520
Head inside.

247
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,720
Let’s go.

248
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,040
Hey.

249
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,200
Take your seat.

250
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,320
It took you ages.

251
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,120
How about the others?

252
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,920
It took you ages.

253
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,280
Cheers.

254
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,640
Cheers.

255
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,240
We’re here, guys.

256
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
Oh! guys.

257
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,960
Tan, Fang,

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,920
it took you forever.

259
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,520
Do you know

260
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
you’re not the only couple in our gang now?

261
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,560
Why?

262
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,680
Those two we’re rooting for are already dating.

263
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,080
Seriously?

264
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,960
Where are they?

265
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,360
Oh, you’re here.

266
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,160
Come.

267
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,360
Come.

268
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Come here.

269
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,960
You two are already dating?

270
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,320
Whoa. Look at that nod.

271
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,760
Finally.

272
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,720
You got us so tired.

273
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,440
Let’s celebrate the new couple.

274
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,720
Cheers.

275
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,040
Cheers.

276
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,600
Is that my glass?

277
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,880
Don’t overreact.

278
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,440
We aren’t overreacting.

279
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,880
Don’t you know how tired we have been to make you end up together?

280
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,080
Don’t say that.

281
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,160
It’s I who should complain.

282
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,960
Come on.

283
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,680
Cheers.

284
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,480
Cheers.

285
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,680
Bottoms up.

286
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,560
You’re good at this, bro.

287
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,960
I’m happy for you.

288
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,120
I followed in your footsteps, Fang.

289
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,120
Don’t be slighted.

290
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,520
Our couple will get to celebrate like them soon.

291
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,320
Awww.

292
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,560
How romantic.

293
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,640
Cheers.

294
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,400
One more time.

295
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,800
Cheers.

296
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,000
Guys, the deadline

297
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,040
for submitting your work to the gallery is this Friday at 1 PM.

298
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,360
Speed up if you haven’t finished.

299
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
If you’re already done, look forward to the results.

300
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,400
But let me give a spoiler.

301
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,000
I saw Q’s work already.

302
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,400
I’m sure it will be displayed again this year.

303
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,920
No wonder he’s called Maestro Q.

304
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,920
Stop, Fai.

305
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,760
I’m telling the truth.

306
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,160
You already submitted it?

307
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,440
I just submitted it yesterday.

308
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:45,920
How about you?

309
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,800
Are you submitting yours this year?

310
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,480
Of course.

311
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,400
It’s nearly done.

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,040
Wait and see.

313
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
My work will certainly be displayed this year.

314
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,360
Hello?

315
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,640
(Are you free tomorrow?)

316
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,800
Yes. Why?

317
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,240
I’ve finished my work.

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Really? It’s finished?

319
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,400
Can I see you now?

320
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Tomorrow.

321
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,800
We’re seeing each other tomorrow anyway.

322
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,960
Come on.

323
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,560
Can’t I see it now?

324
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,120
I want to see you too.

325
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,880
(Tomorrow.)

326
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,720
Okay.

327
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,880
Let’s meet tomorrow, then.

328
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,800
I’ll pick you up.

329
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,600
Alright.

330
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,680
I’ll wait at home.

331
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,200
(What time should I be there?)

332
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,400
Is late morning okay?

333
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,800
Sure.

334
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,000
Alright. See you.

335
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,720
Your drink is ready.

336
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
- Here you are.
- 	Thank you.

337
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,040
Green tea, my nephew’s favorite

338
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,000
and toast, something ordinary but made with love.

339
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank you.

340
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,319
I’m off to teach now.

341
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,640
Sure. Bye.

342
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,079
Bye.

343
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,079
[Where are you?]

344
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,400
[Are you nearly here?]

345
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,920
[I’m waiting.]

346
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,880
Oho. This is so awesome.

347
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,760
You nailed it.

348
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,160
Hey, Peem is also submitting his work, isn’t he?

349
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,080
Where is his work?

350
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,840
I haven’t seen it.

351
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,360
We’re closing soon.

352
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
I’ll call him.

353
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,320
Hello? What’s up?

354
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,440
(Hello? Peem, where are you?)

355
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,000
Home.

356
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,080
I’m about to head there.

357
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,280
(You’re home?)

358
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,200
(The deadline is today.)

359
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,080
(You aren’t coming yet?)

360
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,800
Alright.

361
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,560
I’ll hurry there.

362
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,640
Hurry up, or you’ll miss it.

363
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,200
What did he say?

364
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,800
He’s on the way here.

365
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,000
[Fang, are you with Phum?]

366
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,640
[He didn’t answer my calls.]

367
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,920
[I don’t know if something happened to him.]

368
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,400
[Give me a call.]

369
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,400
I guess nobody else is coming.

370
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,800
Hold on. Give me a second.

371
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,480
Where is Peem now?

372
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,800
Where is he?

373
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,960
Will he make it?

374
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,840
Give me a second.

375
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,800
I made it in time, right?

376
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,560
Uh-huh.

377
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,920
We’re about to close.

378
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
Why are you so late?

379
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,440
Just forget about it.

380
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
Do you need any help?

381
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,680
They’re already closed.

382
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,240
I guess nobody else is coming.

383
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
I’m going back, then.

384
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,640
[Phum is alright.]

385
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,640
[You can call and ask him again.]

386
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,800
[Thank you.]

387
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,840
Can I sit with you?

388
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,400
Kluen? Why are you here?

389
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,240
Why?

390
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,760
Aren’t architecture students

391
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,200
allowed into the Faculty of Fine Arts?

392
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,200
That’s not it.

393
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,240
I’m here to see you.

394
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,760
Why didn’t you tell me first?

395
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,840
What if I weren’t here?

396
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,160
You’re here now anyway.

397
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,640
So, what’s up?

398
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,960
I just want to see you.

399
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
I have something to tell you.

400
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,080
Well,

401
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,160
- I…
- 	I have been thinking it over,

402
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,160
about whether I should tell you or not.

403
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,920
Actually, I kind of already know your answer,

404
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,600
but I would regret it if I didn’t tell you.

405
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
Am I making you feel uncomfortable?

406
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,320
No.

407
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,120
Thanks a lot for your feelings

408
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,160
but…

409
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,400
But you already like someone else, right?

410
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,400
Let me guess.

411
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,800
That person must be the reason

412
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,520
you’re sitting here, looking glum.

413
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,960
What did you two argue about?

414
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,240
We didn’t.

415
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,640
You can talk to me about it.

416
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,280
So, he didn’t keep the promise.

417
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,320
Plus, you can’t reach him now.

418
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,440
You like someone like this?

419
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,600
It isn’t funny?

420
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,040
I’m sorry.

421
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,520
I just don’t want you to feel stressed.

422
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,360
Sadness doesn't suit someone like you, Peem.

423
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,960
Thanks a lot.

424
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,560
Honestly, I don’t want to make excuses for him,

425
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,120
but I think he probably has his reasons.

426
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,840
Actually, that’s what I’m thinking.

427
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,000
Peem, though I know you aren’t choosing me,

428
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
can I keep liking you like this?

429
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,120
I’m not asking you to feel the same for me.

430
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,840
I just want to be here

431
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,400
and like you like I do now.

432
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Are you okay with this?

433
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,720
I can’t stop your feelings.

434
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
But if one day,

435
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,200
liking someone takes your happiness away,

436
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,040
I hope you’ll choose to love yourself first.

437
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,480
It’s because you’re like this.

438
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,760
But won’t you reconsider it?

439
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,920
I’m handsome and rich.

440
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,400
It’s rare to find someone like me.

441
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,560
Phum is handsome, too.

442
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,960
Oh, come on.

443
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,440
But talking about you being rich,

444
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,240
can you tell me how much you’re willing to give,

445
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,480
so I can consider it?

446
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,520
Is this an auction?

447
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,360
Let’s call it knowing how to invest well.

448
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,840
They say cute people are usually weird.

449
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,760
I think you’re one of them.

450
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,000
Do you really like me, huh?

451
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,600
Peem.

452
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,000
Can I talk to you?

453
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,520
I’m leaving, Peem.

454
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,400
Thanks a lot.

455
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,400
I’m sorry.

456
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,560
I’m sorry I didn’t keep the promise.

457
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,160
I’m sorry for making you wait for me again.

458
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,840
Where have you been?

459
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,480
You didn’t answer my calls.

460
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,040
You didn’t reply to my messages either.

461
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,920
I’m asking because I’m worried about you.

462
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,160
Well, I…

463
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,880
You said you’d talk to me about everything, didn’t you?

464
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,840
Fine.

465
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,880
Just forget about it.

466
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,960
It’s a relief you’re alright.

467
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,560
Hey.

468
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,320
Hold on, Peem.

469
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,480
Why are you sitting here?

470
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
Aren’t you going to class?

471
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,120
I’ll join you later.

472
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,680
Is something wrong?

473
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,720
Well, I ruined it again.

474
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,560
Phum, talk to me.

475
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,440
Can we talk later?

476
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,560
I have an errand, so I have to leave now.

477
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,880
How long will you keep running away from me?

478
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,240
Running away?

479
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,040
What did I do to make you this mad at me

480
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,800
and be like this with me?

481
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,600
And what did I do wrong?

482
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,320
I just want to know if you don’t love me.

483
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,520
That’s why you sent me there to live alone.

484
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,520
All I did was for you.

485
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,680
Have you ever asked me if I was okay with it?

486
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,880
I just want you to make time for me,

487
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,920
not to focus only on your business.

488
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,200
Why didn’t you tell Peem?

489
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,640
If this is the reason,

490
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
I think Peem will understand you.

491
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,640
Because I know Peem will understand it,

492
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,320
I look like someone who can’t handle anything on my own.

493
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,960
But this is out of control.

494
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,800
You didn’t want it to turn out this way.

495
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,720
So, what will you do now?

496
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,920
Won’t you do something about it?

497
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,840
What are you waiting for?

498
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,800
Let’s go to class.

499
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,480
Let’s go to class.

500
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,920
Hurry up.

501
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,080
If I miss another class, I’ll fail this course.

502
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
Are you okay?

503
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,920
I am.

504
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,200
I already know why you almost didn’t submit your work

505
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,080
and also…

506
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,800
It’s alright.

507
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,160
Don’t worry about me.

508
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,760
Just get to work.

509
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,680
Are you really okay?

510
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,560
I am.

511
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,240
Yes, Aunt Pui.

512
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,200
Why are you guys here?

513
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,880
Eh?

514
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,240
Q said there is a sad puppy here,

515
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,360
so that’s why we came.

516
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,200
Come in.

517
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,400
Come in.

518
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,240
I want to watch a movie.

519
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,120
What should we watch?

520
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,400
Good idea.

521
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,200
Peem, what do you want to watch?

522
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,840
Who told you to watch a movie in my room?

523
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,800
If we asked you first,

524
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,640
you wouldn’t let us come.

525
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,520
How about a horror movie?

526
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,560
That’s the right vibe for now.

527
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,200
Good idea.

528
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,120
Let’s watch it now.

529
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,280
Chain, pass me the remote.

530
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,760
Come on.

531
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,280
Sit here.

532
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,160
What are you waiting for?

533
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,720
The movie is starting now.

534
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,400
Make yourself at home.

535
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,800
It’s obviously my home, dude.

536
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,720
Which one should we go with?

537
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,120
Peem, give me the blanket.

538
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,280
No, I won’t.

539
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,920
It’s mine.

540
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,400
I can’t concentrate.

541
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,440
Pun, if you’re scared,

542
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,400
why did you pick a horror movie?

543
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,760
What?!

544
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,400
A dog.

545
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,920
Asshole!

546
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,280
Just watch.

547
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,400
Chain!

548
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,360
Why are you teasing me?

549
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,200
Why, huh?

550
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,560
Come on. I’m not teasing you.

551
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,160
Eat.

552
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,840
Eat.

553
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,480
Eat.

554
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,040
Open your eyes wide.

555
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,720
Don’t.

556
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,400
Don’t.

557
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,440
What are you two doing?

558
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,680
Hey, stop.

559
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,440
This is my bed.

560
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,040
Open your mouth.

561
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,960
Oh, I missed it.

562
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,600
Won’t you clean up the mess?

563
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,720
What are you doing downstairs?

564
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,360
What about you?

565
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,360
I’m here to talk with a glum puppy.

566
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,480
You’re a puppy, not me.

567
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,320
You should clear things up with him.

568
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,600
So? You’re siding with him?

569
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,120
You know that I almost didn’t submit my work in time because of him, right?

570
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,040
I know.

571
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,840
But do you know why he disappeared all of a sudden?

572
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,560
Phum is really into you.

573
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,800
He can’t be lying down doing nothing

574
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,120
and not answering your calls just like that.

575
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,400
What do you want me to do then?

576
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,800
Apologize?

577
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,280
Make up with him?

578
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,160
Clear things up with him.

579
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,600
But if you want him to learn a lesson,

580
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,120
I have something fun to offer.

581
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,960
Something fun?

582
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Pay him back.

583
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,360
Get back at him for making you his slave.

584
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,960
Huh?

585
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,680
Peem is Phum’s slave?

586
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,360
Take this as a practice.

587
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,120
You have to do it next year.

588
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,440
Q, you must help me next year.

589
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:57,920
Deal?

590
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,000
Absolutely.

591
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,640
Cool.

592
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,200
You’re my senior, so you should help me.

593
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,360
I’m your boyfriend.

594
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,320
You’re quite crazy over your boyfriend, aren’t you?

595
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,400
Eh?

596
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,800
Phum.

597
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,520
So, you guys already know

598
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,000
what happened between Peem and me?

599
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,680
Uh-huh.

600
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,280
And we’re seriously mad at you.

601
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,080
It’s really my fault.

602
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,880
It makes sense for you guys to be mad.

603
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
Q, you’re Peem’s bestie.

604
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
Can you tell him what he should do

605
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,400
to make Peem forgive him?

606
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,960
Why should I help?

607
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,800
Q.

608
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,320
Actually, I didn’t pick him up

609
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,680
because I argued with my family.

610
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,520
Why are you telling me?

611
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,640
What’s the point of telling me?

612
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,960
I want to talk to him,

613
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
but I think he doesn’t want to see me anymore.

614
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,800
What a loser you are.

615
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,560
Q.

616
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,200
Where is he now?

617
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,600
He’s probably with Kluen.

618
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,080
I think Peem is organizing stuff

619
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,360
around the gallery,

620
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,600
the same venue as last year.

621
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,000
You remember where it is, right?

622
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,720
Thanks a lot.

623
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,960
I’ll rush there.

624
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,440
Toey, you’re ruining the plan.

625
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,200
Ouch.

626
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,480
You’re playing like a kid.

627
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
I feel sorry for Phum and Peem.

628
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,840
Ouch.

629
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,240
You enjoy teasing others too much.

630
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,320
It took you forever to come back.

631
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,800
You had fun coloring with Toey, huh?

632
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,840
So, what do you want to talk about?

633
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,280
I’m sorry.

634
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,000
That’s all?

635
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,960
I didn’t answer your calls

636
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,920
because I argued with my dad.

637
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,000
I already know.

638
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,520
Huh?

639
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,239
Do you know how worried I was about you?

640
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,159
When you didn’t pick me up,

641
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,360
I thought something happened to you.

642
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,159
When Fang told me you argued with your dad,

643
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,880
I was like, okay.

644
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,920
I thought you’d give me a call later.

645
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,520
But then what?

646
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,199
I was waiting for your call,

647
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,280
but you didn’t reach me at all.

648
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,040
You made me feel

649
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,120
I couldn’t be your comfort zone.

650
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,800
That’s not it.

651
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,680
It’s because today is your important day.

652
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,680
But you’re also important to me.

653
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Because you’re also important to me,

654
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,320
I don’t want my problem to make you feel uneasy.

655
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,400
But I promise that, from now on,

656
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,040
I’ll tell you about everything.

657
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I’m sorry.

658
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,360
I wasn’t angry with you at all

659
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,560
no matter the reason.

660
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,880
I was just worried.

661
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,920
I don’t know

662
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,920
what it would feel like if you weren’t here.

663
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,200
But what I know now is…

664
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,000
I only know that I love you.

665
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,840
Don’t disappear again.

666
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,560
I promise.

667
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,440
I heard you made up with him already.

668
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,440
So, it’s your doing.

669
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I just didn’t want to see my friends fight.

670
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,520
Enough for that.

671
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,920
So,

672
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
what do we have to prepare for our booth?

673
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,720
I’m planning to do shadow drawings.

674
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,840
The main tools needed are paper and pencils.

675
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,800
I’ll go with watercolor, then.

676
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,080
But it looks like I have to buy new tools.

677
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,400
Mine are messy.

678
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,960
Let’s buy them together at the co-op, shall we?

679
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,080
Deal.

680
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,200
Q, Peem,

681
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,240
where are you going?

682
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,120
Co-op.

683
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,240
Do you want to go with us?

684
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,840
Yes.

685
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,640
I’m going.

686
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,320
Let’s go.

687
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,480
Hey, Peem.

688
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,600
Hey? Kluen.

689
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,320
What are you doing here?

690
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,280
Buying some stuff.

691
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:36,960
You?

692
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,720
Same here.

693
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,480
We’re buying stuff for our gallery.

694
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,600
I see.

695
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,000
The gallery your faculty is hosting, right?

696
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,960
Yep.

697
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,880
If you’re free, drop by.

698
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,200
We’re opening a portrait booth.

699
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
If I go,

700
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,200
will you open up and give me a chance?

701
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,040
Kluen.

702
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,840
I’m kidding.

703
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,720
I’ll drop by then.

704
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,440
I have to get back to work at the faculty.

705
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,120
See you later.

706
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,160
See you.

707
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,120
I’m buying stuff.

708
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,440
Q, did you hear the same thing?

709
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,000
This doesn’t look right.

710
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,600
I must make Phum do something.

711
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,120
Eh?

712
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,600
Q, wait for me.

713
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,120
Q.

714
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,160
I want some ice cream.

715
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,720
Go ahead.

716
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,680
Peem, do you want one?

717
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,840
Nope.

718
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,840
Thank you.

719
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,840
My boyfriend is the cutest.

720
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,960
I guess you two are sweeter than ice cream.

721
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,600
Let’s head back to the faculty.

722
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,000
Hold on, Q.

723
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,000
I forgot that I…

724
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,000
I have to run an errand.

725
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,760
I’ll tell Phum about that thing.

726
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,960
Bye-bye.

727
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,480
Let’s go.

728
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,560
Hey, let me ask you something.

729
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,640
What is it?

730
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,600
What’s between Kluen and you?

731
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,080
Well, we’re friends.

732
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,040
Well, he confessed his feelings to me.

733
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:42,920
Huh?

734
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,800
But…

735
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,880
But I already rejected him,

736
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,480
so we’re now friends.

737
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,800
Nice.

738
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,760
But I guess

739
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,840
Toey has already spread the fake news.

740
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,680
Huh? What?

741
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,880
Nothing.

742
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,800
Wait.

743
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,960
- Talk to me first.
- Fake news.

744
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,840
Phum.

745
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,840
Phum.

746
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,600
Phum.

747
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,880
Toey, what are you doing here?

748
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,560
Do you know what I just saw?

749
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,280
A ghost?

750
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,360
A female or a male one?

751
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,920
Nonsense, Mick.

752
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,640
Are you really studying science, huh?

753
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
Also, it’s broad daylight now.

754
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,840
How could I see a ghost?

755
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,480
Why are you asking such an unintelligent question?

756
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
I saw your shocking face,

757
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,000
so I thought you saw a ghost.

758
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,080
Come on.

759
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,400
So what did you see?

760
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,360
Can you tell us already?

761
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,200
Fine. I will.

762
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,360
Well, I went to buy stuff with Q and Peem.

763
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,120
Do you know who I met?

764
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,600
A ghost?

765
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,800
No.

766
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,680
I met Kluen.

767
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,840
You know what?

768
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,880
It seems there’s something between Kluen and Peem.

769
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,480
I bet Kluen is hitting on Peem.

770
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,680
Phum, you must speed up to win his heart,

771
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,400
or else Kluen will steal your chance

772
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,720
and it can’t be helped.

773
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,520
Eh? Toey.

774
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,320
What’s with you?

775
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,440
Why are you walking around?

776
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,800
Nothing.

777
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,880
I’m free, so I’ll stay here with you two.

778
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,840
Just do your work, Q and Peem.

779
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,720
Nothing’s going on.

780
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,280
So, are you practicing tonight, Q?

781
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:39,960
Of course.

782
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,280
The event day is just around the corner.

783
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,160
So?

784
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,520
You’ll leave me here setting up the booth alone again?

785
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,280
Alone? Nonsense.

786
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,840
A lot of our faculty friends will be there.

787
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,480
Toey, are you going to the practice room with him?

788
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,200
- If not, stay at the booth with me.
[This evening, Peem will be alone at the booth.]

789
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,080
Toey.

790
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,360
[It’s your chance!]

791
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,120
Toey.

792
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,520
Toey!

793
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,160
What? Peem?

794
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,000
Nothing.

795
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,520
I’m not talking to anyone.

796
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,480
You’re not cheating on my friend, right?

797
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,040
You’re talking nonsense, Peem.

798
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,280
Why did you call my name?

799
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,360
Nothing.

800
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,160
I asked if you’re going to the practice room with him.

801
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,760
If you’re not going, keep me company here.

802
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,480
Of course, I’m going with him.

803
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,760
If I don’t go,

804
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,280
Q won’t have the energy to practice.

805
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,240
Am I right?

806
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,920
Nonsense.

807
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,680
Nonsense.

808
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,240
Shame on you.

809
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,520
Stay by yourself this evening.

810
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,720
Am I right, Q?

811
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,160
I’m drawing.

812
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,520
Come on, Q.

813
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,360
We’re opening the booth together,

814
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,840
but you left me here setting up alone.

815
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
A knight in shining armor is already here.

816
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,760
What brings you here?

817
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,160
What knight are you talking about?

818
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,840
I know that you’re setting up the booth here alone,

819
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,320
so I guess it’s a chance for me

820
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,400
to flirt with you to win your heart.

821
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,880
How could you know I’m…?

822
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,800
What? Peem?

823
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,200
Nothing.

824
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,160
I’m not talking to anyone.

825
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,840
Toey.

826
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,000
I’m here to keep flirting with you.

827
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,600
I don’t want to discontinue.

828
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,680
Or have I already won your heart?

829
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,560
You want to help, right?

830
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,000
Fine.

831
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,880
Where should I put it?

832
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,560
Tighter.

833
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,480
Tighter?

834
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:37,840
Yes.

835
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,560
Pull it straight.

836
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,320
Where? Here?

837
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,440
Attach it on the hook.

838
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,280
Tighter.

839
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:43,960
More?

840
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:44,840
I see.

841
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,600
Here we go.

842
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,760
That nail?

843
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,280
Are you really studying engineering?

844
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:08,920
Oops.

845
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,480
I tripped over “love.”

846
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,880
So, is there anything else you want me to do?

847
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,360
You drew this yourself?

848
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:29,920
[Peem]

849
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,840
What are you playing at?

850
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,280
Mr. Peem,

851
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,280
are you that heartless to look down on Phum’s love for you?

852
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,640
Set up the table.

853
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,760
Move the table here.

854
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,120
What?

855
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,760
You’re tired already?

856
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,800
Yeah.

857
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,160
I’m exhausted.

858
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,920
I’m drained already.

859
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,520
What?

860
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,520
Stop pretending.

861
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,200
You might as well say that you love me.

862
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:22,840
No.

863
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,400
Come on.

864
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,400
Say that you love me.

865
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:24,920
I won’t.

866
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,160
My ears were muffled that day.

867
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,680
I couldn’t hear it.

868
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,560
That’s your problem.

869
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:33,920
Please.

870
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:37,920
Please.

871
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,600
Say it.

872
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,440
Please.

873
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,040
Please.

874
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:44,320
Please.

875
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,200
Say you love me.

876
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,080
If you say it,

877
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,040
I’ll stop feeling tired.

878
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,040
Love.

879
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,040
Huh? Pardon?

880
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,040
What did you say?

881
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,840
Love you.

882
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,120
Well, then,

883
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,320
should we start dating already?

884
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,080
Nope.

885
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,520
I almost said yes,

886
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,120
but you’re annoying me a bit.

887
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,000
I’ll go get some water.

888
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,600
Bye.

889
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,480
Come on.

890
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,440
Matt, hurry up. Look at you. You’re slacking off.

891
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,480
Matt, hurry up. Look at you. You’re slacking off.

892
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,480
Come on. Will we finish it today?

893
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,680
Come on. Will we finish it today?

894
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,600
Hey, you’re still being slow.

895
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,640
Hey, you’re still being slow.

896
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,840
You also. You aren’t helping him, huh?

897
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,080
Right. You aren’t helping me?

898
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:54,840
Still.

899
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,000
Hey. You’re still not moving?

900
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:56,760
Still.

901
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,800
Hey. You’re still not moving?

902
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,400
Still.

903
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:58,920
Still.

904
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,080
Stop saying what I said. Lift it.

905
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,040
Lift it.

906
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,160
I have a headache.

907
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,200
I have a headache.

908
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,600
Hey.

909
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,080
You want to be a matchmaker that much, right?

910
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,800
Oh? What are you talking about? I have no clue.

911
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,920
I know Phum came to see me last night because you told him.

912
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,720
Nonsense. I didn’t do that.

913
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,800
Stop making that innocent face.

914
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,800
I know it’s your doing. Stop pretending already.

915
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,960
Being Cupid is Pun’s duty. Stay away from this, okay?

916
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,240
Uh-huh. So, are you two in a relationship already?

917
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,880
If you want to know, ask your dearest Phum.

918
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,560
Dearest Phum? Nonsense.
I’m the only dearest one to him.

919
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,600
I’m the only dearest one to him.

920
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,560
Whatever.

921
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,400
To punish you for messing with my business,

922
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,560
stay here tonight to help me set up the gallery.

923
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,880
Though you don’t tell me to, I’m going to help anyway.

924
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,680
Toey!

925
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,040
I think we won’t finish it.

926
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,480
Come on, guys. Stop being so silly. Why don’t you act your age?

927
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,480
Why don’t you act your age?

928
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,800
What are you waiting for?

929
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,360
What, bro?

930
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,040
Lift it already.

931
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,680
I see. I must lift it.

932
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,320
You always order me to do this and that.

933
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,640
I’ll convince Toey to date someone else.

934
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,720
What did you say?

935
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,080
Where are the rest of our seniors?

936
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,160
Ugh.

937
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,360
Look at you. How long have you been working on this, huh?

938
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,560
How come you’re standing there? You know nothing.

939
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,880
Unbelievable. How could you even work? Tell me.

940
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,720
Asshole!

941
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,600
I’m sorry, bro.

942
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,080
Finally, your work is displayed next to mine.

943
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,880
Don’t tell me you told Fai to display ours next to each other,

944
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,840
so people will compare them.

945
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,280
Nonsense.

946
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,600
I’m kidding.

947
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,720
My work is also nice.

948
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,400
So, this is how it feels.

949
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,840
Won’t you save your happiness for tomorrow, too?

950
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,240
What?

951
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,560
You could say that

952
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,880
because your work has been displayed many times already.

953
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,560
It’s my first time,

954
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,800
so let me feel it, okay?

955
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,800
Congratulations.

956
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,640
Thanks.

957
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,560
I’ll check out others’ works.

958
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,560
See you later.

959
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,240
Oho.

960
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,840
Your work is displayed again this year.

961
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:20,960
What do you think?

962
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,360
Your boyfriend is talented, right?

963
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,440
Yep.

964
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,480
But I’m more talented for

965
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,280
making someone talented like you my boyfriend.

966
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,040
Getting on my nerves, huh?

967
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,920
Q.

968
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,200
Toey, are you really hurt?

969
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,480
I’m sorry.

970
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,480
I’m kidding.

971
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,920
You can be so easily tricked.

972
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,680
You’re getting on my nerves.

973
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,680
Q,

974
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,400
I probably haven’t told you before

975
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:05,120
but you’re the one who introduced me to art.

976
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,760
If you didn’t walk past Oh’s cafe that day,

977
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,200
or if you ignored my notes

978
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,480
and didn’t reply to them,

979
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,640
I probably wouldn’t get to find my passion like I do now.

980
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,080
Thank you, Q.

981
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,960
I also want to thank you

982
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,760
for having waited for me this long.

983
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,560
By the way,

984
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,720
I have something to show you.

985
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,160
Follow me.

986
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,040
Come here.

987
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,520
I don’t draw portraits often,

988
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,400
so I don’t know if you’ll like it or not.

989
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,760
Whoa. That looks so nice.

990
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,960
Thank you, Q.

991
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,600
Am I the first customer of your booth?

992
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,920
You’re not a customer

993
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,720
but a significant other.

994
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,240
Huh?

995
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,720
What kind of joke is this?

996
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,080
You’re not just a significant other,

997
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,680
but “my” significant other.

998
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,640
Q’s significant other.

999
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,240
Thank you, Q.

1000
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,920
Your drawing is always special to me.

1001
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,480
Isn’t the artist special to you, too?

1002
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,680
He’s my most special one.

1003
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,160
Peem.

1004
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,480
Do you remember telling me that

1005
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,960
after you finish drawing this,

1006
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,160
you’ll cancel our deal?

1007
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,320
Well,

1008
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,320
can I propose a new deal?

1009
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,200
What is it?

1010
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,200
Will you date me?

1011
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,440
Uh-huh.

1012
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:08,960
Uh-huh?

1013
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:11,960
Alright.

1014
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,720
I will.

1015
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,920
That sounds like you don’t really want to.

1016
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,560
Don’t be too much.

1017
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,560
Hi, everyone who’s joining us at the Faculty of Fine Arts today.

1018
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,280
Let’s have fun together.

1019
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,640
Q, you’re so cool!

1020
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,360
How about a kiss?
A kiss?

1021
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,440
Kiss me.

1022
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,520
Draw me.

1023
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,240
The booth is closed.

1024
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,280
Does staring at me for a long time excite your heart?

1025
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,840
I’ll take you to meet my parents in Chiang Mai.

1026
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,120
Deal, my boo?
