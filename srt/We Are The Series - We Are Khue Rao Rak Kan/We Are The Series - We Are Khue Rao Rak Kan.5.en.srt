5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,700
Fang asked me to give it to you.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,300
It's a thank-you for helping him yesterday.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,400
Why are you looking at me?

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,110
I see you wear earphones all the time,

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,890
so I wonder what song you’re listening to.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,320
If you can’t make it home yourself next time,

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,290
call me.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,300
What brings you here?

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,910
You’re heading home, right?

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,820
I’ll give you a ride.

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,100
Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask you.

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,620
You dropped me off that night, right?

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:40,980
If you could remember it,

18
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,620
then why are you asking?

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,620
And do you remember

20
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,420
what you said to me that night?

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,410
You’ve got a tall nose,

22
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,000
and lovely eyes.

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,840
Your mouth is…

24
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,620
Hi, Auntie.

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,640
I was wondering whose car was parked in front of my house.

26
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,680
Hello.

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,840
Hi.

28
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,700
How kind of you to drop Peem off.

29
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,140
He’s super-duper kind.

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,600
Eh?

31
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,380
Please excuse me.

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,460
Won’t you come in and have something to drink first?

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,259
No, thank you.

34
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,340
I’m just dropping Peem off.

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,640
I see.

36
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,560
Safe drive, then.

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,440
Yes. Goodbye.

38
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,350
Goodbye.

39
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,440
Peem.

40
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,889
You were sitting in the car for so long.

41
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,980
What were you guys talking about?

42
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,210
Oh, nothing.

43
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,060
I’ll take a shower.

44
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:17,970
Nothing? What do you mean?

45
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,780
I saw you chatting away for ages.

46
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,110
I was standing there, spying on you for a long time,

47
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,110
but you didn't notice me at all, Peem.

48
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,060
Why are you smiling?

49
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,220
I’m thinking of something funny.

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,040
About that friend, right?

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,820
No.

52
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,830
What nonsense are you talking about?

53
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,970
Gotcha.

54
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,100
Who are you talking about?

55
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,090
Phum is smiling, thinking of someone.

56
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,500
I told you I was thinking of funny stuff.

57
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,420
Let’s eat already.

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,980
Fang, here you go.

59
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,700
Thank you.

60
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,900
You’re still addicted to games?

61
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,850
We’ve been friends since high school.

62
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,410
Have you ever seen him put his phone down even once?

63
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,070
Yay. I won.

64
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,610
Hey? Fang? You’re also here?

65
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,020
Fang,

66
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,500
do you remember Toey?

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,180
Yes.

68
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,910
Why?

69
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,000
He didn’t study abroad.

70
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,350
How do you know?

71
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,190
I met him at the Fine Arts faculty here the other day.

72
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,100
Are you talking about Toey from our school?

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,610
Uh-huh.

74
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,820
I should go find him then.

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,770
He decided to stay in Thailand but didn’t even let me know.

76
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,970
I already told him off.

77
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,180
By the way,

78
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,840
I’ve heard Fine Arts majors are having an art gallery.

79
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,620
Let’s check it out, shall we?

80
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,220
Gallery?

81
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,740
It’s a showcase of their work.

82
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,589
Let’s go, then.

83
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,830
You’re interested in that sort of thing?

84
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,950
Well,

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,409
let’s meet Toey there.

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,260
What the heck?

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,590
Eat already.

88
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,310
DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

89
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
Do you think something is still missing here?

90
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,710
Here.

91
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,500
It’s probably this part.

92
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,980
You haven’t done enough shading here.

93
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,620
I don’t see much contrast between light and dark areas.

94
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,760
Ah, you’re right.

95
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,540
You’re turning into another maestro, aren’t you?

96
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,000
Hello.

97
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,710
Hello.

98
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,840
You’re going to class?

99
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,100
How about you guys?

100
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,500
What are you up to?

101
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,980
We have a drawing class in the afternoon.

102
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,700
I’m reviewing the previous draft

103
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,940
to see what I can fix.

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,070
I think you haven’t done much shading.

105
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,380
Darn it.

106
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,370
Toey, you’re good at this.

107
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,780
Well, before you came,

108
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,860
Toey said the exact same thing.

109
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,780
Now that you can already review someone else’s work,

110
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,540
you’d better learn to improve yours too.

111
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,580
I know.

112
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,810
We’re off to class.

113
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,200
See you.

114
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,980
Q? Where are you taking my pencils?

115
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,260
I have a class later.

116
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,090
Q.

117
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,980
Since you’ve all chosen this major,

118
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,440
I assume you have favorite artists.

119
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,640
For this next assignment,

120
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,860
each of you must choose a work by your favorite artist.

121
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,500
Then, reinterpret it,

122
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,340
use your own technique,

123
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,580
and create a new piece of work.

124
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,700
Oh, Prof.

125
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,640
Hang in there.

126
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,740
For those without a favorite,

127
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,730
please choose any artwork you like

128
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,830
and do the same thing.

129
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,080
As usual, bring your sketch and discuss it with me first

130
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,150
before working on it.

131
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,800
That’s it.

132
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,790
Take your time, guys.

133
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,970
Thank you.

134
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,420
It looks like I’m burning the midnight oil again soon.

135
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,340
I’m leaving.

136
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,820
- Hey, Q?
- Where are you going?

137
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,240
Is he feeling artsy or something?

138
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,550
His artistic mode is on?

139
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,710
Hey. You can borrow my pencil.

140
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,220
Q enjoys teasing you so much, doesn’t he?

141
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,180
You’re right.

142
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,130
How mean he is.'

143
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,980
Toey.

144
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,270
Damn it. Prof. Po assigned such a tough task.

145
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,270
I couldn’t pick my favorite artist yet.

146
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,260
But when the deadline is approaching,

147
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,380
your ideas will get flowing.

148
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,100
But what’s wrong with Q?

149
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,120
I don’t know.

150
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,300
He has disappeared for a while.

151
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,410
What’s damn wrong with him?

152
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,480
Oh?

153
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,140
I wonder.

154
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,570
Eh? What?

155
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,460
Who’s that?

156
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,390
His boyfriend?

157
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,340
I don’t know.

158
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,010
Let’s go.

159
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,960
Why are you here?

160
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,630
To make you do your job, of course.

161
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,980
Get in now.

162
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,980
New assignment?

163
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,210
Uh-huh.

164
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,560
Thank you

165
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,260
for the pencils, Q.

166
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,320
Uh-huh.

167
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,800
What are you drawing?

168
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,330
Prof.Pro has just assigned a new assignment.

169
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,520
He asked us to pick a piece of art by our favorite artist,

170
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
draw, and reinterpret it.

171
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,270
It feels so good to be someone’s favorite artist, doesn’t it?

172
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,460
Nonsense.

173
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,810
So, what do you want me to do here?

174
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,120
Well,

175
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,470
clean my room.

176
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,470
I feel it’s pretty messy.

177
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,540
I mean, there’s dust everywhere,

178
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,160
but since it’s small,

179
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,220
I guess you can’t detect it.

180
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,980
Anyway, clean my room.

181
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,050
Make it clean.

182
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,790
I’ll take a nap.

183
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,900
Clean the table, too.

184
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,850
Lots of dust on it, you know.

185
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,850
What are you looking at?

186
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,300
Hurry up and do it.

187
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,990
This part is already clean.

188
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,500
Move on to the rest.

189
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,700
I’m watching TV.

190
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,300
I said, it’s already clean here.

191
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,680
I’m watching TV.

192
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,470
There’re still many areas for you to clean.

193
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,470
You’ve been vacuuming here for too long already.

194
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:49,990
What?

195
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,300
Why are you looking at me like that?

196
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,830
What’s this thing?

197
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,660
A doll.

198
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,550
You don’t know what it is?

199
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Someone like you plays with a doll?

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,190
Stop talking too much.

201
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,110
Move.

202
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,410
Vacuum over there.

203
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,560
What are you doing, huh?

204
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,560
What? I’m getting rid of dust.

205
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,640
If you want to get rid of it,

206
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,160
do it over there,

207
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,740
not in front of me.

208
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,550
Eh? You want it this way, huh?

209
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,530
Phum!

210
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,140
I was just doing chores.

211
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,800
How mischievous you are.

212
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,130
Phum, let’s play a game.

213
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,210
I just got a new one.

214
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,860
I’m sorry.

215
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,410
We didn’t know you’re with a guest.

216
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,280
We’ll drop by next time.

217
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,410
Hey.

218
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,860
But I just got a new game.

219
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,140
It’s alright.

220
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,620
You guys can stay.

221
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,340
I’m heading back now.

222
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,630
Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?

223
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,510
What?

224
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,090
Usually, we didn’t have to tell you ahead.

225
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:50,890
Left.

226
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,320
Left.

227
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,190
To the left.

228
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,560
Beer, pass it to me.

229
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,900
Give me the tomato.

230
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,480
I already did.

231
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,420
Here.

232
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,180
To the front.

233
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,640
[I forgot to grab my bag.]

234
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,180
Phum.

235
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,290
[I forgot to grab my bag.]

236
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,890
Phum.

237
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,490
[Are you going to wait?]

238
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,620
Phum.

239
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,340
[Of course. The report I’m submitting tomorrow is in the bag.]

240
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,350
We’re losing.

241
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,290
Alright. Got it.

242
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,820
You guys are already grown up

243
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,870
but still playing such a game.

244
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,770
Yay. We made it.

245
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,980
Should we continue?

246
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,390
I’m already tired today.

247
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,890
Can we play it later?

248
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,440
What? You’re already tired?

249
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,580
We usually play until morning, don’t we?

250
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,390
Yeah.

251
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,230
But today I feel kind of tired.

252
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Let’s play it next time.

253
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,330
I promise to stay up all night and play it.

254
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,820
Let’s go back.

255
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,180
We’ve passed so many rounds already.

256
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,390
We can play next time.

257
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,960
Fine. Let’s do that.

258
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,230
Let’s go.

259
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,910
See you.

260
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,200
Let’s go.

261
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,230
Your friends left already?

262
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,210
Well, I didn’t expect them to come.

263
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,420
Oh, really?

264
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,580
But

265
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,800
you aren’t mad at me, right?

266
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,510
I didn’t do it on purpose.

267
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,099
Well, but how could you be mad at me?

268
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,250
You’re my slave.

269
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,710
My friends have already left.

270
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,020
Hurry up and clean the room.

271
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,970
What’s with you?

272
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,110
Is there anything else you want me to do?

273
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,870
I’m hungry.

274
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,220
Cook me something.

275
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,620
Hey. You know full well I can’t cook.

276
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,320
You already tasted the food I cooked last time, didn’t you?

277
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,290
You still want me to do it?

278
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,070
Cook something else this time.

279
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,760
There are some ingredients in the refrigerator.

280
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,820
Go ahead.

281
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,710
You can do it.

282
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:53,900
Fine.

283
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,940
This is the only dish I can cook.

284
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,810
Also, there’re only these ingredients in your refrigerator.

285
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,620
Try it.

286
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,700
How could you even eat it?

287
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,990
It’s freaking salty.

288
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,170
Let’s order something to eat.

289
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,100
We can’t eat it.

290
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,980
Hold on. What are you doing?

291
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,140
I’m throwing it away.

292
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,150
Is it even edible?

293
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,250
I’m okay with it.

294
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,740
It’s not that bad.

295
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,620
Put it down.

296
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,370
Put it down.

297
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,290
This guy’s mood seriously swings, huh?

298
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,510
Something must have gotten into him.

299
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,510
Look at how comfortably you’re sleeping.

300
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
You left me out there, feeling achy alone.

301
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,000
Hey. What’s up?

302
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,070
(♪ On the full moon night of the twelfth month ♪)

303
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,540
(♪ The river is filled with tons of water ♪)

304
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,550
What’s with you?

305
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,900
(Loy Krathong.)

306
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,230
(Today is Loy Krathong Day.)

307
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,860
Loy Krathong?

308
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,170
I’m not feeling it.

309
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:03,650
I’m not going out today.

310
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,710
(Deal. See you in the evening.)

311
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,550
- (Today’s theme is scotch shirts.)
- No way.

312
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,760
I told you I’m not going.

313
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,540
Q.

314
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,980
Q!

315
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,540
Thank you

316
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,300
When are they showing up?

317
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,330
You’re eating all the time.

318
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,280
It’s yummy.

319
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,200
When will we ditch the matching outfits for the festival?

320
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,850
You’re complaining, but you’re wearing it yourself.

321
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,460
Why?

322
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,160
We’re here as a squad, so we need matching outfits.

323
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,860
Cool, isn’t it?

324
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,440
Anyway.

325
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,340
Where is Tan?

326
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,610
He’s playing a friendship ambassador over there.

327
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,820
There he is.

328
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,870
Hi, my friends.

329
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,120
I thought you’re from the 4Kings movie.

330
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,900
Sure thing.

331
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,210
Here comes my gang.

332
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,930
I’ll introduce them to you.

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,870
This is Phum.

334
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,510
I guess you guys already know him.

335
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,030
Beer and Mick are my engineering buddies.

336
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,840
That’s Khaofang, Phum’s brother.

337
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,180
He’s my future boyfriend.

338
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:57,970
Hello.

339
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,530
You don’t have to be so formal.

340
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,070
We’re same-year students now,

341
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,020
so we can be friends.

342
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,950
You said that yourself.

343
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
Eh? Relax, Q.

344
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,900
Calm down, buddy.

345
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
I’m performing tonight.

346
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,660
Will you all stay and check it out?

347
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,010
No.

348
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,490
Seriously?

349
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,550
I’m kidding.

350
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,310
Well, how about we split up and roam the fair?

351
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,320
Then, we’ll meet later in front of the stage.

352
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,730
Good idea.

353
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,720
Fang, let’s go.

354
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,780
What?

355
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,560
Guys, let’s go.

356
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,090
Are you thinking the same thing?

357
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,080
Definitely.

358
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,500
I feel we can get along, Pun.

359
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,720
Let’s go, comrade.

360
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,660
Sure, my comrade.

361
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,550
Hey, wait.

362
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,980
When did they become close?

363
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,780
I’ll get ready.

364
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,340
Hey.

365
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,300
Wait for me.

366
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,710
Let’s go.

367
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,060
Why did you drag me here?

368
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,230
To check out the fair.

369
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,340
Don’t you think I probably wanted to go with someone else?

370
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,580
Oh?

371
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,500
Why?

372
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,280
You don’t want to walk with me?

373
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,490
Fine. Where are you taking me?

374
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,280
Lead the way.

375
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,950
How about buying a krathong?

376
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,260
Let’s go.

377
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,350
- Let’s buy a krathong.
[Loy Krathong, 2023]

378
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,580
I’ll get this one, please.

379
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,420
Just one?

380
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:34,930
Yes.

381
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:35,660
Come.

382
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Let’s float it now.

383
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,500
You aren’t waiting for me.

384
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Are we floating it now?

385
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,620
It will be crowded at night.

386
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,840
Let’s float it now while there aren’t many people.

387
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,840
We’ve got only one krathong?

388
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,290
Let’s float it together.

389
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,180
Let’s do it.

390
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,160
Bye-bye.

Yeah?

393

Well,

we…

395
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,980
Can we start dating?

396
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,750
Well, I like you.

397
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,490
Yes.

398
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,180
Huh?

399
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,670
I said, yes.

400
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,640
Oh, I’m sorry.

401
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,540
I was carried away.

402
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,770
Can I hold your hand?

403
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,980
From now on,

404
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,540
can I call you babe?

405
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,310
Uh-huh.

406
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:35,980
Babe.

407
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,410
Oh, I’m shy.

408
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,200
I’m going crazy.

409
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,290
Crazy.

410
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,140
I’m blushing.

411
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,970
Can I give you a cheek kiss?

412
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,520
Can I?

413
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,660
You’d better be quick,

414
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,340
or others will spot us.

415
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,010

416
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,770
Chain.

417
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,540
You came solo?

418
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,760
Nope.

419
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,990
I’m meeting up with some friends, too.

420
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,740
Have fun.

421
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,830

Mick, why did you look at my friend like that?

423
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,860
Oh, nothing.

424
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,840
Your friend is lovely.

425
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,640
Hello, Fah.

426
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,940
I’m at the Loy Krathong fair

427
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,000
with my friends today.

428
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,260
Let’s meet another time.

429
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,460
I’m so tired of you, Chain.

430
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,800
You know every girl in the university, don’t you?

431
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,060
You know what? I have seen all of his ex-girlfriends.

432
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,820
You’re exaggerating, Pun.

433
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,820
Let’s just forget about him.

434
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,310
Mick, my comrade, let’s have fun at this fair.

435
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,050
There are so many riveting things here, thee.

436
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,680
When it’s time for Q, our comrade, to perform on stage,

437
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,820
we shall stop walking around.

438
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,120
Why are you using old-fashioned words?

439
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,170
This is a Loy Krathong fair, my comrade Chain.

440
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,990
Let’s rejoice in it,

441

Let’s go, my comrade Mick.

443
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,620
He said, comrade.

444
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,180
They’ve just known each other for one day, haven’t they?

445
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,380
What now?

446
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,300
Let’s roll, Beer, my comrade.

447

Let’s go, Chain, my comrade.

448
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,330
Hold on.

449
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,860
Excuse me, how much is it?

450
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,840
It’s 150 THB.

451
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,700
150?

452
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,350
Do you think it’s cute?

453
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,700
What’s your age again?

454
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,540
How much is this one?

455
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,780
Nice tees.

456
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,210
Do you want one?

457
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,280
Peem, Phum.

458
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,460
Toey, you’re here too?

459
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,700
Yep.

460
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,960
Well, you two are together again.

461
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
You told me you weren’t dating, didn’t you?

462
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,010
Come on.

463
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,330
Others are also here with us.

464
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,660
We’ve just split up,

465
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,990
so it’s just the 2 of us now.

466
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,810
Q is singing today?

467
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,540
Yes,

468
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,490
but it will be a while before he performs.

469
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,270
Where are you two going?

470
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,970
Nowhere.

471
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,260
We’re just walking around.

472
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,070
Let’s go to our faculty’s booth.

473
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,630
Huh?

474
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,980
Take Phum with us.

475
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,580
Come now.

476
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,080
Come with me now.

Matt, look at who I’m bringing with me.

479
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,690
Oh? Peem.

480
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,710
I’ll take one.

481
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,710
Take it.

482
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,850
But I don’t have any cash with me.

483
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,460
Don’t worry. It’s on me.

484
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,110
Phum, you’re always kind.

485
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,860
Buy one for Peem, too.

486
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,410
Huh?

487
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,950
No, thanks.

488
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,250
Let’s sit over there, okay?

489
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000

Toey!

495
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,680
You’re making my hair messy.

496
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,650
Not contacting me at all is worse than this little hair mess.

497
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,630
I asked Phum to find you at your house, but you weren’t there.

498
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,480
But I’m here to meet you in person now.

507
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,730

Hurry up.

00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,300
Let’s go.

564
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,610
You’re terrible at this.

565
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,600
Watch me.

566
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,540
Oho.

567
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,970
Go ahead.

568
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,800
Shit.

569
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,000
You’re really good at this.

570
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,160
You’re even better than Tan.

571
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,100
Excuse me,

572
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,340
I’ll take that white buffalo doll, please.

573
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,860
Thank you.

574
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,460
Take it.

575
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,890
It looks like you.

576
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,450
Are you indirectly insulting me?

577
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,620
I think it looks more like you.

578
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,910
Take a look.

579
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,970
It’s like you.

580
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,910
You.

581
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,600
Hold it for me.

582
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,460
What?

583
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,990
You said you’d be kind to me today.

584
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,980
You’re so demanding, Peem.

585
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,320
You’re so demanding, Peem.

586
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,600
Peem.

587
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,340
Huh?

588
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Why are you zoning out?

589
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,420
Do you want to float a krathong or not?

590
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,120
Follow me.

591
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,530
I do.

592
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,500
How was it?

593
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,980
Did you enjoy my band performance?

594
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,300
You excel at the guitar.

595
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,420
Absolutely, buddy.

596
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,110
That sounded really genuine.

597
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,850
Agreed.

598
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,550
But I don’t get why you didn’t make me a lead vocalist.

599
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,360
If you were,

600
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,320
I’m sure all the audience would run away.

601
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,470
You’re defaming me.

602
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,400
Where is Peem?

603
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,440
No clue.

604
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:20,830
When I turned to him,

605
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,970
he was gone.

606
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,010
Have all of you floated your krathongs?

607
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,100
I haven’t.

608
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,860
Well, we already did.

609
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,180
Same here.

610
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,220
Come on.

611
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,500
This isn’t fun.

612
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,230
I want to float one.

613
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,700
Can you guys accompany me?

614
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,810
But you have just finished your performance,

615
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,360
so, I guess you haven’t floated yours yet.

616
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,440
Come with me.

617
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,460
Please.

618
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,920
Why must I go with you?

619
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,770
Hey, go with him.

620
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,230
Go.

621
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,360
No way.

622
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,710
Accompany him.

623
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,220
Don’t you think it’s too mean to let him go alone?

624
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,990
Look. He’s begging you.

625
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,220
Don’t you feel sorry for him?

626
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,020
Fine. I’ll go.

627
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,230
Well, then,

628
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,980
should we split up now?

629
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,380
Right?

630
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,120
See you later.

631
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,210
Bye-bye.

632
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,850
Q, let’s go now before the shops close.

633
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,820
Hurry up.

634
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,580
I’ll take this one, please.

635
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,430
That will be 40 THB.

636
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,200
Won’t you buy one?

637
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,740
I have no cash now.

638
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,980
Can you buy it for me?

639
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,490
If you don’t have any cash,

640
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,170
don’t buy it.

641
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,540
I really didn’t bring any money.

642
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,970
Well, can I float this with you?

643
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,750
Just do whatever you want.

644
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,500
As you wish.

645
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,360
Happy now?

646
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,940
Would you like to buy a krathong?

647
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,540
Is this the last one?

648
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,900
Yes, it is.

649
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,080
It’s beautiful.

650
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,950
How much is it?

651
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,680
300 THB.

652
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,170
I will give you a discount too.

653
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,080
Here you are.

654
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,580
It’s 300 THB, right?

655
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,440
Yes.

656
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,410
You can keep the change,

657
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,210
but can you please make another one for us?

658
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,050
I’ve run out of banana leaves already.

659
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,280
I only have a trunk and some flowers left.

660
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,530
That will do.

661
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:50,990
Sure.

662
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,320
I’ll get it done for you quickly.

663
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,570
Just a moment, please.

664
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,280
You want it?

665
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,620
Nope. I don’t.

666
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,020
I just don’t like

667
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,630
how someone like you always ends up with the good stuff.

668
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,980
Someone like me?

669
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,940
What’s wrong with someone like me?

670
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,580
What?

671
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:11,660
Well,

672
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
you have a terrible personality.

673
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,970
How so?

674
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:18,760
Do you want me to explain it?

675
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,350
You’re mean

676
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,680
and power-crazy.

677
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,970
Who else would say they would only be kind today?

678
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:25,830
That person must be unusual.

679
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,020
They must be heartless.

680
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,540
What if I have it?

681
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,300
What…do you have?

682
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,140
Feelings in my heart.

683
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,690
You do, of course.

684
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,900
Who on earth doesn’t have a heart?

685
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:56,920
Without a heart, you must be dead already.

686
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,810
Here’s your krathong.

687
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,540
That’s the best I could manage.

688
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:03,340
No worries.

689
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,140
Thank you so much.

690
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,870
Alright. Let’s go.

691
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,970
Thank you.

692
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,070
You’re welcome.

693
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,020
Thank you.

694
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,380
When will you stop making fun of my krathong?

695
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,940
Look at its size.

696
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,100
Why?

697
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,190
What’s wrong with this size?

698
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:25,960
Nothing.

699
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,940
It’s cute.

700
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,210
Oh, really?

701
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,020
You think it’s cute?

702
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,920
Cute?

703
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,860
Yeah. It is.

704
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,180
One set of sparklers, please.

705
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:38,810
Thank you.

706
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,380
Here you are.

707
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,960
Can we float the krathongs already?

708
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,960
I think they want to get into the water so bad now.

709
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,560
Handsome?

710
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:07,320
Huh?

711
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,960
I’ve seen you stare at me several times.

712
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,460
So, do you think I’m handsome or not?

713
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:17,920
Hold on.

714
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,610
Make a wish first.

715
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,610
Do like this.

716
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,580
Do you think my krathong will sink?

717
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,490
It won’t.

718
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,700
Mine will keep yours afloat.

719
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,740
Sparklers.

720
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,660
We must do it like this.

721
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,500
Whoa. It’s beautiful.

722
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,240
Light yours up with mine.

723
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,470
Like this?

724
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,330
You can draw something in the air.

725
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,330
Are you sure

726
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,320
you don’t want me to drive you home?

727
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,630
I have to continue working.

728
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,630
At this late hour?

729
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,730
It’s typical for Fine Arts majors.

730
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,660
If you go inside,

731
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,780
you’ll see that many of my friends are still working.

732
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,100
Which room?

733
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,640
Should I accompany you?

734
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,600
No, that’s okay.

735
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,460
I had a lot of fun today.

736
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,630
I’ve never gotten to do something like this before.

737
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,550
My parents usually can’t make time for me.

738
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,500
Only Fang and Beer can make time to play with me.

739
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,320
Thank you.

740
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,540
(You’ve got a tall nose,)

741
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,320
(lovely eyes,)

742
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,930
(and a handsome face.)

743
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,610
The Fine Arts Faculty is hosting a gallery today.

744
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,180
Someone like you is here to watch art?

745
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,130
Have you finished re-painting that work?

746
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:56,920
Not yet.

747
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,920
So, I guess you have to keep seeing me around for a long time.

748
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,300
Buddy, your work is showcased in the gallery,

749
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,290
so I must congratulate you, of course.

750
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,280
Cheers!

751
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,440
Let’s play a game, shall we?

752
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,160
King's Cup.

753
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:07,960
I’m the King!

754
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,820
Number 1,

755
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:09,960
you must kiss number 2 on the forehead.

756
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,650
Oh, shit.

757
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,450
My turn as King.

758
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,620
Number 2 and number 6,

759
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,480
kiss each other on the cheek.
