5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:17,900
Q,

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,810
do you really like me?

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,500
I wouldn’t kiss someone I didn’t like.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,150
The only person

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,310
who can make me fall in love again must be you.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,080
Hang on.

11
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:24,710
Let’s go.

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,110
Hey.

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,080
Or did you tell me you haven’t finished it

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,020
because you want to have me around?

15
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,800
You didn’t agree to cancel our deal either.

16
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,550
Do you like me?

17
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,960
DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

18
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,380
Is something bothering you, Peem?

19
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:10,780
Well,

20
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,070
recently I’ve felt pretty unconfident about my work.

21
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,850
I don’t know if what I’ve done is good enough.

22
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,020
That feeling is normal, Peem.

23
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,970
Creating art is about exploring what you like.

24
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,500
Whether you realize it or not,

25
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,960
and whether intentionally or unintentionally,

26
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:40,130
every work you create contains a piece of you, more or less.

27
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,500
What’s wrong?

28
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,200
Got scolded by Prof.Po?

29
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,220
No.

30
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,170
Damn it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me recently.

31
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,130
I can’t come up with any ideas for my work.

32
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,390
It’s like my brain has gone blank.

33
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,860
We’re art students.

34
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,620
That’s why we need to use our thoughts all the time.

35
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,360
I think it’s normal to feel stuck sometimes.

36
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,150
The best way is to take a break for a while,

37
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,260
or stop thinking about work.

38
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,779
Do something you want to do.

39
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,420
Or if you don’t want to do anything, just don’t.

40
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,930
Just lie down and do nothing.

41
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,130
If I start working when the deadline is approaching,

42
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,840
you’ll scold me again then.

43
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,130
Last time, you weren’t out of ideas. You were just being lazy.

44
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,150
Anyway, I’m watching Toey skateboard this evening.

45
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:38,780
Do you want to come along?

46
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,880
What?

47
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,130
You won’t take your eyes off him at all.

48
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,550
Are you two dating already?

49
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,630
What?

50
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,430
Not yet.

51
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,180
What are you waiting for?

52
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,330
So, are you coming or not?

53
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,570
No.

54
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,600
I’ll head home and sleep.

55
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,270
Are you sure?

56
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,680
Yep.

57
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,150
I need some rest.

58
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:06,950
Whatever.

59
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,240
Where are you going?

60
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,630
I don’t have the energy to argue with you today.

61
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,909
What’s wrong?

62
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,700
There, there.

63
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,230
What’s wrong?

64
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,650
Are you alright?

65
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,630
Can you tell me already what’s wrong?

66
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,230
This isn’t like you.

67
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,400
What am I supposed to be like then?

68
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,430
Well, you usually talk a lot

69
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,400
and make a fuss often.

70
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,280
You’re a bit annoying.

71
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,590
You’re usually livelier.

72
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,010
You surround everyone with your positive energy.

73
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,160
So, what’s wrong?

74
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,290
I’m just a bit stressed about my assignment.

75
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,410
I can’t come up with ideas.

76
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,120
What do you usually do when you're stuck?

77
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,010
Well, I go somewhere that makes me feel at ease.

78
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,390
Somewhere that makes you feel at ease?

79
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,360
Somewhere with water.

80
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
Beaches,

81
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,770
somewhere by the water,

82
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,400
or rivers.

83
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,340
When I’m near the water

84
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,690
and see it flow,

85
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,960
I feel happy and comfortable.

86
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,180
How about going to the beach then?

87
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,030
Let’s go now.

88
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,120
I’ll take you there.

89
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,730
You’re overreacting.

90
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,170
Why?

91
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,390
Is it too far?

92
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,120
I’ve got an idea.

93
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,390
I’ll take you somewhere.

94
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,730
Follow me.

95
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,680
Here?

96
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,750
It’s the only place with water that I could think of.

97
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,040
Why?

98
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,650
How are you feeling now?

99
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,810
Better?

100
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,210
Hey.

101
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,280
You’re teasing me, right?

102
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,290
Hey.

103
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,660
Phum.

104
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,540
Phum!

105
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,420
Get in the water.

106
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,890
Come here.

107
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,380
Stop.

108
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:27,820
I can’t breathe.

109
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,870
I can’t breathe.

110
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,230
I can’t breathe.

111
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,490
So, how are you feeling now?

112
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,030
Better?

113
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,030
Yep.

114
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,490
Thanks a lot.

115
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,470
If this place makes you feel good,

116
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,490
come here whenever you want.

117
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,980
I want to become water, too.

118
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,410
Why?

119
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,730
I want to be the reason you feel good.

120
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,110
Honestly, it feels good to be with you.

121
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,600
Pardon?

122
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,120
It feels good to be with you.

123
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,810
I couldn’t hear it clearly.

124
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,110
Can you come closer and say it?

125
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,060
Close enough?

126
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,140
What if I say I want it even closer?

127
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,070
Is this too close?

128
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,150
Do you want me to step back?

129
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,320
You want to play like this, huh?

130
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,390
Let’s go.

131
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,730
Hey, Toey?

132
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,050
What are you doing here?

133
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,840
This painting workshop studio is our faculty’s.

134
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,200
Let me use it, too.

135
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,740
Of course,

136
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,450
if that’s what you ask.

137
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:43,960
What’s wrong?

138
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,440
Did your foot get stuck in your throat or what?

139
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,870
Are you almost done, Q?

140
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,690
You said you’d skateboard with me, didn’t you?

141
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,440
I’m almost done.

142
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,200
Just a second.

143
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,210
You’re waiting for Q, right?

144
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,000
Take a seat.

145
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,580
I’m leaving.

146
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,180
See you.

147
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,500
I’m almost done.

148
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,960
Just a second.

149
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,260
Even if I have to watch you draw until I die,

150
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,460
I won’t get bored.

151
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,170
But I won’t let you die.

152
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,560
You must stick with me for a long time.

153
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,640
No matter how often I see your work,

154
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,220
I’m still not used to it.

155
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,790
That was since I saw your work at Oh’s cafe.

156
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,600
It was when I realized how great art could be

157
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,770
for someone like me with no life goal.

158
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,080
Back then, you told me you’d find what you liked.

159
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,270
When I found it, Pencil Senior had disappeared.

160
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,640
You knew it all along that I was Pencil Senior?

161
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,980
I saw you at the cafe often

162
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,490
and figured out later that you’re Pencil Senior.

163
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
But it’s I who never looked for you.

164
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,060
It’s alright.

165
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,480
We’ve met now.

166
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,770
What happened after I disappeared?

167
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,370
After you disappeared,

168
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,410
I studied for the Fine Arts admission exam,

169
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,710
and I made it.

170
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,690
Do you know why?

171
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,270
It’s because of the last message you left.

172
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:52,600
“No matter what you do, I’m always rooting for you.”

173
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,960
Back then, I didn’t expect to see Pencil Senior again.

174
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,250
When I met you at the university,

175
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,190
I was really in shock.

176
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,460
I’ve also become your mentee.

177
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,330
What a coincidence.

178
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,920
Exactly.

179
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,560
It’s such a coincidence

180
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,360
that it scared me.

181
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,570
Do you know how hard it was

182
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,560
to keep this whole thing a secret?

183
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,510
But luckily, Matt was there for me.

184
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,450
I felt a lot more comfortable talking to him.

185
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,920
Why didn’t you tell me at all?

186
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,640
I was afraid you’d disappear again.

187
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,990
I won’t disappear anymore.

188
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,730
You’re still using it?

189
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,350
Uh-huh.

190
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,780
My grandpa gave it to me.

191
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,080
If you hadn’t picked it up, it would have been lost.

192
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,500
How nice.

193
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,090
It’s nice.

194
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,750
It’s nice because I picked it up for you?

195
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,910
It’s nice that you picked it up,

196
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,570
and it’s also nice having you here.

197
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,890
Q!

198
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,490
You know what?

199
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,890
I was super happy you found it.

200
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,400
Hey, are you almost done drawing?

201
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,150
I want to skateboard already.

202
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,910
Alright.

203
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,780
I’ll speed up.

204
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,460
It’s almost done.

205
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,070
Okay.

206
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:15,470
He can’t skateboard but always accompanies you here.

207
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,349
He just wants a change of atmosphere to draw his work.

208
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,550
Isn’t he here to watch over you?

209
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,030
Nonsense.

210
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,839
You guys go ahead.

211
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,990
I’ll join you soon.

212
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,300
Q.

213
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,360
What were you guys whispering about?

214
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,000
Were you gossiping about me?

215
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,690
They just said you can’t skateboard,

216
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,250
but you’re just sitting here and acting handsome.

217
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,690
I’m not acting.

218
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,990
I’m just sitting.

219
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,990
Are you saying you’re naturally handsome?

220
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,770
Do you think I’m handsome?

221
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,630
Toey, what do you think?

222
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,880
Is Q handsome?

223
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,750
I’ll continue playing.

224
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,940
Take a shower now,

225
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,420
so you won’t catch a cold.

226
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,180
Wear my clothes then.

227
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,350
You don’t have to worry about me that much.

228
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,190
I’m super healthy.

229
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,050
I won’t get sick easily.

230
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,480
Tonight, sleep here.

231
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,970
Why should I?

232
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,410
By the time you finish showering,

233
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,300
it will be late already.

234
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Also, I’m now too lazy to drive you home.

235
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,450
It’s alright.

236
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,330
I can head home myself.

237
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,240
Sleep here.

238
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,600
Please.

239
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,170
Ouch.

240
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,680
Mosquitoes.

241
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,130
Has my babe finished working yet?

242
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,510
It’s taking him so long.

243
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,200
Babe.

244
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,820
You finished so late.

245
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,190
Are you tired?

246
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,540
Are you tired?

247
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,590
I’m sorry for keeping you waiting so late.

248
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,820
Why are you smiling?

249
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:58,880
Well,

250
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,190
you’re…cute, babe.

251
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,980
You don’t like it?

252
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,710
I like it, of course.

253
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,940
Actually, I like every version of you.

254
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,420
But save this version as a bonus treat once in a while

255
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,220
to give me a bubbly feeling.

256
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,820
I’m hungry already.

257
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,650
Let’s eat, babe.

258
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,590
What did you just call me?

259
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,000
Did you just call me babe?

260
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,110
Come back here and call me babe.

261
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:22,380
Hurry up.

262
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,000
I didn’t say that.

263
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,200
Come back and call me babe.

264
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,550
My bag.

265
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,460
My bag.

266
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,450
Babe, wait for me.

267
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,450
Wait for me.

268
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,520
I didn’t say that.

269
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,520
Pun, what are you doing here?

270
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,260
Hey, help.

271
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,640
I found it under the tree on my way home.

272
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,410
It has been bitten by ants, too,

273
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,510
but I got rid of them already.

274
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,630
What are you doing here then?

275
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,560
You’re a doctor, aren’t you?

276
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,730
I’m a dentist.

277
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,830
Aren’t all doctors the same?

278
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,550
Hey.

279
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,630
I’m a dentist, not a vet.

280
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,830
Alright.

281
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,250
Let’s go.

282
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,560
Where to?

283
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,990
Let’s take Tiny to the vet.

284
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,850
I named it Penguin, not Tiny.

285
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,900
You’ve just found it but already named it?

286
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,430
Yeah.

287
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,020
I named it just now.

288
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,020
Let’s go.

289
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,150
That way.

290
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,290
Be gentle with it.

291
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:38,840
Phum.

292
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,000
Eh?

293
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,640
I thought you were a doll.

294
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,620
You look like one of them.

295
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,250
Go already.

296
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:44,760
Let go.

297
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,280
Come with me.

298
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,360
Let’s go to bed.

299
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,860
Hey.

300
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,430
What are you doing?

301
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:47,980
Phum.

302
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,550
Hey.

303
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,090
Hey.

304
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,830
Phum!

305
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,150
What’s this?

306
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,060
Get up.

307
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,390
You carried me here,

308
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,630
and now you’re asking me to get up?

309
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,440
Go ahead.

310
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,080
I’m going to sleep now.

311
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,310
I didn’t expect you’d like dolls this much.

312
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,540
I need to hug something while sleeping.

313
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,190
Why are you hugging me now?

314
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,500
You have plenty of dolls.

315
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,490
Pick one of them to hug.

316
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,340
It’s alright.

317
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,300
You’re as soft as them.

318
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,500
I’ll let you hug me tonight only.

319
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,550
Think of it as a gift

320
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,260
for making me feel better.

321
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,610
Sure.

322
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,800
Let’s do something else other nights, then.

323
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,330
Huh?

324
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,910
Phum.

325
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,270
What did you say?

326
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:52,890
Phum.

327
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,560
Seriously?

328
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,800
I’m sorry.

329
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,890
I talked in my sleep.

330
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,090
Wake up already.

331
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,840
Hey. Wake up.

332
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,900
Are you sick?

333
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,500
I’ll be alright after taking a shower.

334
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,830
Who told you to shower when you have a cold?

335
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,550
How did you grow up?

336
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,890
Just like this.

337
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,320
I’m still alive, obviously.

338
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,690
If you’re scared, stay away from me then.

339
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,690
You chased me away,

340
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,370
but you’re still hugging me like this.

341
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,200
I’m not scared of catching a cold from you.

342
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,640
Just this? I won’t catch it.

343
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,230
Go. Take a shower already.

344
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,870
Or do you want me to help you take a shower?

345
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,830
You’d better be quick.

346
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,370
What do you think?

347
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,820
Do you feel comfy wearing my clothes?

348
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,980
Nice.

349
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,980
You can sleep over often, then.

350
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,210
Eat it quickly.

351
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,200
I’ll get back to work.

352
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,020
What?

353
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,230
I thought you wanted to stay together longer.

354
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,460
If you don’t eat it now,

355
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,250
I’ll go myself.

356
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,600
Wait for me.

357
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,590
Let’s stay together.

358
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,730
Please.

359
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,080
Eat.

360
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,840
I’ll get going.

361
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,240
Let that doll keep you company.

362
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,750
It can’t substitute you.

363
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,840
Hello?

364
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,350
(Q, help!)

365
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,150
Toey, what’s going on?

366
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,610
(Help!)

367
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,440
What’s going on?!

368
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,350
(Help!)

369
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,040
Toey, what’s wrong?

370
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,920
Are you hurt?

371
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,690
Who hurt you?

372
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,370
I hurt myself.

373
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:33,430
Huh?

374
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,670
You’re Peem’s bro,

375
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,330
but that doesn’t mean you must behave like him.

376
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,030
A deadline is the due date of your work.

377
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,090
It’s not the first day you start working on it.

378
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:45,990
Got it?

379
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,750
I’m sorry.

380
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,740
I can’t apologize enough.

381
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,740
I’ll let this slide only once.

382
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,410
If you do this again, I won’t help you.

383
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,780
I’ll let you miss the deadline

384
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,190
and the professor will deduct your score,

385
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,010
so you will learn a lesson.

386
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,340
I won’t let this happen again.

387
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,550
I can’t repay you enough for helping me this time.

388
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,260
Let me know what you want me to do to return the favor.

389
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,440
I’m willing to do anything.

390
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,790
Eh?

391
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,280
You want me to sharpen your pencils?

392
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,050
Sure.

393
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:26,930
Nope.

394
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,600
I want you to draw on this pencil case.

395
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,110
Draw on this pencil case?

396
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,250
I won’t do it.

397
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,990
It can’t be erased, can it?

398
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,790
I don't dare do it.

399
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,440
You only draw on paper or what?

400
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,010
When you grow up,

401
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,390
your work needs to improve.

402
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,240
It will keep getting more difficult.

403
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,000
Take this as a practice.

404
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,980
But your grandpa gave you this pencil case.

405
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:03,000
Is it a good idea to practice on something important to you?

406
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,100
Yes.

407
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,580
When my important item and my important person are put together,

408
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,000
it’s easier for me to take care of both.

409
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,230
What do you mean?

410
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,590
Just do it.

411
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,940
Thanks for sending me here.

412
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,600
What’s up?

413
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,760
You have a morning class?

414
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,230
Strange question.

415
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,580
We’re taking the same class.

416
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,340
Head back to class.

417
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,960
Take care of your friend.

418
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,280
He’s sick but won’t see a doctor.

419
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,640
Don’t worry about him.

420
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,570
He won’t die easily.

421
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,880
Eat and take some pills.

422
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,210
If you’re feeling unwell, call me.

423
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,970
Alright.

424
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,800
Get going.

425
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,050
Let’s go.

426
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,610
Both of us.

427
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,280
Are you possessed by a ghost or something?

428
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,200
Why are you in such a good mood?

429
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,920
I’m just in the mood for work.

430
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,420
I told you at the beginning of the year that

431
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,020
I would work hard.

432
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,140
I won’t procrastinate anymore.

433
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,410
You were still moody yesterday,

434
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,760
complaining you couldn’t come up with ideas.

435
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,770
Phum said you’re sick.

436
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,540
Are you alright now?

437
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,870
He was just exaggerating.

438
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,240
I just coughed a bit after waking up.

439
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,520
Well, I’ll stay here until late.

440
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,330
Are you staying with me?

441
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,410
Nope.

442
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,960
Stay alone.

443
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,460
After I finish mine,

444
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,250
I’ll head back home

445
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,250
and sleep for 2 days and 2 nights.

446
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,570
Sleep for me, too.

447
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,320
Sure.

448
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,480
Eh? Matt?

449
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,640
What are you doing?

450
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,500
I’m supposed to ask you, Toey.

451
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,860
I’m working on an important item.

452
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,330
What is it?

453
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,740
I won’t tell you.

454
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,140
You won’t?

455
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,830
You’re shortsighted?

456
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,220
See you later.

457
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,810
I see you passionate about work only once in a while.

458
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,270
You jerk.

459
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,810
What can I get for you?

460
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,690
Green Tea, please.

461
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,480
Hey? Beer?

462
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,820
Can I ask you something?

463
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,700
What is it?

464
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,260
Well, I don’t know how to start.

465
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,870
But…

466
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,650
About Phum?

467
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,250
Uh-huh.

468
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,300
How could you know?

469
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,020
I made a correct guess, didn’t I?

470
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,580
Yep.

471
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,330
What is it about?

472
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,940
Well, I just want to know what kind of person he is.

473
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,020
I’m just asking, you know.

474
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,940
I didn’t say anything.

475
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,370
What kind of person do you think he is?

476
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,630
Why did you ask me the same question, huh?

477
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,380
I want to know how you see him.

478
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,590
Well,

479
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,960
he likes to act cool.

480
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,750
He’s self-centered, stubborn,

481
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,160
and childish.

482
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,080
Though you see him like that,

483
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Phum is actually very sensitive.

484
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,410
He’s sensitive?

485
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,960
Look at what he did to me.

486
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,130
That he made you his slave?

487
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,500
How did you know?

488
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,570
He told me,

489
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,840
but I didn’t tell anyone.

490
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,510
Honestly,

491
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,890
I didn’t agree with that

492
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,020
because it isn't right for him to treat you like that.

493
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,020
You might think I’m siding with my friend,

494
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,990
but trust me, Phum isn't as mean as he seems.

495
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,010
He was sent to live abroad when he was young.

496
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,970
That was when we were about 4-5 years old.

497
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,520
His family business faced a problem,

498
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,750
but I didn’t know why his dad sent him there alone to live with relatives.

499
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,150
Because of this, Phum has turned his back on the world.

500
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,670
From a kid who used to be clingy to his mom and his brother,

501
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,000
and enjoyed playing around with friends,

502
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,230
he had to live away from home

503
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,200
where he couldn’t even understand what people talked about.

504
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,430
So, he only stayed in his room with the doll his mom gave him  as a reminder of her.

505
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,980
A teddy bear?

506
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,910
You went to his room often, right?

507
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,750
Continue.

508
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,630
He came back to Thailand to attend secondary school.

509
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,400
But I felt he has changed.

510
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,920
His parents couldn't make time for him either.

511
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,980
Imagine this.

512
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,390
Even on his birthday,

513
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,150
his parents celebrated their client’s birthday instead.

514
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,790
He came to my room and cried.

515
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,790
I was angry at his parents then,

516
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,770
wondering why they devoted that much time to work.

517
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,420
They probably thought that it was for their family.

518
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,450
They did the best thing for their kids.

519
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,050
But I’m glad Phum has got to know you.

520
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,550
He seems in a good mood

521
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,670
and a lot livelier these days.

522
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,660
He’s in a good mood because he gets to tease me, I guess.

523
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,980
Talking to you, I feel relieved now.

524
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,030
Take care of my friend for me.

525
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,980
What?

526
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,110
Me? Take care of him?

527
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,429
I’m off to class.

528
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:09,969
See you later.

529
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,650
What’s with him?

530
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,610
Don’t worry.

531
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,650
The professor always gives us such harsh comments.

532
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,679
I’ll grab something to eat.

533
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,710
See you later.

534
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,239
See you.

535
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,270
Fang.

536
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:56,880
What are you doing here?

537
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,600
Why didn’t you answer my calls?

538
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,970
Eh? You called?

539
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:04,890
Oh.

540
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,730
3 missed calls.

541
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,630
I’m sorry.

542
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,550
I was doing a quiz.

543
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,000
I couldn’t hear it.

544
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,280
I had my phone on mute.

545
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,870
Is something wrong?

546
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,150
That’s obvious.

547
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,320
I can tell.

548
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,630
Who upset you?

549
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,480
Tell me.

550
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,570
I’ll handle them.

551
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,560
I’ll punch them like this.

552
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,180
Do you think I’m unreasonable?

553
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,600
Why are you asking that?

554
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,440
I’m stressed about the work I submitted to the professor today.

555
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,310
The feedback wasn’t quite good.

556
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,080
That’s why I was being unreasonable to you

557
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,350
because you didn’t pick up my calls.

558
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,750
Come on.

559
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,360
Don’t say that.

560
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,720
My cute nose boy.

561
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,670
To me, my babe is always cute.

562
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,200
You’ve never been unreasonable.

563
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,110
How was my digital dodge?

564
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,640
Let’s eat.

565
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,730
I’m hungry already.

566
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,960
I’ll treat you to a meal

567
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,920
to compensate for not picking up your calls.

568
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,830
I’m hungry.

569
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,850
I forgot my bag.

570
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,850
Oh? I’ll grab it for you.

571
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,610
It’s always like this when I’m working, huh?

572
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,550
What’s up?

573
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,220
(What if nothing is up?)

574
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,170
(Can’t I call you?)

575
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,360
It’s good you called.

576
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,260
Come see me.

577
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,170
(Huh?)

578
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,850
Peek-a-boo!

579
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,660
It’s already late.

580
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,530
Why haven’t you gone home?

581
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,990
Your important item is ready.

582
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,690
But it’s probably not that beautiful.

583
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,730
It’s very beautiful.

584
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,630
I really like it.

585
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:30,800
Thank you.

586
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,230
You’re the best.

587
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,150
Q’s mentee is the best, of course.

588
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,720
Yeah.

589
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,370
Let’s go home.

590
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,930
Why did you ask me to meet you here?

591
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,490
Have you secretly fallen for me already?

592
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,990
Nonsense.

593
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,010
I want you to accompany me to buy some stuff.

594
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,370
Are you sure?

595
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,280
Of course.

596
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:06,830
Let’s go.

597
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,710
Let’s make it quick.

598
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,680
I have to come back and continue working.

599
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,100
Alright.

600
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,010
Let’s go.

601
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,460
What’s the difference?

602
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,450
Aren’t they all the same?

603
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:26,790
Paintbrushes?

604
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
They’re all used for painting,

605
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,060
but each type has different pros and cons.

606
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,050
This one, for example, is flat.

607
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,510
It’s used for painting wide or large areas.

608
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,360
But if you need to add details,

609
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,470
you need to use this one.

610
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,600
It’s round.

611
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,700
We can easily control it

612
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,250
since it’s small.

613
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:47,760
Why did you ask?

614
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,730
Are you interested in drawing?

615
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,010
I just want to know what you like or dislike,

616
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,460
so I can take care of you properly.

617
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,350
I can take care of myself.

618
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,720
Why?

619
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,000
I didn’t take care of you well enough last night?

620
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,610
Let’s go.

621
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,990
Let’s hurry up and pay.

622
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Are you blushing?

623
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,770
Whoa.

624
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,820
It’s spaghetti

625
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,010
again.

626
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,730
It’s the only dish I can cook.

627
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,580
Will you eat it or not?

628
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,120
I will.

629
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,950
Let me taste it.

630
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,520
It’s yummy as always, babe.

631
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,000
Aren’t you eating?

632
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,770
I’ll feed you.

633
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,330
I can eat it myself.

634
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,910
Babe, I saw a couple eating it like this in the movie.

635
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:36,930
Can we try it?

636
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,980
Can we?

637
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,510
Eating this way makes it much tastier.

638
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,080
Let’s eat again.

639
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,730
Sit down.

640
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,620
Come on.

641
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,210
Fine.

642
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,040
Thanks a lot for accompanying me.

643
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,900
You can head home already if you like.

644
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,330
What?

645
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,250
After you finished using me,

646
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,380
you’re chasing me away already?

647
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,620
That’s not what I mean.

648
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,040
I need to get back to work.

649
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,320
It’s going to be a long night ahead.

650
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,610
But I don’t want to go home now.

651
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,140
Can I stay with you?

652
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,720
You’ll feel bored.

653
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,550
Please.

654
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:41,870
Let me stay.

655
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,130
Up to you then.

656
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,400
This is your work?

657
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,770
Art students are talented.

658
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,840
Can I take a look around?

659
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,740
Go ahead.

660
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,010
But just don’t break anything.

661
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,180
If you’re bored, you can head home first.

662
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,690
You don’t have to wait for me.

663
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,060
Alright.

664
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:21,940
Babe.

665
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,460
Come on, babe.

666
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,170
You aren’t romantic at all.

667
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,160
How do I be romantic?

668
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,130
Like this.

669
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,960
And…

670
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:48,810
And…this.

671
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,050
And…

672
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:58,850
Like this.

673
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,090
Is this romantic already?

674
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:46,380
We can get even more romantic.

675
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,760
(Phum isn’t as mean as he seems.)

676
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,050
(He was sent to live abroad when he was young.)

677
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,250
(From a kid who used to be clingy to his mom and his brother,)

678
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,350
(and enjoyed playing around with friends,)

679
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,510
(he had to live away from home)

680
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,320
(where he couldn’t even understand what people talked about.)

681
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,120
(So, he only stayed in his room with the doll his mom gave him)

682
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,210
(as a reminder of her.)

683
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,540
You did a great job

684
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,280
getting through those times.

685
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,240
You’re moving your face this close to me.

686
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:46,930
Your heart could tremble.

687
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,680
Why are you sleeping here?

688
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,670
I’m waiting to drive you home.

689
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,000
You’re done already?

690
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,190
Yes. It’s done.

691
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,750
I’ll get my stuff, and we can leave.

692
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:04,910
Tomorrow, Q and other friends are drinking at my place.

693
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,600
If you’re interested, join us.

694
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,950
Bring your friends, so it will be fun.

695
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:08,870
Sure.

696
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,240
See you then.

697
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,030
Hold on.

698
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,430
Goodnight, Nong Peem.

699
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,690
Thanks, Puppy Phum.

700
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,780
(Whether you realize it or not,)

701
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,220
(and whether intentionally or unintentionally,)

702
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:20,970
(every work you create contains a piece of you, more or less.)

703
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,960
Bro, please buy my flowers.

704
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,980
Can I get one latte, please?

705
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,480
Sure.

706
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,010
Hey?

707
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,000
How could you get here?

708
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:39,910
Try this.

709
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:41,170
I made it myself.

710
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,550
What do you think?

711
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:52,580
Don’t pretend it’s not good.

712
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,720
I know I’m skilled.

713
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,160
It’s good.

714
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:57,380
Do you want a cake too?

715
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:58,280
My cafe serves delicious cakes.

716
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:58,990
I’ll get one for you.

717
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,980
Maybe next time.

718
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:04,150
Don’t you have to get back to work?

719
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,310
Oh, it’s okay.

720
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:10,940
There aren’t many customers either.

721
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,760
Your house looks nice to live in.

722
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,710
I see. You’re an architect.

723
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,130
Do you want to say something?

724
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,130
Can I ask you something?

725
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:49,810
Sure.

726
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:55,980
Do you have a crush on anyone yet?

727
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,420
[Dad]

728
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,160
Pick it up

729
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,260
in case it’s something urgent.

730
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,980
Hello. Yes?

731
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:33,270
Yes.

732
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:35,670
Now?

733
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:39,910
I’ll hurry there.

734
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:45,670
My dad called.

735
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:47,770
Something urgent is up.

736
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,170
I have to head home.

737
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,860
Go back and handle it.

738
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:02,970
Kluen.

739
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,150
I have a crush on someone already.

740
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,180
I’ll drop by again.

741
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,010
Give me that.

742
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,350
Cheers.

743
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:52,010
Eh?

744
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,420
It took you forever, my engineering peeps.

745
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,140
You left me alone for too long.

746
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,130
What are you celebrating this time?

747
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:01,990
You’re drinking again.

748
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,650
Dude, look at me.

749
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,430
Someone like me can always celebrate without special occasions

750
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,160
because I’m a drunkard.

751
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,860
Oops. I’m kidding, babe.

752
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,240
Pass me a glass.

753
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,170
You’re ordering us, huh?

754
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,410
You came late and are making orders.

755
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,040
Toey, how about the work you submitted?

756
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:20,020
Someone my level would definitely get an A.

757
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,790
Great job.

758
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,750
I’m sick of people in love.

759
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,890
Cheers to console me.

760
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:30,490
You’re talking too much.

761
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,140
I’ll hit you with a plate.

762
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:31,700
It will be broken.

763
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,840
Your head?

764
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:33,430
That plate.

765
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:34,380
My head is strong.

766
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,260
I’m strong-headed.

767
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,020
Let’s try.

768
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,020
My head is broken.

769
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,300
Let’s fight, dude.

770
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,650
Cheers, guys.

771
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,670
Cheers.

772
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,980
Hey, eat.

773
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:10,220
Great job, my dog Charlie.

774
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,600
Charlie?

775
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:14,090
One more for you.

776
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:18,190
Eat.

777
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,030
Eat.

778
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:22,750
Eat.

779
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:23,880
Can you eat it up?

780
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,840
It’s big.

781
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:29,260
I’ll help.

782
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,640
Eh?

783
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:03,910
Hey, this is not good.

784
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:04,840
Someone would ship you two as a couple.

785
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:06,200
Go ahead.

786
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,680
I like it.

787
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,690
Ship?

788
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,550
Who’s shipping me?

789
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:10,180
Who, huh?

790
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,700
Relax, bro.

791
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,050
I kind of dislike it now.

792
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,740
Nobody’s shipping me.

793
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,600
What’s wrong with you guys?

794
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,350
He’s strange.

795
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,330
I have something to say.

796
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,610
Huh?

797
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,160
Huh?

798
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:53,970
I…

799
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,590
Just say it.

800
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:06,970
What?

801
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:10,810
One more drink for me.

802
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,010
Come on.

803
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,750
I thought you were going to talk about something.

804
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:14,950
Pass me your glass.

805
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:17,970
I thought something was up.

806
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,630
Why did you make such a fuss just to ask for another drink?

807
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,110
The atmosphere was getting dull, you know.

808
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,220
I see.

809
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,000
Guys,

810
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,160
I also have something to say.

811
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:37,970
There he goes.

812
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,150
What is it?

813
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,010
If you ask for more drink like he did,

814
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,640
I’ll slap you.

815
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:44,860
Peem.

816
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:52,540
What?

817
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,290
What?

818
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:03,050
Hey?

819
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,930
Just say what you want to say.

820
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,270
I like you.

821
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:16,550
Huh?

822
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,200
Huh?

823
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,470
Huh?!

824
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:20,520
Huh?!

825
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:38,170
Since you like me,

826
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:43,220
then…

827
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,390
Eat a lot, Penguin.

828
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,640
Eat a lot, Pun.

829
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,950
Q used to be quite the playboy.

830
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,740
If you want to know if that’s true or not,

831
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:00,030
date me.

832
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:00,870
Huh?

833
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,230
[Be my boyfriend.]

834
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,060
With Peem around, Phum smiles more often.

835
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,990
Wait, are you saying Phum has started hitting on you already?

836
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:11,970
Watch it.

837
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,530
If you fall in love with me,

838
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,840
there’s no escape.

839
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,840
When will you finally know that I love you?
