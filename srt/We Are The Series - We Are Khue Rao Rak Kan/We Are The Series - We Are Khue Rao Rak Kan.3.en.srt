1
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,890
Be my slave.

2
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,650
Two months is too long.

3
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,020
I’ll do that until

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,240
I’ve finished repainting the work you ruined.

5
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:25,870
Deal.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,810
Deal.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,940
Peem, hello.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:28,880
Why are you here?

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,750
Do you know that Toey actually planned to study medicine?

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,040
Why did you end up studying Fine Arts, then?

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,680
You must help me

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,390
hit on your brother.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,240
My brother?

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,400
It’s been a while.

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,910
I thought you were dead.

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:48,960
Peem.

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,600
But you’re this drunk.

18
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,200
How could you go back?

19
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,410
Phum, give him a lift.

20
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,610
But how will you go home then?

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,910
I’ll call a cab and go with Tan.

22
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,970
Ouch.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,830
The car is leaning.

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,370
Bro, please buy these flowers.

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,680
I don’t like flowers.

26
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,680
You can buy one for someone else.

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,680
Give one to your boyfriend.

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,600
I’m sending Peem home.

29
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,640
DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

30
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,740
Eh?

31
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,380
You aren’t teaching today?

32
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,600
It’s my day off.

33
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,010
I’ll be keeping an eye on the cafe also.

34
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,220
Do you want some bread?

35
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,840
No. I’m good.

36
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,800
Grab one for yourself, Peem.

37
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,230
Last night, you were totally wasted.

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,079
Did you remember?

39
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,690
Well, it was just celebrating, you know,

40
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,670
after we handed in our project.

41
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,270
You guys seem to celebrate a lot, huh?

42
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:53,930
The other day,

43
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,460
I came home to tons of water spinach out there.

44
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,050
By the way, how did I get home last night?

45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,020
I can’t really remember.

46
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,160
Your friend dropped you off.

47
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,910
You were too drunk to come back on your own.

48
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,560
My friend?

49
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,750
I know you’re already grown up now, Peem,

50
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,860
but I want you to take care of yourself, too.

51
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,640
I got it.

52
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,950
I should head to the university now.

53
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,520
If I stay,

54
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,800
I’ll just have to hear more of your complaints.

55
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,620
See you, Auntie.

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,030
What? Hey?

57
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,110
Are you saying I’m nagging like a granddad?

58
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,960
I mean, an old auntie.

59
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,400
I've got a splitting headache.

60
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,750
Last night, you were totally plastered.

61
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,790
How did you manage to get home last night?

62
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,430
Huh?

63
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,820
I’m too lazy to work.

64
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,440
You’re always complaining you can’t meet deadlines.

65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,220
But look at you.

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,060
That’s because I’m out of inspiration.

67
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Hey. What are you up to, Toey?

68
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,790
Heading to class?

69
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,690
Yep. I have a drawing class.

70
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,210
Before the entrance exam, I had to take a drawing lesson.

71
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,890
Now that I’m already studying here, 	I still have to take it.

72
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,160
It’s a basic skill,

73
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,060
so it’s mandatory.

74
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,670
I know.

75
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,480
I’m just venting a bit.

76
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,050
You have no class now?

77
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,310
Professor has assigned the work already,

78
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,130
but we’re slacking off,so we came down here.

79
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,960
I bet the deadline isn’t approaching yet, right?

80
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,480
I’m off to class.

81
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,530
Matt must already be waiting there.

82
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,650
See you.

83
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,650
Oh. Chinese steamed dumplings.

84
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,820
I’m starving.

85
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,750
Give me, Q.

86
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,750
Hey!

87
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,400
Toey!

88
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,080
Look at your dearest junior.

89
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,840
He’s freaking mischievous.

90
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,800
Beer,

91
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,190
have you finished the calculus assignment?

92
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,470
There’s one question I couldn’t solve.

93
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,740
I want to copy your answer.

94
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,480
Which question?

95
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,370
I’ll help.

96
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,840
Hey? What’s this assignment?

97
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,340
I’m lost.

98
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,160
It’s for the class this afternoon.

99
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,700
Did you forget to do it?

100
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,280
Let me copy your answers, too.

101
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,940
Come on, Mick

102
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,520
You’re so hooked on games that you ignore your work.

103
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,340
Hello, my friend.

104
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,430
Take this.

105
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,780
What’s this?

106
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,450
Give it to Fang for me.

107
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,350
Why don’t you give him yourself?

108
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,350
I’m not brave enough.

109
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,720
So you’re asking me to do it for you?

110
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,640
You’re his brother, aren’t you?

111
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,020
But I usually don’t buy this kind of dessert for Fang.

112
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,730
Just do something out of the ordinary this time.

113
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,990
Give it to him, and he’ll take it.

114
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,830
That’s it.

115
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,000
Fine.

116
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,040
Cool.

117
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,360
What has gotten into you, Tan?

118
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,800
Don’t tell me you’re hitting on Fang.

119
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,360
Oh? Are you hitting on him?

120
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,659
Shhh.

121
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,670
Keep it down.

122
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,780
Keep it on the down-low, alright?

123
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,870
Others might hear.

124
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,730
Hey, Fang.

125
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,820
Gotcha.

126
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,960
Gotcha.

127
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,120
You’re tricking me, aren’t you?

128
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,320
I’ve known this prank since elementary school.

129
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,300
Call me stupid if I believe you.

130
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,290
- Only little kids would fall for it.
- Fang. How did you get here?

131
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,670
My friend wanted to grab lunch at the engineering canteen.

132
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,920
I saw you guys, so I came to say hi.

133
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,440
Well,

134
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,760
you just got here?

135
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,200
Yeah. Why?

136
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,210
Tan said he’d…

137
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,480
I just got here too.

138
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,280
I’m hungry.

139
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,200
Have you eaten anything?

140
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,690
Fang, I bought a dessert for you.

141
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,650
Wow. That looks yummy.

142
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,560
You did?

143
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,880
Yeah.

144
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,580
I think it looks yummy.

145
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,750
Thanks.

146
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,820
Thanks.

147
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,420
Hey, are you heading home with me this evening?

148
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,440
I’m not available this evening.

149
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,360
I have to run an errand.

150
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,159
Okay.

151
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,909
I’ll get my lunch.

152
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,250
Thanks for the dessert.

153
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,659
Bye-bye.

154
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,560
Bye-bye.

155
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,780
Phum, where are you off to this evening?

156
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,840
Come on.

157
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,970
You’re missing out on a chance for free food.

158
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,640
I was planning to treat you to dinner.

159
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,560
Come on.

160
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,220
[Wait in front of your faculty building at 4 PM.]

161
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,440
[I’ll pick you up.]

162
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,160
Do you even know how to shade?

163
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,140
I’m not you, okay?

164
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,140
Whose car is that?

165
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,110
I’m leaving.

166
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,350
Who picked him up right in front of the faculty?

167
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,300
Do you know?

168
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,320
No clue.

169
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,590
I don’t know who.

170
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,380
Peem has been acting weird recently.

171
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,360
He looks suspicious.

172
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,159
Or is he dating someone without telling us?

173
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,090
I don’t know either.

174
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,960
I’m pretty sure.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,760
Did you see who was in the car?

176
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,350
Why are you so nosy, Fai?

177
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,300
Don’t you want to know, huh?

178
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,480
Well, I’m curious, too.

179
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,640
Call him now.

180
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,540
Tell him he forgot his stuff.

181
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,250
Call him.

182
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,310
What should we say he forgot?

183
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:58,970
What do you want to eat?

184
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,740
Nothing.

185
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,270
I won’t eat.

186
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:01,980
I’m not hungry.

187
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,030
You aren’t allergic to anything, right?

188
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,480
I’ll take this one

189
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,800
and this one, too.

190
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,020
Yes. That’s all.

191
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,680
Thank you.

192
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,530
Peem.

193
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,230
What?

194
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,940
What a common name.

195
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,100
Yours isn’t common at all?

196
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,630
Why did you ask for me?

197
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,630
You clearly didn’t need company for dinner.

198
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:43,860
I didn’t.

199
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,390
I just wanted to talk about our agreement

200
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,670
because I haven’t yet explained what I need from you.

201
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,000
You must clean my room,

202
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,320
wash my clothes,

203
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,970
and do everything I say.

204
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,420
I think you’ve gone too far.

205
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,790
Compared to 200K,

206
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,400
I think it’s reasonable.

207
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,400
What about my work?

208
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,560
It has value, too.

209
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,410
Do you know how much effort I put in finishing it

210
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,420
without even getting sleep?

211
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,920
Just tell me how much it costs.

212
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,120
I’ll pay you now.

213
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,190
Give me 200K,and we’re good.

214
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,200
I’ll pay you

215
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,870
only after you complete your job.

216
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,400
I’ll head back now.

217
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,320
You can’t.

218
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,190
What now?

219
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,850
I want to go shopping.

220
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,840
Just follow me.

221
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,100
Hurry up.

222
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,230
Help me carry stuff.

223
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,670
Help me find where the other store is.

224
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,880
How about you carry these bags

225
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,850
and I find the store?

226
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,400
Let’s go to the next store.

227
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,060
There’s still more?

228
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,560
Hey.

229
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,650
I’m thirsty.

230
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,730
I’m getting something to drink.

231
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,370
Fine.

232
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,870
Hello.

233
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,640
What can I get for you?

234
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,540
Matcha latte, please.

235
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,170
Matcha latte.

236
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,090
Would you like a regular sweetness?

237
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,810
Yes, please.

238
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,600
That will be 150 THB, please.

239
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,640
Here you are.

240
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,010
Just a moment, please.

241
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,660
You’re way too slow.

242
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,220
Can we leave now?

243
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,370
Huh?

244
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,310
What?

245
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,190
We just sat down.

246
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,790
Why did you freaking buy so much stuff?

247
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,100
You’re such a spendthrift.

248
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,140
Hey. I heard what you said.

249
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,570
Are you done?

250
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,320
Let me finish it first.

251
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,070
Then, we’ll leave.

252
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,800
Fine.

253
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,090
I’ll run an errand after this.

254
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,260
Where?

255
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,190
Just around the corner.

256
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,140
Wait here.

257
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,040
It won’t take long.

258
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,370
If it doesn’t take long, I’ll go with you.

259
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,410
You’re heading home after, right?

260
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,410
I don’t want to carry those things around.

261
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,450
That sounds like you’re the one carrying them.

262
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,120
Wait here.

263
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,210
I told you to wait, so just wait.

264
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,270
I’ll be right back.

265
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,470
Fine.

266
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,560
I’ll wait here.

267
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,570
But are you sure you’re coming back?

268
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,820
Hey.

269
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,960
Why didn’t you tell me you were coming home?

270
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,270
I passed through the area,

271
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,470
so I didn’t want to return to the condo.

272
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,400
Have you eaten anything?

273
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,400
Yeah. I’m good.

274
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,230
What did you do today?

275
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,990
You seem unusually in a good mood.

276
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,810
Well, I did something fun.

277
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,030
Shit.

278
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,040
Has it been an hour already?

279
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,930
I’ll go to my room.

280
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,660
Here we are.

281
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,660
This is a must-try spot,

282
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,550
newly opened, near our university.

283
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,420
Trust me, it’s fantastic.

284
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,930
You eat here often?

285
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,670
Nope.

286
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,270
You read any reviews?

287
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:32,890
I didn’t.

288
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,840
What?

289
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,880
Well, honestly,

290
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,220
I’m…just feeling lonely.

291
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,980
Guys, imagine this.

292
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,540
I’m by myself in my condo room.

293
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,160
I don’t have anyone by my side.

294
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,680
Wherever I go,

295
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,950
I go alone.

296
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,660
I eat alone.

297
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,040
I do everything alone.

298
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,040
I sleep alone.

299
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,000
But it’s alright.

300
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,500
Now, I have you two with me.

301
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,860
What about the others?

302
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,230
They didn’t pick up my calls.

303
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,010
What?

304
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,460
So we are the chosen ones?

305
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,690
Correct.

306
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,650
That’s right.

307
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,700
That’s right.

308
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,510
Come on.

309
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,260
Can’t you two just eat with me?

310
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,500
I don’t have many friends, you know.

311
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,860
Alright.

312
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,860
But if it isn’t good,

313
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,640
you’re in trouble.

314
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,140
I guarantee it’s delicious.

315
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,100
Yummy, for sure.

316
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,430
I’m hungry already.

317
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,370
Come on.

318
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,350
Here we go.

319
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,380
Thank you.

320
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,100
Take the spoon, buddy.

321
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,900
I forgot to order mine without vegetables.

322
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,990
Just eat it.

323
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,410
Give it to me.

324
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,700
Are these chopsticks even needed now?

325
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,860
Give me, buddy.

326
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,680
Thank you.

327
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,770
Ouch!

328
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,570
Ouch!

329
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,900
$%*.

330
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,240

331
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,060
$%*.

332
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,260
$%* -  spoon?

333
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,620
Tan, you forgot to give him a spoon.

334
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,870
He doesn’t want it.

335
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,680
No spoon.

336
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,000
It’s hot, right?

337
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,410
Hot.

338
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:23,840
Hot?'

339
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,590
Huh?

340
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,070
$%.

341
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,190

342
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,330

343
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,470
Blow.

344
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,500
Blow.

345
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,210
I see.

346
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,640
Drink it.

347
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,460
Here you are.

348
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,920
Nope. I want that one.

349
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,140
Take both.

350
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,640
Hurry up. Drink it.

351
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,070
You weren’t careful before eating it.

352
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,440
It was just served.

353
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,600
Damn it.

354
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,460
I shouldn’t have brought them here.

355
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,310
I feel even lonelier now.

356
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,720
Fine. There’s one more here.

357
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,740
I don’t eat nuts.

358
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,440
You don’t?

359
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,400
This one is without nuts.

360
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,270
It’s too much.

361
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,020
Don’t worry.

362
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,940
If you can’t finish it,

363
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,119
we’ll pack it up and eat it at home.

364
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,109
Auntie, no more noodles for me.

365
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,119
I want someone by my side.

366
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,089
Will we split the bill in two?

367
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,089
- In three.
- 	I’m lonely.

368
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,280
I feel even lonelier now.

369
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,310
What the hell is wrong with him?

370
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,400
Where has he been?

371
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,290
[Phone: 12 notifications]

372
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,410
(This number can’t be reached now.)

373
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,010
He must have gone home already.

374
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,490
Excuse me. We’re closing soon.

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,540
I see.

376
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,800
I’m back.

377
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,400
You’re back, Peem?

378
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,810
What’ve you got there?

379
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,350
Brand name stuff?

380
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,890
You bought brand name stuff?

381
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,840
I didn’t, Auntie.

382
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,960
They belong to…

383
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,650
Someone you’re dating?

384
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,010
These are my friend’s.

385
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,930
Dating?

386
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,060
I’m not dating anyone.

387
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,050
Alright. Your friend.

388
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,670
Teens these days are spendy, aren’t they?

389
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,420
How much is that in total?

390
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,820
I don’t know.

391
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,440
I just know that his family is loaded.

392
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,560
Do you feel somewhat small?

393
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,050
Do you want one for yourself??

394
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,400
I’ll take you to buy one on your birthday.

395
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,420
I’ll take you to the shop.

396
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,700
You can choose what you want there, kiddo.

397
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,230
Auntie, don’t worry.

398
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,890
I’m not into this stuff,

399
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,410
unlike someone around here.

400
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,570
Watch it.

401
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,610
I’ll go to bed now.

402
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,150
Too much stuff here.

403
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,750
Alright.

404
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,180
Go ahead.

405
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,400
Goodnight, Peem.

406
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,010
See you.

407
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,510
Goodnight.

408
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,280
Yeah.

409
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,450
Oho.

410
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,600
That must be a million in total.

411
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,520
A million, sis?

412
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,000
Who is your damn sis?

413
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,110
I’m your aunt.

414
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,100
Oh, my bad.

415
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,040
I’m sorry, Auntie Pui.

416
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,250
Goodnight.

417
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:28,710
Hello?

418
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,840
Where have you been?

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,340
You left me alone.

420
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,840
Are you alright?

421
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,250
(What are you talking about?)

422
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,210
[Q]

423
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,530
Shit.

424
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Q.

425
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,320
Are you doing fine?

426
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,110
Stop getting on my nerves.

427
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,100
Seriously.

428
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,790
What’s up?

429
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,710
I’m sleepy already.

430
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,480
(I should be the one asking where you’ve been.)

431
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,450
(You didn’t answer my calls.)

432
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,110
Come on.

433
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,480
I was running an errand.

434
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,770
(Why didn’t you pick up my calls?)

435
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,220
My phone died.

436
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,380
You said you waited a long time.

437
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,220
Who were you waiting for?

438
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,220
Just forget about it.

439
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,890
You’re always like this.

440
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,880
You’re way too kind.

441
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,910
I’m not.

442
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,190
But thanks a lot for worrying about me.

443
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,030
(Who said I was worried about you?)

444
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,880
(I was worried?)

445
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,840
(Don’t flatter yourself.)

446
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,790
You always don’t speak your mind, huh?

447
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,920
Fine.

448
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,540
I was worried.

449
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,380
But mostly, I was just being nosy.

450
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,660
Is that all you have to say?

451
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,120
I’ll take a shower.

452
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,520
What are you doing?

453
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:07,880
Hey?

454
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,540
Q?

455
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,070
Why are you still here?

456
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,560
I’m practicing molding here.

457
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,200
I think I’m still lacking this skill.

458
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,740
It’s already late.

459
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,210
It’s not safe to be alone here.

460
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,230
But now you’re here with me.

461
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,630
Here we go.

462
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,310
Let me help.

463
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,540
Oho. I’ve got help from Maestro Q.

464
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,310
From now on, I should be called Maestro Toey, right?

465
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,260
Ouch.

466
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,640
Maestro Toey? Nonsense.

467
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,390
You’re as muddy as a kitten fallen into the water.

468
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,910
Keep going.

469
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,630
Here.

470
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,950
Hey, what are you playing at?

471
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,830
Come here, Q.

472
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,290
Toey, stop.

473
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:00,920
Let go.

474
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,070
Come here, Q.

475
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,270
You’re tricking me, right?

476
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,570
You won’t stop, right?

477
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,300
[Were you alright yesterday?]

478
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,160
[Where did you go?]

479
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,510
[You kept me waiting for so long.]

480
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,420
[Tan.]

481
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,330
[Where are you?]

482
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,150
[I’m at the faculty, of course.]

483
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,550
[A hard-working student like me came to class at the crack of dawn.]

484
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,600
[Impressive, right?]

485
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,820
[Have you seen Phum around?]

486
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,970
[Certainly.]

487
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,440
[We’re in the same class now.]

488
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,440
[Does he seem… okay?]

489
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,140
[Absolutely.]

490
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,190
[He’s all smiles.]

491
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,000
[I don’t know why he’s in such a good mood.]

492
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,830
Move.

493
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,740
Move a bit.

494
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,120
Hey.

495
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,320
Hey, move.

496
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,990
Leave.

497
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,830
I can’t see.

498
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,960
Move already.

499
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,440
Are you moving or not?

500
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,170
Move.

501
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,120
Fine. I’ll just leave.

502
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,920
Hey. What are you laughing at?

503
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,260
Well, I just saw something funny.

504
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,600
Oh, I have something to ask you about.

505
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:51,420
Did you buy these paintings?

506
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,840
I didn’t.

507
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,370
They were painted by a junior I’m close with.

508
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,430
I think he’s about your age.

509
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,180
What do you think?

510
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
A high school student did these.

511
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,970
He’s incredible.

512
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,880
He is.

513
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,570
I’m so surprised

514
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,750
how someone this young can be so talented.

515
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,620
I’m envious of him, though.

516
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,920
Why?

517
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,780
He’s about my age

518
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,260
and look at what he’s accomplished.

519
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Now, look at what I’m doing.

520
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,170
Toey,

521
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,600
some are born with special gifts,

522
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,130
and we can’t do anything about it, you know.

523
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,010
But no matter born gifted or not,

524
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,890
if they want to excel,

525
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,120
they must walk the walk.

526
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,230
They must really put their all into it.

527
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,120
Take this junior, for example.

528
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,240
He’s been putting his heart and soul into it.

529
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,420
His drawing board was almost like his breath.

530
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:11,680
Also, I don’t want you to measure success by age.

531
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,770
Talent can blossom at any age, and when it does,

532
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,600
it’s always worth appreciating, isn’t it?

533
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,560
By the way,

534
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,160
why did you suddenly ask about paintings in my shop?

535
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,080
You usually don’t talk about them.

536
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,670
I’ve gotten into drawing recently.

537
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,880
Really?

538
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,770
Are you interested in being my Fine Arts junior?

539
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,980
I’ve found my passion a bit late.

540
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,670
If I need to take an entrance exam,

541
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,670
I must practice really hard.

542
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,130
But I think

543
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,020
if you’re determined and willing to put in the effort,

544
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,740
you can do it.

545
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,020
What are you doing?

546
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,450
You’re a scaredy cat, aren’t you?

547
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,640
What did you just do?

548
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,080
See? My work got stained.

549
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
You can erase it anyway.

550
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,660
My pencil lead is also broken now.

551
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,260
Is that your only pencil?

552
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,090
I haven’t sharpened the others.

553
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:26,940
Cutter.

554
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,640
Cutter? Don’t you have one?

555
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:32,720
Oh.

556
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,290
Next time, be sure to have many of them ready.

557
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,340
When you do your work, pencils are necessary.

558
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,370
By the way,

559
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,780
our senior mentors are treating you to a meal tonight.

560
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,710
Make sure you join us.

561
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,520
Why haven’t you treated me to snacks even once?

562
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,200
My friends’ mentors always buy them snacks.

563
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,660
I’ve helped you with your work many times already.

564
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,770
Work is work.

565
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,520
I want some snacks.

566
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,650
Peem buys me snacks even more often than you.

567
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,880
Then maybe you should be his mentee.

568
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,990
Come on. That’s not what I’m trying to say.

569
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,200
A candy?

570
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,860
I gave you a heart. See?

571
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,520
How stingy.

572
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,040
Thank you.

573
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,380
How about the other one?

574
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,740
You’re being too much.

575
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,250
Watch it.

576
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,530
Hey? Peem.

577
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,630
What’s up?

578
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,720
Have you found the troublemaker?

579
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,280
Which one?

580
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,160
That son of a bitch, I guess.

581
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,500
I’m talking to one of them now, am I not?

582
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,700
Seriously.

583
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,160
I’m talking about the one who kept you waiting.

584
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,020
To hell with it.

585
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,980
He’s freaking dead.

586
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,470
Peem, where are you off to?

587
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,490
Workshop.

588
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,500
Are you coming, Q?

589
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,910
Yeah. I’ll be right there.

590
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,520
[Come see me at the faculty this evening.]

591
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,310
Get in.

592
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,470
Where are you taking me again?

593
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,810
To do your job.

594
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:27,470
Hurry up.

595
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,100
That’s Peem.

596
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,710
Just tell me what you want me to do here.

597
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,480
Wash my clothes.

598
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,940
Where is the washing machine?

599
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,160
Well, it’s out of order.

600
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,920
Hey, what are you doing?

601
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,590
What? I’m washing your clothes.

602
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,180
See?

603
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,650
Are you out of your mind?

604
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,880
This will ruin my clothes.

605
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,840
Your washing machine is broken,

606
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,900
so I have to do it this way.

607
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,180
Hey, stop.

608
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,560
Stop.

609
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:42,940
Stop.

610
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,230
Hey.

611
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,400
Stay away,

612
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,130
or I will turn this on.

613
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,700
Stop it

614
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:46,960
Hey, stop.

615
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:47,670
It’s wet now.

616
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,490
I told you.

617
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,440
Get out.

618
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,110
I’m soaked.

619
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,230
I told you.

620
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,130
I warned you already.

621
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,010
What’s wrong with you?

622
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,500
Get out.

623
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,360
You’re interrupting me.

624
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,440
I’m washing your clothes.

625
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,270
I’m soaked.

626
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,880
You should have washed them properly from the start.

627
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,659
I told you already to stay back.

628
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,889
We’re both wet now.

629
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:54,960
Happy now?

630
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,870
Not yet.

631
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,370
I’m hungry.

632
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,710
Cook me something.

633
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,950
I can’t cook.

634
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,950
I want you to do it.

635
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,240
What do you want to eat?

636
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,550
Let’s eat together.

637
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,820
Nope.

638
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,420
Go ahead.

639
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,330
I’m not hungry.

640
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,190
Though you’re not hungry,    	you must eat it.

641
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,680
What if you poisoned me?

642
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,540
What did you cook?

643
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,160
It tastes awful.

644
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,840
If you don’t want to eat it, then don’t.

645
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,480
I told you already I can’t cook.

646
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,830
You intentionally wanted to prank me, right?

647
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,420
Prank?

648
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,900
You’d better ask yourself who the real prankster is.

649
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,410
You pranked me yesterday.

650
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,810
You made me wait until the mall closed.

651
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:06,940
In the end, you didn’t show up.

652
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,350
I thought I would forget about it,

653
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,360
but what now?

654
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,640
Being your slave doesn’t mean you can treat me however you want.

655
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,930
You waited for me yesterday?

656
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,200
I did.

657
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,980
You told me to wait, so I did.

658
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,450
Shit.

659
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,960
I shouldn’t have trusted someone like you.

660
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,260
How long have you arrived?

661
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:43,790
Hey there.

662
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,530
Hello.

663
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,380
Hello.

664
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,810
You came together?

665
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,220
Order whatever you like.

666
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,180
It’s on us.

667
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,620
How’s your studying going?

668
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,660
The semester is ending soon, isn't it?

669
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,140
Everything is still okay?

670
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,100
Yes.

671
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,940
Most of the courses I’m taking are pretty basic.

672
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,150
Nothing too complicated.

673
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,160
But I don’t really like lecture-based ones.

674
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,840
Lectures?

675
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,350
I’ll dig up my old lectures and share them with you.

676
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,680
Q, have you been looking after your mentee well?

677
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,920
Q?

678
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,480
He never took care of me.

679
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,570
You’re exaggerating.

680
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,060
I’ve helped you with your work.

681
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,720
Q, you work part-time here, right?

682
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,510
How about singing for us?

683
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,160
One song, okay?

684
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,720
It’s my day off.

685
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,370
I’m not singing.

686
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,840
Oh, come on.

687
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,600
Q, come on.

688
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,530
Sing.

689
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,150

Oho.

702
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,760
You looked so handsome when singing, Q.

703
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,210
Cheers.

704
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,800
Cheers.

705
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,550
Cheers.

706
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,690
Hey?

707
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,040
What’s up?

708
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,350
I came with some friends.

709
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,830
I saw you guys here, so I came to say hi.

710
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,140
And he is?

711
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,680
That’s my junior mentee.

712
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,500
And this is the junior I know.

713
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,950
Hey, let’s drink.

714
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,120
Sure, bro.

715
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,740
Cheers.

716
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,710
You’re studying Fine Arts?

717
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,710
I like art, too.

718
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,210
Really?

719
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,100
What style of work do you like?

720
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,240
Actually, I…

721
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,050
Why didn’t you enter your work in the gallery contest?

722
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,820
Well,

723
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:07,950
I don’t think mine is good enough for that.

724
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,880
You haven’t given it a try.

725
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,880
How could you judge if it’s good or bad?

726
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,340
By the way, how are you going back home?

727
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,540
Do you want me to give you a lift?

728
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,910
You don’t have to.

729
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,030
He’s my junior.

730
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,080
I can take care of him.

731
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,300
Well, I’m heading back to my table.

732
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,300
I’ve kept my friends waiting.

733
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,930
See you around.

734
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,010
Alright. Good luck.

735
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,560
Hey,

736
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,890
you’re quite protective towards your mentee, aren’t you?

737
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,080
You pranked me yesterday.

738
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,200
You made me wait until the mall closed.

739
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,290
In the end, you didn’t show up.

740
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,780
You waited for me yesterday?

741
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,800
I did.

742
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,800
You told me to wait, so I did.

743
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,250
Phum?

744
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,520
Phum?

745
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,680
Phum.

746
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,630
What?

747
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,570
What’s wrong with you?

748
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,570
You’ve been zoning out all day.

749
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,880
Let me ask you something.

750
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,710
Well, I’ve heard this story from a friend.

751
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,530
One of my friends went to a shopping mall with another friend.

752
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,320
He told that friend that he’d run an errand,

753
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,130
but, in fact, he didn’t really have one.

754
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,090
He just wanted to prank that friend by making him wait.

755
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,560
He actually didn’t want that friend to wait that long.

756
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,220
He thought he would head home himself after some time.

757
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,100
But his friend ended up waiting until the mall closed

758
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,100
and was really furious.

759
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,150
I want to know what you would do

760
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,270
if you were him.

761
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,560
Who’s that friend?

762
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,560
You don’t know him.

763
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,800
Just tell me how you would handle it.

764
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,350
But why did that friend wait for him?

765
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,780
I don’t know either.

766
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,980
That’s why I’m asking for your opinion.

767
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,190
Just ask him directly

768
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
why he waited.

769
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,780
What do you think, Beer?

770
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,010
Hearing the story,

771
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,700
I think saying sorry is the easiest way.

772
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,030
But I didn’t do anything wrong.

773
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,060
I mean,

774
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,830
my friend didn’t mean to make him wait so long.

775
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,830
But your intention was

776
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,440
to prank him by making him wait, wasn’t it?

777
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,580
Just say sorry.

778
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,540
It’s the best way.

779
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,860
I told you it’s not my story.

780
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Whatever. Just forget about it.

781
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,250
I’m heading back.

782
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,110
See you later.

783
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,220
Phum,

784
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,190
don’t forget to ask your friend why he waited.

785
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,820
See you.

786
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,260
Hey, where’s your friend?

787
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,810
Where is Peem?

788
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,270
Why are you asking?

789
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,520
Well, I need to talk to him about something.

790
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,330
It seems you have something to talk to my friend often.

791
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,440
I don’t know what got him so mad.

792
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,450
He must be around here, editing his work.

793
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,810
Someone ruined his work,

794
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,490
so he has to paint a new one.

795
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,570
Alright.

796
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,720
Where’s him?

797
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,360
Next to the building.

798
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:53,830
Okay.

799
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:54,780
Thanks a lot.

800
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:17,800
What do you want?

801
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,880
You’re my slave,

802
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,200
but you disappeared.

803
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,120
Is that your painting?

804
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:31,920
Yes.

805
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,580
It’s nearly done.

806
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,490
Exactly.

807
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,230
After it’s finished,

808
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,560
you’ll never see me again.

809
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,380
Can you not finish it too soon?

810
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,760
Just tell me what you want me to do.

811
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,110
You’ll do everything I tell you to do, right?

812
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,110
Just tell me what you want.

813
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,560
Well,

814
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,360
can you forgive me?

815
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:19,200
I’m sorry.

816
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,360
Hey? Are you sure you’re alright?

817
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,310
You aren’t sick, are you?

818
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,520
You don’t seem to have a fever.

819
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,350
I’ll give you a lift.

820
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,610
You’re heading that way?

821
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,240
Yeah.

822
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,860
Thanks for your help.

823
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,150
Wow. This drink is delicious.

824
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,720
That’s just an ordinary drink.

825
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,200
It’s because you bought it for me.

826
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:06,240
Pun.

827
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,290
Have you eaten anything?

828
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,020
I’ve just finished hitting the books.

829
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,530
I’m braindead now.

830
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,220
Why are you looking at me?

831
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,990
I see you wear earphones all the time, Q.

832
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,790
I’m just curious what song you’re listening to.
