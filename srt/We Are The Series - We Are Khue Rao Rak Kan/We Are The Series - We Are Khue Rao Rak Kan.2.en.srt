Hey.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,310
Pick the ball up for me.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,410
Don’t you even want to say sorry?

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,180
I won’t.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,050
Fine.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,920
Ouch!

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,880
Where’s your friend?

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,680
Take me to meet him now.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,910
Damn it.

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,910
Bear in mind how much you messed with me.

15
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,620
Come.

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,040
I’m sorry.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,770
You must compensate for hurting me.

I can’t afford to pay.

21
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,730
You must compensate with something else, then.

I can’t afford to pay 200K.

You must compensate with something else, then.

29
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,500
Like what?

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,600
Be my slave.

31
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,900
Are you kidding me?

32
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,870
I’m serious.

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,980
Serve me for two months,

34
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,600
and we’re good.

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,200
Why must I do it?

36
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,200
Pay me, then.

37
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,330
The choice is yours.

38
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,140
Choose whether you want to do it or not.

39
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,430
Whatever pleases you.

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,900
Thanks a lot.

41
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,380
I never felt this pleased before in my life.

42
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,840
I can take payment in four installments if you want.

43
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,170
See how kind I am to you?

44
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,329
You wrecked my drawing,

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,460
but you didn’t own up to it.

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,220
You didn’t even simply say sorry to me.

47
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,100
How much is it?

48
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,750
How much is your drawing?

49
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,829
I’ll pay you now.

50
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,680
You’re just…

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,970
a rich brat.

52
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,750
Don’t talk too much.

53
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,090
It’s your call.

54
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,340
Pay up

55
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,690
or agree to do as I say.

56
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,320
Two months is too long.

57
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,160
I’ll do that until

58
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,260
I’ve finished repainting the work you ruined.

59
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,280
What if you just cut corners

60
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,580
and finish it in a couple of days?

61
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,000
Hey.

62
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,450
What kind of person do you think I am, huh?

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,620
It took me several weeks to finish the painting

64
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,250
that a random dog just ruined.

65
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,160
I won’t cut corners.

66
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,730
Fine.

67
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,740
But we’ll be doing this under one condition.

68
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,589
What is it?

69
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,430
Don’t tell anyone I’m your slave.

70
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,010
Don’t even let Tan find out.

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,470
Deal.

72
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,790
Deal.

73
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,400
Let go already.

74
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,400
Follow me.

75
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,810
Where to?

76
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,900
To do your job.

77
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,909
Huh?

78
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,000
Don’t talk too much.

79
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,880
Just follow me.

80
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,600
Hurry up.

81
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,900
Where are you taking me?

82
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,160
Hey, talk to me.

83
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,410
Where are you taking me?

84
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,370
Fine.

85
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,870
You’re being like this, huh?

86
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,700
But bear this in mind.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,770
If something happens to me,

88
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,090
you’re toast

89
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,390
because those three are witnesses.

90
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,840
They saw me come with you.

91
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,390
I’m not threatening you

92
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,520
but just want to let you know

93
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,510
I’m not a puppet on a string

94
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,810
that you can do away with easily.

95
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,460
What are you talking about?

96
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,240
Also, why would a puppet be on a string?

97
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,159
Alright then.

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,820
Just talk to me reasonably

99
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,850
like how a civilized person does.

100
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,730
Got it?

101
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,100
Please.

102
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,810
Okay?

103
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:55,480
I admit we both screwed up that day.

104
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,840
You couldn’t control yourself,

105
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,450
while I let my emotions take over too much.

106
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,950
So, since we already screwed up,

107
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,720
we couldn’t turn back time to fix it.

108
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,040
But what we can do is keep moving forward

109
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,040
because such a thing won’t happen again.

110
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,090
Starting today, I promise

111
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,340
we’ll turn into strangers

112
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,770
and pretend this whole thing never happened.

113
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,920
The story about us will just remain a memory.

114
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,790
Okay?

115
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,750
What story?

116
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,000
The story between us.

117
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,670
Drop it.

118
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,270
You’re annoying me.

119
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,870
Can we head back already?

120
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
I’ll just swing by a few more shops.

121
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,780
A few more?

122
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,800
Hey.

123
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,520
Why did you buy so much stuff?

124
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,440
Look.

125
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,600
It’s freaking a lot.

126
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,280
Just carry them.

127
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,390
Stop complaining.

128
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,350
Why?

129
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,810
It’s just carrying stuff, but you’re tired already?

130
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,620
Whoa.

131
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,760
I’m just carrying stuff but already tired?

132
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,560
You’re shopping as if you’re trying to empty out the entire mall.

133
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,880
Peem, you’re back?

134
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,870
Yeah.

135
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,930
Oh, look at you.

136
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,320
You look exhausted.

137
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,770
Have you been hitting the books hard?

138
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,180
No, Auntie.

139
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,430
My university buddy made me haul his stuff around all day today.

140
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,280
Who?

141
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,600
Who dared to do that to my nephew?

142
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,030
Tell me.

143
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,060
I’ll handle him.

144
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,180
Just forget about it.

145
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,700
Where are you off to?

146
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,560
Grandma’s place?

147
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,730
Yes.

148
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,880
I’ll be right back.

149
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,340
Sure.

150
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,720
Don’t just drink with your friends on the weekend.

151
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,430
Yes, sir.

152
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,040
That’s obvious.

153
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,409
That’s obvious.

154
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,770
I’ll come home no later than 6 AM.

155
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,760
Look after the shop for me.

156
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,960
Lock the door.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,820
Look after my shop

158
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,370
and my house, Peem.

159
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,470
Help me, okay?

160
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,750
Peem, wake up already.

161
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,630
Peem!

162
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,630
Hey!

163
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,240
Peem!

164
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,659
Peem.

165
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,840
Wake up.

166
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,360
I think we must do something.

167
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,429
One, two, three.

168
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,799
Peem!

169
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,240
Gosh.

170
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,360
What do you want from me, huh?

171
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,170
What’s up?

172
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,630
Come on.

173
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,660
I’m worried about you.

174
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,290
You didn’t pick up my calls.

175
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,990
I thought Phum randomly ditched you somewhere.

176
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,020
Don’t even say a single word.

177
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,290
You got me into a real mess, Tan.

178
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,500
Don’t mention his name.

179
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,530
I’m up in arms.

180
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,310
I didn’t do anything, buddy.

181
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,750
So, what did Phum talk to you about?

182
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,210
Nothing.

183
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,100
He didn’t do anything.

184
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,900
Nothing much.

185
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,380
We just hashed things out.

186
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,080
That’s it.

187
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,640
Are you sure?

188
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,240
He dragged you that hard.

189
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,570
He didn’t do anything to you?

190
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,000
Why is nobody believing me?

191
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,320
There’s really nothing to worry about.

192
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,400
We already cleared things up.

193
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,570
What are you guys talking about?

194
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,020
Eh?

195
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,760
You tagged along

196
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,920
but you had no clue what happened?

197
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,980
Uh-huh.

198
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,370
But I think it’s fun,

199
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,070
so I came along.

200
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,660
Tell me about it.

201
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,610
Please.

202
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,180
Please.

203
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,880
Long story short.

204
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,070
Nothing much, everyone.

205
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,330
He dragged me there,

206
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,470
and we talked it out.

207
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,490
We cleared things up.

208
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:43,920
It’s all water under the bridge now.

209
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,040
Really?

210
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,850
Could someone like Phum let it slide this easily?

211
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,430
What are you implying?

212
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,120
Tan!

213
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,280
You knew from the start he would do something to me, didn’t you?!

214
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,280
But you still brought him over?

215
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,170
My bad. I’m sorry.

216
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,370
You’re done for.

217
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,740
Nothing happened, seriously?

218
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,950
Nothing at all.

219
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,880
I said that already.

220
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,350
Don’t you understand what I said?

221
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,400
Just forget about it.

222
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,530
Let’s cook, shall we?

223
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,540
Auntie is not home.

224
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,180
Good idea.

225
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,120
Today, Tan’s on a mission to show off his cooking prowess.

226
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,530
Eh?

227
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,680
With his bare hands, you know.

228
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,990
Make sure it’s delicious.

229
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,940
Sure thing.

230
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,270
I guarantee you will enjoy how delicious it is

231
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,310
though it doesn’t meet food hygiene standards.

232
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,080
If you mess it up,

233
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,040
I’ll give you a double serving of trouble.

234
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,150
Give me three.

235
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,960
Right here.

236
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,610
I’m kidding.

237
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,170
Do you remember this friend of yours?

238
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,110
Phum really didn’t do anything to you?

239
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,950
You’re still curious?

240
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,880
From what I know of him,

241
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,520
Phum is not one to let things slide easily.

242
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,190
Why?

243
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,190
What did you expect him to do to me?

244
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,090
I don’t know.

245
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,080
Well,

246
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,440
we buried the hatchet.

247
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,100
That’s it.

248
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,920
Got it?

249
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,520
But Tan told me

250
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,650
Phum kicked the ball right into your painting.

251
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,700
He did.

252
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,790
It got stained all over.

253
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,890
The deadline is approaching.

254
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,650
How will he make it right?

255
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,300
Be my slave.

256
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,150
Well, he just paid me.

257
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,170
That’s it.

258
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,280
End of story.

259
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,520
Hey, Pun!

260
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,960
What are you doing?

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,690
You just splashed oil all over me.

262
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
Eh? We’re cooking Water Spinach Stir-Fry,

263
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,390
so, we must flip it in the air, mustn’t we?

264
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,280
Come on, Pun.

265
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,990
We’ll just flip it at the end.

266
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,080
Did you really think having Pun help you was a good idea?

267
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,110
Dude, I didn’t ask for his help.

268
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,260
He just barged in.

269
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,270
You aren’t going to set my house on fire, are you?

270
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,920
Come on, dude.

271
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,090
If that happens,

272
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,100
I’ll call the fire department to put the fire out.

273
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,080
Here we go.

274
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,650
Hey!

275
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,790
See?

276
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,340
The pan is on fire!

277
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,340
I’m the master.

278
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,970
Customers, please wait for it.

279
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,140
This chef will serve you this dish shortly.

280
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:21,710
Should we add some more?

281
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,490
No, we won’t.

282
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:22,960
You silly.

283
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,650
We’re good.

284
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,490
Hey.

285
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,260
Pun, just sit down and wait for it.

286
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,970
What are you standing here for?

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,650
In case you need more water spinach.

288
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,400
Stop it.

289
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,160
Here you are, my customers.

290
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,490
Here.

291
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,170
You added crispy pork, too?

292
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:37,930
How is it?

293
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,600
What do you think of my skills?

294
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,080
It looks delicious.

295
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,390
Whoa. You’re eating crispy pork first.

296
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,100
Hey.

297
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,620
It’s delicious.

298
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,530
Let me taste it.

299
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,190
Wow. It’s delicious.

300
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,220
What do you think?

301
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,890
How could I do this?

302
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Oh, it’s delicious for real.

303
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,340
See? I told you.

304
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,760
I’ve realized I can cook, too.

305
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,930
Pun.

306
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,180
All you did was put water spinach in the pan.

307
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,040
You also splashed the oil on me.

308
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,560
The crispy pork is superb.

309
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,850
How is it?

310
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,820
Super tasty, huh?

311
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,070
I bought it down the alley.

312
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:16,770
What?

313
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,200
Just enjoy it.

314
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,870
Go ahead.

315
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,100
It’s delicious.

316
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,870
Gotcha.

317
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Tan!

318
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,980
That’s my crispy pork!

319
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,470
It’s mine.

320
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:00,950
It’s mine.

321
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,160
It’s mine.

322
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,680
It’s mine.

323
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,730
It’s mine.

324
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,560
Tan!

325
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,810
I’m the winner.

326
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,260
Tan!

327
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,990
Throw up.

328
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:18,840
I’ll eat it.

329
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,360
Your food is here.

330
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,360
Your food is here.

331
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,580
Come take what you ordered.

332
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,510
Don’t forget to pay.

333
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,360
I’ve got it noted down.

334
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,030
I’m broke.

335
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,310
I won’t pay.

336
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,620
You’re in for it, dude.

337
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,910
Pay me now.

338
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,220
I’m already broke this month.

339
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,000
Come.

340
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,930
Grab yours.

341
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,280
Come.

342
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,970
Did you get any sleep?

343
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,240
How amazing you are, buddy.

344
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,990
Professor Po is coming at 9 AM.

345
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,170
Where is Fai?

346
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,940
She had an upset stomach,  so she went home.

347
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,550
Poor us.

348
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,730
Give me one more.

349
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Hey. I’m hungry too.

350
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,510
Show me yours.

351
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,520
What’s this?

352
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,080
What’s wrong?

353
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,300
I don’t know.

354
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,530
I just feel my work is still not good enough.

355
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,850
Professor Po will help you.

356
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,860
I’ll make instant noodles.

357
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,140
Need one?

358
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:03,470
Nope.

359
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,090
Go ahead.

360
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,520
How is it going, Peem?

361
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,380
Well, it looks interesting,

362
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,500
but I still don’t quite get your concept.

363
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,040
But after you finish it,

364
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,800
I think I’ll have a clearer picture.

365
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,990
By the way, Peem,

366
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,280
I’ve seen many times

367
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,940
that your work often involves water and canals.

368
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,470
Do you have a specific reason for that?

369
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,160
I personally like rivers.

370
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,160
I enjoy watching the water keep flowing.

371
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,170
When I stare at it for a long time,

372
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,430
I’ll feel at ease.

373
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,130
It feels like I’m flowing with it.

374
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,050
That’s why I often involve it in my art

375
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,800
to show how it affects my emotions.

376
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,730
Ah, I see.

377
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,680
Prof, do you think my work is too simple?

378
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,720
Simple?

379
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,930
That’s a tricky question.

380
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,520
Why, Peem?

381
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,960
Well,

382
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,069
I feel my art delivers messages directly.

383
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,000
Like, comparing to other classmates’

384
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,150
such as Q’s,

385
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,960
which is complex, deep, and needs interpretation,

386
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,570
I think his work looks majestic and valuable.

387
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,500
Peem, are you telling me that,

388
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,040
to label the work as complex,

389
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,700
it must be valuable and majestic?

390
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,000
Um, maybe?

391
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,540
How strange you two are.

392
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,980
I now believe you’re besties.

393
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:54,750
Eh?

394
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,960
Why?

395
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,990
When Q submitted his sketch last time,

396
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,930
he asked a similar question.

397
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,430
He was like, “Prof, is my work too complicated?”

398
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,140
“I’m afraid viewers won’t understand it.”

399
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,150
“I want it more like Peem’s, which conveys a message directly.”

400
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,410
“I want to make it easy to interpret and understand.”

401
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,160
See?

402
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,050
Q said that?

403
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,700
He did.

404
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,760
Seriously?

405
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,480
Yeah.

406
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,310
You aren’t joking, right?

407
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,310
I’m not joking.

408
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,240
I understand that it’s really tough

409
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,930
to stop comparing yourself to others.

410
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,780
But I have one question for you, Peem.

411
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,720
What’s not good about simplicity?

412
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,920
Think it over.

413
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,900
Thank you, Prof.

414
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Keep at it.

415
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,100
He’s not sharing it with anyone, huh?

416
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,530
What did he say?

417
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,510
He said it’s okay.

418
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,040
I just have to refine my concept.

419
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,680
Everything else is already on track.

420
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,200
Give me some.

421
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,320
That’s the leftover.

422
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,430
Since the dog didn’t eat it,

423
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,360
I will.

424
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,190
Peem, hello.

425
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,130
Hey. What brings you here?

426
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,780
Q, hello.

427
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,620
Why are you here?

428
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,270
Well, we’ve both got a meeting with Professor Po.

429
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,280
Peem, that looks so yummy.

430
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,240
Let me have a bite.

431
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,970
You want some?

432
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,800
That’s mine.

433
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,780
I’m not sharing.

434
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,290
Come on, Q.

435
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,440
Let me eat it.

436
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,470
Just one bite will do.

437
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,240
No.

438
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,790
Quit teasing him.

439
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,590
Take it, then.

440
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,400
It’s yours, isn’t it?

441
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,180
I’ll make one for you.

442
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,830
Don’t worry.

443
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,800
Oho.

444
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,990
Peem is so kind-hearted,

445
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,920
unlike someone here.

446
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,990
Show me your work.

447
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,930
Why?

448
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,440
Why must I do that?

449
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,350
Oh, he’s being serious here.

450
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,090
Fine.

451
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,200
I’ll show you.

452
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,520
Here it is.

453
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,210
What do you think?

454
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,130
It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

455
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,730
No wonder you’re my mentee.

456
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,620
What?

457
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,990
What does that have to do with you?

458
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,810
How could you say it doesn’t?

459
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,340
I taught you how to draw like that.

460
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,830
I even guided your hand.

461
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,530
How could you say it’s nothing to do with me?

462
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,350
By the way, how long have you been into drawing?

463
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,350
Well,

464
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,200
you’re just getting started, right?

465
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,610
He has just discovered his passion.

466
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,440
That’s why.

467
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,220
Q,

468
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,890
do you know that Toey actually planned to study medicine?

469
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,740
Why did you end up studying Fine Arts then?

470
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,950
Here you go.

471
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,200
- Thank you.
- 	You order the same one every day.

472
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,270
Aren’t you bored of it?

473
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,610
You’re good at making this drink.

474
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,610
Are you saying I’m not good at making others?

475
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,790
No.

476
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,560
That’s not what I mean.

477
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,720
I’m kidding.

478
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,650
Are you planning to study medicine?

479
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,260
My mom wants me to.

480
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,990
Do you like it?

481
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,380
But I still don’t know what I like and what I want to do.

482
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,190
I’m not particularly good at anything, either.

483
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,560
You still have time.

484
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,760
One day, you’ll figure it out.

485
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,980
Hopefully, I will.

486
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,780
But don’t pressure yourself.

487
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,060
Just take your time.

488
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,560
Sure.

489
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,950
Thank you, Oh.

490
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,660
Okay.

491
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,930
I’ll get back to work.

492
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,120
You’re zoning out, huh?

493
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,940
What’s on your mind?

494
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,530
Q, it hurts.

495
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,640
Here you go.

496
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,130
Be careful. It’s hot.

497
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,330
Thank you.

498
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,700
By the way,

499
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,030
how about the work you’re submitting to the gallery?

500
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,260
The one Phum messed up.

501
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,730
Damn it. What can I do?

502
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,920
I can’t do anything about it, can I?

503
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,350
I’ll just paint a new one and submit it next year.

504
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:01,920
Shit.

505
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,100
Hey?

506
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,570
But it’s your dream, isn’t it?

507
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,770
Don’t say that.

508
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,510
It just makes me feel worse.

509
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,430
What do you think I should do?

510
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,350
See how it looks now?

511
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,100
I just need to admit it.

512
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,100
What are you two talking about?

513
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,040
It’s adult’s stuff.

514
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,200
Juniors like you shouldn’t get involved.

515
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,710
I asked Peem.

516
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,950
Q, what are you drawing?

517
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,850
I don’t get it.

518
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,480
Hello?

519
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,300
(I’m thirsty.)

520
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,740
Who’s this?

521
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,140
(You can’t recognize your creditor’s voice?)

522
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,770
How did you get my number?

523
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,040
I told you I’m thirsty.

524
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,060
I’m busy.

525
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,990
But I’m thirsty.

526
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,360
(Or do you want me to tell your friends?)

527
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,180
(You’d better be fast)

528
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,180
(because I don’t know when I will let it slip.)

529
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,180
Where are you?

530
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,920
Engineering Faculty’s canteen.

531
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,130
Hurry here.

532
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,800
I’ll be right back.

533
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,580
Where are you going?

534
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,430
I’m running an errand.

535
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,600
I’ll be right back.

536
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,600
What do you want?

537
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,260
I’m thirsty.

538
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,590
Go buy the drink for me.

539
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,880
[Cooked to Order Dishes]

540
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,590
What?

541
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,920
Hurry up.

542
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,140
Water, please.

543
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,310
Here you are.

544
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,400
I don’t drink water.

545
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,920
Then what do you want?

546
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:18,950
Here you are.

547
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,300
I don’t like this red one either.

548
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,720
I don’t drink this fizzy green drink.

549
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,860
It’s unhealthy.

550
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,560
What?

551
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,650
Be fast.

552
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,540
Buy me lunch after this.

553
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,960
Did he freaking eat poops or something?

554
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,800
Why?

555
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,190
Is the food at my faculty not good?

556
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,510
It’s not good because I’m eating with you.

557
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,690
Tan won’t see us, will he?

558
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,690
He’s still in class.

559
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,130
You didn’t go to class?

560
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,760
Just eat.

561
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,550
Here.

562
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,750
What are you doing?

563
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,840
What are you playing, huh?

564
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,960
Eat.

565
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,200
Don’t.

566
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,160
I can feed myself.

567
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,810
Look at what you did.

568
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,810
It’s dirty.

569
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,750
What? Why are you looking at me?

570
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,430
Eat.

571
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,170
You said he’s in class, didn’t you?

572
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,090
Who knew his class would finish early, huh?

573
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,880
I’ll go now.

574
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,280
What’s up, Phum?

575
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,520
Gotcha.

576
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,990
Gotcha.

577
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,790
Gotcha.

578
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,500
I’m reminding you to keep your promise.

579
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,890
What promise?

580
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,550
Phum,

581
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,710
don’t tell me you’re breaking the promise.

582
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,440
You must help me

583
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,040
hit on your brother.

584
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,870
My brother?

585
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,560
Yep.

586
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,290
Khaofang?

587
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,150
Yep.

588
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,490
You have a crush on Fang?

589
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,150
Why should I help you?

590
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,560
What?

591
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,760
Just figure it out yourself.

592
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,560
Fine. I’ll help you.

593
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,920
Oho. Great.

594
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,470
You’re such an awesome friend.

595
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,970
But I don’t think I can do much.

596
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,730
You aren’t

597
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,870
Fang’s ideal type.

598
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,750
That tears my heart into pieces.

599
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,280
But anything is possible, you know.

600
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,630
I’m handsome.

601
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,560
What do you want me to do?

602
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,960
I know a great hangout spot.

603
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,940
Ask Fang to join us tonight.

604
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,370
Answer me.

605
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,200
Fine. I’ll do that.

606
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,460
Way to go, man.

607
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,320
Cool.

608
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,180
Come with me now.

609
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,920
Come.

610
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,680
Let’s go.

611
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,560
Are you hungry?

612
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,420
Hello, bro.

613
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,810
Hi, guys.

614
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,380
What’s up?

615
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,790
Cheers.

616
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,990
Is the whole faculty here?

617
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,150
My bar is packed with Fine Arts folks.

618
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,390
Aueai, we’ve just submitted our sketches to Professor Po.

619
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,530
It’s time to unwind.

620
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,670
Sure thing.

621
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,420
Let’s party the night away.

622
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,520
But first-years,

623
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,000
be careful of Professor Po.

624
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,240
Why?

625
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,460
He’s a ghost.

626
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,150
How silly.

627
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,930
There’s not much to worry about when he checks your sketch,

628
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,570
but after you submit your work, you’ll see.

629
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,120
Is he that strict with grades?

630
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,370
When I was his student,

631
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,840
if he didn’t approve the concept,

632
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,340
he would make me start over.

633
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,420
Think about it.

634
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,120
People say there’s no right or wrong

635
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,880
when it comes to art, right?

636
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,680
But do you know what the problem is?

637
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,360
What is it?

638
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,860
Grades are involved.

639
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,610
Oh, grades.

640
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,670
Come on.

641
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,180
Bro, don’t scare them.

642
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,880
He isn’t that tough on us.

643
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,680
You say he’s not that strict.

644
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,680
But what grade did he just give you?

645
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,020
I bet it’s an A.

646
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:38,850
It’s a D.

647
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,580
Wow, an expert.

648
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,160
If he’s that strict,

649
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,560
how will I survive?

650
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,950
Ask your mentor for help.

651
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
He always freaking got As.

652
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,810
Who’s gossiping about me?

653
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,990
Wow, he heard us.

654
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,460
Bro, not only did you make him sing,

655
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,080
but you also made him work as a waiter.

656
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,520
Understand me, okay?

657
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,580
I don’t have enough staff here.

658
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,090
But the owner seems to have a lot of free time.

659
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Suddenly, I’m the target, huh?

660
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,470
You guys are too much.

661
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,390
Come.

662
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,570
Cheers.

663
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,140
Cheers.

664
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,100
Cheers.

665
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,180
You come here often?

666
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,120
Yeah.

667
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,690
Q and my other friends work here part-time.

668
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,130
You aren’t drinking?

669
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,720
I have to drive.

670
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,150
Okay.

671
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,720
Good music here.

672
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,000
Of course.

673
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,580
Hey. It’s been a while.

674
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,100
Right?

675
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,610
I thought you were dead.

676
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,910
Come on.

677
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,210
I haven’t seen you in ages either.

678
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,240
By the way,

679
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,320
why did you ask me to join you at the bar all of a sudden?

680
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,190
Is something up?

681
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,040
Nothing.

682
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,780
I just wanted a change of scenery.

683
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,320
That’s why I asked you to join me.

684
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,460
You and Tan were the only ones free to join.

685
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,170
What a coincidence.

686
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,480
Cheers.

687
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,870
You aren’t drinking?

688
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,290
Uh-huh.

689
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,290
I’m just chilling out and enjoying the music.

690
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,790
Is the drink good?

691
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
So-so.

692
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,560
Bottoms up!

693
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,320
If I drink it up,

694
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,800
I’ll really need a toilet.

695
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,590
Oh.

696
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,480
Are you alright?

697
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,460
Not really.

698
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,660
I can tell.

699
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,320
Hey.

700
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,600
Be careful.

701
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,590
Sit properly.

702
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,240
Hey.

703
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,310
Stop drinking already.

704
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:27,970
Look at you.

705
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,220
Hey.

706
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,330
Take care of your friend, will you?

707
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,510
Sure.

708
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,720
These guys are a mess.

709
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,330
You’re addicted to games, right?

710
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,830
How are you going back?

711
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,180
I’m alright.

712
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:48,800
I can go home myself.

713
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,370
Don’t worry.

714
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,360
How could you?

715
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,780
You’re as drunk as a skunk.

716
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,760
Stop.

717
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,140
- Stop already.
- You should be worried about your mentee first.

718
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,730
I’m still alright.

719
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,960
Are you really alright?

720
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,080
Are you sure you’re alright?

721
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,140
Yeah.

722
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,680
I’m going home now.

723
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,540
Take care of them.

724
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:09,989
See you later.

725
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,360
You’re sure you can go back by yourself?

726
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,300
Yeah.

727
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,540
Show me where the exit is.

728
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,469
Over there.

729
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:14,960
That way.

730
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,080
Okay.

731
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,040
See you later.

732
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,139
Bye-bye.

733
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,120
See you.

734
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:19,929
- See you.
- 	I’ll get going.

735
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,350
See you guys later.

736
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,420
Hey?

737
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,760
Peem.

738
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,489
Why are you sprawled out like wet trash here?

739
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,080
Look at you.

740
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,010
I just left my faculty friends.

741
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,080
I’m about to head home.

742
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,340
But you’re this drunk.

743
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,180
How could you go back?

744
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,150
You called a cab?

745
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,840
You did?

746
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,640
Oh, come on.

747
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,180
You haven’t booked one.

748
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,090
I haven’t?

749
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,930
You haven’t.

750
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,320
Do you think you’ll make it home tonight?

751
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,400
He’s the one who got you hurt?

752
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,820
Yep.

753
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,980
It’s this guy.

754
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,540
Why are you laughing?

755
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,720
- I’m not.
- 	What’s so funny?

756
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,610
Hey.

757
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,800
Your friend is going home, right?

758
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,030
Phum, give him a lift.

759
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,440
What?

760
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,720
Come on.

761
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,210
Your friend is totally wasted.

762
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,340
Give him a lift.

763
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,010
You didn’t drink.

764
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,470
But how will you go home then?

765
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,730
I’ll call a cab and go with Tan.

766
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,840
Fang is right.

767
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,400
Phum, you should give him a lift.

768
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,050
Look at him.

769
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,300
He’s as drunk as a skunk.

770
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,350
I don’t want him going home alone.

771
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,450
I’m worried about my friend.

772
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,530
Give him a lift, okay?

773
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,990
Please.

774
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,070
You want me to drive him home?

775
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,710
Yeah.

776
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,310
Look at how drunk he is.

777
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,410
Don’t you feel sorry for him?

778
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,440
Hey.

779
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,990
We can call a cab, right?

780
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,530
Don’t drink so much next time.

781
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,530
You’re freaking causing us trouble, you know?

782
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Don’t let me catch you drinking, then.

783
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,910
Fine.

784
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,630
You’ll never see me drunk.

785
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,920
Hang on.

786
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,720
Tan, help me.

787
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,640
Be careful.

788
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,710
Be careful with your head.

789
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,720
Duck it.

790
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,690
Give him a lift.

791
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,220
I’ll send you his house location.

792
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,320
Are you sure you can go home on your own?

793
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,000
Of course.

794
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,190
It’s no big deal.

795
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,280
Let’s go.

796
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,920
Yep.

797
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,840
See you later.

798
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,240
Wow.

799
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,720
You’re in high spirits, huh?

800
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,150
Bye.

801
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,370
Take care of Peem.

802
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,550
Oh?

803
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,800
Bro, please buy these flowers.

804
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,740
No, thank you.

805
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,740
Please.

806
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,040
I don’t like flowers.

807
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,670
You can buy one for someone else.

808
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,910
Give one to your boyfriend.

809
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,020
Fine.

810
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,720
I’ll take all of them.

811
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,480
Keep the change.

812
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,190
That’s your tip.

813
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,450
Thank you.

814
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,730
Mommy, we’re out of flowers.

815
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,730
Bring more.

816
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,960
There are no cabs passing by.

817
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,390
We’ll find one soon.

818
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,110
I don’t mind waiting long.

819
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,480
By the way, what is your friend like?

820
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,180
My friend?

821
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,340
Your friend named…Peem.

822
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,240
Oh. Peem.

823
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,920
He is quite an easygoing person.

824
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,920
He accompanies me whenever I ask him to.

825
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,430
He does whatever I ask him to.

826
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,780
He really loves his friends.

827
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,700
How long have you known him?

828
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,000
That was since high school.

829
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,920
But why did you ask?

830
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,400
Nothing much.

831
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,720
I was just curious.

832
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,960
Aren’t you curious about me too?

833
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,060
Hey, one is arriving.

834
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,130
Huuhh.

835
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,350
Why so soon?

836
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,370
I’m heading off.

837
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,050
See you around.

838
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,260
Eh? What about me?

839
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,570
Do you want to come along?

840
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,050
Yeah.

841
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,670
I feel achy.

842
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,340
Ouch.

843
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,020
Ouch.

844
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:55,840
The car is leaning.

845
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,960
Bro, drive carefully.

846
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,600
I’m losing my balance.

847
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,200
Take the water.

848
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,790
It’s here.

849
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,330
Give me. I’ll open it for you.

850
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,850
Are you alright?

851
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,920
Where is Matt?

852
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,970
Where is he?

853
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,300
He went home already.

854
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,010
No. That’s not true.

855
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,010
He told me he’d send me home.

856
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,110
Is he still in the bar?

857
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,530
He went back already.

858
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,530
You also sent him off to his car.

859
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,170
Don’t stagger.

860
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,170
Are you alright?

861
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,760
Are you alright?

862
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,440
Are you alright?

863
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,150
Are you alright?

864
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,060
I asked you.

865
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,450
- Stop teasing me.
- 	Gotcha.

866
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,280
Are you alright?

867
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
Are you?

868
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,560
Are you?

869
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,400
Are you?

870
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,320
I have a headache.

871
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,970
I have a headache.

872
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,310
Bear with it.

873
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,560
The cab is arriving soon.

874
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,990
What are you doing?

875
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,370
What are you doing?

876
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,840
Catching some Z’s.

877
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,920
You’re smiling, aren’t you?

878
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:57,730
Come.

879
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,380
We’ve arrived.

880
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,370
Come.

881
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,170
Watch your head.

882
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:26,460
Who’s that?

883
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,560
We’re closed now.

884
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,790
No more orders.

885
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,200
I’m sending Peem home.

886
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,840
Eh? Peem?

887
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,030
Peem.

888
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:37,830
Peem.

889
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,290
Peem.

890
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,070
Peem.

891
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:40,550
Ummm.

892
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,310
What?

893
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,170
Peem.

894
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,190
I’ll close the door for you.

895
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,320
Peem.

896
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,660
What do you keep saying?

897
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,270
Oh, dear.

898
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,510
Oh, dear.

899
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,000
Oh, dear.

900
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,830
Oh, dear.

901
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,010
Oh, dear.

902
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:58,880
Oh.

903
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,680
How are you going to lie down?

904
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,340
Which pose?

905
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:01,440
Which way?

906
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,600
How?

907
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,920
I’m letting go.

908
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:08,730
Look at you.

909
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,050
You’re totally wasted.

910
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,360
He’s seriously wasted.

911
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,570
Thanks a lot.

912
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:22,120
You are?

913
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,220
Phum.

914
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,330
Phum.

915
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:27,910
Are you two friends?

916
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,370
You don’t look familiar.

917
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,160
Yes.

918
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:31,970
Nope.

919
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:33,710
Huh?

920
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,090
Thank you.

921
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:38,770
Phum.

922
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:39,660
Yes?

923
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,790
Do you need to rush home?

924
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,490
Not really.

925
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,800
Please help take care of Peem.

926
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,800
When he’s drunk, he likes to whine.

927
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,940
That’s not true.

928
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,170
Auntie, who’s doing that?

929
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,580
I never do that.

930
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,340
See?

931
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,960
Look after him, please.

932
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,140
I’ll grab a towel to clean him up.

933
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,190
No problem.

934
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,300
He didn’t even shower.

935
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,780
How can he lie there like that?

936
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:02,050
It’s my bed.

937
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:03,920
What did he say?

938
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:04,900
He said, “It’s Peem’s bed.”

939
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,280
Got it.

940
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,220
He gets drunk every day.

941
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,980
I really don’t get it.

942
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,450
Please take care of him.

943
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:12,320
Sure.

944
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,270
Get comfortable.

945
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,320
%5$#*@*!

946
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,000
Huh?

947
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,810
Phum.

948
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,690
What did you say?

949
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,420
You’ve got a tall nose,

950
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,020
lovely eyes,

951
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,290
and a handsome face.

952
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,090
What are you doing?

953
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,400
But why are you such an asshole?

955
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,830
How did you manage to get home last night?

956
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,420
Huh?

957
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,090
Get in.

958
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,490
Just tell me what you want me to do here.

959
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,290
Wash my clothes.

960
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,380
Hey. What are you doing?

961
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,710
I’m washing your clothes.

962
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,080
See?

963
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,290
It’s wet all over.

964
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,520
I told you already.

965
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,840
Here.

966
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,030
Give it to Fang for me.

967
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,480
Don’t tell me you’re hitting on Fang.

968
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,750
Hey, that’s…

969
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,080
Why haven’t you treated me to snacks even once?

970
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,560
I’ve helped you with your work many times already.

971
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,200
- Hey, what are you playing?
- 	Come here, Q.
