5

Peem will take Phum to see Peem’s parents in Chiang Mai.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,600
It’s been a while.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,680
Are you doing well?

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,320
Mom, this is Toey I told you about.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,440
What do you think? Adorable, right?

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,240
You have good taste.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,600
Who are these six guys?

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,400
Cat, are they your new friends?

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:30,960
Hold on.

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,680
Cat?

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,920
Northern dialect talking?

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,520
Dude, I love you.

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,960
Donkey.

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,520
I’m hugging you,

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,440
so you won’t feel hungry.

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,400
Goodnight.

21
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,080
DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,440
Guys, are we really walking up there?

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,480
Hang in there.

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,160
You can do it.

25
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,960
I bet it’s going to be hot, babe.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,080
What’s wrong with you guys?

27
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,840
Whoa.

28
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
It’s stunning.

29
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,040
Seeing it makes me feel like drawing.

30
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,120
Nice.

31
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,800
I’ll draw mine too.

32
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,720
Let’s see whose drawing turns out better.

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,840
You can never beat me.

34
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
Mine is more beautiful, no matter what.

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
What?

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,240
Draw the view.

37
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,960
Here it is.

38
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,400
My favorite view.

39
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,560
It’s beautiful.

40
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,760
Come on.

41
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,640
You two are having a secret romantic moment here.

42
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,720
Bring it down a notch.

43
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,360
We’re inside the temple.

44
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,520
How adorable you guys are.

45
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,520
Pencil Senior and Milk Frappe Boy, enjoying your moment without us?

46
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,960
Let’s go, Q.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,920
Eh?

48
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,960
Come on.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,960
We just teased you a bit.

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,240
Guys, let’s go to Chiang Mai Zoo.

51
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,560
Aw, you’re asking so sweetly.

52
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,560
Are you going or not?

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,880
I’m going, of course.

54
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,600
Let’s go.

55
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,840
Let’s go.

56
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,160
Bro, don’t go too fast.

57
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,960
What’s that animal?

58
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,120
You’re sweating.

59
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,159
Do you know this animal?

60
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,200
A monkey, obviously.

61
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,280
Be careful.

62
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,200
Eat some vegetables.

63
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,600
Babe, you’re so cute.

64
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,600
Penguin.

65
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,760
Take the fish.

66
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,880
Walk properly, Toey.

67
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
If you just watch and do nothing,

68
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
someone else might win his heart.

69
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
Nobody could take his heart away.

70
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,480
Don’t be so careless.

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,480
If someone else wins his heart first,

72
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,440
you might end up in tears.

73
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,040
I don’t know.

74
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,880
I've shown my feelings directly and indirectly.

75
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,640
Maybe I need to buy a penguin as a dowry to make him realize.

76
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,720
I think you should go with this one.

77
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,520
He will like it.

78
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,640
Come on.

79
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
If we buy it, where do we keep it?

80
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,600
In the freezer.

81
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,520
Buy it then.

82
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Buy it from them.

83
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,159
Guys, let’s take a photo together.

84
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,200
Here we go.

85
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,320
Fang, come here.

86
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,760
Phum, sit down.

87
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,760
You’re blocking me completely.

88
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,159
One, two, three.

89
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,320
Q!

90
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,799
This place is stunning.

91
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,280
I don’t want to go back to Bangkok yet.

92
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,360
Can we stay here for a few more days?

93
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,640
Aren't you going back to study?

94
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,880
I still want to travel around with you here.

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,680
We can travel to other places later.

96
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,400
Together.

97
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,520
You said it already.

98
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,320
I’ll list down several attractions,

99
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,040
and let’s go there together.

100
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,440
We held hands all the way here.

101
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,280
Isn’t that enough?

102
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,400
You know it’s never enough.

103
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,000
Chain.

104
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,760
Hug me.

105
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,880
Huh?

106
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,560
I’m hungry, so I can’t sleep.

107
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,920
If you hug me,

108
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I can probably fall asleep.

109
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Get hungry often then.

110
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
Why are you standing here?

111
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
I don’t get to travel often.

112
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,400
I don’t want to waste any minute.

113
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,400
I want to make the most of it.

114
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,240
Feeling artistic?

115
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,760
Tan is snoring very loudly.

116
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,120
I can’t sleep.

117
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,480
Q, look at that star.

118
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,680
It’s so big.

119
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,400
Cute.

120
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,680
Which star is cute?

121
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,320
Let me kiss you.

122
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,200
Whose room is this?

123
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
A guest’s room.

124
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,440
Q.

125
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Can I?

126
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,200
Let me sleep with you.

127
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,599
Can’t you sleep alone?

128
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
I don’t have anyone to hug.

129
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,040
Just a hug?

130
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,920
Peem, I love you.

131
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,560
I love you so much.

132
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,920
I love you too.

133
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,000
I woke up and didn’t see you.

134
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,400
My heart was almost torn apart.

135
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,480
Don’t overreact.

136
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,080
I need a kiss on the cheek to console me.

137
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,280
Hurry up.

138
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,160
This side.

139
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
How happy I am.

140
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,960
Is that all you want?

141
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
I already feel happy,

142
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,640
but it’s still not enough.

143
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,560
Not enough?

144
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,600
Oho.

145
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,240
I’m super happy.

146
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,560
How adorable my boyfriend is.

147
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,600
Give me your hand.

148
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,480
I want to hold your hand.

149
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,120
Be careful, you might slip.

150
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,320
Bye-bye.

151
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,280
What a regret.

152
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,000
You should have stayed a little longer.

153
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,080
Our house is rarely this full.

154
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,800
It feels like a housewarming party.

155
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,480
It’s fun.

156
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,280
I like it.

157
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
I’ll visit again.

158
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,160
Bye.

159
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,760
Take care of yourself when you go back.

160
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,800
You too.

161
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,080
Take good care of yourselves.

162
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,880
I’m leaving.

163
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,280
Bye, guys.

164
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,960
Goodbye, Mom.

165
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,120
Bye.

166
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,520
Safe trip home.

167
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,240
Bye.

168
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,160
Love you, xoxo.

169
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:29,960
Goodbye,

170
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,720
Mom, Dad.

171
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,440
Study well.

172
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,680
We’re ready to welcome you back next time.

173
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,080
Oh, nope.

174
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,720
Bye-bye.

175
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,080
Bye-bye.

176
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,840
[Peem, are you free next Saturday?]

177
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,040
[Saturday? Yes.]

178
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,680
[I see. Okay.]

179
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,880
[Why did you ask?]

180
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,400
[Nothing.]

181
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,640
[Eh? What’s with you?]

182
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,920
What’s up?

183
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,960
What’s happening this Saturday?

184
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,360
The thing is

185
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,760
Phum suddenly asked me if I’m available this Saturday

186
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,880
but didn’t tell me why.

187
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,080
This Saturday?

188
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,000
I see.

189
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,320
So you know, right?

190
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,880
Why must I tell you then?

191
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,080
You’re older,

192
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
but that doesn’t mean I don’t dare kick you.

193
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,320
It’s Phum’s birthday.

194
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,200
Seriously?

195
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,440
It’s just a few days away.

196
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,960
Right.

197
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,760
Why would I lie?

198
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,720
Help me with something.

199
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,720
(Me?)

200
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,760
(Hello? What’s up?)

201
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,280
Where are you?

202
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,360
Can I see you?

203
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,360
(I’m sick.)

204
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,120
Oh? Are you alright?

205
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,160
You’re home, right?'

206
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,160
I’ll come over.

207
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,440
(I’m okay. It’s not that serious.)

208
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,440
(I’m just a bit sick.)

209
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
(Don’t come.)

210
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,480
(You might catch it.)

211
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,320
So, I can’t see you, right?

212
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,760
(I just took a pill.)

213
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,680
(I’m going to sleep.)

214
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,200
(Bye-bye.)

215
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,960
What’s wrong?

216
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,760
Why that face?

217
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,640
Peem said he’s sick.

218
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,800
I wanted to see him

219
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,160
but he wouldn’t let me.

220
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Nothing can hurt someone like Peem.

221
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,720
Don’t worry.

222
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,840
I’m helping a bit, applying the cream for you.

223
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,360
If I waited for you,

224
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,000
Phum wouldn’t get to eat this cake in this lifetime.

225
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,840
I’ve just realized making a cake is this difficult.

226
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,360
It is, of course.

227
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,520
Now, you have to write a message.

228
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,120
Write whatever you want.

229
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,960
I hope you have enough talent to do it.

230
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,720
I’m a Fine Arts student.

231
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,200
I’ll wait and see.

232
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
I’ll get back to work.

233
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,400
Yeah.

234
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,960
[Happy Birthday, Puppy Phum.]

235
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,440
[It’s done. Let’s proceed with the plan.]

236
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,040
[Peem: It’s done. Let’s proceed with the plan.]

237
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,360
Phum, come with me to buy some stuff.

238
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,840
Now?

239
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,280
How about Tan?

240
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,240
He isn’t free.

241
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,800
Someone like him isn’t free?

242
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,240
Please.

243
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,840
Just come with me.

244
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,000
Besides,

245
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,280
we two haven't hung out together in ages.

246
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,800
Fine.

247
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,840
[Khaofang: I’m taking Phum outside already.]
[Khaofang: You guys can go in.]

248
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,160
[Peem: Okay.]

249
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,400
Who are you talking to?

250
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,200
Nobody.

251
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,480
You’re acting suspicious.

252
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,520
That’s right, Q.

253
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,840
But move it up a bit.

254
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,720
Chain.

255
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,280
Q, I think it’s too high.

256
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,200
Move it down.

257
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,880
It’s too high.

258
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,800
Do it yourself, will you?

259
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,680
Guys, hurry up, or we won’t finish it in time.

260
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,080
Stop arguing.

261
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,160
Mick, what are you playing at?

262
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Let’s continue.

263
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,400
It’s not on the same level.

264
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,200
Come do it yourself.

265
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,080
Hold it.

266
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,960
So, what are you buying here, Fang?

267
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,040
You haven’t bought anything.

268
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,920
[Peem: Everything is done. You can come back now.]

269
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,920
I forgot what I wanted to buy.

270
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,480
Let’s head back.

271
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,400
Let’s go.

272
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,520
Hurry up.

273
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,760
[Happy Birthday, Puppy Phum.]

274
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,960
Happy Birthday, Puppy Phum.

275
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,520
Thank you.

276
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,960
Make a wish now.

277
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,920
Surprise!

278
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,840
You guys are here too?

279
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,040
To surprise you.

280
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:18,920
What do you think?

281
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,480
Beautiful, right?

282
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,280
We organized this for you.

283
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,720
How do you like it?

284
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,000
This is all we’ve prepared

285
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,640
just for you, Young Master Phum.

286
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,640
You should love us a lot.

287
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,440
Get this into your head.

288
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,200
Thanks a lot, everyone.

289
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,920
Pay us 50K for organizing this event.

290
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,480
You’re unbelievable.

291
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,640
Certainly.

292
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,520
Cheers!

293
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,840
Cheers!

294
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,040
So, telling me you were sick was just part of the plan, right?

295
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,160
I was so worried about you.

296
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,120
Fang, you knew the whole thing, right?

297
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,520
Cheers again!

298
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,400
This is your gift from Toey and me.

299
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,800
Happy Birthday, Phum.

300
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,080
This is from me.

301
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,040
From me.

302
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,520
Mine too, shared with Pun.

303
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,720
It’s pretty big.

304
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,320
Unbox it now.

305
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,040
Now?

306
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,400
You like it, right?

307
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,240
My taste never disappoints anyone, you know.

308
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,120
I didn’t get you a gift,

309
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:51,080
but you can have all your beloved cars checked at my garage for free.

310
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,800
That’s it.

311
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,400
Is that all?

312
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,520
How about you, Beer?

313
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,600
No gift for him?

314
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
I already gave him one in advance.

315
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,120
Are you guys best friends who want to be more than friends?

316
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,400
Come on.

317
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,440
Watch your thoughts.

318
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,960
You all might as well eat my cake.

319
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,920
I made it myself.

320
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,440
I’ll skip it.

321
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,520
Same here.

322
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,200
Babe, do you want to eat it?

323
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,040
Chain, how about you?

324
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,000
I’m telling you, he’s the real trouble-maker.

325
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,920
Matthew, what’s wrong with you?

326
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,840
Are you glad because you’re going home?

327
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,400
So, you guys are going back?

328
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,560
Are you sure you won’t sleep over?

329
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,720
I won’t.

330
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,280
I don’t want to be the third wheel between you two.

331
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,200
Tan, don’t make that face.

332
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,480
Don’t forget to answer Mom and Dad’s call.

333
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,840
Anyway, thanks a lot, everyone.

334
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,320
Safe trip home.

335
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,640
See you, buddy.

336
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,360
See you.

337
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
Bye-bye.

338
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,760
Bye-bye.

339
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,240
Turn off the light when you sleep.

340
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,000
Got it?

341
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,840
Let’s go.

342
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,120
Bye-bye.

343
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,280
Do you want to eat this cake?

344
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,520
Is it edible?

345
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,120
I’m kidding.

346
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,560
Come on.

347
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,280
Let me taste it.

348
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,760
Quickly.

349
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,760
Am I a puppy?

350
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,560
Puppy Phum.

351
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,120
Let me taste it.

352
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,760
How is it?

353
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,640
Yummy.

354
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,640
That's a relief to hear.

355
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Thank you, Peem.

356
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,880
Thank you for making my birthday this year special.

357
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,440
It’s not over yet.

358
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,960
I also have a gift for you.

359
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,000
Happy Birthday, Phum.

360
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,080
I wish you a really happy birthday this year.

361
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,960
I hope we love each other like this for a long time.

362
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,440
And I hope we’ll stay together

363
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,280
and celebrate our birthdays together for the next 100 years.

364
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,160
Thank you for being born so I could love you.

365
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:35,880
Eh?

366
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,200
Can you say that last sentence one more time?

367
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,000
Nope.

368
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,640
You only get to hear the good stuff once.

369
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,480
Thank you for loving me, Peem.

370
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
I love you, too.

371
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,800
Is this how you want to eat the cake?

372
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,640
Fine.

373
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,520
Here we go.

374
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,520
Phum.

375
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,800
Phum.

376
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,360
Phum.

377
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,240
Alright. I give up.

378
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,640
I give up.

379
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,800
I give up.

380
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,040
Are you really giving in?

381
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,880
Phum.

382
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,440
Peem,

383
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,640
I love you.

384
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,560
Good morning.

385
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Peem, where are you?

386
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,760
Hey.

387
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,600
I called your name. Why didn’t you answer?

388
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,440
I’m eating.

389
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,760
Do you want some?

390
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,360
Nope.

391
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,160
Peem,

392
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,360
how about coming over for a meal at my place?

393
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,080
Do you think we should?

394
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,880
I think I’m not ready yet.

395
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,600
It’s just having a meal.

396
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,600
You’ll also get to meet my mom.

397
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,280
I’ve been to your place often.

398
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,200
Don’t you want to come to mine too?

399
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,840
It’s not that.

400
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,520
But I won’t know how to act when I’m there.

401
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,080
You said you’re not ready.

402
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,280
Can you tell me why?

403
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,000
Please, Peem.

404
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,240
Come with me.

405
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,760
I want my family

406
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,560
to know about you.

407
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,800
But don’t overthink.

408
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,040
I’m with you.

409
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,880
Go with me, okay?

410
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,240
Let’s go.

411
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,720
Alright.

412
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,560
How cute you are.

413
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,960
Are you nervous?

414
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,120
A bit.

415
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,680
My mom is kind.

416
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,200
Don’t be afraid.

417
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,160
You’re adorable.

418
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,160
I’m sure she will like you.

419
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,600
Let’s go.

420
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,160
Mom.

421
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,920
Phum.

422
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,160
I woke up early just to wait for you.

423
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,160
Eh?

424
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,200
Who’s here with you?

425
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,280
Please have a seat.

426
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,840
Thank you.

427
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,040
This is Phum.

428
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,240
I thought you only had Beer and Mick as friends.

429
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,080
Actually, Phum has a lot of friends,

430
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,520
but they’re studying in different faculties.

431
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,960
What do you study?

432
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,960
Fine Arts.

433
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
You must be good at art, then.

434
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,520
Stay and join us for lunch, Peem.

435
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,600
Sure.

436
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,800
I don’t know what you like to eat.

437
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,640
I hope you like it.

438
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,040
It’s very delicious.

439
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,520
I’m relieved to hear that.

440
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,200
Eat plenty.

441
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,280
You too, Phum.

442
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,440
Eat plenty.

443
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,560
Yeah.

444
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,240
It’s a shame your dad isn’t here.

445
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,800
Next time, we’ll all eat together, including Fang.

446
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,640
Sounds good?

447
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,880
Let’s eat.

448
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,720
Eat a lot.

449
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,480
What are you doing?

450
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,480
Someone might see us.

451
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,160
How could they?

452
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,440
This is my bedroom.

453
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,480
Oh. You’re right.

454
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,200
Also, I think my mom likes you a lot.

455
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,760
I’m glad.

456
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,400
I like your mom, too.

457
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,000
She’s so kind.

458
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,320
You’re being sneaky here.

459
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Actually, your dad seems kind too.

460
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,800
I don’t know.

461
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,520
We aren't that close.

462
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,760
But he has given me pretty much freedom in life,

463
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,560
whether it’s work or study.

464
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,760
If that’s kindness, then yeah, he’s kind.

465
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,360
Won’t you consider reconciling with him?

466
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,160
I know, deep down,

467
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,560
you want to do that.

468
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,880
I also believe your dad feels the same.

469
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
How about opening up and talking to him?

470
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
I just don’t want you to argue with him again.

471
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
I don’t want to see your sad face again.

472
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,920
I understand.

473
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,880
I’m an outsider who doesn’t know the whole story.

474
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,360
In the end,

475
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,680
it’s down to you whether you’ll forgive him or not.

476
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,080
It’s your right.

477
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,840
Whatever you decide, I’m here for you.

478
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,880
I’ll try talking to him then.

479
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,360
Don’t stress about it.

480
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,680
Why are you stressed out?

481
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,920
Is this your oldest sibling?

482
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,240
That’s Khaooat.

483
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,720
He works hard,

484
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,320
so he can’t make time to come home often.

485
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,000
So the oldest is Khaooat, and the middle one is Khaofang.

486
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,600
Where does the word Phum come from, then?

487
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,720
You know what?

488
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,120
Actually, my name wasn’t originally Phum.

489
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,040
Oh?

490
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,280
But when I was young, I got sick easily,

491
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,160
including allergies, hay fever, shrimp allergies, and so on.

492
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,920
So, my relative named me Phum,

493
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,880
hoping this name would ward off illnesses.

494
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,120
But honestly, my original name begins with the word Khao, too.

495
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,400
Really?

496
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,520
What is it?

497
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,920
If I tell you, will you tease me?

498
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,600
Are you sure?

499
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:23,920
Yeah.

500
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,840
Tell me.

501
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,440
I want to know.

502
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,280
Khaophan.

503
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,640
It isn’t funny at all?

504
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
It’s cute.

505
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,080
Khaophan.

506
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,880
Khaophan.

507
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,800
Khaophan.

508
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,200
Why?

509
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:39,920
Are you shy?

510
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,960
It’s so cute.

511
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,360
This is Khaophan, right?

512
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,760
Look at that big smile.

513
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,200
That one.

514
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,800
Eh?

515
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,440
You can’t distinguish?

516
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,320
Khaophan.

517
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,320
Khaophan.

518
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,360
Are you sure you’re playing it like this?

519
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,640
Why?

520
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,800
Hello?

521
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,000
(It’s time, buddy.)

522
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,480
It’s time for what?

523
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,880
(On the full moon day of the twelfth lunar month)

524
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,600
I won’t go.

525
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,480
I’ll sleep.

526
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,680
(Why the hell are you sleeping that much?)

527
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,360
(This year’s costume theme is Polka Dot.)

528
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,160
(Let’s meet at 7PM at Wat Arun.)

529
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,200
Wat Arun?

530
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:45,920
(Yep.)

531
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,200
(Let’s change the atmosphere.)

532
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,200
(See you there, buddy.)

533
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,360
What did Peem say?

534
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,560
He was whining, as usual.

535
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,720
But he’ll join us.

536
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,600
Peem always goes along with what others want,

537
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,080
unlike someone here.

538
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,400
Why?

539
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,320
Am I not spoiling you enough?

540
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,240
I’ve done this and that for you.

541
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
I’ve given you everything you wanted.

542
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,680
- Look at you.
- 	I could give you whatever you wanted.

543
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,680
- Look at you.
- 	Isn’t that enough?

544
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,800
We’re in a relationship,

545
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,800
but you aren’t talking to me nicely.

546
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:18,920
See?

547
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,320
See?

548
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:28,120
Should I say, “Toey, this is Phi Q right here”?

549
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,760
Huh?

550
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,320
Do I have to say it like this?

551
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,120
Nope.

552
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,680
That doesn’t sound like you.

553
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,200
Why? Toey, you don’t like Phi Q anymore?

554
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,560
I can’t with this.

555
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,040
I can’t

556
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,800
It’s giving me chills.

557
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,000
What’s up? It’s your Phi Q.

558
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,000
I can’t stand it.

559
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:44,440
I can’t.

560
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,320
Why are your cheeks so soft?

561
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,360
Who are you?

562
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,120
Why are your cheeks so soft?

563
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,960
Who are you?

564
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,040
Can I smell it?

565
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,360
Your cheeks are so soft.

566
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,720
Do you want more?

567
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,680
I’m giving in.

568
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,200
I’m giving in.

569
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,880
I’m not. Is this what you want?

570
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,200
They aren’t here yet?

571
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,320
Here they come.

572
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,400
Those good-looking guys?

573
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,920
If you mean handsome, I don’t think so.

574
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,840
Not them.

575
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,320
What’s up?

576
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,040
Did I keep you waiting long?

577
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,280
Oho.

578
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,080
Oh, if there’s an award for the couple of the year,

579
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,240
you two would win it.

580
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,320
Bro.

581
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,200
Yeah?

582
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,080
Something like this is hard to compete with, you know.

583
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,520
Oho.

584
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,240
Right in my face.

585
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,240
Couple of the year award? Nonsense.

586
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,440
He made me wear it.

587
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,280
Babe, tell them you’re happy to wear it.

588
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,000
Say that.

589
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,400
Say that.

590
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,560
Look at how he’s gritting his teeth.

591
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,560
Fine. He wasn’t willing to.

592
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,440
I forced him.

593
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,160
Phum, let me give you a warning.

594
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,760
Don’t stand close to me.

595
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,120
My handsome aura will take over your existence.

596
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,760
Oho.

597
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,320
How confident.

598
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,440
Where’s he getting all this confidence from?

599
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,800
Did you look at your face before saying that?

600
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,760
Why, Peem?

601
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,040
You’re protecting him, huh?

602
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,640
I’m not.

603
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,680
I’m just stating the facts.

604
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,800
He’s more handsome than you.

605
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,400
But I disagree.

606
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,840
Q is more handsome.

607
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,960
There he goes.

608
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,320
Phum is more handsome.

609
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,960
Q is more handsome.

610
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,640
Phum is more handsome.

611
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,360
Q is more handsome.

612
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:42,880
Phum is more handsome.

613
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,160
Hey. Look at his face.

614
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,320
He’s more handsome.

615
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,280
Phum is more handsome.

616
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:47,880
Q is more handsome.

617
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,520
Phum is more handsome.

618
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,240
Q is more handsome.

619
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,520
Phum.

620
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,160
Q.

621
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,360
Phum.

622
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:50,760
Q.

623
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,120
Phum.

624
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,320
Stop.

625
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,800
I have a question.

626
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:00,480
Between Peem’s Phum and Toey’s Q,

627
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,040
I’m the most handsome, right?

628
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,520
Why is he talking about himself just like that?

629
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,080
Stay away from my feet.

630
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,400
Eh, babe?

631
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,520
Let’s head inside.

632
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,640
I want to eat cotton candy already.

633
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,480
Q, let’s go.

634
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,680
Hey, I’m here.

635
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,640
Q, hurry up.

636
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,040
- What do you want to eat?
- 	Hey.

637
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,760
Can I check out that shop first?

638
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,280
How much is it?

639
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,280
How many do you want?

640
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,720
You’re paying for me?

641
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,160
Peem told me you’re really good at this.

642
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,000
Let’s compete.

643
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,000
Definitely, little bro.

644
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,040
Let’s compete.

645
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,960
Don’t cry if you lose.

646
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,800
You aren’t the real deal, huh?

647
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,640
It’s alright.

648
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,640
You aren’t the real deal, huh?

649
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,320
You’re sucky.

650
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,240
I'll hit you.

651
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,880
Babe, did I do well?

652
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,760
Whoa.

653
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,880
Yes, you did.

654
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,560
It’s alright.

655
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,520
You’re talented for me.

656
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,960
I won’t take the doll then.

657
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,840
I beat him already.

658
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,040
I’m happy now.

659
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,680
How annoying.

660
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,280
I want to eat cotton candy.

661
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,960
One for us, please.

662
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,640
Thank you.

663
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,200
Thank you.

664
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,200
Let’s go, babe.

665
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,640
Let’s float our lovey-dovey tiny Krathong.

666
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,880
So where are we floating our Krathong, guys?

667
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,080
Anywhere works.

668
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:26,960
It makes no difference anyway.

669
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,520
You aren’t romantic at all.

670
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,680
Let’s just go to that same place we went last time.

671
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,480
Let’s go.

672
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,120
Gotcha.

673
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,760
Peem.

674
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:36,760
Stop.

675
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,160
Come back here.

676
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,800
Going to the same place again?

677
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,400
That means you two have been here before, right?

678
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,880
Q, interrogate them.

679
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,440
Right.

680
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,600
You guys had some secret romantic moments here before, didn’t you?

681
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,400
Answer me.

682
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,760
Say, yes.

683
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,200
If that’s true,

684
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,040
say, yes.

685
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,360
One more time.

686
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,160
Yes.

687
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,840
Clear enough.

688
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,680
You guys came here in secret.

689
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,560
That’s why.

690
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,640
Where are Chain and the others?

691
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,280
I don’t know.

692
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:07,880
But don’t worry.

693
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,480
They’ll be here.

694
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,240
Let’s float our Krathong.

695
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:09,800
Hurry up.

696
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,840
Walk, you both.

697
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,840
Since you’ve been here before, you lead the way.

698
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,360
Q, wait for me.

699
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,480
Watch your step, you might slip.

700
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,080
My heart has melted on the ground.

701
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,560
Toey, where did you get that Krathong?

702
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,560
I didn’t see any shops selling it.

703
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,920
Your bro asked you, so answer him already.

704
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,040
You don’t have a mouth or what?

705
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,560
Stop standing there, blushing.

706
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,720
Don’t tell him off.

707
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,000
Did you make it yourself?

708
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,200
It looks handmade.

709
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,920
Yes.

710
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,640
Q and I made it.

711
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,120
Q climbed the tree to get the coconut.

712
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,760
Oh, he did?

713
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,960
He looked so cool climbing up.

714
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,680
So, my friend is a monkey?

715
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,440
Someone who’s single might be unlucky here.

716
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,040
Which means I’m lucky since I’ve already got a boyfriend.

717
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,880
I guess I’m unlucky, then.

718
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,800
What? Babe?

719
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,640
Nothing.

720
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,680
Don’t forget to make a wish first.

721
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,240
Someone told me you must make a wish before floating it.

722
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,680
And you believe him?

723
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,080
Absolutely.

724
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,040
Because I love him, I believe him.

725
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,680
Just float it already.

726
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,960
Move.

727
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,560
Just throw it so it will float in the air.

728
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,640
Move already.

729
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,560
Let’s make a wish first.

730
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,040
Let’s float it.

731
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,000
You secretly looked at me again.

732
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,600
My boyfriend is handsome.

733
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,440
Why can’t I look at him?

734
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,480
You’re getting more tough these days.

735
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,400
I love you.

736
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,800
You’re saying you love me when we’re floating Krathong?

737
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,640
Why?

738
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,360
Or do you want me to kiss you?

739
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,760
We’re in the temple.

740
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,480
We’re in the temple.

741
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,120
It’s good you stopped.

742
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,680
You’re still standing here?

743
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,240
Stil?

744
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,000
You’re still not moving?

745
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,440
Why on earth are you standing here?

746
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:42,800
Move.

747
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,040
Move.

748
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:43,640
Move.

749
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,320
Babe, let’s float our Krathong.

750
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:52,680
Hopefully, our love lasts longer than the river.

751
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,240
You’d better go to the beach then.

752
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,400
Out of the sea, I guess.

753
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,520
Please get rid of all the bad stuff.

754
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,120
Eh?

755
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,280
Saying that means you’re single now, Fang.

756
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,320
Let me get out of Fang’s life.

757
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,440
What’s with you guys?

758
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,120
Oh. My wish came true really fast.

759
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,600
What do you mean?

760
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,440
I’m here, babe.

761
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,840
I’m still a good thing in your life, right?

762
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:11,880
Let’s float it.

763
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,080
Alright. Let’s do it.

764
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,720
Bye-bye.

765
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,280
It looks like our Krathong collapsed or something, babe.

766
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,760
To send away bad things.

767
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,240
Go already.

768
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:23,720
Bye.

769
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,080
I don’t know why it’s still here, though.

770
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,360
I’m talking about Krathong.

771
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,360
Hey.

772
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,400
You’ve finished floating yours, so move already.

773
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,400
Babe, our Krathong sank.

774
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,520
Hey.

775
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,680
Let me ask you something.

776
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,600
Is that Krathong or a coconut shell?

777
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,240
Krathong.

778
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,440
It looks like a coconut shell.

779
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,560
What did you wish for?

780
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,680
My wish is to float a Krathong with you every year.

781
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,440
Every year.

782
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,160
Well, then, your wish has been fulfilled already.

783
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,080
You keep smiling.

784
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,920
Maybe you won’t get to float it.

785
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,240
Oh? As I said.

786
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,160
Toey!

787
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,560
I haven’t made my wish yet.

788
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,040
Q, climb the tree again later.

789
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,400
Come on.

790
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,840
You guys didn’t wait for me.

791
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,760
Oho.

792
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,080
Are you five sharing one Krathong?

793
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,880
It depends on our faith.

794
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,400
Oho. He’s talking about faith.

795
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,760
Those already taken won’t understand this kind of fun.

796
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,280
Feel free to have fun then.

797
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,120
You’re touching each other as if pouring water after making merit.

798
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,720
You’re sleeping already?

799
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,400
Still alive.

800
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,600
What did you wish for?

801
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,600
I wished for penguins in Thailand.

802
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,160
Huh?

803
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,200
I love that wish.

804
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:11,920
How smart you are.

805
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,440
You like that?

806
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,040
I do.

807
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,160
I like penguins.

808
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,480
I freaking like them.

809
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,040
I super love them.

810
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,440
Let’s float it already.

811
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,640
Go ahead.

812
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,520
Go ahead.

813
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,120
Chain.

814
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,760
When you heard him say he loves penguins,

815
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,200
you should have jumped in the water with your Krathong.

816
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,520
Should I do that now?

817
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,840
Let’s go.

818
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,800
Let’s check out the fair.

819
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,160
Tan, I don’t want to carry it anymore.
Give it to me.

820
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,080
Babe, let’s go.

821
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,560
Thank you.

822
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,600
Guin, I hope you find your mom

823
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,440
or some other good bird to take care of you.

824
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,520
Don’t get hurt again.

825
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,840
I can’t always help you, okay?

826
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,720
I’m going to let Guin go now.

827
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,800
Do you have anything to say?

828
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:14,840
Love you.

829
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,200
Same here.

830
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,520
I mean, I love Guin.

831
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,480
Go already.

832
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,720
Fly, Guin.

833
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,400
He’s used to being in the cage, so he doesn’t want to leave.

834
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,840
Good luck.

835
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
Bye-bye.

836
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,080
Good luck.  Guin.

837
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,800
I’ll take care of him here.

838
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,280
Q, why are you trying to eat mine?

839
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,840
What?

840
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,320
What are you doing?

841
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:19,880
Help me.

842
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,160
What?

843
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,600
What’s wrong?

844
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,880
I just want to eat some. Can’t I, huh?

845
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,960
I bought it for you.
Nope.

846
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,080
If you want to eat, buy a new one for yourself.

847
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,120
Don’t eat mine.

848
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,280
Don’t eat it, Q.

849
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,160
I will.

850
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,600
Don’t fight.

851
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,320
Guys.

852
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,400
Shit.

853
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,320
Let’s light them.

854
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,200
Come on, Mick.

855
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,200
I hope that, from now on, our lives will be full of fun.

856
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,080
Let’s go all out.

857
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,760
Exams are finally over!

858
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,880
Let's plan a trip!

859
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,600
We're almost done with our fourth year.

860
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,720
I don’t know how many more chances we’ll get to travel together like this.

861
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,160
Let me give you a kiss on the cheek.

862
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,600
Phum.

863
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,520
Phum, stop.

864
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,120
Stop.

865
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,240
Thank you so much, Peem,

866
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,080
for letting me be important to you.

867
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,840
I’m happy to have you all as my friends.

868
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,400
I’m freaking happy.

869
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,480
Love you guys.
